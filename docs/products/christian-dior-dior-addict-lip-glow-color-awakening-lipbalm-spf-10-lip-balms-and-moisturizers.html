            <li>A pleasant shopping.</li>
            <li>The casing is beautifully designed,  locks in nicely.</li>
            <li>so amazing results on me (or anyone) doesn&#x27;t guarantee great results on another.</li>
            <li>I have been using Murad pomegranate lip treatment for a while, and it is good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a vanilla and mint scent, with a wonderful smooth and moisturizing feel.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is good as I have an olive skin color.</li>

            <li>Pros: smells like peppermint, moisturizing, good packaging.</li>
            <li>It comes in a sleek, charming and luxe packaging.</li>
            <li>It also smells and tastes good as well.  </li>
            <li>good things</li>
            <li>Dior is always good</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t always have to wear lipstick, but all my lipsticks look great on top of this.  </li>

            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>good quality ,love it always.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that this lip balm is meant to respond to the the color chemistry of your own lips</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;ve been raving about it for some months now, I got some friends to try it on and let me tell you this lip balm has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li>I really liked this lip balm, except the price.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice product.</li>
            <li>It feels great on... very moisturizing... and leaves my lips in good condition (doesn&#x27;t cause chapping or dryness).  </li>
            <li>Nice item overall - great color, great feel.</li>
            <li>@SamanthaRone who I send this item is happy and say thanks for it on Twitter !</li>
            <li>Goes on very smooth and lasts for quite a while.</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews talk about the first application, which is great</li>
            <li>Love the fact too that there is a SPF factor.</li>
            <li>I love the stuff and its my go to lip wear.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to stick with this one from now on until I find something else better :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricy, but I like carrying around a more sophisticated lip balm/lip stick in my bag.</li>
            <li>love the texture and color.</li>
            <li>Definitely my favorite lip balms.</li>
            <li>people tell me your lips look sexy when i put it on my lip.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff - it&#x27;s like my lip crack.</li>
            <li>I love this better than lip conditioning product that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I am going to order one now just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.  </li>
            <li>Love how emollient it is and the color lasts.</li>
            <li>In my case, I love it so let me count</li>
            <li>marvelous lip balm that I will definitely repurchase and recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d do better with a lip gloss from the drug store.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love the tone it turned on me.</li>
            <li>Love it&lt;br /&gt;Arrived two days faster</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why is listing for more.  </li>
            <li>and I do love it.  </li>
            <li>It makes just a bit of shine and seems to blend with my coloring to make it just a bit better, but not \\&quot;made up\\&quot; appearing.  </li>
            <li>I Will buy again on Amazon :)</li>
            <li>It brings out your natural lip shade and its just beautiful.</li>
            <li>The lip balm is pretty good</li>
            <li>It looks clear but comes out a not too attractive color on me.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product if you don&#x27;t like colored lip sticks or want natural look.  </li>
            <li>Also love the light shine</li>
            <li>Love the smooth feel and the hint of mint flavor.</li>
            <li>Love the silky, smooth, light feel.</li>
            <li>My lips turned out a nice bright pink, but I made my friend try it on and her color was more of a rosy mauve.</li>
            <li>The formula is nice, and it looks pretty on.</li>
            <li>SO sheer but holds amazing lite color.perfect for when you don&#x27;t want to wear a heavy lipstick.great for all year but especially in warm seasons when you want to look natural.love love love!</li>
            <li>Love the product but until Christian Dior stops testing on animals I won&#x27;t be buying it again - too many good cruelty free options that are aligned with my values.</li>
            <li>and I love this product during my first application, but as the day goes on and I apply more after eating or drinking the color changes.</li>
            <li>Glides on easily and feels smooth on my lips.</li>
            <li>The pink isn&#x27;t overwhelming and the taste and smell are great.</li>
            <li>It is not cheap but it is a great treat for yourself!!  </li>
            <li>The color result on my lips is fantastic and works so well with my skintone.  </li>
            <li>Perfect everyday lipstick.</li>
            <li>Confirmed this with Dior customer service.</li>
            <li>Feels smooth like a balm, but sticks like lipstick.</li>
            <li>It glides on smooth without leaving a waxy or sticky feel.</li>
            <li>If u r a light skinned  </li>
            <li>Just turns a nice pink and feels so good on my lips.  </li>
            <li>I have never been confident on the right color of lipstick.  </li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t as vibrant as I would have liked</li>
            <li>I am in love with this Dior Lip Glow!&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes my lips and adds a pretty pop of color.</li>
            <li>word of caution though, be sure to try it on first in the store before you purchase it.</li>
            <li>Its worth a try!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true and very useful.</li>
            <li>Makes my lips feel great and doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li>As for application, I never swipe it more than once as it does turn my lips looking unnaturally bright pink.</li>
            <li>that is so good,i love it, you need to worth it.yes,it is useful.</li>
            <li>Christian Dior Addict Lip Glow Color Awakening is by far the best lip gloss I have ever used.</li>
            <li>On a positive note, I love the way it smells and how it isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li>Gives you a classy sexy look!</li>
            <li>and I was right!</li>
            <li>Every woman should have this amazing lipstick.you look incredibly natural when you wear this.it</li>
            <li>Nice and natural.</li>
            <li>Has a cool, freshing, slightly sweet candy smells.</li>
            <li>It does add a hint of color that is determined by your own coloring (like the Tangee Lipstick of old).  </li>
            <li>Haha works for all skin tones like magic.</li>
            <li>It just enhances your own natural lip.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve put it on my friends with other haircolors and skintones and it looks great on them.</li>
            <li>If you use it all the time like I do, you will go through it rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m one of the lucky ones that it works well with</li>
            <li>Anyway it felt really good and looked a light pink.  </li>
            <li>Get ready for load of compliments on your lips!!</li>
            <li>After using it for a week, I realized that by the end of the day of applying and reapplying, the gloss becomes bright pink.</li>
            <li>but it does make an unusually bright pink color sometimes</li>
            <li>I rarely use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It might be worth to buy another tinted balm that doesn&#x27;t come with a $34 sticker price.</li>
            <li>It gives you your own individual color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cross between a nice lip balm and lipstick.</li>
            <li>it is a tad pricey but its worth it.</li>
            <li>Love how soft this makes my lips.</li>
            <li>It would be perfect for work or a daytime or casual date :)  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I love the smell, feel and natural tint of color.</li>
            <li>Went and bought my own the very next day.</li>
            <li>It smells , tastes and feels lovely as well as brightens up my natural lip color.</li>
            <li>I love this product and thought it was cruelty free but found out it isn&#x27;t after I ordered it - I believe there was no animal testing of Christian Dior products</li>
            <li>but nice and &amp;#34;finished.&amp;#34;  I did have to apply it once my lips felt dry</li>
            <li>Besides the fact that it&#x27;s light and hydrating, it reacts with your lips to bring out your natural lip color.</li>
            <li>Pretty, but not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be.</li>
            <li>not only makes your lip healthy and not peel</li>
            <li>It instantly looks like your wearing a beautiful shade of pink lipstick.  </li>
            <li>If you are re-buying use Amazon, but first timers should try it out in-store first.</li>
            <li>It is even pretty in the case.  </li>
            <li>Many lip products are actually drying.  </li>
            <li>I love this product by Christian Dior.</li>
            <li>you see my lips, only better.</li>
            <li>It looks different on everyone and really does enhance your natural lip color adding a colorful glow without being too overwhelming!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great when you&#x27;re traveling and your space is limited: protective during sports/outdoor activities, and can dress up with you later.</li>
            <li>Other than these, it&#x27;s simply an amazing</li>
            <li>One positive note is that it isn&#x27;t too sticky or waxy.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s a warm day out you have to be careful because I find that it melts in your bag if your in the sun or a hot car more than other lipsticks and lip balms</li>
            <li>The name alone pretty much gives everything away.</li>
            <li>Color is super natural.</li>
            <li>very light pink undertone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen results from bright, neon pink to deep fucshia.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about it...</li>
            <li>However, the price is $35 in stores as well so this isn&#x27;t really a &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34; or discount....plus, you can try it out at the store before you buy.</li>
            <li>It has SPF, color, and is basically the whole package!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t change the color of your lips all that much.  </li>
            <li>The price is to much tho.</li>
            <li>I am blonde with a skin undertone toward blue, not yellow, and the color is great for me.  </li>
            <li>My lips feel very hydrated when I use Addict Lip.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Brings about the right colour if you want to go au natural.</li>
            <li>I have bought a lot of cosmetics in my lifetime and this one fits up there with other items I have found to be worthwhile.</li>
            <li>Given the price, I will only use it for special occasions.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I can easily apply with out a mirror and know I am getting color and shine without worrying about getting pink everywhere.</li>
            <li>I love the slight tint I get when I put it on my lips.  </li>
            <li>but I like really vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>I am getting older, and my face needs a bit of help.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend it to anyone, be they a make up pro or a newbie like me.</li>
            <li>My lips look hot pink by the end of the day, and I&#x27;m pretty sure this is due to the reapplication process and the color layering.</li>
            <li>so I can look a little more polished than normal.</li>
            <li>Although I use a liner too, I really can&#x27;t tell the natural color of my lips from this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for a daytime look or any casual makeup day.  </li>
            <li>The Color Reviver technology is super cool and how it changes according to your lip&#x27;s chemistry, but not sure if layering works with this product.</li>
            <li>I advised them that if they had to much confidence in American consumers willingness to trust products from that region as genuine and non-counterfeit, they should clearly state that they are in Taiwan instead of calling themselves SK Global.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear in the tube and for me it turns out a nice deep, natural pink.</li>
            <li>just like the name imply very addictive...makes you look young and never inappropriate looking when used by mature woman...</li>
            <li>, so far so good.okay!</li>
            <li>Its so silky, refreshing feeling and gives my lips a tiny tingle bringing out the natural pink in my lips.</li>
            <li>Glides on smoothly, has a slight sheen, and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>to keep the same color effect, but that&#x27;s better than the average lip gloss.  </li>
            <li>And with just one swipe (and not more), my lips are hydrated and tinted with a natural looking MLBB (my lips but better) stain.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It enhances the lip color giving it a natural heathy look with a hint of color.</li>
            <li>Brings out your natural lip color.</li>
            <li>It is a hydrating conditioning lip balm that adds a natural color.</li>
            <li>it also makes your lip soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Makes your lips feel so soft and look so natural.  </li>
            <li>It gives my lips a pinker hue that looks natural.  </li>
            <li>I am in my 60&#x27;s when natural lip color fades a lot.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizing and brings out natural lip color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going through a trial where I completely wipe my lips before I reapply...</li>
            <li>This product smells and feels AMAZING, but on this pale redhead, it turns a cartoonish shade of pink every time.</li>
            <li>Okay first of all this was an expensive lip gloss.</li>
            <li>I really like it also because it moisturizes my lips for a long time.</li>
            <li>I love this product but it is so hard to find in a local store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a pretty shiny, barely tinted pink shade.</li>
            <li>This is very nice; however, very expensive for the size.</li>
            <li>Not only does this offer long-lasting, soothing moisture, it gives a bit of very natural looking color.  </li>
            <li>Darkens my natural lip color just enough.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about $25.00 and the tube is rather large and bulky compared to other lip products I carry around.</li>
            <li>and i both bought this, and although its in the same color, it actually does personalize our lips and brings out natural color</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it took so long to get here and came from Korea</li>
            <li>What color there is doesn&#x27;t last long and isn&#x27;t all that lush or glossy looking.  </li>
            <li>I have used this daily for several months and it is clear it will last a long time.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> She is happy...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> great buy...</li>
            <li> great product</li>
            <li> am so happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> and it all looked great together, not too &amp;#34;try-hard&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great lipstick.  </li>
            <li> The shipper was great and the product arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> This looks great on me and my lighter skinned girlfriend.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> This lip balm is great.</li>
            <li> great my mum likes it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!</li>
            <li> so I though ok perfect, I will get this.  </li>
            <li> A pleasant shopping.</li>
            <li> The casing is beautifully designed,  locks in nicely.</li>
            <li> so amazing results on me (or anyone) doesn&#x27;t guarantee great results on another.</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad pomegranate lip treatment for a while, and it is good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a vanilla and mint scent, with a wonderful smooth and moisturizing feel.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is good as I have an olive skin color.</li>
            <li> feels great and leaves a nice color.</li>
            <li> The color looks good.  </li>
            <li> Pros: smells like peppermint, moisturizing, good packaging.</li>
            <li> It comes in a sleek, charming and luxe packaging.</li>
            <li> It also smells and tastes good as well.  </li>
            <li> good things</li>
            <li> Dior is always good</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t always have to wear lipstick, but all my lipsticks look great on top of this.  </li>
            <li> Great lipstick, awesome natural colour.</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm!</li>
            <li> I love the texture and smell of this balm!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite go to lip product!</li>
            <li> This is my first Dior product and im very happy with this lip balm.  </li>
            <li> Love lip glow!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> , I love the color it gives my lips!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> It stays on well, and does not clump up like most lipsticks on me!</li>
            <li> but I must say, I love it!  </li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> good quality ,love it always.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that this lip balm is meant to respond to the the color chemistry of your own lips</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;ve been raving about it for some months now, I got some friends to try it on and let me tell you this lip balm has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li> I really liked this lip balm, except the price.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product.</li>
            <li> It feels great on... very moisturizing... and leaves my lips in good condition (doesn&#x27;t cause chapping or dryness).  </li>
            <li> Nice item overall - great color, great feel.</li>
            <li> @SamanthaRone who I send this item is happy and say thanks for it on Twitter !</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth and lasts for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews talk about the first application, which is great</li>
            <li> Love the fact too that there is a SPF factor.</li>
            <li> I love the stuff and its my go to lip wear.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to stick with this one from now on until I find something else better :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricy, but I like carrying around a more sophisticated lip balm/lip stick in my bag.</li>
            <li> love the texture and color.</li>
            <li> Definitely my favorite lip balms.</li>
            <li> people tell me your lips look sexy when i put it on my lip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - it&#x27;s like my lip crack.</li>
            <li> I love this better than lip conditioning product that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I am going to order one now just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.  </li>
            <li> Love how emollient it is and the color lasts.</li>
            <li> In my case, I love it so let me count</li>
            <li> marvelous lip balm that I will definitely repurchase and recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d do better with a lip gloss from the drug store.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love the tone it turned on me.</li>
            <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;Arrived two days faster</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why is listing for more.  </li>
            <li> and I do love it.  </li>
            <li> It makes just a bit of shine and seems to blend with my coloring to make it just a bit better, but not \\&quot;made up\\&quot; appearing.  </li>
            <li> I Will buy again on Amazon :)</li>
            <li> It brings out your natural lip shade and its just beautiful.</li>
            <li> The lip balm is pretty good</li>
            <li> It looks clear but comes out a not too attractive color on me.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product if you don&#x27;t like colored lip sticks or want natural look.  </li>
            <li> Also love the light shine</li>
            <li> Love the smooth feel and the hint of mint flavor.</li>
            <li> Love the silky, smooth, light feel.</li>
            <li> My lips turned out a nice bright pink, but I made my friend try it on and her color was more of a rosy mauve.</li>
            <li> The formula is nice, and it looks pretty on.</li>
            <li> SO sheer but holds amazing lite color.perfect for when you don&#x27;t want to wear a heavy lipstick.great for all year but especially in warm seasons when you want to look natural.love love love!</li>
            <li> Love the product but until Christian Dior stops testing on animals I won&#x27;t be buying it again - too many good cruelty free options that are aligned with my values.</li>
            <li> and I love this product during my first application, but as the day goes on and I apply more after eating or drinking the color changes.</li>
            <li> Glides on easily and feels smooth on my lips.</li>
            <li> The pink isn&#x27;t overwhelming and the taste and smell are great.</li>
            <li> It is not cheap but it is a great treat for yourself!!  </li>
            <li> The color result on my lips is fantastic and works so well with my skintone.  </li>
            <li> Perfect everyday lipstick.</li>
            <li> Confirmed this with Dior customer service.</li>
            <li> Feels smooth like a balm, but sticks like lipstick.</li>
            <li> It glides on smooth without leaving a waxy or sticky feel.</li>
            <li> If u r a light skinned  </li>
            <li> Just turns a nice pink and feels so good on my lips.  </li>
            <li> I have never been confident on the right color of lipstick.  </li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t as vibrant as I would have liked</li>
            <li> I am in love with this Dior Lip Glow!&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes my lips and adds a pretty pop of color.</li>
            <li> word of caution though, be sure to try it on first in the store before you purchase it.</li>
            <li> Its worth a try!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true and very useful.</li>
            <li> Makes my lips feel great and doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> As for application, I never swipe it more than once as it does turn my lips looking unnaturally bright pink.</li>
            <li> that is so good,i love it, you need to worth it.yes,it is useful.</li>
            <li> Christian Dior Addict Lip Glow Color Awakening is by far the best lip gloss I have ever used.</li>
            <li> On a positive note, I love the way it smells and how it isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li> Gives you a classy sexy look!</li>
            <li> and I was right!</li>
            <li> Every woman should have this amazing lipstick.you look incredibly natural when you wear this.it</li>
            <li> Nice and natural.</li>
            <li> Has a cool, freshing, slightly sweet candy smells.</li>
            <li> It does add a hint of color that is determined by your own coloring (like the Tangee Lipstick of old).  </li>
            <li> Haha works for all skin tones like magic.</li>
            <li> It just enhances your own natural lip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put it on my friends with other haircolors and skintones and it looks great on them.</li>
            <li> If you use it all the time like I do, you will go through it rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m one of the lucky ones that it works well with</li>
            <li> Anyway it felt really good and looked a light pink.  </li>
            <li> Get ready for load of compliments on your lips!!</li>
            <li> After using it for a week, I realized that by the end of the day of applying and reapplying, the gloss becomes bright pink.</li>
            <li> but it does make an unusually bright pink color sometimes</li>
            <li> I rarely use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It might be worth to buy another tinted balm that doesn&#x27;t come with a $34 sticker price.</li>
            <li> It gives you your own individual color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cross between a nice lip balm and lipstick.</li>
            <li> it is a tad pricey but its worth it.</li>
            <li> Love how soft this makes my lips.</li>
            <li> It would be perfect for work or a daytime or casual date :)  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love the smell, feel and natural tint of color.</li>
            <li> Went and bought my own the very next day.</li>
            <li> It smells , tastes and feels lovely as well as brightens up my natural lip color.</li>
            <li> I love this product and thought it was cruelty free but found out it isn&#x27;t after I ordered it - I believe there was no animal testing of Christian Dior products</li>
            <li> but nice and &amp;#34;finished.&amp;#34;  I did have to apply it once my lips felt dry</li>
            <li> Besides the fact that it&#x27;s light and hydrating, it reacts with your lips to bring out your natural lip color.</li>
            <li> Pretty, but not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be.</li>
            <li> not only makes your lip healthy and not peel</li>
            <li> It instantly looks like your wearing a beautiful shade of pink lipstick.  </li>
            <li> If you are re-buying use Amazon, but first timers should try it out in-store first.</li>
            <li> It is even pretty in the case.  </li>
            <li> Many lip products are actually drying.  </li>
            <li> I love this product by Christian Dior.</li>
            <li> you see my lips, only better.</li>
            <li> It looks different on everyone and really does enhance your natural lip color adding a colorful glow without being too overwhelming!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great when you&#x27;re traveling and your space is limited: protective during sports/outdoor activities, and can dress up with you later.</li>
            <li> Other than these, it&#x27;s simply an amazing</li>
            <li> One positive note is that it isn&#x27;t too sticky or waxy.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s a warm day out you have to be careful because I find that it melts in your bag if your in the sun or a hot car more than other lipsticks and lip balms</li>
            <li> The name alone pretty much gives everything away.</li>
            <li> Color is super natural.</li>
            <li> very light pink undertone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen results from bright, neon pink to deep fucshia.</li>
            <li> I would really recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about it...</li>
            <li> However, the price is $35 in stores as well so this isn&#x27;t really a &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34; or discount....plus, you can try it out at the store before you buy.</li>
            <li> It has SPF, color, and is basically the whole package!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t change the color of your lips all that much.  </li>
            <li> The price is to much tho.</li>
            <li> I am blonde with a skin undertone toward blue, not yellow, and the color is great for me.  </li>
            <li> My lips feel very hydrated when I use Addict Lip.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Brings about the right colour if you want to go au natural.</li>
            <li> I have bought a lot of cosmetics in my lifetime and this one fits up there with other items I have found to be worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Given the price, I will only use it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I can easily apply with out a mirror and know I am getting color and shine without worrying about getting pink everywhere.</li>
            <li> I love the slight tint I get when I put it on my lips.  </li>
            <li> but I like really vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> I am getting older, and my face needs a bit of help.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend it to anyone, be they a make up pro or a newbie like me.</li>
            <li> My lips look hot pink by the end of the day, and I&#x27;m pretty sure this is due to the reapplication process and the color layering.</li>
            <li> so I can look a little more polished than normal.</li>
            <li> Although I use a liner too, I really can&#x27;t tell the natural color of my lips from this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for a daytime look or any casual makeup day.  </li>
            <li> The Color Reviver technology is super cool and how it changes according to your lip&#x27;s chemistry, but not sure if layering works with this product.</li>
            <li> I advised them that if they had to much confidence in American consumers willingness to trust products from that region as genuine and non-counterfeit, they should clearly state that they are in Taiwan instead of calling themselves SK Global.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear in the tube and for me it turns out a nice deep, natural pink.</li>
            <li> just like the name imply very addictive...makes you look young and never inappropriate looking when used by mature woman...</li>
            <li> , so far so good.okay!</li>
            <li> Its so silky, refreshing feeling and gives my lips a tiny tingle bringing out the natural pink in my lips.</li>
            <li> Glides on smoothly, has a slight sheen, and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> to keep the same color effect, but that&#x27;s better than the average lip gloss.  </li>
            <li> And with just one swipe (and not more), my lips are hydrated and tinted with a natural looking MLBB (my lips but better) stain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It enhances the lip color giving it a natural heathy look with a hint of color.</li>
            <li> Brings out your natural lip color.</li>
            <li> It is a hydrating conditioning lip balm that adds a natural color.</li>
            <li> it also makes your lip soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Makes your lips feel so soft and look so natural.  </li>
            <li> It gives my lips a pinker hue that looks natural.  </li>
            <li> I am in my 60&#x27;s when natural lip color fades a lot.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizing and brings out natural lip color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going through a trial where I completely wipe my lips before I reapply...</li>
            <li> This product smells and feels AMAZING, but on this pale redhead, it turns a cartoonish shade of pink every time.</li>
            <li> Okay first of all this was an expensive lip gloss.</li>
            <li> I really like it also because it moisturizes my lips for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this product but it is so hard to find in a local store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a pretty shiny, barely tinted pink shade.</li>
            <li> This is very nice; however, very expensive for the size.</li>
            <li> Not only does this offer long-lasting, soothing moisture, it gives a bit of very natural looking color.  </li>
            <li> Darkens my natural lip color just enough.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about $25.00 and the tube is rather large and bulky compared to other lip products I carry around.</li>
            <li> and i both bought this, and although its in the same color, it actually does personalize our lips and brings out natural color</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it took so long to get here and came from Korea</li>
            <li> What color there is doesn&#x27;t last long and isn&#x27;t all that lush or glossy looking.  </li>
            <li> I have used this daily for several months and it is clear it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> aptly named &amp;#34;addict&amp;#34; because I am totally &amp;#34;addicted&amp;#34; to it; just wish it lasted longer since it is so expensive!</li>
            <li> Conditions well, just the right amount of subtle color.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t used a lipstick or a lip gloss for a long time since I became allergic to red color dye in lip sticks or lip glosses.  </li>
            <li> but it is quite sticky, and doesn&#x27;t last on your lips as long.  </li>
            <li> I have dry lips and it restores my lips to being as they were when I was younger!  </li>
            <li> It makes my lips feel so soft and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It stays on quite long.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time...</li>
            <li> It does turn a different shade of pink for each person.</li>
            <li> The package came wrapped in silver gift wrap, but it was not completely sealed.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it!</li>
            <li> Also it lasts for a while not like those lip glosses that dry your lips out in a minute.  </li>
            <li> I started using this product a year ago &amp; have to say now I use it every single day.</li>
            <li> It is not a high gloss lip balm, however, so if that is what you are looking for this will not be for you.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but worth every penny if you suffer from dry lips year around.</li>
            <li> I only give it a 4 because it&#x27;s a little pricey for lip balm.</li>
            <li> I never have to wear lipstick over it, but do so anyway from time to time to give it a little something extra.</li>
            <li> Well worth it even though it is expensive.</li>
            <li> ; turn out fluorescent pink on my lips but not so this time.</li>
            <li> Suddenly I look less dead.</li>
            <li> If you have a trace of another lipstick on, I find that this product enhances and refreshes other lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Figured I would like this product based on previous reviews</li>
            <li> I supposed I could use it less often?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically wear lipstick color, this gives a slight enhancement that is flattering.</li>
            <li> There is a little colour to your lips.</li>
            <li> My lips stayed the same unfortunate shade of baby pink that comes in the tube.  </li>
            <li> This product does go on a little stiff.</li>
            <li> The shade is too pink for my complexion and it feels a little too thick, but it does keep my lips moist for at least a couple hours.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle scent with slight notes of vanilla and mint.</li>
            <li> I have in the past had so-called &amp;#34;smart colors&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The box package looked fake, and when I complained to the company that I wanted a refund, they tried to get indignant and question my mistrust of Chinese products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-sticky, moisturizing and it literally &#x27;revives&#x27; dull looking lips by giving it a dose of color.</li>
            <li> but my boyfriend often complained that it was too sticky.</li>
            <li> Its waxy, so it&#x27;s thick, and coats your lips without clumps.</li>
            <li> Taste like a candy mint, but not cool or cold to the lips.</li>
            <li> I wore it yesterday to brunch with some thin eyeliner and mascara</li>
            <li> They are blatantly hiding the fact that they don&#x27;t even operate out of the US.</li>
            <li> Too expensive</li>
            <li> Very expensive product of very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as bad as losing my cell phone</li>
            <li> Too bad!</li>
            <li> Considering what I paid for this, I&#x27;m very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Thank! A+ ten points!</li>
            <li> Figured I would like this product based on previous reviews and I was right! Color is super natural. Goes on very smooth and lasts for quite a while. Love the fact too that there is a SPF factor. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This reminds me of a product that I tried in my teens.  It looks clear but comes out a not too attractive color on me.  I rarely use it.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS LIPSTICK!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is shiny without being sticky. The pink isn&#x27;t overwhelming and the taste and smell are great. I love the stuff and its my go to lip wear. I can easily apply with out a mirror and know I am getting color and shine without worrying about getting pink everywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lip balm user.  i haven&#x27;t used a lipstick or a lip gloss for a long time since I became allergic to red color dye in lip sticks or lip glosses.  This is a great product if you don&#x27;t like colored lip sticks or want natural look.  I love the slight tint I get when I put it on my lips.  Also it lasts for a while not like those lip glosses that dry your lips out in a minute.  It is not cheap but it is a great treat for yourself!!  I have been using Murad pomegranate lip treatment for a while, and it is good but it is quite sticky, and doesn&#x27;t last on your lips as long.  I think I&#x27;m going to stick with this one from now on until I find something else better :)</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm! Besides the fact that it&#x27;s light and hydrating, it reacts with your lips to bring out your natural lip color. My lips turned out a nice bright pink, but I made my friend try it on and her color was more of a rosy mauve. I only give it a 4 because it&#x27;s a little pricey for lip balm.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it took so long to get here and came from Korea but I like the color.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  The color result on my lips is fantastic and works so well with my skintone.  My niece tried it on her lips and the color was totally different.  It is a great moisturizer and the color \\&quot;tints\\&quot; the lips too!</li>
            <li> I love the texture and smell of this balm! It&#x27;s a vanilla and mint scent, with a wonderful smooth and moisturizing feel.&lt;br /&gt;Although, the reason I bought this was because of it&#x27;s supposed ability to &#x27;change&#x27; colors based on your individual body chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;I like the color, but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s really different than what it is in the tube. It&#x27;s just a pretty shiny, barely tinted pink shade. Pretty, but not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be. My sister and Mom tried it too, and it looks the same on me as it does on them.&lt;br /&gt;It might be worth to buy another tinted balm that doesn&#x27;t come with a $34 sticker price.</li>
            <li> This product is great for that hint of color. It gives you your own individual color. Get ready for load of compliments on your lips!!</li>
            <li> This product smells and feels AMAZING, but on this pale redhead, it turns a cartoonish shade of pink every time. I&#x27;ve put it on my friends with other haircolors and skintones and it looks great on them. Too bad!</li>
            <li> Although expensive, I really love this lip glow. It enhances the lip color giving it a natural heathy look with a hint of color. Beautiful.</li>
            <li> Brings out your natural lip color. Great produt</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It is a hydrating conditioning lip balm that adds a natural color. It stays on quite long. It&#x27;s clear in the tube and for me it turns out a nice deep, natural pink. If you have a trace of another lipstick on, I find that this product enhances and refreshes other lipsticks. It&#x27;s smells delicious like vanilla. This reminds me of a product in the 1970&#x27;s by Coty. One drawback in the price. It&#x27;s about $25.00 and the tube is rather large and bulky compared to other lip products I carry around. If you use it all the time like I do, you will go through it rather quickly. If it&#x27;s a warm day out you have to be careful because I find that it melts in your bag if your in the sun or a hot car more than other lipsticks and lip balms would. It&#x27;s \\&quot;melty\\&quot;.  Alot of peple compare this to tangee lipstick, but I cannot wear that because it turns my mouth a unflattering orange shade and I cannot stand the smell.  When I run out of Lip Glow I will be buying another. I would really recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I like the way this product feels on my lips. It&#x27;s a cross between a nice lip balm and lipstick. It didn&#x27;t chap my lips and the \\&quot;mood\\&quot; color is good as I have an olive skin color. I like how the container is designed because it stops me from ruining my lipstick. It&#x27;s a bit pricy, but I like carrying around a more sophisticated lip balm/lip stick in my bag.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about it... but my wife says it&#x27;s great. She is happy...so therefore, five stars! I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> I am in love with this Dior Lip Glow!&lt;br /&gt;It moisturizes my lips and adds a pretty pop of color.</li>
            <li> The shade is too pink for my complexion and it feels a little too thick, but it does keep my lips moist for at least a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this lipstick looks on!  It looks different on everyone and really does enhance your natural lip color adding a colorful glow without being too overwhelming!  Perfect everyday lipstick.</li>
            <li> aptly named &amp;#34;addict&amp;#34; because I am totally &amp;#34;addicted&amp;#34; to it; just wish it lasted longer since it is so expensive! I supposed I could use it less often?</li>
            <li> just like the name imply very addictive...makes you look young and never inappropriate looking when used by mature woman...not only makes your lip healthy and not peel it also makes your lip soft to the touch. great buy...great product it is a tad pricey but its worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true and very useful. A pleasant shopping.</li>
            <li> Love how soft this makes my lips. Also love the light shine this gives my lips not goopy shiny.. I have glow nail polish as well and they look great together!  Nice and natural.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite go to lip product! love the texture and color. perfect for any occasion.</li>
            <li> Makes your lips feel so soft and look so natural.  It instantly looks like your wearing a beautiful shade of pink lipstick.  The color is different on everyone.</li>
            <li> This is my first Dior product and im very happy with this lip balm.  The casing is beautifully designed,  locks in nicely. Has a cool, freshing, slightly sweet candy smells. Taste like a candy mint, but not cool or cold to the lips. Glides on smoothly, has a slight sheen, and not greasy.  Definitely my favorite lip balms. Will be ordering others</li>
            <li> Nice item overall - great color, great feel. However, it does NOT contain SPF as indicated in the description. Confirmed this with Dior customer service.</li>
            <li> Love lip glow! However, the price is $35 in stores as well so this isn&#x27;t really a &amp;#34;deal&amp;#34; or discount....plus, you can try it out at the store before you buy. Macys, bloomys, Lord and Taylor etc. If you are re-buying use Amazon, but first timers should try it out in-store first.</li>
            <li> Give me a break!! As if anyone would buy a high-end brand product if they knew it was going to come from Taiwan or China. The box package looked fake, and when I complained to the company that I wanted a refund, they tried to get indignant and question my mistrust of Chinese products. I advised them that if they had to much confidence in American consumers willingness to trust products from that region as genuine and non-counterfeit, they should clearly state that they are in Taiwan instead of calling themselves SK Global. They are blatantly hiding the fact that they don&#x27;t even operate out of the US. Next time, I&#x27;ll just drive to Ulta or Sephora.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading about it in a magazine.  It does add a hint of color that is determined by your own coloring (like the Tangee Lipstick of old).  It is not a high gloss lip balm, however, so if that is what you are looking for this will not be for you.</li>
            <li> good quality ,love it always.</li>
            <li> feels great and leaves a nice color.</li>
            <li> Its waxy, so it&#x27;s thick, and coats your lips without clumps. It has SPF, color, and is basically the whole package!&lt;br /&gt;my mom and i both bought this, and although its in the same color, it actually does personalize our lips and brings out natural color, therefore my mom and i get two completely different colors from the same tube!&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is very nice; however, very expensive for the size. Given the price, I will only use it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Great lipstick, awesome natural colour. Brings about the right colour if you want to go au natural. Lasts a long time...</li>
            <li> people tell me your lips look sexy when i put it on my lip. Gives you a classy sexy look!</li>
            <li> I love it!  It feels great on... very moisturizing... and leaves my lips in good condition (doesn&#x27;t cause chapping or dryness).  The color looks good.  It gives my lips a pinker hue that looks natural.  It&#x27;s great for a daytime look or any casual makeup day.  I wore it yesterday to brunch with some thin eyeliner and mascara and it all looked great together, not too &amp;#34;try-hard&amp;#34; but nice and &amp;#34;finished.&amp;#34;  I did have to apply it once my lips felt dry (maybe every 2 hours-ish) to keep the same color effect, but that&#x27;s better than the average lip gloss.  It would be perfect for work or a daytime or casual date :)  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this product but it is so hard to find in a local store. It brings out your natural lip shade and its just beautiful. I&#x27;m so glad to find it on Amazon. Will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> This product does go on a little stiff. It doesn&#x27;t change the color of your lips all that much.  It&#x27;s way over priced for what it does. I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - it&#x27;s like my lip crack. I find myself putting in on a lot during the day.</li>
            <li> I love this better than lip conditioning product that I have ever used.  I have dry lips and it restores my lips to being as they were when I was younger!  This is the best buy of the year to me.  I am going to order one now just to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.  It is even pretty in the case.  It is perfect and stays on well.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been a fan of Clinique lipgloss but my boyfriend often complained that it was too sticky. So I upgraded to Dior after reading the reviews. I love the smell, feel and natural tint of color. My product came on time &amp; was neatly packaged. Great price!</li>
            <li> Great lipstick.  I just wish the price was lower.</li>
            <li> Friend of mine had this and had me try it. Went and bought my own the very next day. Darkens my natural lip color just enough.  Feels smooth like a balm, but sticks like lipstick.</li>
            <li> Love the smooth feel and the hint of mint flavor. Makes my lips feel great and doesn&#x27;t dry out. The color isn&#x27;t as vibrant as I would have liked but I like really vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> The shipper was great and the product arrived in a timely fashion. However, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing this product again. Pros: smells like peppermint, moisturizing, good packaging. Cons: I purchased this because of the pH changing color quality but my lips still look the same color to me. It just looks like I put chapstick on.</li>
            <li> This looks great on me and my lighter skinned girlfriend.  Love how emollient it is and the color lasts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be blunt. This is one of those things that can either work with you or against you. In my case, I love it so let me count the ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dior Addict &#x27;Lip Glow&#x27; Color Reviver Balm. The name alone pretty much gives everything away. It&#x27;s non-sticky, moisturizing and it literally &#x27;revives&#x27; dull looking lips by giving it a dose of color. It glides on smooth without leaving a waxy or sticky feel. It has SPF. It comes in a sleek, charming and luxe packaging. It&#x27;s DIOR so the price point is acceptable. It has a subtle scent with slight notes of vanilla and mint. And with just one swipe (and not more), my lips are hydrated and tinted with a natural looking MLBB (my lips but better) stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution though, be sure to try it on first in the store before you purchase it. Keep in mind that this lip balm is meant to respond to the the color chemistry of your own lips so amazing results on me (or anyone) doesn&#x27;t guarantee great results on another. Because I&#x27;ve been raving about it for some months now, I got some friends to try it on and let me tell you this lip balm has a mind of its own. I&#x27;ve seen results from bright, neon pink to deep fucshia. As for application, I never swipe it more than once as it does turn my lips looking unnaturally bright pink. Other than these, it&#x27;s simply an amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An marvelous lip balm that I will definitely repurchase and recommend.</li>
            <li> Gift to my sister, but she was very good</li>
            <li> This balm brightens lips and adds the perfect sheen. Suddenly I look less dead. Haha works for all skin tones like magic.</li>
            <li> I really liked this lip balm, except the price. It smells , tastes and feels lovely as well as brightens up my natural lip color. The price is to much tho.</li>
            <li> Very expensive product of very poor quality.  I only use Christian Dior make-up and wanted a color that didn&#x27;t disappoint after getting it home from the department store.  Although I use a liner too, I really can&#x27;t tell the natural color of my lips from this product.  I&#x27;d do better with a lip gloss from the drug store.  Save a lot of money too.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I am in my 60&#x27;s when natural lip color fades a lot.  This brings that color back so I don&#x27;t always have to wear lipstick, but all my lipsticks look great on top of this.  It also smells and tastes good as well.  Well worth it even though it is expensive. I have used this daily for several months and it is clear it will last a long time. I have bought a lot of cosmetics in my lifetime and this one fits up there with other items I have found to be worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Expensive but worth it! Moisturizing and brings out natural lip color. very light pink undertone.</li>
            <li> It does turn a different shade of pink for each person. I didn&#x27;t love the tone it turned on me. I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Every woman should have this amazing lipstick.you look incredibly natural when you wear this.it looks like the color you should wear ALWAYS.no yucky scent and it doesn&#x27;t stain your lips.it&#x27;s the perfect color for your chemistry.SO sheer but holds amazing lite color.perfect for when you don&#x27;t want to wear a heavy lipstick.great for all year but especially in warm seasons when you want to look natural.love love love!</li>
            <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;Arrived two days faster</li>
            <li> Sheer, with just a touch of color. Love the silky, smooth, light feel. Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm ever..gives you a tint to match your skin and leaves your lips silky ..</li>
            <li> Many lip products are actually drying.  Not only does this offer long-lasting, soothing moisture, it gives a bit of very natural looking color.  It&#x27;s great when you&#x27;re traveling and your space is limited: protective during sports/outdoor activities, and can dress up with you later.</li>
            <li> Considering what I paid for this, I&#x27;m very disappointed.  My lips stayed the same unfortunate shade of baby pink that comes in the tube.  What color there is doesn&#x27;t last long and isn&#x27;t all that lush or glossy looking.  One positive note is that it isn&#x27;t too sticky or waxy.  It&#x27;s way overpriced for the results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically wear lipstick color, this gives a slight enhancement that is flattering.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a year ago &amp; have to say now I use it every single day. My lips never ever crack even in the winter &amp; I&#x27;m out every day.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is great. It makes my lips feel so soft and a little bit goes a long way. I guess I&#x27;m one of the lucky ones that it works well with, I love the color it gives my lips! Its worth a try!</li>
            <li> I would have given this five stars, if it was not so overpriced. The formula is nice, and it looks pretty on. I probably won&#x27;t purchase it again, because of the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife and here is what she has to say: Okay first of all this was an expensive lip gloss. The package came wrapped in silver gift wrap, but it was not completely sealed. Second, the product box seemed open but the gloss did not look used. After using it for a week, I realized that by the end of the day of applying and reapplying, the gloss becomes bright pink. My lips look hot pink by the end of the day, and I&#x27;m pretty sure this is due to the reapplication process and the color layering. The Color Reviver technology is super cool and how it changes according to your lip&#x27;s chemistry, but not sure if layering works with this product. I&#x27;m going through a trial where I completely wipe my lips before I reapply...so let&#x27;s see what happens. Most of the reviews talk about the first application, which is great and I love this product during my first application, but as the day goes on and I apply more after eating or drinking the color changes. On a positive note, I love the way it smells and how it isn&#x27;t sticky. Let&#x27;s see what happens this week and I&#x27;ll write another review if you guys want.</li>
            <li> I love this product and thought it was cruelty free but found out it isn&#x27;t after I ordered it - I believe there was no animal testing of Christian Dior products but then when they opened their market to china it resumed as chine requires for now all products be tested on animals. Love the product but until Christian Dior stops testing on animals I won&#x27;t be buying it again - too many good cruelty free options that are aligned with my values.</li>
            <li> that is so good,i love it, you need to worth it.yes,it is useful. good things, so far so good.okay! that&#x27;s enough.</li>
            <li> I love this product by Christian Dior. Although I am a African American female the colour still comes up on my lips. I really like it also because it moisturizes my lips for a long time.</li>
            <li> Christian Dior Addict Lip Glow Color Awakening is by far the best lip gloss I have ever used. Its so silky, refreshing feeling and gives my lips a tiny tingle bringing out the natural pink in my lips. I have one with my makeup, in my purse &amp; at my desk.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Just turns a nice pink and feels so good on my lips.  Came across it by accident when i had airbrush makeup applied at the Dior counter and as I was leaving the clerk put some blush and asked if she could put this gloss on my lips, said it would just bring out the natural pink in my coloring(which I had told her when she applied the blush)  Anyway it felt really good and looked a light pink.  My husband loves makeup, especially eyes, but not lipstick, so I though ok perfect, I will get this.  Have not recieved yet so will see if he likes it.It is only 30.oo  Don&#x27;t know why is listing for more.  That is Dior&#x27;s price.  Hope this helps.  If u r a light skinned  girl  I think u will like.</li>
            <li> Dries out my lips.  I wasnt expecting it to be so drying for a lip balm.</li>
            <li> This is what I have been looking for. Conditions well, just the right amount of subtle color. I am blonde with a skin undertone toward blue, not yellow, and the color is great for me.  I have in the past had so-called &amp;#34;smart colors&amp;#34; turn out fluorescent pink on my lips but not so this time.</li>
            <li> My purse was stolen a month ago and one of the items in the bag was this lipstick.  Wasn&#x27;t as bad as losing my cell phone but I didn&#x27;t wait a day before ordering a replacement!</li>
            <li> Dior is always good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product get delivered ealier than I was expecting</li>
            <li> I am getting older, and my face needs a bit of help.  I have never been confident on the right color of lipstick.  A friend suggested this product and I do love it.  It makes just a bit of shine and seems to blend with my coloring to make it just a bit better, but not \\&quot;made up\\&quot; appearing.  I highly reccomend it to anyone, be they a make up pro or a newbie like me.</li>
            <li> Save your money on all those chapstick, sugar pot, lip balms and trade it in for this luxurious lip glow. It is expensive, but worth every penny if you suffer from dry lips year around. The color effect also works wonders. I never have to wear lipstick over it, but do so anyway from time to time to give it a little something extra. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last a minute</li>
            <li> My lips feel very hydrated when I use Addict Lip. It goes everywhere with me so I can look a little more polished than normal. I&#x27;m not a regular makeup wearer, but when I use this product it looks like I am. you see my lips, only better.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect shade for me! It stays on well, and does not clump up like most lipsticks on me! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> @SamanthaRone who I send this item is happy and say thanks for it on Twitter ! I Will buy again on Amazon :)</li>
            <li> i like it. because it smoth, moist, and protect lip from sun burn. i use it all the year.</li>
            <li> Too expensive but I must say, I love it!  Glides on easily and feels smooth on my lips.</li>
            <li> The lip balm is pretty good but it does make an unusually bright pink color sometimes</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product. It goes on smooth and lasts a long time. There is a little colour to your lips. It just enhances your own natural lip.</li>
            <li> great my mum likes it.</li>
