            <li> I was hesitant to order this product online as jars that have been refilled with cheaper inferior products are a common problem on the internet, but I did not want to spend another $125 at my local medspa, so I took a chance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this feels really heavy .  </li>
            <li> When I travel, It is bulky, not easily packed in my carry on bag.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed to have paid as much as I did for no better benefits than I got from this.</li>
            <li> To expensive to continue use.</li>
            <li> Very expensive at the Dermatology office&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> At $100 per bottle, was very disappointed with this seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this product on sale through E Bay for $200 which was quite shocking.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have used this cream before. Started noticing my skin was not looking as good as it did six months ago. Since I have started to use it again, I have see an improvement in my skin. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is an extra replenishing facial cream recommended by plastic surgeons post surgery.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a couple weeks but am happy so far. It is not greasy and is absorbed well into my skin. My face feels much more hydrated after using it.</li>
            <li> This is the same moisturizer I purchased at a local spa/dermatologist office for double the price. It comes within 2 - 3 days after I purchase it online.</li>
            <li> it was wrapped in sealed still everything that I liked it to be.</li>
            <li> Love, love it! My skin can&#x27;t live without it. I can use it all year around.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!!  It makes my skin feel so nourished and healthy!  Greatest penetrative moisturizer on the planet...until I find the next greatest thing!!</li>
            <li> I use the dermal skin repair with the total recovery and I love both products. Also, I am impressed at how both work well together. My skin is brighter and smoother. There is a difference after only a month, but it has not diminished any freckles or brown spots yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 4-5 years now.  My skin is very moist, very soft and I get compliments all of the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Dermal Repair for quite some time now.  Very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> its okay..fast shipment...don&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> Used to for years. The best product on the market for reducing lines and brightening skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product several years.  It was prescribed to me by my dermatologist.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> So great for ur skin. Moisturizers ur skin.  Wonderful</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The most wonderful face treatment!</li>
            <li> Definitely has improved my skin. Before using face was dry and lacked moisture after using only a few weeks I see and feel a big difference. Happy with this product and will continue using nightly. Don&#x27;t use in morning ritual since I use the spf &amp; mositurizer for the day...every day no matter what the weather.</li>
            <li> To expensive to continue use. There are other products with growth factors now.</li>
            <li> I tried a mini sample-size of this cream a few months back and instantly fell in love w/it, but not the price.&lt;br /&gt;So happy to have found it at apprx. 40% off retail on Amazon, i ordered the 1.7 ounce jar.I would recommend this cream for normal to dry skin types, not oily because it is slightly thicker/heavier. It absorbs quickly and makes my skin look \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; and plumped up, as well as moisturized really well. This cream contains NO SUNSCREEN so i tend to use it mostly&lt;br /&gt;at night or just on a few areas of my face that are more dry during the day... otherwise you need to wait until the cream soaks in, then ADD a light facial suncreen over the cream. I HIGHLY recommend this, it&#x27;s so luxurious!!!</li>
            <li> I love my skin medica but this feels really heavy .  I only use it at night.  wont get again,</li>
            <li> Very happy with the skin medica line. Love the dermal repair. Works great and makes my skin feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this was reccomended to me by a nurse friend who works for a dermatologist. I was disappointed to have paid as much as I did for no better benefits than I got from this.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I am happy with my purchase. I was hesitant to order this product online as jars that have been refilled with cheaper inferior products are a common problem on the internet, but I did not want to spend another $125 at my local medspa, so I took a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was well worth it.  While the packaging was a bit dented, it was sealed and the actual jar and product were in perfect condition.  I also had some of my original jar left and compared the two- the scent, consistency, etc of my amazon purchase is identical to the one I bought locally for a lot more money. (I realize businesses need to make a profit, but the mark up margin on this is way too high at spas.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS the actual Skinmedica Dermal Repair Cream is great too...I am in my 40&#x27;s in a very cold/dry environment and this mosturizer works! (and I have spent  a lot of money trying to find one that does :-))</li>
            <li> I bought it at my derm&#x27;s office and paid much more than Amazon&#x27;s price.  I like the cream, but the jar was not full and it&#x27;s simply too big.  I don&#x27;t know if I will see a difference in my skin, but forever hopeful!</li>
            <li> Use it all the time love it</li>
            <li> Great deal for price!  I bought some at the salon and it was over $100.00.  This works wonders!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using the Dermal Reapair Cream. I have used several of the other Skin Medica products and like all of them. The Dermal Cream is a nice rich cream which works well for me. I sese it on my face and neck area. Very expensive at the Dermatology office&#x27;s. Nice getting it a much lower price at Amazon. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very rich, works great for nighttime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. It works very well even on sensitive skin. My dermatologist sells it in his office.</li>
            <li> Love this product it seems my skin drinks it up &amp; people have been telling me how good my skin looks lately. Hghly reccommend it. I use skin medica C&amp;E on top of it. They work great together.</li>
            <li> Skinmedica Dermal repair Cream is an excellent product which I would recommend to anyone wanting to look younger. I would only recommend this product if you can get it at a reasonable price like I did this time through A &amp; B SkinCare on Amazon. I&#x27;ve seen this product on sale through E Bay for $200 which was quite shocking. I&#x27;m very pleased that I was able to locate this item so reasonably priced through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love all of Skin Medica&#x27;s products. This is one of my favorites. You used it sparingly as it&#x27;s quite rich and thick.&lt;br /&gt;It does wonders for the skin in the way of hydrating and keeping your skin soft.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer ... Been using it for years as my basic moisturizer both day and night.  During the day I use it under my sunscreen. I have basically normal to dry skin and it works well fo me. It would not work well for someone with dry to very dry skin though.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I have previously bought this from a doctors office and paid more for it. I was impressed with the price and the quality of the product. I will be ordering from here again!</li>
            <li> I love this product in general, but the seller shipped me a faulty product. It was all brown and then would not allow a return. At $100 per bottle, was very disappointed with this seller. BUYER BEWARE!</li>
            <li> Got a rash form it but I do have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Would not order again because of the packaging.  When I travel, It is bulky, not easily packed in my carry on bag.  The quantity of product is not commensurate with jar. If it was packaged differently, Even placing it on my dressing table, it takes too much space.  I might try it again, but now as shown and sent.</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist recommended this cream. It is good, absorbant, and does make your face less dry. Used it for two years and have found a better cream for my face.</li>
