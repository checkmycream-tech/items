            <li>i Add one more star</li>
            <li>just OKAY.</li>
            <li>but it smells great and shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it and that was 5 years ago</li>
            <li>10 more words required.</li>
            <li>4 more words required.</li>
            <li>Ok?</li>
            <li>i love it my wife love the smell</li>
            <li>My favorite Axe scent.</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest for any men</li>
            <li>THIS ITEM WORKS AND SMELL JUST FINE.</li>
            <li>Just a quick squirt beneath the shirt!  </li>
            <li>I loved the smell because it was not too strong, still noticeable, and masculine.</li>
            <li>Cheap too</li>
            <li>Light, not to overpowering.</li>
            <li>(2 spritzes is plenty), this is a solid every day scent that will win a lot of people over.    </li>
            <li>The smell is great and should last a while.</li>
            <li>All the boys love this scent, and if you&#x27;re straight, all the girls will love it too.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good cologne for your son, boyfriend or husband you will have no regrets buying this stuff.  </li>
            <li>NOTHING TO GET EXCITED ABOUT</li>
            <li>This is a great scent, that comes off clean and refreshing with a tiny touch of musk that&#x27;s sits very well.  </li>
            <li>Clean.  </li>
            <li>but thanks to amazon was able to get again and</li>
            <li>Absolutely one of my favorite colognes.</li>
            <li>It smells so good and is the only cologne he wears.  </li>
            <li>Hey it was nice of them for sending me back the money for a product i fully didn&#x27;t enjoy..</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be much better off with a fragrance of Creed&#x27;s caliber, but for the price, and relief that you won&#x27;t force everyone else to smell you wearing it, this is a decent effort by Axe to move into the Eau de Toilette market.</li>
            <li>The smell lasts a long time--and I can&#x27;t believe the great price for the large size.  </li>
            <li>So if you are just looking for something new, like I was, or looking for the benefits that it will most likey trigger then Axe Lab is for you.</li>
            <li>Fresh.  </li>
            <li>truly i don&#x27;t think its worth it...</li>
            <li>Not only did I like it but many of my (female) coworkers took notice and told me they thought it smelt relly good too.</li>
            <li>They did this one right.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s funny how they say its been or its getting discontinued .. smell pretty weird for sure,.. the only thing i can say is great price and nice way to attract peolpe to buying it..</li>
            <li>Super fast.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy this stuff at a local company store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see that Unilever finally released an Axe fragrance that&#x27;s not nuclear-powered.</li>
            <li>The first time I smelled this cologne on my boyfriend</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve compared with other colognes that I own ranging from 40 to 100</li>
            <li>Other than that, this gift was exactly what I was expecting; I think he will love it.</li>
            <li>and we both really like the smell.  </li>
            <li>shiping thanks amazon.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>but I really like it...</li>
            <li>The cologne is no longer available in stores and can only be bought on-line.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 3 before the price became that of real perfume.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I am currently 23 years old.  </li>
            <li>If you like other Axe products, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>AxeLab is close to \\&quot;Touch\\&quot; in scent, but with a slightly stronger top note of watermelon.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The smell is like a fresh clean manly smell with a little sweetness in the undertone.  </li>
            <li>They will love this stuff once they wear it and get a few compliments.</li>
            <li>Since it is discontinuted, I have to resort to purchasing it on ebay, amazon (third party sources), but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I normally wear colognes YSL, RSQ, BLVGARI, etc</li>
            <li>When I first bought Axe Lab, transitioning from Axe&#x27;s Kilo body spray, it was a sweeter and more subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li>This has been a favorite of mine for many years,  I was very disappointed when they discontinued it so you can imagine my surprise to see it available online.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne since I was 18 years old when my mother bought it for me as a stocking stuffer.  </li>
            <li>Axelab adds to your natural allure.  </li>
            <li>so much I went and bought a second bottle.</li>
            <li>Definately not a good way to keep attracting return customers if they discontinue Snake Peel look like its back to good ole&#x27; Irish Spring.</li>
            <li>Very bad that this is not for sale anymore, I really like how this last all day and the price was perfect but is not place where to find it  </li>
            <li>After giving this a bad review .. i ended up getting a message from the seller asking if i wanted a full refund for a better review ..</li>
            <li>I am very sad the stores discontinued such a phenomenal product!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m scared if other girls like it too much too.</li>
            <li>One or two sprays is all that any cologne needs, guys -- keep it light and subtle, and women will appreciate it.</li>
            <li>Boyfriend loves the smell, box smelled a little funny</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Boyfriend loves the smell, box smelled a little funny</li>
            <li> However, when the package arrived (earlier than I expected), I noticed the packaging was dented and the scratch-and-sniff sticker was almost ripped off.</li>
            <li> was mad that i could not get it any more</li>
            <li> Other guys are constantly asking him what he is wearing.</li>
            <li> We just keep it a secret ;)  </li>
            <li> Getting harder to find these days, but always get compliments from women on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to my other colognes.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased this product about 2 or 3 years ago at a Target store as a gift for my boyfriend, now husband.</li>
            <li> I am not a cologne wearer because they tend to give me a headache, however, a friend of mine had this body spray a few years ago and didn&#x27;t want it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunely, we are unable to purchase locally as this is discontinued</li>
            <li> Its hard to describe.  </li>
            <li> We are in our late 20s</li>
            <li> The smell is so subtle yet you just want to inhale every time he walks by.  </li>
            <li> My son loves this fragrance, and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores-thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
            <li> I never get tired of wearing it.</li>
            <li> and I am farrr from shy.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing forced or vulgar about it.  </li>
            <li> so we thought it was the wrong one</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this</li>
            <li> You cann&#x27;t go wrong buying this cologne.</li>
            <li> I hate Axe body sprays because they are too common.  </li>
            <li> Some people are materialistic these days(It&#x27;s the price we pay for switching to a consumerism economy) and will be disappointed thinking it&#x27;s just another lame Axe product, show them these reviews on amazon because we are not yanking any chains here!  </li>
            <li> The bad part is that it&#x27;s no longer sold at stores</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that it has been discontinued by the makers.</li>
            <li> so bad ...</li>
            <li> Provided you aren&#x27;t a moron and soak yourself in it</li>

            <li> I had previously purchased this product about 2 or 3 years ago at a Target store as a gift for my boyfriend, now husband. I loved the smell because it was not too strong, still noticeable, and masculine. My husband likes it too and it&#x27;s inexpensive. The bad part is that it&#x27;s no longer sold at stores and therefore I decided to find it online. My husband is now enjoying AXE Lab again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this EDT as a gift for my brother in-law. However, when the package arrived (earlier than I expected), I noticed the packaging was dented and the scratch-and-sniff sticker was almost ripped off. I wouldn&#x27;t have minded this at all if it was for myself, but since I was planning on giving it as a gift, I wasn&#x27;t too happy about the scuffs, etc. Other than that, this gift was exactly what I was expecting; I think he will love it.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my hubbie as a gift and we both really like the smell.  We are in our late 20s and I think the scent is appropriate--not too \\&quot;teenage.\\&quot; :)  The smell lasts a long time--and I can&#x27;t believe the great price for the large size.  If you like other Axe products, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for sometime now looove it stop selling it in store was mad that i could not get it any more but thanks to amazon was able to get again and soo glad got it in 2 days good shiping thanks amazon.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I am currently 23 years old.  I go out to the bars multiple times a week and I am farrr from shy.  I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne since I was 18 years old when my mother bought it for me as a stocking stuffer.  Why?  Because every time I go out, I get compliments on this cologne.  Girls LOVE this cologne.  I hate Axe body sprays because they are too common.  Everybody wears them; but not this stuff!  I never tell anyone what I&#x27;m wearing either, I prefer to let it be a mystery.  For 10 dollars, shoot you cant beat this.  If you are looking for a good cologne for your son, boyfriend or husband you will have no regrets buying this stuff.  I&#x27;ve compared with other colognes that I own ranging from 40 to 100+ dollars and this is still my default every day cologne.  Some people are materialistic these days(It&#x27;s the price we pay for switching to a consumerism economy) and will be disappointed thinking it&#x27;s just another lame Axe product, show them these reviews on amazon because we are not yanking any chains here!  They will love this stuff once they wear it and get a few compliments.</li>
            <li> I am not a cologne wearer because they tend to give me a headache, however, a friend of mine had this body spray a few years ago and didn&#x27;t want it. He have it to me and I fell in love. The smell is absolutely amazing. It&#x27;s not overpowering or fruity smelling. It also doesn&#x27;t smell musky. This is the only thing I will buy. Since it is discontinuted, I have to resort to purchasing it on ebay, amazon (third party sources), but it&#x27;s worth it. EVERYTIME I wear it, I get tons of compliments telling me how great I smell. I NEVER tell anyone what it is. They just have to wonder. All the boys love this scent, and if you&#x27;re straight, all the girls will love it too. It attracts ALL genders.</li>
            <li> Has an awesome smell, got for my hubby and he loves it as do i</li>
            <li> Best, longlasting, cologne I ever purchased. Cheap too and i looooove it on my boyfriend. I&#x27;m scared if other girls like it too much too. haha</li>
            <li> I used to be able to buy this stuff at a local company store. When they ran out I was devastated! I love this smell on my boyfriend. Other guys are constantly asking him what he is wearing. We just keep it a secret ;)  Try this smell guys.. I gaurentee the girls will love it!</li>
            <li> in this review i send for the axe lab and i got in on time and it was what i wanted and i loved it. this product smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely one of my favorite colognes. Getting harder to find these days, but always get compliments from women on it. Light, not to overpowering. They did this one right.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent scent. Not musky. It&#x27;s too bad that it has been discontinued by the makers. I will buy it again, if given the chance. My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> finally a good fragrance i really liked and guess what DISCONTINUED go figure well i guess thats just my luck something that smelled good and didnt cost an arm and a leg. Definately not a good way to keep attracting return customers if they discontinue Snake Peel look like its back to good ole&#x27; Irish Spring. So A word of warning to our friends at AXE quit messing with a good thing!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this Axe cologne.  It seems to have disappeared from the stores, so I am happy I can always find it on your website to re purchase it when my husband runs out.  I bought it for him as one of his Xmas gifts and I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll be happy as the one he has now is almost gone.</li>
            <li> Just a quick squirt beneath the shirt!  Axelab adds to your natural allure.  There&#x27;s nothing forced or vulgar about it.  Clean.  Fresh.  I never get tired of wearing it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s funny how they say its been or its getting discontinued .. smell pretty weird for sure,.. the only thing i can say is great price and nice way to attract peolpe to buying it.. truly i don&#x27;t think its worth it... I&#x27;ll stick to my other colognes. After giving this a bad review .. i ended up getting a message from the seller asking if i wanted a full refund for a better review .. so i asked for the refund and left the review and 2star.. Hey it was nice of them for sending me back the money for a product i fully didn&#x27;t enjoy.. so for that i Add one more star ***  but my opinion still stays Its the same the spray Its just OKAY.</li>
            <li> Very bad that this is not for sale anymore, I really like how this last all day and the price was perfect but is not place where to find it  so bad ... but I really like it...</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this fragrance because its not too strong or overpowering but it smells great!  Unfortunely, we are unable to purchase locally as this is discontinued but I&#x27;m thankful to amazon for still carrying it.  The smell is like a fresh clean manly smell with a little sweetness in the undertone.  Its hard to describe.  The smell is so subtle yet you just want to inhale every time he walks by.  He smells so good!</li>
            <li> My son loves this fragrance, and it&#x27;s hard to find in stores-thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
            <li> They should have never discontinued this fragrance.  Everyone compliments me on the way my husband smells.  I bought 3.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend loves the smell, box smelled a little funny so we thought it was the wrong one but it smells great and shipped fast.</li>
            <li> He loved it and so do I !!!!</li>
            <li> I normally wear colognes YSL, RSQ, BLVGARI, etc... but I had to find out what the rave is all about with AXE LABS. I used the body washes every day. I just got my bottle in and the smell is amazing good and lasts. I like it so much I went and bought a second bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to see that Unilever finally released an Axe fragrance that&#x27;s not nuclear-powered. I was apprehensive to buy this, knowing the potency of the bodysprays, but this is nothing like the overpowering sprays. AxeLab is close to \\&quot;Touch\\&quot; in scent, but with a slightly stronger top note of watermelon. You&#x27;d be much better off with a fragrance of Creed&#x27;s caliber, but for the price, and relief that you won&#x27;t force everyone else to smell you wearing it, this is a decent effort by Axe to move into the Eau de Toilette market. One or two sprays is all that any cologne needs, guys -- keep it light and subtle, and women will appreciate it.</li>
            <li> I buy that colon for my husband for years now. Service is great and smell is wonderful. I strongly suggest for any men</li>
            <li> This is a great scent, that comes off clean and refreshing with a tiny touch of musk that&#x27;s sits very well.  Provided you aren&#x27;t a moron and soak yourself in it (2 spritzes is plenty), this is a solid every day scent that will win a lot of people over.    Oh, and if you can grab a bottle of the AxeLab massage oil...do so.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> When I first bought Axe Lab, transitioning from Axe&#x27;s Kilo body spray, it was a sweeter and more subtle fragrance. Not only did I like it but many of my (female) coworkers took notice and told me they thought it smelt relly good too. So if you are just looking for something new, like I was, or looking for the benefits that it will most likey trigger then Axe Lab is for you.</li>
            <li> The first time I smelled this cologne on my boyfriend I fell in love with it and that was 5 years ago then they stopped selling it at walmart  and that was devestating...i am so happy to have found it on amazon and it made a great v-day gift he loved it! He was excited and happy that I found hia favorite axe cologne. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this it smells great and comes in a very elegant bottle!</li>
            <li> Wish Axe hadn&#x27;t stopped making this. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> He loves the scent and would recommend it to others. 10 more words required. Your welcome. 4 more words required. Ok?</li>
            <li> I ordered this Axe cologne spray for my teenage son. He loves all Axe products, including this one. The smell is great and should last a while. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and so do women the best axe they ever came out with b b b b b b b</li>
            <li> I really liked the smell of this when I smelled it before I bought it on amazon.. Price was good and it was a good gift.</li>
            <li> i love it my wife love the smell</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM WORKS AND SMELL JUST FINE. NOTHING TO GET EXCITED ABOUT BUT ITS OK.&lt;br /&gt;SIM TO THE SAMPLES THAT I GOT AT AN OUTING.</li>
            <li> Love this shipper!!!! Super fast.</li>
            <li> This has been a favorite of mine for many years,  I was very disappointed when they discontinued it so you can imagine my surprise to see it available online. highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had bought several bottles of AXE for my husband for Christmas.  The cologne is no longer available in stores and can only be bought on-line.  It smells so good and is the only cologne he wears.  He has enough to last him until next Christmas-2013.  You cann&#x27;t go wrong buying this cologne.</li>
            <li> My favorite Axe scent. Last hours, on clothing. (chest sprays for me!). I ordered 3 before the price became that of real perfume.</li>
