            <li>Smells nice and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>Best and most effective when used fresh out of the shower or tub.</li>
            <li>came in handy for my trip to West Africa.</li>
            <li>For someone that is very sensitive, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>It smells so good and goes on so smoothly that I use it for all purposes - not just for the SPF.</li>
            <li>I find the smell warm and comforting right out of the shower, so it is pleasant to me.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin a nice smell, has a nice gloss that leaves it looking like the skin you see in magazines, and makes your skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>My wife and children love this product because it leave their skin very smooth.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure with the ingredients it has,my skin will glow more and more.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>feeling that most sunblocks have.</li>
            <li>I think I will like it better in the summer, at the end of a winter day</li>
            <li>so I love that.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>

            <li>The cream is okay, even duo</li>
            <li>Love it as always all of plumbers is a love product for me</li>
            <li>and it is ok</li>
            <li>You would think they would know better and use a colorless chemical sunscreen for a gel oil which most people apply on DAMP skin</li>
            <li>Love it, Love it, Love it……</li>
            <li>what more do you want - well i could do with a Palmers Tanning lotion SPF 2 or 4 UVA/UVB protection tanning lotion for this price</li>
            <li>Lasts well and love that it&#x27;s a subscribe and save item.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of cocoa butter (if you don&#x27;t, you probably wouldn&#x27;t like most of palmer&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>so better make sure area applied won&#x27;t be making contact with anything for a while</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s safe for use outdoors--</li>
            <li>Love the scents.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>The seller got it to me QUICKLY and in new, perfect condition.</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s the best oil for people who are concerned with stretch marks and dry skin..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for dry skin in the winter.  </li>
            <li>Nice light scent and not too greasy-very smooth application.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for and I love the yummy cocoa butter smell too!</li>
            <li>This body oil spreads out so easily.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not too strong; my husband thinks it smells like chocolate.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sticky and smells strongly of cocoa.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit getting used to the texture, it kinda sticky at first but it absorbs quickly into the skin and feel really good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing makes your skin shine and really good on the winter getting rid of cracks and dry skin</li>
            <li>i used this during my pregnancy and its perfect, i do have strechmarks a little but its not as noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I could use it once in the morning fresh out of the shower and never have to reapply it on most days.</li>
            <li>Important to apply to moist/wet skin</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin silky smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li>the smell is light and divine and the feel is like silk.  </li>
            <li>It is great especially in the sun because it has spf</li>
            <li>The smell is not over powering, you can still where light perfume if that is your thing.</li>
            <li>Mixing it in with lotion then putting it on my legs and arms makes them so soft and smell good.</li>
            <li>This is a unique Palmer&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li>Palmer&#x27;s is the best brand for African American Skin--It never fails--I love the scent and the richness of the moisture gel...</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this gel oil.</li>
            <li>Love love love, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>and it works great on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Another great use for this gel is for dry, cracked feet.</li>
            <li>Please take note that it does not get absorbed that easy</li>
            <li>This Cocoa Butter Gel Oil is great for when your skin is dry.</li>
            <li>It smells good and is very moisturizing (a real plus in the winter).</li>
            <li>The Cocoa Butter Moisturizing Gel Oil, is great for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>UVA/UVB full protection -</li>
            <li>Gives my skin a nice glow and keeps it moisturised, and that&#x27;s saying a lot considering the fact that am African and my go to moisturiser was good old fashioned Vaseline.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried bath oils and lotions, after-bath formulas that cost 10X this much, and have not had any better results.</li>
            <li>but in the Texas heat it really makes you sweat more.</li>
            <li>It is heavily scented, but if you like the scent, which I think is a sort of pleasant chocolatey scent that fades quickly,  you&#x27;ll love it), so if you have reservations about that consider before buying.</li>
            <li>For this product, don&#x27;t use too much, just use a little for best results.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not a race to get it on quickly.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really smell like cocoa butter, but more like a fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I seems to work well on my facial area absorbing more quickly and providing a nice shine under my makeup.  </li>
            <li>Right after you shower put a fab full in your hand moisturizer into your body.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m spoiled by 2-day shipping from Amazon, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I put it on right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>some reviewers have mentioned, the natural cocoa butter smell is quite strong, so if that is something that will bother you, consider another product.  </li>
            <li>this gel is like a very intense treatment</li>
            <li>my first experience buying something that DOES EXACTLY WHAT</li>
            <li>and I tried several things before I fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li>It leaves a sheen at first</li>
            <li>My first time trying this</li>
            <li>really viscous and sticky!</li>
            <li>love that oil, especially after a bath.</li>
            <li>Smooth soft skin.</li>
            <li>so I thought this oil would be fast absorbing and quick to apply.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly not greasy, and the bonus of having SPF 15 is great.</li>
            <li>I hope it will really work during hot and sunny weather.</li>
            <li>First time I tried this product and I really like it.</li>
            <li>So it seems to be more oil-like than gel-like, and is blended somewhat strangely with the sunscreen</li>
            <li>I was really amazed when I found some cocoa butter in a gel form.</li>
            <li>I do however really like using it on my face.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product a couple of months ago and really like it; I like how it makes my skin feel after I put it on after a shower.  </li>
            <li>This gel oil smells yummy (like cocoa butter) and moisturizes really well.  </li>
            <li>With the price, there is a lot of product because it is very concentrated.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely be buying this product again</li>
            <li>and I would happily reccomend it to anyone who likes the way baby oil makes their skin feel but is tired of cleaning drippy baby oil off their bathroom rugs and floors.</li>
            <li>I like it thanks</li>
            <li>- hope they make one soon or if there already is one some one please tell me - thanks</li>
            <li>Does not seem to absorb very well.</li>
            <li>I really quite like the gel.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Shines you up really well</li>
            <li>I think every other day use at most.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of other palmers products since I love their lotion.</li>
            <li>I thought for sure this would be nice and light :(</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin smooth all day long even without additional moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>When used properly it&#x27;s lovely takes less than 3 minutes to quench your skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling healthy, especially after regular use.</li>
            <li>Now that I have this gel and it has SPF in it, I don&#x27;t have to worry about ruining the amount of protection in my sunscreen as I only mix a small amount in, and it helps my sunscreen go on so much more smoothly and blend in better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommed it for anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>they get super dry from washing them so much</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling soft the whole day.</li>
            <li>I use this product everyday :)</li>
            <li>Combining  both the gel and lotion together makes my skin feels amazing, my skin is protected from the harmful UVA/UVB rays and it saves money making the lotion last longer by using less of it.</li>
            <li>Also makes my feet feel very soft after applying.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy for a child to apply without making a mess.</li>
            <li>If they could make this in a higher SPF, I would only use this product.</li>
            <li>The oil itself is extremely moisturizing, and it leaves a tiny bit to protect your skin on top.</li>
            <li>Instead of it making my skin super soft like their other products it made my skin feel sticky.</li>
            <li>then go to bed and wake up to soft skin.</li>
            <li>always use this product  and always will leave skin so soft</li>
            <li>but it HAS made my skin soft, supple and silky.</li>
            <li>it keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Keeps the skin moisturized and soft even after shaving.</li>
            <li>In fact I use so much of the Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Lotion that I  constantly run out of it.</li>
            <li>This product has also helped with skin discoloration on my arms and legs another unexpected plus.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin soft and moisturizing without the greasy oil feeling.</li>
            <li>It protects from Ted sun and leaves my skin amazingly soft</li>
            <li>The consistency is nice and thick, one drop goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It is a little sticky, but seems to absorb fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>This gel/oil is absolutely fantastic and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Generally I use baby-oil when I get out of the shower, but this cocoa butter gel has changed that.  </li>
            <li>My skin stay soft all day long.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so thick, made me sweat and doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly.</li>
            <li>I put a drop of this in my hand and mix it with a generous amount of sunscreen to thin it out just enough to get it to rub in easily.  </li>
            <li>it is like a very thick oil which requires massaging it in very well or it will get on your clothes too much.  </li>

            <li> Love it, Love it, Love it……</li>
            <li> what more do you want - well i could do with a Palmers Tanning lotion SPF 2 or 4 UVA/UVB protection tanning lotion for this price</li>
            <li> Lasts well and love that it&#x27;s a subscribe and save item.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of cocoa butter (if you don&#x27;t, you probably wouldn&#x27;t like most of palmer&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> so better make sure area applied won&#x27;t be making contact with anything for a while</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s safe for use outdoors--</li>
            <li> Love the scents.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> The seller got it to me QUICKLY and in new, perfect condition.</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s the best oil for people who are concerned with stretch marks and dry skin..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for dry skin in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Nice light scent and not too greasy-very smooth application.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for and I love the yummy cocoa butter smell too!</li>
            <li> This body oil spreads out so easily.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not too strong; my husband thinks it smells like chocolate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky and smells strongly of cocoa.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit getting used to the texture, it kinda sticky at first but it absorbs quickly into the skin and feel really good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing makes your skin shine and really good on the winter getting rid of cracks and dry skin</li>
            <li> i used this during my pregnancy and its perfect, i do have strechmarks a little but its not as noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I could use it once in the morning fresh out of the shower and never have to reapply it on most days.</li>
            <li> Important to apply to moist/wet skin</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin silky smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li> the smell is light and divine and the feel is like silk.  </li>
            <li> It is great especially in the sun because it has spf</li>
            <li> The smell is not over powering, you can still where light perfume if that is your thing.</li>
            <li> Mixing it in with lotion then putting it on my legs and arms makes them so soft and smell good.</li>
            <li> This is a unique Palmer&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s is the best brand for African American Skin--It never fails--I love the scent and the richness of the moisture gel...</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this gel oil.</li>
            <li> Love love love, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> and it works great on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Another great use for this gel is for dry, cracked feet.</li>
            <li> Please take note that it does not get absorbed that easy</li>
            <li> This Cocoa Butter Gel Oil is great for when your skin is dry.</li>
            <li> It smells good and is very moisturizing (a real plus in the winter).</li>
            <li> The Cocoa Butter Moisturizing Gel Oil, is great for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> UVA/UVB full protection -</li>
            <li> Gives my skin a nice glow and keeps it moisturised, and that&#x27;s saying a lot considering the fact that am African and my go to moisturiser was good old fashioned Vaseline.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried bath oils and lotions, after-bath formulas that cost 10X this much, and have not had any better results.</li>
            <li> but in the Texas heat it really makes you sweat more.</li>
            <li> It is heavily scented, but if you like the scent, which I think is a sort of pleasant chocolatey scent that fades quickly,  you&#x27;ll love it), so if you have reservations about that consider before buying.</li>
            <li> For this product, don&#x27;t use too much, just use a little for best results.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a race to get it on quickly.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really smell like cocoa butter, but more like a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I seems to work well on my facial area absorbing more quickly and providing a nice shine under my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Right after you shower put a fab full in your hand moisturizer into your body.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m spoiled by 2-day shipping from Amazon, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I put it on right out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> some reviewers have mentioned, the natural cocoa butter smell is quite strong, so if that is something that will bother you, consider another product.  </li>
            <li> this gel is like a very intense treatment</li>
            <li> my first experience buying something that DOES EXACTLY WHAT</li>
            <li> and I tried several things before I fell in love with this product.</li>
            <li> It leaves a sheen at first</li>
            <li> My first time trying this</li>
            <li> really viscous and sticky!</li>
            <li> love that oil, especially after a bath.</li>
            <li> Smooth soft skin.</li>
            <li> so I thought this oil would be fast absorbing and quick to apply.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly not greasy, and the bonus of having SPF 15 is great.</li>
            <li> I hope it will really work during hot and sunny weather.</li>
            <li> First time I tried this product and I really like it.</li>
            <li> So it seems to be more oil-like than gel-like, and is blended somewhat strangely with the sunscreen</li>
            <li> I was really amazed when I found some cocoa butter in a gel form.</li>
            <li> I do however really like using it on my face.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a couple of months ago and really like it; I like how it makes my skin feel after I put it on after a shower.  </li>
            <li> This gel oil smells yummy (like cocoa butter) and moisturizes really well.  </li>
            <li> With the price, there is a lot of product because it is very concentrated.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely be buying this product again</li>
            <li> and I would happily reccomend it to anyone who likes the way baby oil makes their skin feel but is tired of cleaning drippy baby oil off their bathroom rugs and floors.</li>
            <li> I like it thanks</li>
            <li> - hope they make one soon or if there already is one some one please tell me - thanks</li>
            <li> Does not seem to absorb very well.</li>
            <li> I really quite like the gel.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Shines you up really well</li>
            <li> I think every other day use at most.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of other palmers products since I love their lotion.</li>
            <li> I thought for sure this would be nice and light :(</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin smooth all day long even without additional moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> When used properly it&#x27;s lovely takes less than 3 minutes to quench your skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling healthy, especially after regular use.</li>
            <li> Now that I have this gel and it has SPF in it, I don&#x27;t have to worry about ruining the amount of protection in my sunscreen as I only mix a small amount in, and it helps my sunscreen go on so much more smoothly and blend in better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommed it for anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> they get super dry from washing them so much</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling soft the whole day.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday :)</li>
            <li> Combining  both the gel and lotion together makes my skin feels amazing, my skin is protected from the harmful UVA/UVB rays and it saves money making the lotion last longer by using less of it.</li>
            <li> Also makes my feet feel very soft after applying.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy for a child to apply without making a mess.</li>
            <li> If they could make this in a higher SPF, I would only use this product.</li>
            <li> The oil itself is extremely moisturizing, and it leaves a tiny bit to protect your skin on top.</li>
            <li> Instead of it making my skin super soft like their other products it made my skin feel sticky.</li>
            <li> then go to bed and wake up to soft skin.</li>
            <li> always use this product  and always will leave skin so soft</li>
            <li> but it HAS made my skin soft, supple and silky.</li>
            <li> it keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Keeps the skin moisturized and soft even after shaving.</li>
            <li> In fact I use so much of the Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Lotion that I  constantly run out of it.</li>
            <li> This product has also helped with skin discoloration on my arms and legs another unexpected plus.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin soft and moisturizing without the greasy oil feeling.</li>
            <li> It protects from Ted sun and leaves my skin amazingly soft</li>
            <li> The consistency is nice and thick, one drop goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is a little sticky, but seems to absorb fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> This gel/oil is absolutely fantastic and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Generally I use baby-oil when I get out of the shower, but this cocoa butter gel has changed that.  </li>
            <li> My skin stay soft all day long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick, made me sweat and doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly.</li>
            <li> I put a drop of this in my hand and mix it with a generous amount of sunscreen to thin it out just enough to get it to rub in easily.  </li>
            <li> it is like a very thick oil which requires massaging it in very well or it will get on your clothes too much.  </li>
            <li> Thick, economical, and has sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a pea-size which how a long way.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t actually purchase this thru amazon, but I must say this oil has worked wonders on my dry skin this winter.  </li>
            <li> But my skin was dry several hours after applying.  </li>
            <li> only actual problem I have with this stuff is the SPF concoction just doesn&#x27;t seem to blend too well if you happen to get wet, put this on when you are damp, or attempt to use this in the shower.</li>
            <li> hard to apply to large areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and heavy and not suitable for warm weather.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin deliciously soft and a little bit goes a looooong way, especially if applied when still wet from the shower.</li>
            <li> Thick, seems like it would moisturize very well.  </li>
            <li> but no, they had to use mineral sunscreen that applies like white paste on the skin and is difficult to remove without jumping right back into the shower.</li>
            <li> I have extremly dry skin (think parched, cracked, dry earth) and my skin just \\&quot;drinks\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a recommendation from my dr to address dry skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then pat dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for dry chapped hands and a wind burned face in the winter and dry cracking feet in the summer.</li>
            <li> got this to use during the winter to help fight my dry itchy winter skin.  </li>
            <li> the the results is worth it----no more miserable itchy night!!!</li>
            <li> then I pat dry.</li>
            <li> Turns out my dry skin requires cream rather than oil or lotion.  </li>
            <li> I use this just on my fingers and heel as they get really dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> I step out of the shower and squirt a half-dollar sized dollop in my hand then massage into my neck, arms, elbows, legs, knees, feet, even under my eyes, then towel dry.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin but am always in a rush after my morning shower to get to work</li>
            <li> My skin gets dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> As prior reviewer said, little goes long way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a terrific product for your skin but caution, don&#x27;t use a lot because a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I use it after showering while my skin is still wet, apply the oil and then pat dry.  </li>
            <li> Left a slightly sticky residue after application that would not soak in.</li>
            <li> I use it every 3-4 days alternating with palmers dry ashy skin lotion on the other days.  </li>
            <li> There are really no words to add.  </li>
            <li> I put it on in the shower while wet</li>
            <li> while wet,  this rinses off.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t forsee yourself getting wet anytime soon with this stuff on</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple of weeks ago, and only use it a few times.</li>
            <li> It is certainly not for everyone though</li>
            <li> little goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I generally use mineral sunscreens which are notoriously hard to get blended in well, which usually leaves my skin a bit white and blotchy, but I need the protection</li>
            <li> I use a lot of sunscreen every time I leave the house due to photo-sensitivity and needing a lot of protection.  </li>
            <li> I love the spf cream, but this product is just way too sticky and doesn&#x27;t absorb well at all :(</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my excessive dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is not super absorbent.  </li>
            <li> I can use less of it also, so that&#x27;s a plus</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it has decreased the appearance of any stretch marks, but it certainly hasn&#x27;t made them any worse</li>
            <li> it takes a few minutes longer</li>
            <li> I will be in trouble if I do not refill their shelves with back-up bottles.  </li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> There were a few days I had to wipe off the excess with a paper towel before getting dressed, but it was a small price to pay for no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> So, a little heavier than the usual thin oils, but very heavy duty moisturizing and will stay for a longer time, I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to rub into your skin.</li>
            <li> When I’m going to be out for a prolonged period of time, I do use at least SPF 30.</li>
            <li> and it soaks into your skin nicely, not greasy.</li>
            <li> The gel is thick so it doesn&#x27;t drip off like baby oil</li>
            <li> The shipping was slow, it took over a week to arrive...</li>
            <li> Put gel on your feet then a pair of thin socks before going to bed.</li>
            <li> Too bad everyday is not halloween!</li>
            <li> I found it tough to sit on my furniture after using it because I was afraid it would stain.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say that I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with Palmers everything, so I had to try the oil!</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> so i can&#x27;t ever say anything bad about them</li>
            <li> I hate the sticky, dirty (to me)</li>
            <li> I hate, hate sunblock.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gel with oil base</li>
            <li> Blech.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was really amazed when I found some cocoa butter in a gel form. I never couldnt find that product at not any store..I want to say &amp;#34;Thank You&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is the best gel / oil ever.  If you ever use it you will not use anything else.</li>
            <li> I have extremly dry skin (think parched, cracked, dry earth) and my skin just \\&quot;drinks\\&quot; this in. I use it on my face, hands, feet, and legs then go to bed and wake up to soft skin. The fragrance is not too strong; my husband thinks it smells like chocolate.</li>
            <li> i used this during my pregnancy and its perfect, i do have strechmarks a little but its not as noticeable.  i looked for it everwhere, and could only find it on amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing research what&#x27;s the best oil for people who are concerned with stretch marks and dry skin.. and what works best to maintain healthy skin and it&#x27;s been a week,since I&#x27;m using this gel oil all I can say is,it&#x27;s great,I&#x27;m gonna keep using it on the daily bases and I&#x27;m sure with the ingredients it has,my skin will glow more and more.</li>
            <li> Love it. I mix it with lotion to give me that extra moisture. Leaves my skin feeling healthy, especially after regular use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a recommendation from my dr to address dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a LONG way.  It is not super absorbent.  I found it tough to sit on my furniture after using it because I was afraid it would stain.  I do however really like using it on my face. I seems to work well on my facial area absorbing more quickly and providing a nice shine under my makeup.  It also has a sunscreen in it which is a must for wrinkle prevention.</li>
            <li> When used properly it&#x27;s lovely takes less than 3 minutes to quench your skin. Right after you shower put a fab full in your hand moisturizer into your body. Then pat dry. Your skin would llook like a magazine cover. And it smells lovely!!! Great for winter season. I&#x27;m going to have to find another remedy for summer though!!!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!  It smells so good and goes on so smoothly that I use it for all purposes - not just for the SPF.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a couple of months ago and really like it; I like how it makes my skin feel after I put it on after a shower.  I wish this product was under the Subscribe and Save Program because I would definitely purchase it every month.  The gel oil doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy at all.  I especially like using it during the winter months.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because the product works on ashy skin. I like the shine/glow it leaves on one&#x27;s skin and last all day.</li>
            <li> This gel/oil is absolutely fantastic and a little goes a long way. I apply after showering but before drying with a towel and my skin feels and smells amazing. I&#x27;ve used it for dry chapped hands and a wind burned face in the winter and dry cracking feet in the summer. I highly recommed it for anyone. I have it on auto delivery so I&#x27;m never out.</li>
            <li> There are really no words to add.  It is as perfect a product as I have ever bought...my first experience buying something that DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS IT WILL DO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a happy camper.</li>
            <li> The BEST moisturizer ever!  After moving to the east coast, it&#x27;s the only thing that truly moisturizesy skin.</li>
            <li> I hate, hate sunblock. I hate the sticky, dirty (to me) feeling that most sunblocks have. But I’m fair skinned. I know I have to wear it. I was very pleased to find this formula by Palmers. It smells good and is very moisturizing (a real plus in the winter). It is a little sticky, but seems to absorb fairly quickly. It gives skin a nice sheen after. I use this for just incidental daily sun exposure. When I’m going to be out for a prolonged period of time, I do use at least SPF 30. If they could make this in a higher SPF, I would only use this product.</li>
            <li> I use this over and over.  Makes legs look great for summer with a nice shine!</li>
            <li> I am pre disposed to strech marks and have several from childhood growth spurts. I thought they&#x27;d be unavoidable durring pregnancy and I tried several things before I fell in love with this product. I could use it once in the morning fresh out of the shower and never have to reapply it on most days. There were a few days I had to wipe off the excess with a paper towel before getting dressed, but it was a small price to pay for no stretch marks. I buy this for all my mommy-to-be friends now.</li>
            <li> always use this product  and always will leave skin so soft</li>
            <li> arrival was as stated.</li>
            <li> My favorite moisturizer for winter!</li>
            <li> got this to use during the winter to help fight my dry itchy winter skin.  it works great!!  I use it every 3-4 days alternating with palmers dry ashy skin lotion on the other days.  this gel is like a very intense treatment and I do not need it daily.  it is like a very thick oil which requires massaging it in very well or it will get on your clothes too much.  even tho it takes a few minutes longer the the results is worth it----no more miserable itchy night!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t actually purchase this thru amazon, but I must say this oil has worked wonders on my dry skin this winter.  I use it after showering while my skin is still wet, apply the oil and then pat dry.  Keeps my skin smooth all day long even without additional moisturizers.  Nice light scent and not too greasy-very smooth application.</li>
            <li> Great going on your skin.  It leaves a sheen at first but it&#x27;s not overly greasy.  I think I will like it better in the summer, at the end of a winter day it needs to be re-applied.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of sunscreen every time I leave the house due to photo-sensitivity and needing a lot of protection.  Generally I use baby-oil when I get out of the shower, but this cocoa butter gel has changed that.  The gel is thick so it doesn&#x27;t drip off like baby oil so it&#x27;s not a race to get it on quickly.  I can take my time and apply it like a lotion but with the same type of moisture barrier that I get from baby oil.  I also get the added benefit of SPF protection, which regular baby oil doesn&#x27;t give me so I love that.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to using it just out of the shower to keep the moisture in my skin, I have also been using it to help apply sunscreen.  I put a drop of this in my hand and mix it with a generous amount of sunscreen to thin it out just enough to get it to rub in easily.  I generally use mineral sunscreens which are notoriously hard to get blended in well, which usually leaves my skin a bit white and blotchy, but I need the protection so I have to use it.  Now that I have this gel and it has SPF in it, I don&#x27;t have to worry about ruining the amount of protection in my sunscreen as I only mix a small amount in, and it helps my sunscreen go on so much more smoothly and blend in better.&lt;br /&gt;As some reviewers have mentioned, the natural cocoa butter smell is quite strong, so if that is something that will bother you, consider another product.  I find the smell warm and comforting right out of the shower, so it is pleasant to me.  It is certainly not for everyone though so keep in mind that it is cocoa butter and will smell like it!</li>
            <li> Have used this one for years. It&#x27;s the only &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; I use on my entire body, especially summer time. For someone that is very sensitive, this is perfect. Also makes my feet feel very soft after applying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for dry skin in the winter.  It&#x27;s thick and heavy and not suitable for warm weather. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Thick, economical, and has sunscreen.  As prior reviewer said, little goes long way.  Important to apply to moist/wet skin, otherwise it will not spread around.  I love this stuff.  I think every other day use at most.</li>
            <li> This gel oil smells yummy (like cocoa butter) and moisturizes really well.  Leaves your skin feeling soft the whole day.</li>
            <li> This oil makes my skin feel like silk. With the price, there is a lot of product because it is very concentrated.</li>
            <li> This is a unique Palmer&#x27;s product. It doesn&#x27;t really smell like cocoa butter, but more like a fresh scent. The consistency is nice and thick, one drop goes a long way. Surprisingly not greasy, and the bonus of having SPF 15 is great. Leaves my skin silky smooth and glowing. The shipping was slow, it took over a week to arrive... I guess I&#x27;m spoiled by 2-day shipping from Amazon, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Left a slightly sticky residue after application that would not soak in. I had to wipe off the excess. Smells nice and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> The cream is okay, even duo I just tried 1 yet. I hope it will really work during hot and sunny weather. This is what am waiting for, to try and see.</li>
            <li> Love it as always all of plumbers is a love product for me so i can&#x27;t ever say anything bad about them</li>
            <li> Highly recommended. It is the best for keeping stretch marks at bay. A little goes a long way. I still have after ten months</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for and I love the yummy cocoa butter smell too! It leaves my skin deliciously soft and a little bit goes a looooong way, especially if applied when still wet from the shower. I don&#x27;t know that it has decreased the appearance of any stretch marks, but it certainly hasn&#x27;t made them any worse but it HAS made my skin soft, supple and silky. The seller got it to me QUICKLY and in new, perfect condition. I will absolutely be buying this product again and I would happily reccomend it to anyone who likes the way baby oil makes their skin feel but is tired of cleaning drippy baby oil off their bathroom rugs and floors. The gel is easier to apply and smells like a tropical breeze instead of like a baby&#x27;s butt. Love it!</li>
            <li> this is petty good. like it because of spf it. help to protect from sun. would recommend it to every one</li>
            <li> My first time trying this and it is ok it keep my skin soft.I like it thanks I might order one again</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!!! I put it on in the shower while wet and it soaks into your skin nicely, not greasy.</li>
            <li> I should have figured this would be a problem with the SPF. You would think they would know better and use a colorless chemical sunscreen for a gel oil which most people apply on DAMP skin but no, they had to use mineral sunscreen that applies like white paste on the skin and is difficult to remove without jumping right back into the shower. Too bad everyday is not halloween!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my excessive dry skin. I use it after bathing before I go to bed. It leaves my skin with a silky feeling until the next morning.</li>
            <li> First time I tried this product and I really like it. It does leave you a bit sticky but I like the moisture and smell is great. I am a big palmers fan</li>
            <li> Love it, Love it, Love it……the smell is light and divine and the feel is like silk.  I put it on right out of the shower.  My skin stay soft all day long.  It is great in the winter.</li>
            <li> I use this oil as part of my pre-shave prep and it feels great! Keeps the skin moisturized and soft even after shaving.</li>
            <li> My son has medium brown skin and this is the only lotion he likes.  I like the smell, the cost and the SPF.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent Moisturizing Gel Oil, I have Sjogrens Syndrome Disorger and it works great on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Smells tropical.  Thick, seems like it would moisturize very well.  But my skin was dry several hours after applying.  And unlike baby oil gel that can be applied in the shower,  while wet,  this rinses off.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d like this gel version of my favorite body oil, but it&#x27;s actually very nice. It takes a bit getting used to the texture, it kinda sticky at first but it absorbs quickly into the skin and feel really good. I can use less of it also, so that&#x27;s a plus. I&#x27;d definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This body oil spreads out so easily. It only takes a pea-size which how a long way. It&#x27;s an awesome body massage oil too.</li>
            <li> UVA/UVB full protection - what more do you want - well i could do with a Palmers Tanning lotion SPF 2 or 4 UVA/UVB protection tanning lotion for this price - hope they make one soon or if there already is one some one please tell me - thanks</li>
            <li> Obsessed with Palmers everything, so I had to try the oil! It is great especially in the sun because it has spf and I know that  it is hydrating my skin instead of drying it out like I am being protected from the florida rays and I am still being hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have used  Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula with vitamin E on a daily basis after the 1st time purchasing it so when stumbled across this product with SPF I just had to try it. It&#x27;s a terrific product for your skin but caution, don&#x27;t use a lot because a little goes a LONG way. It&#x27;s a gel with oil base In fact I use so much of the Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Lotion that I  constantly run out of it. Combining  both the gel and lotion together makes my skin feels amazing, my skin is protected from the harmful UVA/UVB rays and it saves money making the lotion last longer by using less of it. After shaving my legs and exfoliating with a puff in the tub/shower I use the gel after getting out of bath and it soaks into my skin then I pat dry. Another great use for this gel is for dry, cracked feet. Put gel on your feet then a pair of thin socks before going to bed. This product has also helped with skin discoloration on my arms and legs another unexpected plus.</li>
            <li> This oil smells good but made me break out. Turns out my dry skin requires cream rather than oil or lotion.  I&#x27;ll not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Lasts well and love that it&#x27;s a subscribe and save item. Keeps my skin well moisturized and there&#x27;s also a bit of sunscreen protection. The smell is not over powering, you can still where light perfume if that is your thing. My son uses it too on occasion and it&#x27;s easy for a child to apply without making a mess.</li>
            <li> This stuff was a good idea on paper. I love the scent of cocoa butter (if you don&#x27;t, you probably wouldn&#x27;t like most of palmer&#x27;s products. It is heavily scented, but if you like the scent, which I think is a sort of pleasant chocolatey scent that fades quickly,  you&#x27;ll love it), so if you have reservations about that consider before buying. The oil itself is extremely moisturizing, and it leaves a tiny bit to protect your skin on top. So, a little heavier than the usual thin oils, but very heavy duty moisturizing and will stay for a longer time, I feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only actual problem I have with this stuff is the SPF concoction just doesn&#x27;t seem to blend too well if you happen to get wet, put this on when you are damp, or attempt to use this in the shower. I noticed the sunscreen separating out and forming a separate, white film if this &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; oil came in contact with water. So it seems to be more oil-like than gel-like, and is blended somewhat strangely with the sunscreen portion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t forsee yourself getting wet anytime soon with this stuff on I&#x27;d give it a go if you need hours of moisture.</li>
            <li> Mixing it in with lotion then putting it on my legs and arms makes them so soft and smell good. I&#x27;m very happy with this product. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful. From the reviews I thought it would be great. This stuff is what I would imagine trying to rub melted chocolate all over yourself. It&#x27;s sticky and smells strongly of cocoa. It&#x27;s so hard to rub into your skin. Blech.</li>
            <li> really viscous and sticky! hard to apply to large areas. good thing I use this just on my fingers and heel as they get really dry and cracked. perfect for my use but not so sure if anyone will appreciate using it as a moisturiser. Please take note that it does not get absorbed that easy so better make sure area applied won&#x27;t be making contact with anything for a while</li>
            <li> Good product. Does what it promises. Gives my skin a nice glow and keeps it moisturised, and that&#x27;s saying a lot considering the fact that am African and my go to moisturiser was good old fashioned Vaseline.</li>
            <li> So much better than baby oil gel! Best and most effective when used fresh out of the shower or tub.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Palmer&#x27;s makes a great product.</li>
            <li> I use to buy this at Walmart but it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon . It&#x27;s amazing makes your skin shine and really good on the winter getting rid of cracks and dry skin I don&#x27;t use lotion anymore not for the last 2 years ... Takes away marks too I use all coco butter products hair and oils and they are the best ....</li>
            <li> This Cocoa Butter Gel Oil is great for when your skin is dry. I use throughout the winter time to help my skin stay moist.</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s is the best brand for African American Skin--It never fails--I love the scent and the richness of the moisture gel...plus it&#x27;s safe for use outdoors--came in handy for my trip to West Africa.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of other palmers products since I love their lotion. I was not too happy with this product. It&#x27;s really thick, a little goes a long way. Instead of it making my skin super soft like their other products it made my skin feel sticky. I ended up using it with my body wash in the shower. That seemed to work out good. In the winter months my hands crack and bleed bc they get super dry from washing them so much (I work I&#x27;m the medical field) so I&#x27;ll keep it and try it again then to see if it helps. It does smell great!! Love the scents. Smells like chocolate. If you use it in the shower be extra carful as it can make you slip and fall! This happens to me years ago while using a similar product.</li>
            <li> My wife and children love this product because it leave their skin very smooth.  I will be in trouble if I do not refill their shelves with back-up bottles.  Needless to say that I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Very good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great for after the shower.</li>
            <li> The Cocoa Butter Moisturizing Gel Oil, is great for very dry skin. It leaves the skin soft and moisturizing without the greasy oil feeling. I use this product everyday :)</li>
            <li> OMG! This stuff is the best! I step out of the shower and squirt a half-dollar sized dollop in my hand then massage into my neck, arms, elbows, legs, knees, feet, even under my eyes, then towel dry. It leaves my skin moist and velvety without being slimy or sticky. I&#x27;ve tried bath oils and lotions, after-bath formulas that cost 10X this much, and have not had any better results. Plus it has a yummy, almost chocolate scent. I love it.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this gel oil. In my mind, this was gonna be easier to apply than regular oil or lotion. I have dry skin but am always in a rush after my morning shower to get to work so I thought this oil would be fast absorbing and quick to apply. Boy was I wrong! Every time I try to use it, I have to rub, rub, rub or it wont spread, it leaves a white milky residue on your skin if you don&#x27;t rub it in well. Does not seem to absorb very well. I feel my skin pulling like when you apply wax for hair removal. I do not recommend at all! What a waste.</li>
            <li> I really quite like the gel. It protects from Ted sun and leaves my skin amazingly soft</li>
            <li> Works amazingly! My skin feels moisturized and refreshed afterwards.It&#x27;s perfect for those that don&#x27;t like the oil because of it&#x27;s consistency or greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Love my Palmers! Thanks</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin a nice smell, has a nice gloss that leaves it looking like the skin you see in magazines, and makes your skin smooth.  For this product, don&#x27;t use too much, just use a little for best results.  I&#x27;d recommend this product to everybody.</li>
            <li> OMG!! The BEST Over All Moisturizerr EVER!!! I use it for Tanning. My skin has a wonderful glow. I put it on either before or after my shower. The moisture last&#x27;s for 24 hours!!  This is My Number ONE!! Palmers is the BEST!!</li>
            <li> Shines you up really well but in the Texas heat it really makes you sweat more.</li>
            <li> Love love love, especially in the winter. My skin gets dry and flaky. This smells great!</li>
            <li> It is just like the oil just easier to manage. I like that it has SPF.</li>
            <li> I added it to another oil because of it&#x27;s thickness  I thought for sure this would be nice and light :(</li>
            <li> I love the spf cream, but this product is just way too sticky and doesn&#x27;t absorb well at all :(</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it.  I believe I bought the oil, not the gel oil.&lt;br /&gt;I love that oil, especially after a bath.</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple of weeks ago, and only use it a few times. It&#x27;s so thick, made me sweat and doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly. I may have a good use for it during the winter months.</li>
            <li> I love this product...I&#x27;ve used it for years. Smooth soft skin. Great stuff!</li>
