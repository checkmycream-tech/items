            <li>Its easy to fold and doesn&#x27;t take much space in my shower which is great for my husband not to worry about relocating the seat when he is ready to use the shower.</li>

            <li>easy to clean.</li>

            <li>Easy to clean and</li>
            <li>A great find for when only 1 person in the family needs to utilize a seat.  </li>
            <li>I have trouble with my knees and it is perfect for me</li>
            <li>The chair is comfortable, as well as stable.</li>
            <li>It is great to have a shower seat only when you need it.</li>
            <li>me feel secure when showering.</li>
            <li>Great for injured relative.  </li>
            <li>So far so good; no problems to date.</li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>One is where it latches; the others are inside and when you turn it over to clean the rusty water drips out.  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li>The price was good also Thanks so much.  </li>
            <li>great delivery product as expected</li>
            <li>The was very sturdy and I felt safe on it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much better than the chair does not take up as much room in the shower (in my option) than the chair &amp;</li>
            <li>works very well, light weight, folds easily and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>But it is rusting quickly at a number of places.  </li>
            <li>I have a high risk pregnancy and I use this folding chair to help keep me off my feet safely in the shower.</li>
            <li>, it is small and fits very good in my tub shower.</li>
            <li>The fit and finish on the stool is first rate.                                      </li>
            <li>BTW, the relative was very pleased and called it a &amp;#34;Dandy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It is higher than some folding stools I saw, which makes a comfortable sitting position.</li>
            <li>I am a tall (5&#x27;8&amp;#34;) heavyset (250#) and have discovered that this shower chair a very comfortable height for me and is very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Travel has been pretty much out of the question for her for almost 5 years because while hotels offer handicapped bathrooms, most are just walk in shower and no seat.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Her first trip was to the beach!</li>
            <li>Life saver for 9 month pregnant woman who wants to shave legs and actually enjoy taking a shower.</li>
            <li>GREAT FOR LARGE SHOWER OR LARGE TUB BUT NOT FOR A REGULAR TUB.  </li>
            <li>I consider that a great product since I use it everyday.</li>
            <li>My dad is having trouble getting in and out of the tub and sitting in the tub to take a shower was a great idea.</li>
            <li>The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; is that the height isn&#x27;t adjustable (since I&#x27;m short), but I&#x27;m sure it would be a good height for everyone else.</li>
            <li>This chair is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Just the right height for me but check the dimensions as there is no height adjustment.  </li>
            <li>Also the price was right..</li>
            <li>Plus the fact that it folds up is great, because our bathroom is small, and we don&#x27;t always want it in there.</li>
            <li>so it takes up much less space than one that doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It is also the right size for my bathtub,width and lenght wise.</li>
            <li>I wish it was more compact for traveling and a little higher, but it work great on my last trip</li>
            <li>Extremely comfortable seat, given that I am disabled and some of bargain hotels may or may not have handicap accessible rooms, the seat allows me to look for better priced hotels and save a lot of money.</li>
            <li>very sturdy and thought the price was very reasonable!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fairly fit, 40 year old man.    </li>
            <li>first one did not fold and was always in the way&lt;</li>
            <li>If you buy this, just make sure to sit all the way back in the chair.</li>
            <li>Now she just sits and is enjoying her showers immensely.  </li>
            <li>stool was exactly as advertised, and served its purpose as a mobile shower stool to take on trips.  </li>
            <li>it does nothing more then act as a standard stool</li>
            <li>first, altho I can&#x27;t wait to take a shower, etc.; bench allows that wi.</li>
            <li>I am surprised that this happened so quickly when I had others for a couple of years and never had rust,  </li>
            <li>It folds easily for compact storage and definitely meets all of my showering needs.</li>
            <li>Can easily just fold it up and put away until that persons next use and not be inconvinient for the rest of the family.</li>
            <li>I folds open easily and it sits very stable in the tub.  </li>
            <li>Fits smaller tubs fine.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipped via FedEx.</li>
            <li>and it is ready to use.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy and convenient for my elderly mother.  </li>
            <li>I really like this chair.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy - bought this to take on vacation for my mother.  </li>
            <li>My mother had back surgery, and we purchased this to fit into our shower, and so that when not in use it could be folded up and stand in the corner...</li>
            <li>this is much more&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very unsafe and I am afarid to use it because it&#x27;s not stable.</li>
            <li>So having this seat has really help.  </li>
            <li>It fits my shower very well and does what it was purchased for.  </li>
            <li>The bags worked very well.  </li>
            <li>It folds up and is a very sturdy chair made of a durable material.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy also.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful for elderly and infirm</li>
            <li>Very helpful item.  </li>
            <li>Very well made; sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd shower chair I have purchased for my own use, and I have finally found one that works for me!  </li>
            <li>The main reason I choose this one over others (besides fast Prime shipping) is that it folds up for storage.</li>
            <li>It folds flat in between uses and is very easy to open and fold.</li>
            <li>With many tubs slanting slightly towards the drain, the chair tends to fold up a bit when a person leans forward (say to adjust the shower or reach for the shampoo).  </li>
            <li>I actually like it more than my regular shower chair.</li>
            <li>Folds to save space which is the main reason I got this particular chair.</li>
            <li>Ready to use right out of the box in my shower that was remodeled from a standard tub space.    </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for it as it folds up to save space.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;would highly recommend this item</li>
            <li>collapsing, if we made sure to lock the little silver lock into the hole.</li>
            <li>Small enough to fit into tub, and folds easily.</li>
            <li>It takes up next to no space when folded up and easily fits in my walk in shower and my bathtub (which is separate, in a different bathroom.)</li>
            <li>Slips right into the space next to the sink.    </li>
            <li>Prior to that I&#x27;ve had shower seats that skid around too much in the tub, or bend too much.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 74 year old mother who is not as steady on her feet as she used to be.  </li>
            <li>recommend this to anyone who shares a small shower.folds easily but is really sturdy.</li>
            <li>I first found this stool in a local drugstore chain.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 82 year old mother and she loves it!</li>
            <li>It is heavy enough to feel solid and safe but light enough to move around in the shower.</li>
            <li>We recently had a tub to large shower conversion and opted to not get the shower seat built into the conversion to save space.</li>
            <li>so it gets lots of fold and store action.  </li>
            <li>The part that supports the back is very floppy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It easily folds down, and fits in a standard tub.</li>
            <li>The chair itself is sturdy, my only issue with it is its too high</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>One major reason is it folds up</li>
            <li>It is too high for my shortness, too wide to manoeuvre, and the legs too far apart to fit in my tub which the rubber feet at least help that way.</li>
            <li>The seat is very slippery when wet and soap from your legs.</li>
            <li>Just bought a second one to use as a general purpose stool around the house and garage because of the quality.</li>
            <li>This chair really does fold down to a manageable size.  </li>
            <li>it folds easily and fits in the trunk of the car, or behind a door with no problem.</li>
            <li>That suits me fine as it eliminates unnecessary joints to rust or collect water.    </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Nice, comfortable seat, easy to fold and store.  </li>

            <li> Its easy to fold and doesn&#x27;t take much space in my shower which is great for my husband not to worry about relocating the seat when he is ready to use the shower.</li>

            <li> me feel secure when showering.</li>
            <li> Great for injured relative.  </li>
            <li> So far so good; no problems to date.</li>
            <li> Very useful.</li>
            <li> One is where it latches; the others are inside and when you turn it over to clean the rusty water drips out.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li> The price was good also Thanks so much.  </li>
            <li> great delivery product as expected</li>
            <li> The was very sturdy and I felt safe on it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much better than the chair does not take up as much room in the shower (in my option) than the chair &amp;</li>
            <li> works very well, light weight, folds easily and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> But it is rusting quickly at a number of places.  </li>
            <li> I have a high risk pregnancy and I use this folding chair to help keep me off my feet safely in the shower.</li>
            <li> , it is small and fits very good in my tub shower.</li>
            <li> The fit and finish on the stool is first rate.                                      </li>
            <li> BTW, the relative was very pleased and called it a &amp;#34;Dandy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It is higher than some folding stools I saw, which makes a comfortable sitting position.</li>
            <li> I am a tall (5&#x27;8&amp;#34;) heavyset (250#) and have discovered that this shower chair a very comfortable height for me and is very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Travel has been pretty much out of the question for her for almost 5 years because while hotels offer handicapped bathrooms, most are just walk in shower and no seat.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Her first trip was to the beach!</li>
            <li> Life saver for 9 month pregnant woman who wants to shave legs and actually enjoy taking a shower.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR LARGE SHOWER OR LARGE TUB BUT NOT FOR A REGULAR TUB.  </li>
            <li> I consider that a great product since I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> My dad is having trouble getting in and out of the tub and sitting in the tub to take a shower was a great idea.</li>
            <li> The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; is that the height isn&#x27;t adjustable (since I&#x27;m short), but I&#x27;m sure it would be a good height for everyone else.</li>
            <li> This chair is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Just the right height for me but check the dimensions as there is no height adjustment.  </li>
            <li> Also the price was right..</li>
            <li> Plus the fact that it folds up is great, because our bathroom is small, and we don&#x27;t always want it in there.</li>
            <li> so it takes up much less space than one that doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It is also the right size for my bathtub,width and lenght wise.</li>
            <li> I wish it was more compact for traveling and a little higher, but it work great on my last trip</li>
            <li> Extremely comfortable seat, given that I am disabled and some of bargain hotels may or may not have handicap accessible rooms, the seat allows me to look for better priced hotels and save a lot of money.</li>
            <li> very sturdy and thought the price was very reasonable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fairly fit, 40 year old man.    </li>
            <li> first one did not fold and was always in the way&lt;</li>
            <li> If you buy this, just make sure to sit all the way back in the chair.</li>
            <li> Now she just sits and is enjoying her showers immensely.  </li>
            <li> stool was exactly as advertised, and served its purpose as a mobile shower stool to take on trips.  </li>
            <li> it does nothing more then act as a standard stool</li>
            <li> first, altho I can&#x27;t wait to take a shower, etc.; bench allows that wi.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that this happened so quickly when I had others for a couple of years and never had rust,  </li>
            <li> It folds easily for compact storage and definitely meets all of my showering needs.</li>
            <li> Can easily just fold it up and put away until that persons next use and not be inconvinient for the rest of the family.</li>
            <li> I folds open easily and it sits very stable in the tub.  </li>
            <li> Fits smaller tubs fine.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipped via FedEx.</li>
            <li> and it is ready to use.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy and convenient for my elderly mother.  </li>
            <li> I really like this chair.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy - bought this to take on vacation for my mother.  </li>
            <li> My mother had back surgery, and we purchased this to fit into our shower, and so that when not in use it could be folded up and stand in the corner...</li>
            <li> this is much more&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very unsafe and I am afarid to use it because it&#x27;s not stable.</li>
            <li> So having this seat has really help.  </li>
            <li> It fits my shower very well and does what it was purchased for.  </li>
            <li> The bags worked very well.  </li>
            <li> It folds up and is a very sturdy chair made of a durable material.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy also.  </li>
            <li> Very helpful for elderly and infirm</li>
            <li> Very helpful item.  </li>
            <li> Very well made; sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd shower chair I have purchased for my own use, and I have finally found one that works for me!  </li>
            <li> The main reason I choose this one over others (besides fast Prime shipping) is that it folds up for storage.</li>
            <li> It folds flat in between uses and is very easy to open and fold.</li>
            <li> With many tubs slanting slightly towards the drain, the chair tends to fold up a bit when a person leans forward (say to adjust the shower or reach for the shampoo).  </li>
            <li> I actually like it more than my regular shower chair.</li>
            <li> Folds to save space which is the main reason I got this particular chair.</li>
            <li> Ready to use right out of the box in my shower that was remodeled from a standard tub space.    </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for it as it folds up to save space.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;would highly recommend this item</li>
            <li> collapsing, if we made sure to lock the little silver lock into the hole.</li>
            <li> Small enough to fit into tub, and folds easily.</li>
            <li> It takes up next to no space when folded up and easily fits in my walk in shower and my bathtub (which is separate, in a different bathroom.)</li>
            <li> Slips right into the space next to the sink.    </li>
            <li> Prior to that I&#x27;ve had shower seats that skid around too much in the tub, or bend too much.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 74 year old mother who is not as steady on her feet as she used to be.  </li>
            <li> recommend this to anyone who shares a small shower.folds easily but is really sturdy.</li>
            <li> I first found this stool in a local drugstore chain.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 82 year old mother and she loves it!</li>
            <li> It is heavy enough to feel solid and safe but light enough to move around in the shower.</li>
            <li> We recently had a tub to large shower conversion and opted to not get the shower seat built into the conversion to save space.</li>
            <li> so it gets lots of fold and store action.  </li>
            <li> The part that supports the back is very floppy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It easily folds down, and fits in a standard tub.</li>
            <li> The chair itself is sturdy, my only issue with it is its too high</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> One major reason is it folds up</li>
            <li> It is too high for my shortness, too wide to manoeuvre, and the legs too far apart to fit in my tub which the rubber feet at least help that way.</li>
            <li> The seat is very slippery when wet and soap from your legs.</li>
            <li> Just bought a second one to use as a general purpose stool around the house and garage because of the quality.</li>
            <li> This chair really does fold down to a manageable size.  </li>
            <li> it folds easily and fits in the trunk of the car, or behind a door with no problem.</li>
            <li> That suits me fine as it eliminates unnecessary joints to rust or collect water.    </li>
            <li> It folds up fairly flat and can be slipped next to the sink...</li>
            <li> It does very well in my small shower.</li>
            <li> Nothing to assemble, folds flat easilly to store and</li>
            <li> She loves it and it folds flat</li>
            <li> Steady legs, non slip grip, fold easily, no essembly required.</li>
            <li> l am thinking about buying it for my 93 year old Mother but can someone tell me if it can be adjust it up and down?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little &#x27;stiff&#x27;, folding &amp; unfolding it thus far, but it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a visiting elderly relative who is partially immobile.</li>
            <li> Although we always specify handicap accessible rooms, we have learned by sad experience that the hotels/motels are often not as advertised.  </li>
            <li> The seat could be a little deeper (to accommodate larger bottoms).</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the chair does not \\&quot;lock\\&quot; into the open position.  </li>
            <li> not fold closed while sitting on it&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Arrived and packaged as expected.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something that could be stored while taking up minimal space.</li>
            <li> However,I installed a linchpin pin on the other side of the seat to insure that the seat&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> She has motor neuron disease, so has trouble with standing long periods of time.  </li>
            <li> Ordered it from the hospital for my mother had one given to me before this arrived but decided to keep it due to it convenience.  </li>
            <li> My wife is off balance due to a neurological issue.</li>
            <li> Other times it folded up out of the way.</li>
            <li> Would reccommend it to everyone with a bathing problem due to standing in shower or getting in and out of tub.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this for anyone who would rather have a seat while they shave or who have a hard time getting up from a sitting position.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an average sized woman</li>
            <li> This was easily ready for my shower -- merely had to be unfolded.  </li>
            <li> Now, I can sit down comfortably,&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Rust formed on legs after less than 10 uses.</li>
            <li> Arms are weakened, yu may need slight help with that.</li>
            <li> but all were tight to begin with.</li>
            <li> Hate showers but this chair makes it easy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little slanted</li>
            <li> and I sometimes get a little out out breath trying to get washed and my hair shampooed.</li>
            <li> I needed this for only a short time due to a broken foot, but it was a lifesaver as trying to shower or bathe any other way was messy and difficult.</li>
            <li> I sometimes have trouble with my balance</li>
            <li> I have a rather narrow bathtub and it fits.</li>
            <li> I bought this to take my disabled daughter on a 10-day road trip.</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t have trouble with it</li>
            <li> She was hesitant to take a shower since she is having trouble with her balance  even though her bathtub is equipped with holding bars.  </li>
            <li> It fits but mine, but may not fit a small tub.</li>
            <li> Also, shower-bathrm has limited floor-space; folding bench allows me to keep it out of the way behind a door when not in use.</li>
            <li> If balance is not very good in shower, use this shower chair.</li>
            <li> X this year, my legs are weak @</li>
            <li> i BOUGHT THIS CHAIR BECAUSE I HAVE A BAD LEG AND HAVE TROUBLE STANDING IN THE SHOWER TO SHAVE MY LEGS.</li>
            <li> Muscular Dystrophy has caused my legs to be very weak and standing isn&#x27;t always an option.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the chair ended up lifting up at the folding joint and cause I slip and fall from the chair unto shower ground.  </li>
            <li> I would rather take a bath then a shower, but was unable to, because I couldn&#x27;t push myself up to get out of the tub.  </li>
            <li> You will not be sorry if you purchase one.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s crazy.  </li>
            <li> I could see this being dangerous for an elderly person or anyone who was not paying attention.    </li>
            <li> Disappointed as I will need to buy another soon.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see I bought it over 3.5 years ago!</li>

            <li> We recently had a tub to large shower conversion and opted to not get the shower seat built into the conversion to save space. Since we don&#x27;t always use or need the chair, this folding version is perfect. It stores easily and out of the way in a  closet. The handles work nicely so that it is easy to position yourself or if you need to lean to the side. Be sure to use the locking device when it is unfolded and being readied for use, so the seat does not tip.</li>
            <li> I bought this stool because the gym at work has no benches.  It has worked out perfectly.  It fits into my locker, and serves my needs.</li>
            <li> After looking at most every shower seat here, I found the best one for me and this is it.  It&#x27;s sturdy yet light and easy to use.  I&#x27;m the only one using the shower who needs a seat so it gets lots of fold and store action.  Slips right into the space next to the sink.    Just the right height for me but check the dimensions as there is no height adjustment.  That suits me fine as it eliminates unnecessary joints to rust or collect water.    Ready to use right out of the box in my shower that was remodeled from a standard tub space.    Fast shipped via FedEx.</li>
            <li> I purchased this folding shower/tub chair because I don&#x27;t like sitting in the shower to shave. I just got this item and I loved it right from the start. For starters it came assembled. I love that about any product. I opened it up and sat on it and it seems sturdy. It takes up next to no space when folded up and easily fits in my walk in shower and my bathtub (which is separate, in a different bathroom.) I would definitely recommend this for anyone who would rather have a seat while they shave or who have a hard time getting up from a sitting position.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for! Love it!!</li>
            <li> Great for anyone who shaves their legs in the shower!</li>
            <li> Perfect. Just as described. Small enough to fit into tub, and folds easily.</li>
            <li> There are a couple of things about this chair if you are considering buying it.  (1)  The part that supports the back is very floppy.  (2) I wanted this chair because of it folding but have difficulty collapsing the chair after its open so I have to leave it open all the time.  My hands/body don&#x27;t have the strength it takes especially if in the morning.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR LARGE SHOWER OR LARGE TUB BUT NOT FOR A REGULAR TUB.  LEAVES NO ROOM FOR MOVEMENT.</li>
            <li> This works fine for me.  I wish it were a bit lighter but until I can have a built in seat installed, this does the trick.</li>
            <li> I first found this stool in a local drugstore chain.  I bought it because I want the folding feature.  I wanted a second one for my mom.  What a surprise the drugstore now only carries the type that you have to put together and it doesn&#x27;t fold.  That&#x27;s crazy.  I want to fold it and stow it away when not in use.  I found this same stool at Amazon and bought 3 of them to have in case nobody makes the folding ones.  Eventually this one will wear out and I don&#x27;t have to search for a replacement.  The store shipped them to me quickly and they arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected. I am using it daily.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bath chair after fracturing my left leg.  I needed a sturdy bench to help me get the leg in and out of the tub and to sit on during the shower.  I&#x27;m a fairly fit, 40 year old man.    My only complaint is that the chair does not \\&quot;lock\\&quot; into the open position.  With many tubs slanting slightly towards the drain, the chair tends to fold up a bit when a person leans forward (say to adjust the shower or reach for the shampoo).  I could see this being dangerous for an elderly person or anyone who was not paying attention.    Otherwise, this product is well built, easy to fold up, light, and does the job.  Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I use a shower chair at home but I needed something that would be compact  (to store away) at my Sister&#x27;s house for my annual Christmas visits.  I had the first stool sent to her house and it was great.  Just opened the box and it is ready to use.  I can now visit and take showers with ease.  I loved the stool so much that I bought another one that I can take  with me on road trips.  You will be very happy with this purchase.  I love it !!</li>
            <li> Great product! Gives me confidence while in the shower. Muscular Dystrophy has caused my legs to be very weak and standing isn&#x27;t always an option.</li>
            <li> My husband is handicapped. This seat is good for him in the tub.  He loves it because it keeps him from falling</li>
            <li> sturday construction. easy to store.perfect for my husband to sit on after showering. cross brace give that extra support. easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This has offered some peace of mind and safety to us.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and convenient for my elderly mother.  I like the convenience of it folding up, it doesn&#x27;t have to be removed for someone else to take a shower.  Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I wish it was more compact for traveling and a little higher, but it work great on my last trip</li>
            <li> The seat has been a godsend.  It works great.  It folds up fairly flat and can be slipped next to the sink...where I keep mine.  I folds open easily and it sits very stable in the tub.  The best part of this deal is, you get two bath seats for the price of one!</li>
            <li> Helps my mom take her showers without falling</li>
            <li> I like it but it&#x27;s a little slanted</li>
            <li> Works great in my shower. Best part is it folds up.</li>
            <li> i BOUGHT THIS CHAIR BECAUSE I HAVE A BAD LEG AND HAVE TROUBLE STANDING IN THE SHOWER TO SHAVE MY LEGS. THIS SEAT IS GREAT.</li>
            <li> Nice, lightweight item for traveling.</li>
            <li> I use this seat in my bath tub for showering.&lt;br /&gt;It works very well, light weight, folds easily and dries quickly. It comes with a safety clip to keep the seat from closing during use. However,I installed a linchpin pin on the other side of the seat to insure that the seat&lt;br /&gt;Will not fold closed while sitting on it&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item</li>
            <li> l like this chair and l am thinking about buying it for my 93 year old Mother but can someone tell me if it can be adjust it up and down?  My Mother is a short lady and she is 5&#x60; now and a tall chair would not help her.  can anyone help?</li>
            <li> I really like this chair.  Only wish that it was either 1-2 inches shorter or adjustable as I am 5&#x27; 1/2&amp;#34;.  Other than that it is a great chair!</li>
            <li> Steady legs, non slip grip, fold easily, no essembly required. I would suggest that anyone buying it should measure their bath tub width and compare it with the dimensions specified for the product. I did, and was glad I did. It fits but mine, but may not fit a small tub.</li>
            <li> This is the best shower seat around. My just broke and when I went back to look at my order history I was shocked to see I bought it over 3.5 years ago! I consider that a great product since I use it everyday. Prior to that I&#x27;ve had shower seats that skid around too much in the tub, or bend too much. But this is the best one. I am re-ordering it now!</li>
            <li> Sturdy, did the job for post ankle surgery showers. It has parts that rust.</li>
            <li> I needed this for only a short time due to a broken foot, but it was a lifesaver as trying to shower or bathe any other way was messy and difficult. The was very sturdy and I felt safe on it. I&#x27;m an average sized woman but I&#x27;m sure it would have been perfect for someone much larger. The main reason I choose this one over others (besides fast Prime shipping) is that it folds up for storage. I&#x27;m hoping I don&#x27;t need it again but it is hanging in the garage just in case.</li>
            <li> wanted a seat that folded easily to be stored when not in use- this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy - bought this to take on vacation for my mother.  She has motor neuron disease, so has trouble with standing long periods of time.  This chair allowed her to take a shower safely, and on her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It easily folds down, and fits in a standard tub.</li>
            <li> This seat is so perfect.  It does very well in my small shower. Comfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great--good quality product.  Needed it after I had foot surgery.  NIce because it folds up and can be put away without taking up too much space.</li>
            <li> My mother had back surgery, and we purchased this to fit into our shower, and so that when not in use it could be folded up and stand in the corner... Works great and now everyone can use the shower again.</li>
            <li> This was easily ready for my shower -- merely had to be unfolded.  No installment problems.  It is comfortable had the side handles make it easy to arise from it.</li>
            <li> Had a different shower chair before this one and as I was sitiing on it, I almost ended up on the ground.  The legs just kept spreading out as I sat.  (I am 110 lbs by the way!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one was great out of the box!  Nothing to assemble, folds flat easilly to store and most importantly felt stable while using in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly reccomend this one!</li>
            <li> My dad is having trouble getting in and out of the tub and sitting in the tub to take a shower was a great idea. It&#x27;s compact and you can fold up this chair which is perfect</li>
            <li> this is the second shower stool I have purchased&lt;br /&gt;the first one did not fold and was always in the way&lt;br /&gt;when my husband used the shower - this is much more&lt;br /&gt;convenient because it can fold and be placed out of the way&lt;br /&gt;comfortable and study</li>
            <li> I loved this shower chair when I first got it. .  But it is rusting quickly at a number of places.  One is where it latches; the others are inside and when you turn it over to clean the rusty water drips out.  I am surprised that this happened so quickly when I had others for a couple of years and never had rust,  Disappointed as I will need to buy another soon.</li>
            <li> I bought this so I can sit in the shower because I have MS. It is heavy enough to feel solid and safe but light enough to move around in the shower. It is a bit big but if your shower is large, its a great item. I am glad I bought it.    Easy to put together. Just open box and unfold! Directions say to tighten screws but all were tight to begin with. No assembly required.</li>
            <li> My mom can&#x27;t stand in the shower. At all. Travel has been pretty much out of the question for her for almost 5 years because while hotels offer handicapped bathrooms, most are just walk in shower and no seat. With this we can take HER seat. I know it&#x27;s clean. It fits even a standard tub. She&#x27;s enjoyed getting out again. Her first trip was to the beach!</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does, and compactly to!</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd shower chair I have purchased for my own use, and I have finally found one that works for me!  I am a tall (5&#x27;8&amp;#34;) heavyset (250#) and have discovered that this shower chair a very comfortable height for me and is very sturdy.  It folds easily for compact storage and definitely meets all of my showering needs.</li>
            <li> The fit and finish on the stool is first rate.                                      My wife needed the stool for use in our oversize shower. She is very pleased with the performance of the stool.</li>
            <li> Good quality, sturdy and stable. Have been using one in the tub/shower for over a year with no problems or complaints at all. Just bought a second one to use as a general purpose stool around the house and garage because of the quality.</li>
            <li> Since my ankle surgery I needed this for the shower.  Don&#x27;t know what I would have done if I didn&#x27;t have this chair.  Arrived and packaged as expected.  Easy to clean and grips/ handles on the sides are good to have.  Easy to fold when not in use.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and excellent product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Appears to be as advertised.  Contrary to some reviews, it can be locked in place.  Also contrary to some reviews, we find it quite stable.  I do wish it had suction cups one the feet instead of simple rubber feet.  That would lock it in place on a slippery surface.</li>
            <li> A great find for when only 1 person in the family needs to utilize a seat.  Can easily just fold it up and put away until that persons next use and not be inconvinient for the rest of the family.</li>
            <li> I received my folding bath tub chair quickly and I am so pleased with it.  I have trouble with my knees and it is perfect for me, it is small and fits very good in my tub shower. The height is good also.The price was good also Thanks so much.  Also I appreciate Amazon for the services they provide.</li>
            <li> MY WIFE LOVES IT . It started to get rust l</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for it as it folds up to save space.  Unfortunately the chair ended up lifting up at the folding joint and cause I slip and fall from the chair unto shower ground.  It&#x27;s very unsafe and I am afarid to use it because it&#x27;s not stable.</li>
            <li> If balance is not very good in shower, use this shower chair. I use it every shower. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> great delivery product as expected</li>
            <li> Was perfect for me to get into the bathtub after my knee surgery.</li>
            <li> I sometimes have trouble with my balance and this is the perfect aid. It folds flat in between uses and is very easy to open and fold. I have a rather narrow bathtub and it fits.</li>
            <li> Rust formed on legs after less than 10 uses.</li>
            <li> I bought this to take my disabled daughter on a 10-day road trip. Although we always specify handicap accessible rooms, we have learned by sad experience that the hotels/motels are often not as advertised.  This handy folding chair slid into our car easily and then fit into multiple-sized tubs and showers in our 8 hotels/motels.  It made the trip so much better for my daughter.  We didn&#x27;t have trouble with it collapsing, if we made sure to lock the little silver lock into the hole.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly as a shower stood.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a visiting elderly relative who is partially immobile. I wanted something that could be stored while taking up minimal space. This fit the bill perfectly. BTW, the relative was very pleased and called it a &amp;#34;Dandy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Like it but could have been lower for tub</li>
            <li> love the convenience of being able to fold it up and put it away when no in use.  Ordered it from the hospital for my mother had one given to me before this arrived but decided to keep it due to it convenience.  very sturdy and thought the price was very reasonable!</li>
            <li> Excellent. Very light weight and can be moved for those who do not need it. Glad I got it and it stays clean, too.</li>
            <li> I like the quality of this bench. Nice, comfortable seat, easy to fold and store.  However...I was sitting forward on the bench and it collapsed and I ended up on the floor.  Scared me!  If you buy this, just make sure to sit all the way back in the chair.</li>
            <li> This seat was great to have after my wrist surgery!  I would rather take a bath then a shower, but was unable to, because I couldn&#x27;t push myself up to get out of the tub.  So having this seat has really help.  Plus the fact that it folds up is great, because our bathroom is small, and we don&#x27;t always want it in there.</li>
            <li> This is very good for traveling because it folds. I take it with me on road trips and use it in hotels. I bought a second one and had it shipped to my sister&#x27;s home across country so I could use it there when I visit. The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; is that the height isn&#x27;t adjustable (since I&#x27;m short), but I&#x27;m sure it would be a good height for everyone else.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 82 year old mother and she loves it! She was hesitant to take a shower since she is having trouble with her balance  even though her bathtub is equipped with holding bars.  Now she just sits and is enjoying her showers immensely.  It is convenient in that this chair folds and is easier to remove from the tub if needed.</li>
            <li> Stable, solid chair! Very useful.</li>
            <li> Sturdy. Folds easily. Love this as a great way to relax in the shower! Also makes a great vanity stool.</li>
            <li> Works great and folds easily</li>
            <li> So far so good; no problems to date.</li>
            <li> It fits my shower very well and does what it was purchased for.  Would recommend this chair to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this it&#x27;s much better than the chair does not take up as much room in the shower (in my option) than the chair &amp; it folds up if you don&#x27;t do not need all the time. You will not be sorry if you purchase one.</li>
            <li> I am on oxygen and I sometimes get a little out out breath trying to get washed and my hair shampooed. Now, I can sit down comfortably,&lt;br /&gt; catch my breath, soap up, etc. then stand to rinse or....vice versa! The chair is comfortable, as well as stable.</li>
            <li> The bags worked very well.  I&#x27;ve used them about 4 times - it remains to be seen how well they hold up.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 74 year old mother who is not as steady on her feet as she used to be.  She loves it and it folds flat so she can store it between the commode and the tub.  I would recommend to anyone who is in need of a shower seat.</li>
            <li> great gift for that elderly person that feels unstable in the shower.  pretty good about not mildewing.</li>
            <li> Ordered this chair for my (huge) shower to use when shaving my legs. Love it!  It folds up and is a very sturdy chair made of a durable material. I love the drainage holes for shedding water. So glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> This folding shower chair works great for my Mom in the bathtub shower.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> recommend this to anyone who shares a small shower.folds easily but is really sturdy.One of us is 230 pounds.no problem.</li>
            <li> This chair really does fold down to a manageable size.  It is very sturdy also.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This chair is so sturdy!  I just love it!  This chair is well worth the money.  I actually like it more than my regular shower chair.</li>
            <li> stool was exactly as advertised, and served its purpose as a mobile shower stool to take on trips.  it folds easily and fits in the trunk of the car, or behind a door with no problem.</li>
            <li> Extremely comfortable seat, given that I am disabled and some of bargain hotels may or may not have handicap accessible rooms, the seat allows me to look for better priced hotels and save a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who is wheelchair bound.  Folds nicely out of the way in our walk in shower and is sturdy</li>
            <li> The concept and design of this chair is great. The chair itself is sturdy, my only issue with it is its too high (and I&#x27;m a 6&#x27;1&amp;#34; guy).</li>
            <li> Very helpful for elderly and infirm</li>
            <li> My wife is off balance due to a neurological issue. I don&#x27;t have to worry about her when she showers for possible falls</li>
            <li> Hate showers but this chair makes it easy. The height is great and I can stand up with no extra help.</li>
            <li> Used to have shower seat in apt before I moved, so missed being able to wash feet and not fear falling (at 77) so this is wonderful and very solid to sit on.  Plus the folding up feature keeps the shower roomy.</li>
            <li> It is great to have a shower seat only when you need it. We only need it when we&#x27;ve had an operation. Other times it folded up out of the way. Rust is starting to form on chrome seat lock.</li>
            <li> This shower stool works well in the shower. I like that it folds out of the way when not in use. It is higher than some folding stools I saw, which makes a comfortable sitting position. The seat could be a little deeper (to accommodate larger bottoms).</li>
            <li> Stable, well made, folds nicely in corner of stand up shower when done.  Life saver for 9 month pregnant woman who wants to shave legs and actually enjoy taking a shower.</li>
            <li> easy to use, sturdy and great....</li>
            <li> Very helpful item.  I got this seat for use in the shower because of the folding capability for storage.  It is easy to fold up and remove for others in the household that do not need or want the seat when they shower.</li>
            <li> I am plagued with chronic fatigue and purchased this for taking a shower in my bathtub. It is too high for my shortness, too wide to manoeuvre, and the legs too far apart to fit in my tub which the rubber feet at least help that way.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. It fits well in my bath tub,&lt;br /&gt;and folds for storage. I had a hip replacement, and this product&lt;br /&gt;makes me feel secure when showering.</li>
            <li> This product has changed my life. Easy to fold and unfold. Locking device makes chair safe. Would reccommend it to everyone with a bathing problem due to standing in shower or getting in and out of tub.</li>
            <li> nice very strong I think is too toll maybe if I cut about 3 inch it is going to be fine or maybe you need to size one for tall people and one for short people</li>
            <li> it works, its a folding chair that fits in a shower - it does nothing more then act as a standard stool</li>
            <li> I have had back surgery and this has helped me for taking a shower and is very good and ha not rusted&lt;br /&gt;would highly recommend this item</li>
            <li> I have a high risk pregnancy and I use this folding chair to help keep me off my feet safely in the shower. I&#x27;m able to easily wash from my head to my toes. Its easy to fold and doesn&#x27;t take much space in my shower which is great for my husband not to worry about relocating the seat when he is ready to use the shower. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product if someone needed handles for stability because this seat does not come with them as it is a folding chair. However, it is a great product for my purpose.</li>
            <li> I love my shower-bench! After release from hospital sevl. X this year, my legs are weak @ first, altho I can&#x27;t wait to take a shower, etc.; bench allows that wi. relative safety, &amp; I also use shower-wall hand-grips to help enter/lower myself to sit &amp; rise. It&#x27;s lite-weight, yet sturdy-enuf for fairly-ample poundage. Also, shower-bathrm has limited floor-space; folding bench allows me to keep it out of the way behind a door when not in use. It&#x27;s a little &#x27;stiff&#x27;, folding &amp; unfolding it thus far, but it&#x27;s new. If yr. Arms are weakened, yu may need slight help with that. ~ K. Birdsong</li>
            <li> Too wobbly for a wheelchair transfer to be safe so we returned it</li>
            <li> The seat is very slippery when wet and soap from your legs.</li>
            <li> very easy to take with you</li>
            <li> I love this chair! One major reason is it folds up so it takes up much less space than one that doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It is also the right size for my bathtub,width and lenght wise. Also the price was right..</li>
            <li> Excellent idea!  Also great for (car) travel if you can&#x27;t book a handicapped room!!  (Or visiting family...)</li>
            <li> Great for injured relative.  Very well made; sturdy.  Fits smaller tubs fine.  We plan to take it when traveling.</li>
            <li> Works well and folds up nicely.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Purchased this one as my disability is temporary and it is easy to store.</li>
            <li> Works as needed. Folds to save space which is the main reason I got this particular chair. No complaints!</li>
