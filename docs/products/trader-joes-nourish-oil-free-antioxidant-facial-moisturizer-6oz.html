            <li>So far this is the best moisturizer ivr ever used</li>

            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s not packed with a bunch of chemicals or fragrances.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, and because I do not have a Trader</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t moisturize, that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li>Smell is way better then the face wash</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this since it is oil free and it leaves my skin nice and smooth</li>
            <li>This however is amazing and such a great price.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that its oil free.</li>
            <li>I thought there was nothing out there for my skin to moisturize it because most oil free products had tons of oil and</li>
            <li>Light and refreshing and does not clog my pores.</li>
            <li>this works fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more mild than infant lotion</li>
            <li>I figured I wouldn&#x27;t lose much if tried Trader Joe&#x27;s and didn&#x27;t like it either, but I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>and this little work horse is the best bang for the buck!</li>
            <li>It is light wait, moisturizing w/o oil.  </li>
            <li>Its light and don&#x27;t break my skin out..not to mention that its paraben and fragrance free.</li>
            <li>It says oil free</li>
            <li>Worth every penny, and more.</li>
            <li>It is cruelty free, but if you are looking for a vegan product, look somewhere else.</li>
            <li>It is not a photo of the product I ordered but the product was good and didn&#x27;t cause problems with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>so happy I found this product cause burts bees is much less product and allot more money</li>
            <li>Then they went and changed the original formula, to a &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light weight and has not broken me out or clogged my pores.</li>
            <li>Goes on with no greasy feeling, spreads nicely and doesn&#x27;t seem to pick up dust or dirt in the air or salt near the ocean.</li>
            <li>not irritating to face, love it</li>
            <li>Large size, cheap price, don&#x27;t cause acne.</li>
            <li>and as this is oil free, it didn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy, but really made no difference at all.</li>
            <li>First off let me say that I have THEE most sensitive skin that&#x27;s on the oily side as well</li>
            <li>Applied this right after washing my face and it really goes on smooth and you wont have to put more on later as it leaves your skin very moisturized and no oily/greasy feeling either.  </li>
            <li>Pretty bummed that I didn&#x27;t realize this has no SPF at all.</li>
            <li>I am definitely a skin care junkie, I work for a dermatologist in Scottsdale Az, I have used some of the best products out there , skinmedica, skin ceuticals , nia, even department store brands, or kiehls, recently I ran out of my daytime moisturizer and was away from home, picked this up at a local trader joes.</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy and absorbs quickly, but leaves your skin soft and feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li>but if I apply too much it will turn my face into an oil slick but applied in moderation I am good to go.</li>
            <li>I get complimented on my skin all the time and laugh to myself at my little trader joes find:)..</li>
            <li>So there&#x27;s how it works for ME, now let me tell you why I&#x27;m really giving this product a five star review.</li>
            <li>I do recommend this to people with skin types like mine but just mindful of how much you use.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend it to every one.</li>
            <li>and this is oil free and sinks right in.</li>
            <li>This is your usual excellent Trader Joe&#x27;s deal- half the price per ounce of Neutrogena face lotion for men.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced, comes in a cute little bottle  too.</li>
            <li>Beyond that, I have sensitive skin and have to be careful of chemical sunscreens, so if I&#x27;m going to be outdoors, I pick the level of SPF I need and apply on top of the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It feels littlebit dry when first I apply this product, but it smoothly absorbed to my skin.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know if this is the smell of the product or its an old bottle but still works very well.</li>
            <li>Her face was so clear!</li>
            <li>An average face lotion as it did not do anything special for my skin.</li>
            <li>the sensitive skin products broke me out.</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin so soft and glowing and no breakouts</li>
            <li>I have allergies, sensitive skinand eyes</li>
            <li>It goes on like silk and makes my face soft and supple.</li>
            <li>It is a decent enough moisturizer, I tend to have oilier skin</li>
            <li>its very long lasting in the bottle also because you don&#x27;t use very much of it.</li>
            <li>(But not extremely oily).</li>
            <li>i could probably use it on very dry patches but not all over my whole face.</li>
            <li>it was sort of weirdly textured and didn&#x27;t feel nice in my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried far more expensive daily mositurizers (Clarins, Clinique, Lancome, Bare Escentuals)</li>
            <li>My particular bottle smells a little old</li>
            <li>I normally use dermalogica active moist, but was looking for a cheaper option.</li>

            <li> I normally use dermalogica active moist, but was looking for a cheaper option.</li>
            <li> I pretty much only use lotion in the late fall winter months</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is searching for a high-quality, low-cost everyday under-make-up moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My two month old daughter has extremely dry rough patches of skin on her cheeks, head, stomach, and legs.</li>
            <li> I have worn and sworn by Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizer since I was 19 (a long time ago...).  </li>
            <li> cause thats the only time my skin feels a bit dry</li>
            <li> my teenage granddaughter, having to use acne medicine that makes her skin dry, loves this!</li>
            <li> My needs are basic and I have no particular criteria beyond those.</li>
            <li> Due to military orders, we are living in South Dakota and there&#x27;s no Trader Joes near us.</li>
            <li> I mean I really did almost give up hope by just resorting to hydrocortisone cream as my moisturizer (which still had mineral oil in it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale with very sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> would definately recomend for oily but dry in winter skin type!</li>
            <li> My skin is real dry and looks like hell without some moisturizer and</li>
            <li> No zits, itching or other reactions seemingly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll also add that my husband uses it on cracked knuckles after a long day of shooting and being in harsh 110</li>
            <li> so I was looking for other options.  </li>
            <li> I use this every morning, and every other evening.</li>
            <li> i gave it the ol college try trust me, i used half the bottle.</li>
            <li> cause i seem to have less blackheads too.</li>
            <li> I decided to brush a little bit of this product over</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that I had to discover this on my own and that there was no notification in the stores or online about this, they just changed the packaging and tried to pretend it never happened.</li>
            <li> and i dont like the heavy feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes your skin without feeling greasy, and I swear you can almost feel the slight tingle of the antioxidants at work!  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not tested on animals (at least that&#x27;s what they claim) and it&#x27;s extremely affordable.</li>
            <li> Not sure what this photo is.  </li>
            <li> I am not really sure that it did anything at all.  </li>
            <li> I also use a thicker cream every other night because of the icky, cold weather that keeps my skin tight, and dry.</li>
            <li> Upon closer inspection, there are at least three ingredients which are not vegan.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled...</li>
            <li> breaks me out :(</li>
            <li> the worst patch-</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Received yesterday, used it today, and I love it already. Gave me a nice glow, softness, smooth skin, and moisture without oily look!!! This stuff is great! I bought two of them based on the reviews. Glad I did! Only used a dime size of it! When TJs name was attached, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase it!</li>
            <li> If it works for you great...but not for me .Irritated my skin. Cause breakouts I returned it.</li>
            <li> This is your usual excellent Trader Joe&#x27;s deal- half the price per ounce of Neutrogena face lotion for men. Goes on with no greasy feeling, spreads nicely and doesn&#x27;t seem to pick up dust or dirt in the air or salt near the ocean. No zits, itching or other reactions seemingly. My needs are basic and I have no particular criteria beyond those. My skin is real dry and looks like hell without some moisturizer and this works fine.</li>
            <li> breaks me out :( and i dont like the heavy feeling on my skin. i gave it the ol college try trust me, i used half the bottle. i just cant deal with it. i could probably use it on very dry patches but not all over my whole face.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of it on my Face. its very long lasting in the bottle also because you don&#x27;t use very much of it.I love the fact that its oil free. My particular bottle smells a little old and I don&#x27;t know if this is the smell of the product or its an old bottle but still works very well.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product that does what it says.  It is light wait, moisturizing w/o oil.  I&#x27;ve had no breakouts, it&#x27;s not tested on animals (at least that&#x27;s what they claim) and it&#x27;s extremely affordable.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Feels like you have nothing on. So far this is the best moisturizer ivr ever used</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not some miracle worker but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to and that&#x27;s moisturizing my face. Works fine for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for five years now. Due to military orders, we are living in South Dakota and there&#x27;s no Trader Joes near us. Yet I still order this moisturizer because it is the BEST. I&#x27;m very pale with very sensitive, dry skin. My T-Zone is oily, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t hinder that part of my face at all. I use this once a day, under my makeup and it lasts until I wash it off. So there&#x27;s how it works for ME, now let me tell you why I&#x27;m really giving this product a five star review. My two month old daughter has extremely dry rough patches of skin on her cheeks, head, stomach, and legs. I&#x27;ve tried everything. Eczema lotions and potions, different soaps, no soaps, Aquaphor and like products, nothing worked. I decided to brush a little bit of this product over the worst patch- her cheeks before she went to bed. 10 hours later, it was practically gone. Her face was so clear! I now use this product on both of my children. It&#x27;s more mild than infant lotion yet it gets the job done. I love that it&#x27;s not packed with a bunch of chemicals or fragrances. It&#x27;s awesome. I&#x27;ll also add that my husband uses it on cracked knuckles after a long day of shooting and being in harsh 110 degree+ weather.</li>
            <li> First off let me say that I have THEE most sensitive skin that&#x27;s on the oily side as well (But not extremely oily). I thought there was nothing out there for my skin to moisturize it because most oil free products had tons of oil and the sensitive skin products broke me out. I mean I really did almost give up hope by just resorting to hydrocortisone cream as my moisturizer (which still had mineral oil in it but..hey it worked). Well I&#x27;m glad to say that those day are gone! This moisturizer by Trader Joe&#x27;s is like the answer to my prayers. Its light and don&#x27;t break my skin out..not to mention that its paraben and fragrance free. It says oil free but if I apply too much it will turn my face into an oil slick but applied in moderation I am good to go. I do recommend this to people with skin types like mine but just mindful of how much you use.</li>
            <li> Bought this at local trader joes. I have oily skin and this is oil free and sinks right in. I had tried the Mary Kay Botanicals lotion for more $ and had to quit that kind cause it breaks me out. This however is amazing and such a great price. I pretty much only use lotion in the late fall winter months cause thats the only time my skin feels a bit dry so I got this and it makes my skin so soft and glowing and no breakouts, actually I think its antioxidants are helping with breakouts cause i seem to have less blackheads too. Im so happy I found this product cause burts bees is much less product and allot more money.. thats what I used last year. would definately recomend for oily but dry in winter skin type!</li>
            <li> The only moisturizer I can put on that wont give me pimples. Light and refreshing and does not clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this since it is oil free and it leaves my skin nice and smooth but it still clogged up my pores and I ended up with acne breakout.</li>
            <li> Pretty bummed that I didn&#x27;t realize this has no SPF at all.</li>
            <li> Not sure what this photo is.  It is not a photo of the product I ordered but the product was good and didn&#x27;t cause problems with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I just bought my second bottle of this product on my lunch break today. It is non-greasy and absorbs quickly, but leaves your skin soft and feeling moisturized. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is searching for a high-quality, low-cost everyday under-make-up moisturizer. I&#x27;m a product snob, but not into wasting money. I&#x27;ve tried far more expensive daily mositurizers (Clarins, Clinique, Lancome, Bare Escentuals) and this little work horse is the best bang for the buck!</li>
            <li> I have worn and sworn by Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizer since I was 19 (a long time ago...).  Then they went and changed the original formula, to a &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; version (which I don&#x27;t like), so I was looking for other options.  I figured I wouldn&#x27;t lose much if tried Trader Joe&#x27;s and didn&#x27;t like it either, but I absolutely love it!  It moisturizes your skin without feeling greasy, and I swear you can almost feel the slight tingle of the antioxidants at work!  I, for one, actually appreciate the fact that it doesn&#x27;t contain sunscreen protection as it often causes your face to look washed out and &amp;#34;ghostly&amp;#34; in photographs.  Beyond that, I have sensitive skin and have to be careful of chemical sunscreens, so if I&#x27;m going to be outdoors, I pick the level of SPF I need and apply on top of the moisturizer.  It works great.</li>
            <li> If you are allergic to shea butter, do not order this product!</li>
            <li> not irritating to face, love it</li>
            <li> I purchased this item at my local Trader Joe&#x27;s store. It is a decent enough moisturizer, I tend to have oilier skin and as this is oil free, it didn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy, but really made no difference at all. However, both the packaging and in store signage list this product as being vegan. Upon closer inspection, there are at least three ingredients which are not vegan. Very disappointed that I had to discover this on my own and that there was no notification in the stores or online about this, they just changed the packaging and tried to pretend it never happened.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. Not greasy or oily so my skin does not break out!</li>
            <li> my teenage granddaughter, having to use acne medicine that makes her skin dry, loves this! We are both delighted. thank you</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great. I normally use dermalogica active moist, but was looking for a cheaper option. This stuff is awesome, it offers great bang for your buck, is oil free, and is light but still packs in a lot of moisture! I use this every morning, and every other evening. I also use a thicker cream every other night because of the icky, cold weather that keeps my skin tight, and dry. I love this stuff, and because I do not have a Trader Joe&#x27;s close I&#x27;m glad I found it. Worth every penny, and more.</li>
            <li> surprisingly, all of my acnes were treated since I used this product! (except acne scars) It feels littlebit dry when first I apply this product, but it smoothly absorbed to my skin. Large size, cheap price, don&#x27;t cause acne. perfect product.</li>
            <li> Applied this right after washing my face and it really goes on smooth and you wont have to put more on later as it leaves your skin very moisturized and no oily/greasy feeling either.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Despite the label shown in this description, this is not vegan.  I ordered and when I received it, the back label was different.  It has hydrolyzed silk in it.  It is cruelty free, but if you are looking for a vegan product, look somewhere else.</li>
            <li> My son tells me it hydrates his skin without breakouts or an oily feel.</li>
            <li> An average face lotion as it did not do anything special for my skin. You do get a fairly good amount for the price which is one of the pros. It&#x27;s very light weight and has not broken me out or clogged my pores. Wish it also came with a SPF version so it could be used in summer days during day time.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled...it was sort of weirdly textured and didn&#x27;t feel nice in my face.  I am not really sure that it did anything at all.  It doesn&#x27;t moisturize, that&#x27;s for sure.  Save your money on this one.</li>
            <li> So far so good... Does what it is supposed to do.. Works well with the face wash.. Smell is way better then the face wash</li>
            <li> I have allergies, sensitive skinand eyes and I think I&#x27;ve tried every moisturizer on the market. This is the best. It is soothing, and seems to have cleared a rash on my face. I absolutely recommend it to every one. Reasonably priced, comes in a cute little bottle  too. It goes on like silk and makes my face soft and supple. Great buy.&lt;br /&gt;Judy</li>
            <li> I am definitely a skin care junkie, I work for a dermatologist in Scottsdale Az, I have used some of the best products out there , skinmedica, skin ceuticals , nia, even department store brands, or kiehls, recently I ran out of my daytime moisturizer and was away from home, picked this up at a local trader joes. This product is a gem!, who would have thought, my skin looks great:)...it&#x27;s a basic moisturizer but for the price packs a punch , loaded with antioxidants and botanicals.... I get complimented on my skin all the time and laugh to myself at my little trader joes find:).. Buy it , your skin will thank you!</li>
