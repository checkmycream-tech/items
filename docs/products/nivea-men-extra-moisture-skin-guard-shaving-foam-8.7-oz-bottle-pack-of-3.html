            <li>makes this a solid win win.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The scent is also quite pleasant, and attracts the right attention, but it is more subdued than aggressive in strength.</li>
            <li>The Nivea Foam has a much better feel to it.</li>
            <li>Husband and grown sons love this product.</li>
            <li>my daughter uses most often.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping, great customer service</li>
            <li>Better than Gillette shaving creams</li>
            <li>The thing I like the most is that it DOES NOT clog my razor.</li>
            <li>Make sure you shake it-</li>
            <li>not for me gel works better</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it but love Nivea</li>
            <li>Great foam, lasts a long time and smells good.</li>
            <li>I love this product for the price and how easy it washes off of my Dollar Shave Club razor,</li>
            <li>Better than the cheap Edge products for sure.</li>
            <li>Foams up really well for a good close shave.</li>
            <li>Nice and foamy and smells clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m very happy with the performance of this foam.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t drip or run.</li>
            <li>easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Foam goes on easy.</li>
            <li>, otherwise you will mostly get a liquid that does not work as well as the full on foam.</li>
            <li>Nivea For Men&#x27;s Extra Moisture Shaving Foam is a moderately effective product, but does not distinguish itself like the company&#x27;s shaving gel products which are exceptional in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>and it works fine, but</li>
            <li>That said I am a huge fan of Nivea products and at the price I can get them here and avoid the store</li>
            <li>Easy clean up.</li>
            <li>While I miss gel, I do admit that the foam does provide a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>What more could i say thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Really nice cream that leaves my husbands skin super soft and smooth</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the product&#x27;s scent is appealing, it spreads reasonably well, and the price seems competitive for shaving product standards.  </li>
            <li>My husband has sensitive skin and this is working great for him so far!</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Extra Moisture Shaving Foam is one of such awesome products.</li>
            <li>Cannot recommend this more highly.</li>
            <li>the gel is much more cost effective as you use less and it lasts longer.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few months and it works great.</li>
            <li>It leaves them soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Years ago (in a greedy hunger for higher profits with no concern for consumers and product quality) manufacturers began watering down the great invention of shaving gels.</li>
            <li>3-pack priced right.</li>
            <li>I bought the 12 pack, and it was a real bargain too!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was satisfied with my purchase however, just not as amazed as I am with Nivea&#x27;s Shaving Gel products.</li>
            <li>great product; thick foam, smells pleasing.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>and I purchased a lot of it because I wasn&#x27;t able to find it in local stores.</li>
            <li>Smells a little masculine for my taste, but is a good shaving cream.</li>
            <li>All I got to say is, too much foam.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the foam, would&#x27;ve rather had gel.</li>
            <li>Too much foam comes out at once, and the foam doesn&#x27;t really lubricate well the skin/facial hair.</li>
            <li>Frequently the foam will not come out properly aerated, and is more liquid than foam.</li>
            <li>Super smooth and made shaving less of a chore...</li>
            <li>Much like older style shave cream.</li>
            <li>While this doesn&#x27;t really affect the overall shave, it seems to make you use a lot more of the product to cover the same area.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, very light and airy.</li>
            <li>This product creates very good and smooth lather that keeps facial skin wet and soft during shave, and does not dry out quickly like few other foam products in the market.</li>
            <li>Got to use more than usual.</li>
            <li>so soft n silky!</li>
            <li>If you like menthol (and you significant other does too), then go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gels began coming out pumped with more air and less gel and cans didn&#x27;t last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Wanted to try both the moisturizing and the sensitive gel.</li>
            <li>So far, I prefer the Nivea gel and would recommend this as an alternative to the cream.</li>
            <li>It has a masculine fragrance to it that I don&#x27;t mind.  </li>
            <li>He said that it was a lot better than a few of the other brands he has tried.</li>
            <li>Having a sensitive face can definitely be a bummer when having to regularly shave.  </li>
            <li>The longer, thinner can packs much easier in my travel kit and likewise takes less space on the bathroom counter at home.</li>
            <li>In particular, I don&#x27;t get the same amount of protection against irritation and nicks as I do with other products.  </li>
            <li>I am very particular about my shaving cream since I shave everyday.</li>

            <li> He has sensitive skin and must shave every day due to his profession.  </li>
            <li> Lasts long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fortunately, Nivea Shaving Foam is a thick, creamy foam that is an improvement on older foams and stomps on the weak modern big name gels.</li>
            <li> I was getting constant razor burn from the gel version, but little to none now using the OG foam.</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just have to remember that a little can go a long way!</li>
            <li> The cream has volume and validity that has a fullness that cheaper and other shaving creams seem to be leaning towards.  </li>
            <li> Product pours as a liquid mess with minimal aeration.</li>
            <li> I mean, honestly... would anyone actually write a bad review for a pack of shaving cream!?</li>
            <li> I love the scent and texture of the shaving foam, but I hate the nozzle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got cut less with this product, I&#x27;ll give it that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, find something with a bit less odor.</li>
            <li> It remains thick and foamy unlike certain other national brands that often become very thin and watery.</li>
            <li> I tossed all three units in the waste can.</li>
            <li> not really sure what to put here ...</li>
            <li> Just too thin and doesn&#x27;t get a close shave</li>
            <li> The shaving gel has always felt cold to me.</li>
            <li> Thin, watery worst then the cheapest discount store shave creams.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> worthless --- gave it to neighbors kids to use on Halloween.</li>
            <li> oh very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I must say  that this is the worst shaving cream that I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Awful</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I used to use the extra moisturizer gel version of Nivea, but after trying the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; foam version I am going to have to switch to the OG. I was getting constant razor burn from the gel version, but little to none now using the OG foam. The scent is also quite pleasant, and attracts the right attention, but it is more subdued than aggressive in strength. I bought the 12 pack, and it was a real bargain too!</li>
            <li> I must say  that this is the worst shaving cream that I have ever used! I tossed all three units in the waste can.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the scent. In the end, that&#x27;s all that matters? Leaves my skin moist.</li>
            <li> The shaving gel has always felt cold to me. The Nivea Foam has a much better feel to it. Light and fluffy.</li>
            <li> All I got to say is, too much foam. Got to use more than usual. I&#x27;ve got cut less with this product, I&#x27;ll give it that.</li>
            <li> Great price!  Husband and grown sons love this product.</li>

            <li> Great Price Great Product Great Service !!! What more could i say thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for: a shaving cream that remains moist while I shave so I am not splashing water on and removing the shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months and it works great. I was having an allergic reaction to Edge shave gel. Note this comes out as a foam and not a gel. Much like older style shave cream.</li>
            <li> Works well for a man or a woman</li>
            <li> Awesome product! One of my husband daily items that are a must!</li>
            <li> I prefer foam over gel, and the Nivea shaving foam is superior to any competing brands. It remains thick and foamy unlike certain other national brands that often become very thin and watery. Has a great smell. The longer, thinner can packs much easier in my travel kit and likewise takes less space on the bathroom counter at home. I buy six at a time. Cannot recommend this more highly.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. 3-pack priced right. Foam goes on easy. Moisturizes my beard. Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy, very light and airy. The thing I like the most is that it DOES NOT clog my razor. As I shave, I see the foam and cut hairs, pushed through the back side of the razor. Easy clean up. Definitely will buy again!!</li>
            <li> Thought I would go back to foam. While I miss gel, I do admit that the foam does provide a comfortable shave. Just have to remember that a little can go a long way!</li>
            <li> I use this to shave my legs. It leaves them soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Nivea For Men&#x27;s Extra Moisture Shaving Foam is a moderately effective product, but does not distinguish itself like the company&#x27;s shaving gel products which are exceptional in my opinion.  In particular, I don&#x27;t get the same amount of protection against irritation and nicks as I do with other products.  This might not necessarily be this product&#x27;s fault given it is shaving foam vs. gel however.  Otherwise, the product&#x27;s scent is appealing, it spreads reasonably well, and the price seems competitive for shaving product standards.  Overall, I was satisfied with my purchase however, just not as amazed as I am with Nivea&#x27;s Shaving Gel products.</li>
            <li> Just too thin and doesn&#x27;t get a close shave</li>
            <li> best thing since sliced bread</li>
            <li> I love this product for the price and how easy it washes off of my Dollar Shave Club razor,</li>
            <li> Not just for men.....makes my skin so soft n silky! It&#x27;s Great n I love it!</li>
            <li> I shave my head every 2-3 days, and need a shave cream/foam vs. a gel for protection as well as application. This foam does not get runny, and stays in place while I shave. I love the scent and texture of the shaving foam, but I hate the nozzle. Frequently the foam will not come out properly aerated, and is more liquid than foam. While this doesn&#x27;t really affect the overall shave, it seems to make you use a lot more of the product to cover the same area. Other than that, I&#x27;m very happy with the performance of this foam.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND IS A FAN! works great, leaves skin smooth</li>
            <li> Brilliant used it for years</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  Thin, watery worst then the cheapest discount store shave creams.  So far, I prefer the Nivea gel and would recommend this as an alternative to the cream.</li>
            <li> Make sure you shake it- I&#x27;ve been using gel for years and forgot that with foam you have to shake it, otherwise you will mostly get a liquid that does not work as well as the full on foam.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the foam, would&#x27;ve rather had gel. But it works well...</li>
            <li> great product; thick foam, smells pleasing.</li>
            <li> Ummm...yeah this works too. All around lets me shave. So that is nice.</li>
            <li> not for me gel works better</li>
            <li> This works great, but the smell is a bit over-whelming. If you like menthol (and you significant other does too), then go for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, find something with a bit less odor.</li>
            <li> Too much foam comes out at once, and the foam doesn&#x27;t really lubricate well the skin/facial hair. I would stick to a gel.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite!  He has sensitive skin and must shave every day due to his profession.  No irritation.</li>
            <li> Years ago (in a greedy hunger for higher profits with no concern for consumers and product quality) manufacturers began watering down the great invention of shaving gels. Gels began coming out pumped with more air and less gel and cans didn&#x27;t last as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, Nivea Shaving Foam is a thick, creamy foam that is an improvement on older foams and stomps on the weak modern big name gels.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well. I am very particular about my shaving cream since I shave everyday. It is of the ways I can treat myself.</li>
            <li> Great foam, lasts a long time and smells good.</li>
            <li> I bought a 3 pack for my husband and he loves this. He said that it was a lot better than a few of the other brands he has tried. My husband has sensitive skin and this is working great for him so far!</li>
            <li> Better than the cheap Edge products for sure. Give it a try</li>
            <li> I like the foam and it works fine, but the gel is much more cost effective as you use less and it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> product is Foam... not Gel.  worthless --- gave it to neighbors kids to use on Halloween.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion before.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love shaving cream!?  I mean, honestly... would anyone actually write a bad review for a pack of shaving cream!?</li>
            <li> Quite happy with this product.  Smells great, works great, and very happy with the price.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it but love Nivea</li>
            <li> Good shaving cream.  Leaves skin soft and smooth.  Got it for my guy but I use too.  It has a masculine fragrance to it that I don&#x27;t mind.  A little of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Good stuff ... and I purchased a lot of it because I wasn&#x27;t able to find it in local stores.</li>
            <li> not really sure what to put here ... it&#x27;s shave cream. It helps my face when I shave.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Having a sensitive face can definitely be a bummer when having to regularly shave.  That said I am a huge fan of Nivea products and at the price I can get them here and avoid the store makes this a solid win win.  The cream has volume and validity that has a fullness that cheaper and other shaving creams seem to be leaning towards.  I use this for both my electric and manual shaves.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for this product , this gel foams great and gives you a great shave.</li>
            <li> Nivea makes great men&#x27;s products and Nivea Men Extra Moisture Shaving Foam is one of such awesome products. I always prefer Nivea products for shave. This product creates very good and smooth lather that keeps facial skin wet and soft during shave, and does not dry out quickly like few other foam products in the market.</li>
            <li> Great foam! The best!</li>
            <li> Nivea products have been my standard for almost a decade.  Shaving cream, aftershave, men&#x27;s face wash.  Amazon seems to have the best package pricing, so stocking up is easy and reasonable.</li>
            <li> Lasts long. Great shave</li>
            <li> Smells a little masculine for my taste, but is a good shaving cream.</li>
