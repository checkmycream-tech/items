            <li>It also really weighed my hair down and did make it soft like some other reviews claimed.  </li>

            <li> This does wonders for blonde colored dry frizzy hair!!</li>
            <li> The directions say to use it once a week - but at the price, maybe every other week.</li>
            <li> This product, used with other Pureology products marginally improved my split ends.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy or weighted down.</li>
            <li> I have tried other masks from Pureology in the past as well.</li>
            <li> I use a hair dryer on it every day - so it tends to get dried out.</li>
            <li> i won;t waste my money again.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this product - but it was VERY expensive in the salon.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Had tried a sample pack of this and it was wonderful, however the product that I received when I ordered did not have the same effect.</li>
            <li> I still have to use all the leave-in conditioners and treatments by Pureology.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it has really helped my damaged hair!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this product - but it was VERY expensive in the salon. I tried a sample and then had to buy it. Amazon is by far cheaper than the salon price!!! I have baby fine hair and it is permed. I use a hair dryer on it every day - so it tends to get dried out. I used the sample - put it on after shampooing, wait 5 minutes then rinse. My hair was soft and shiney and absolutely wonderful. I love this stuff. I bought some for myself and my daughter (color treated hair). The directions say to use it once a week - but at the price, maybe every other week. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy or weighted down. Just soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> This is just liek the strength shampoo which I love, but it a lot more in cost and I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair. i won;t waste my money again. i will just continue to use teh conditioner.</li>
            <li> seriously a great product especially if you have damaged or over processed hair!</li>
            <li> I like this mask live my hair soooooo soft</li>
            <li> Love this mask! I have tried other masks from Pureology in the past as well. I purchased the shampoo and conditioner for this line as well and love it all. My hair is getting healthier and has grown significantly since I have started using it! Love Pureology</li>
            <li> This product, used with other Pureology products marginally improved my split ends.</li>
            <li> Hair looks and feels much healthier after using this product. I&#x27;ve been using it once a week for about a month, along with the shampoo and conditioner of the same line.</li>
            <li> I have super curly blonde hair. I do a treatment every week. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Really makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Leaves my hair so soft and manageable!!</li>
            <li> The Pureology range of products are excellent. I have been using this products for 2 weeks and no little hair fall. A must buy</li>
            <li> amazing mask!!!&lt;br /&gt;In the first use makes your hair healthier&lt;br /&gt;super fast delivery!&lt;br /&gt;Great seller!</li>
            <li> Love, love love this stuff</li>
            <li> This is a very good hair treatment, but way too expensive for size of the jar.</li>
            <li> For the price, I wasn&#x27;t that impressed</li>
            <li> This does wonders for blonde colored dry frizzy hair!! I swear by it!</li>
            <li> Definitely not as good as the Pureology Hydrate Optimum Moisture Hair Masque, nor does it smell as good either.  It&#x27;s an ok product; not recommended for restoration, if anything it&#x27;s more of just a de-tangler.  Will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> After one use, I&#x27;m returning this mask.  It smells powdery like an old lady or public restroom hand soap (you know the kind, bleh).  It also really weighed my hair down and did make it soft like some other reviews claimed.  I use the Pureology Hydrate shampoo and Hydrate Light conditioner, which I love (weightless moisture for my fine color-treated hair).  This mask just doesn&#x27;t do it for me, and I will look for another strengthening treatment.</li>
