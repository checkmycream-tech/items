            <li>Buying more.</li>
            <li>They are soft and comfy and very warm.</li>
            <li>Insoles were easily cut to adjust to my riding boots.</li>
            <li>They were easy to trim to size.</li>
            <li>easy to use, was easy to fit shoe size and was nice to give my shoes a fresh start.</li>
            <li>They are not exactly thick or plush, but for the price they are good, and work well inside shoes.</li>
            <li>Easy to cut to fit any shoes as described.</li>
            <li>Can be easily cut to fit.  </li>
            <li>Affordable and comfortable.</li>
            <li>So for they are comfortable</li>
            <li>and these are fantastic in my shoes.  </li>
            <li>I cut the insoles to fit and they give a noticeable padding effect that was not there before.  </li>
            <li>These will spruce up any shoe that’s getting up there in age and is not so comfortable anymore…highly recommended.</li>
            <li>So cheap and not sheep&#x27;s wool and the cut</li>
            <li>They make your tiny bit too big boots feel warm toasty and amazing!!!</li>
            <li>Easy to cut to size and so soft feeling in shoes!</li>
            <li>I have had them in about 2 weeks and the durability is fine so far.  </li>
            <li>Just cut to fit shoe size and insert directly over your shoe&#x27;s insole.  </li>
            <li>But the best thing is that they are just thick enough to be comfortable but not so thick that your shoe doesn’t fit anymore.  </li>
            <li>They take up about as much space as a Dr. Scholl&#x27;s foam insole.</li>
            <li>sweating much better than any other insole.</li>
            <li>These keep my feet warm in my thin soled boots without bulking them up too much.</li>
            <li>I bought these insoles to give my slippers a new soft inside.</li>
            <li>These did not but so far haven&#x27;t shifted out of place.</li>
            <li>Thin and didn&#x27;t hold up very good,iI&#x27;m going to spend a little bit more money next time and get some better ones that will last longer.</li>
            <li>They are pretty thin but really help with warmth.</li>
            <li>That is a big problem with some of the thicker sheepskin insoles, that will only work in a boot, really, without making the shoe so tight that your feet feel like they’re under lots of pressure.  </li>

            <li> They are soft and comfy, and not too thick so they do not take up too much space, especially since my Whooga boots do not have removable inner soles.  </li>
            <li> They do not make your shoes feel tight and you don&#x27;t have to remove your shoes inner sole.  </li>
            <li> These are just what I expected.</li>
            <li> There is no sign of the insoles slipping yet, but if they do, I have some “gorilla” double-sided tape that I will use to hold them in place.  </li>
            <li> Basically they are not worth buying.</li>
            <li> Also they are not wide enough in the boot so this is a bit uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> but it’s getting so thin in spots that I can almost see bare leather.  </li>
            <li> THey might make feet a little warmer but they absorb (or prevent)</li>
            <li> fit guide line is totally off very disgusted</li>
            <li> cozy and warm....easy to cut to size</li>
            <li> Some insoles have small sticky tabs to keep the insoles in place.</li>
            <li> Had I used the cut-to-fit guide, the insoles would have been way too small.</li>
            <li> Well, at least they feel comfy-cozy, whatever they&#x27;re made of.</li>
            <li> Havering to ware dress shoes in the winter can be rough, my feet were always cold.</li>
            <li> They are very thin and not very warm.  </li>
            <li> Also very thin.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my boots and they are very thin.</li>
            <li> I used to suffer horribly from foot pain but no more.  </li>
            <li> very unhappy with this product.</li>

            <li> I purchased these for my mother and she loves them!</li>
            <li> These are just what I expected. They are not exactly thick or plush, but for the price they are good, and work well inside shoes.</li>
            <li> Nice that you get 2 pair, and easy to cut to size. These keep my feet warm in my thin soled boots without bulking them up too much.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Easy to cut to size and so soft feeling in shoes!</li>
            <li> Affordable and comfortable. I use these in flats. THey might make feet a little warmer but they absorb (or prevent) sweating much better than any other insole. Buying more.</li>
            <li> These insoles crumbled up into pieces within 2 weeks in my boots. very unhappy with this product. Also very thin.</li>
            <li> easy to use, was easy to fit shoe size and was nice to give my shoes a fresh start. They made my feet dryer and warmer</li>
            <li> Insoles were easily cut to adjust to my riding boots. Since they are wool, I was hoping they would keep my feet warmer in 0 temperatures that remained throughout winter. Some insoles have small sticky tabs to keep the insoles in place. These did not but so far haven&#x27;t shifted out of place.</li>
            <li> So for they are comfortable but I just put them in yesterday and do not know if they are going to be durable.</li>
            <li> I placed a pair of these insoles in my winter slippers.  They are very thin and not very warm.  Within a week they started to come apart.  Only one month later and I have ordered a different pair to replace them.  The layers have come apart, edges folded over, the backing has come off.  Basically they are not worth buying.</li>
            <li> I have Morton&#x27;s nueroma  and these are fantastic in my shoes.  I used to suffer horribly from foot pain but no more.  I have these in every pair of shoes I own and love them.  They do not make your shoes feel tight and you don&#x27;t have to remove your shoes inner sole.  Just cut to fit shoe size and insert directly over your shoe&#x27;s insole.  That simple.  You will not regret buying them.  Even my Mom is using them.</li>
            <li> These are great!  I used them for a pair of indoor/outdoor slippers I have.  The insides of the slippers have a fuzzy sheepskin-like interior but it’s getting so thin in spots that I can almost see bare leather.  The outsides of the slippers are in great shape so there is no need to discard them so soon.  I cut the insoles to fit and they give a noticeable padding effect that was not there before.  But the best thing is that they are just thick enough to be comfortable but not so thick that your shoe doesn’t fit anymore.  That is a big problem with some of the thicker sheepskin insoles, that will only work in a boot, really, without making the shoe so tight that your feet feel like they’re under lots of pressure.  There is no sign of the insoles slipping yet, but if they do, I have some “gorilla” double-sided tape that I will use to hold them in place.  These will spruce up any shoe that’s getting up there in age and is not so comfortable anymore…highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These did work perfectly to replace the insole of a pair of slippers - about a month ago. The wooly stuff under the toes is already wearing off.  Additionally, DO NOT trust the sizing guide on the back of these. I wear a women&#x27;s 8.5. I used an existing insole to measure the proper size, which equated to the markings for a men&#x27;s 10.  Had I used the cut-to-fit guide, the insoles would have been way too small.</li>
            <li> This is crap !!! So cheap and not sheep&#x27;s wool and the cut fit guide line is totally off very disgusted</li>
            <li> Want these for all my shoes they are so nice</li>
            <li> Services for You Two-pair Cut-to-fit Adjusting Wool Insole One Size Fits All for Women and Men&lt;br /&gt;This product is very good, I would like to buy more! Good!</li>
            <li> These say they&#x27;re made of wool in the listing, but the packaging has no information. Guess you get what you pay for! Well, at least they feel comfy-cozy, whatever they&#x27;re made of.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my boots and they are very thin. Also they are not wide enough in the boot so this is a bit uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Havering to ware dress shoes in the winter can be rough, my feet were always cold. I saw these and figured I&#x27;d give them a shot, and oh boy what a difference. I got them for all my dress shoes and boots, even my hiking shoes and there was an immediate difference.</li>
            <li> These add a nice warm cushioned layer in my snow boots!</li>
            <li> These do their job and keep my feet nice and warm.</li>
            <li> These were awesome! I used them in dress boots and shoes. They are pretty thin but really help with warmth. They take up about as much space as a Dr. Scholl&#x27;s foam insole.</li>

            <li> cozy and warm....easy to cut to size</li>
            <li> Can be easily cut to fit.  They give you a cardboard template to help in this.  They are soft and comfy, and not too thick so they do not take up too much space, especially since my Whooga boots do not have removable inner soles.  I have had them in about 2 weeks and the durability is fine so far.  I just wear my boots around the house like slippers.</li>
