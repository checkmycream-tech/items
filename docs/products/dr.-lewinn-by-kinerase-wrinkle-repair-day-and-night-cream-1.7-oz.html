            <li>Awesome and arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>I think this eye cream is ok!</li>
            <li>LOVE this line of drugstore skin care!</li>

            <li>Nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My face stays nice and moisturized during the night.  </li>
            <li>Great product:) I love the day and nite moisturizer as its not greasy or full of SPF!</li>
            <li>I originally bought the Kinerase Restructure Firming Cream on Amazon for $60 and absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>My skin also looks more wrinkly than before I started using this cream including the area under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I stopped using it my skin started looking better.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Gets the job done okay.</li>
            <li>Liked it so much</li>
            <li>This is a really rich face cream.  </li>
            <li>but really good - especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good for my face - not EPIC like the original Kinerase -</li>
            <li>moisturizer is light weight, has a nice citrus scent, and absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot speak to the wrinkle aspects as I do not have wrinkles yet, but I will continue to use this as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and most lotions and creams</li>
            <li>I thought since it was &amp;#34;by Kinerase&amp;#34; I should have good results like with the other cream.</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative for the much more expensive Kinerase lotion.  </li>
            <li>Love this face cream, ordered on a Friday, received on following Monday.</li>
            <li>I have what I think are deep laugh lines along with fine lines that come with age.  </li>
            <li>There was a noticable difference in the appearance of my skin and how much firmer it looked.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll just suck it up and spend the $100 on the Restructure Firming Cream since I know it works really well for me.</li>
            <li>I have really puffy eyes</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 42 and have had problem skin my whole life.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin so much clearer and smoother and can do without makeup when going to do my grocery shopping.</li>
            <li>I is VERY moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>so it works really well for me.</li>
            <li>this is pretty much a ok moisturizer that helps somewhat with puffyness but not enough I gave it a chance with a few bottles.</li>
            <li>I expected no problems, i shredded the packaging, opened the product box, a bit crushed, and the tube did not feel full, didn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li>This surprised me since this is supposed to be a moisturizer.</li>

            <li> I originally bought the Kinerase Restructure Firming Cream on Amazon for $60 and absolutely loved it.  My problem area is around my mouth and chin.  I have what I think are deep laugh lines along with fine lines that come with age.  There was a noticable difference in the appearance of my skin and how much firmer it looked.  When I started to run low Amazon didn&#x27;t offer it anymore and other places wanted $100 which I thought was too pricey.  I read the good reviews on here and decided to try this cream.  I thought since it was &amp;#34;by Kinerase&amp;#34; I should have good results like with the other cream. It has been a total waste of money for me. My skin has become very dry and flaky.  This surprised me since this is supposed to be a moisturizer. My skin also looks more wrinkly than before I started using this cream including the area under my eyes.  I have never had a problem in that area before using this product.  As soon as I stopped using it my skin started looking better.  I think I&#x27;ll just suck it up and spend the $100 on the Restructure Firming Cream since I know it works really well for me.</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer. Wish it had sum screen</li>
            <li> I think this eye cream is ok! It is less than fifteen dollars so you get what you pay for. I Get upset for the fact there are so many things that are facial creams to under eye creams that have FAKE REVIEWS!! I never know what to belive! I bought three bottles of this it lasts about a month. this is pretty much a ok moisturizer that helps somewhat with puffyness but not enough I gave it a chance with a few bottles. I said forget it why waste the money of junk. I have really puffy eyes and it&#x27;s even worse when I don&#x27;t get enough sleep. I now use Lancome de puffy rolly eye cream!! I love it it&#x27;s 70 dollars and lasts about 2 months well with money!!</li>
            <li> Love this face cream, ordered on a Friday, received on following Monday. Thanks</li>
            <li> This is a really rich face cream.  Not greasy!  It feels great on my face and I like the way my make up goes on over it.  My face stays nice and moisturized during the night.  I did find this particular cream hard to find even on line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stands right up with the expensive creams I have used in the past.  I also like the under eye cream a lot.  It does seem to help the dark shadows.</li>
            <li> No results yet, but it&#x27;s only been a couple of days.</li>
            <li> As always wonderful, feels great on my skin</li>
            <li> Great product:) I love the day and nite moisturizer as its not greasy or full of SPF! I also would recommend Dr. Lewinn Kinerase under eye recovery as it lightened my under eye circles quite a bit !</li>
            <li> It was for my wife ,she said she likes it ,said she would purchase it again.Gets the job done okay.</li>
            <li> Awesome and arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> Borrowed this from my mom when I forgot my moisturizer at home. Liked it so much I night a tube of my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is light weight, has a nice citrus scent, and absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot speak to the wrinkle aspects as I do not have wrinkles yet, but I will continue to use this as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative for the much more expensive Kinerase lotion.  It&#x27;s really good for my face - not EPIC like the original Kinerase - but really good - especially for the price.  I have really sensitive skin and most lotions and creams make me break out or just make my skin feel greasy or bumpy, but this feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> great stuff at a great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 42 and have had problem skin my whole life.  This moisturizing cream is very thick but does NOT feel heavy on my skin.  I often break out when using moisturizers, but have NOT with this product!  LOVE this line of drugstore skin care!</li>
            <li> This left my skin looking worse not better even though I stuck through the entire tube.</li>
            <li> Happy with the product. Works amazing</li>
            <li> Very happy with the cream.  Makes my skin so much clearer and smoother and can do without makeup when going to do my grocery shopping.</li>
            <li> I like it.  This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered it.  I is VERY moisturizing.  My skin is very dry so it works really well for me.</li>
            <li> I expected no problems, i shredded the packaging, opened the product box, a bit crushed, and the tube did not feel full, didn&#x27;t seem right. I opened the tube and there was no safety seal over the inner cap. This should never had been sent out. Never again!</li>
