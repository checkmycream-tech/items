            <li>I have tried numerous, and this one has the best smell, hold, and texture.</li>
            <li>so I buy in bulk from Amazon :)</li>

            <li>I love this hairspray and will never use anything else.  </li>
            <li>This is the only hairspray that I have come across with a good scent, great holding power, and the ability to not stick all of your hairs together and get hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product has been my favorite for many years.  </li>
            <li>Love the citrus fragrance more than anything.</li>
            <li>It holds okay.</li>
            <li>I have used numerous hairsprays over the years and this is one of, if not, the best!</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li>love the product even in Mo. humidity</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a TIGI girl, but Masterpiece is probably my favorite product.</li>

            <li>Just love this hairspray and the smell.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this smells</li>
            <li>Tresemme works  better  </li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s dry, it&#x27;s shiny and most of all it smells great!  </li>
            <li>It really does add an impeccable shine ans</li>
            <li>I have short, fine hair and this hairspray is perfect.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp or make my head itch and to find it online at a price I can afford is awesome!</li>
            <li>It smells great and has a great hold that isn&#x27;t too stiff but not too flexible either.</li>
            <li>I love touchable smooth hair, and this hairspray can&#x27;t give me that.</li>
            <li>It brushes out so easily.</li>
            <li>Buy this spray if you want a crunchy, strong hold, just like with Rave harispray.</li>
            <li>My hair is even in very good condition, however this product did dry it out.</li>
            <li>The application is fine and convenient.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a super hold hairspray but that&#x27;s what I love about it.</li>
            <li>Huge gobs of spray come out.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to find it for such a great price like I can here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Fabulous stuff.</li>
            <li>: spray ever so lightly, and wait a couple of minutes, and lightly run your fingers through your hair.</li>
            <li>It is light weight on your hair but keeps the hold of the style.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous hair spray.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to make it shiny and nice, but doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a flexible hold by no means, but it&#x27;s just what my frizzy/wavy hair needs to tame the fly aways!</li>
            <li>It holds well without being super sticky and brushes out easily.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this hairspray at first because it holds super well, almost too much at times but overall it is a great spray with a nice scent</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite hairspray!  </li>
            <li>Smells so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>The smell is great, a bit fruity and not chemical or strange.</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase this product on this site for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>been using this product for a while, love it, goes on nice and light but has enough hold, would recommend it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong but not ridiculously stiff-feeling&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li>This is by far my most fav hair spray!  </li>
            <li>Works great without stickiness or weighing down my fine hair.</li>
            <li>it is not stiff and has a nice perfume.</li>
            <li>I love Bed Head hair products, but for my bleached hair this hair spray really didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not a bad hairspray.</li>
            <li>I NEVER thought I&#x27;d be willing to pay this much for hairspray, but I can honestly say it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>I have tried so many so called \\&quot;Super\\&quot; and \\&quot;Freeze\\&quot; sprays that will not hold my volumnous style for more than 5 minutes, including Paul Mitchell&#x27;s with the red cap.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I am not in love with this but cannot find an alternative to Bumble and Bumble classic hairspray.</li>
            <li>Works very well!!</li>
            <li>Very well priced, came on time and huge bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all and Masterpiece always wins.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, the hold is medium, it keeps hair in place but isn&#x27;t stiff unless you&#x27;re specifically looking for that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years, and have tried some other hairsprays as well, but this is the best because&lt;</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a long time and love this hairspray!</li>
            <li>However, I still don&#x27;t know if its the right hair spray for me.</li>
            <li>I am sure to order extra to keep my shelf stocked</li>
            <li>the first time I attempted to hold the spray piece in.....</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Product exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I use several TIGI products that I love.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what it says...</li>
            <li>I have used this hair spray for the last couple of years and I love it.</li>
            <li>Bed Head really deserves the five star rating with Masterpiece!  </li>
            <li>My hair stylist was the first to use this on my hair.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the nozzle gets caked, so you have to run hot water over it to de-clog the spout.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly buy it aain.</li>
            <li>I think I have found my new hairspray!!</li>
            <li>Maybe too much hold to use as working spray.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li>Excels in gentle hold with added shine..</li>
            <li>All it really does is make your hair smell like bubble gum.</li>
            <li>Seems to really help control the oily scalp issue, too, so I don&#x27;t have to shampoo as often as I used</li>
            <li>I was looking for a hairspray that wouldn&#x27;t leave my hair crispy or be visible on my light blonde hair, but this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>I do use this when I really want a style to stay</li>
            <li>I am pretty picky and am very sensitive to scents when it comes to hairspray.</li>
            <li>with  more shine  for  less  money</li>
            <li>This spray is so expensive at my job, I was happy to find it up here so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>This hair spray works decently.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>This hairspray for high humidity areas.  </li>
            <li>Masterpiece spray has a fine mist, the hold is strong but not too stiff, doesn&#x27;t leave a white powdery finish, leaves your hair shiny.  </li>
            <li>You can comb through it once it dries and your hair feels normal.</li>
            <li>I use this instead of normal hairspray as it gives me that &amp;#34;piecey&amp;#34; look I have been searching for.  </li>
            <li>I will never use another hairspray and I was so glad to find it on Amazon, it&#x27;s half the price I&#x27;ve been paying!</li>
            <li>/rain since I live in GA and humidity is about 100% for 6 months of the year.</li>
            <li>I live in Houston.</li>
            <li>I live in New Jersey and the humidity here is the pits.</li>
            <li>TIGI Hard Head is also good and very similar to this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty comparable to any regular, drugstore brand hairspray.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and this stuff REALLY holds your style....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to reuse it a number of times throughout the day like I did with my old hair spray.</li>
            <li>Natural look, yet keeps it in place.  </li>
            <li>the scent - and the shine and natural hold.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is it is very hair spray scented</li>
            <li>I HAVE TRIED SO MANY HAIRSPRAYS AND WASTED MONEY AND KEEP COMING BACK TO THIS.</li>
            <li>My limp dull hair has literally been transformed by this stuff; now it actually looks thick, smooth, shiny and healthy --- way better than I thought my hair ever could.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, so a bottle lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comparable to Kenra 25, Redken&#x27;s Forceful 23, but not quite as strong as Sebastian&#x27;s Mega Hold which is hard for me to find.  </li>
            <li>have very long straight no-natural-body hair with an oily scalp to boot</li>
            <li>Actually, the Sebastian will leave a white finish if I accidentally spray too much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the very view hair care products I&#x27;ve found that actually delivers above and beyond what it promises.</li>
            <li>There is no other hairspray like this.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine, zero body, hard to hold hair and now that I&#x27;ve turned gray and color my hair</li>
            <li>I feel like I have to layer it to get a good hold on my hair, which isn&#x27;t thick, but when I do that my hair becomes hard and crunchy.</li>
            <li>It holds very well but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li>My husband ended up trying to switch the bad nozzles out wiht the one good spray bottle nozzle but it didn&#x27;t fix it 100%.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have fine curly hair and this spray works wonderfully for me.</li>
            <li> Just a light spraying all over my lacklustre mop in the morning gives it incredible body without any stiffness or stickiness at all and great shine that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It smells so good that people will ask you if they can come up and smell you&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> But it smells so good</li>
            <li> Light hold w/a great shine!  </li>
            <li> My stylist used it and I absolutely loved the scent....</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> Amazon is a good place to find this product and they have it for a good price.</li>

            <li> And it smells good as well</li>

            <li> I HAVE VERY FINE HAIR.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> I first experienced this hair spray at the salon where I get my hair cut and colored.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SPRAY.</li>
            <li> My favorite spray, and cheaper than salon price.</li>
            <li> I Love this Bed Head Masterpiece Hairspray.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this spray.</li>
            <li> I buy as many as I can at once.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous, and this one has the best smell, hold, and texture.</li>
            <li> so I buy in bulk from Amazon :)</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone, I love the product</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li> Love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li> I love this hairspray and will never use anything else.  </li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray that I have come across with a good scent, great holding power, and the ability to not stick all of your hairs together and get hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product has been my favorite for many years.  </li>
            <li> Love the citrus fragrance more than anything.</li>
            <li> It holds okay.</li>
            <li> I have used numerous hairsprays over the years and this is one of, if not, the best!</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  </li>
            <li> love the product even in Mo. humidity</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a TIGI girl, but Masterpiece is probably my favorite product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell</li>
            <li> Love this spray.  </li>
            <li> I love the hold.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> The hold is ok.</li>
            <li> Just love this hairspray and the smell.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this smells</li>
            <li> Tresemme works  better  </li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s dry, it&#x27;s shiny and most of all it smells great!  </li>
            <li> It really does add an impeccable shine ans</li>
            <li> I have short, fine hair and this hairspray is perfect.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp or make my head itch and to find it online at a price I can afford is awesome!</li>
            <li> It smells great and has a great hold that isn&#x27;t too stiff but not too flexible either.</li>
            <li> I love touchable smooth hair, and this hairspray can&#x27;t give me that.</li>
            <li> It brushes out so easily.</li>
            <li> Buy this spray if you want a crunchy, strong hold, just like with Rave harispray.</li>
            <li> My hair is even in very good condition, however this product did dry it out.</li>
            <li> The application is fine and convenient.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a super hold hairspray but that&#x27;s what I love about it.</li>
            <li> Huge gobs of spray come out.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find it for such a great price like I can here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Fabulous stuff.</li>
            <li> : spray ever so lightly, and wait a couple of minutes, and lightly run your fingers through your hair.</li>
            <li> It is light weight on your hair but keeps the hold of the style.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous hair spray.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to make it shiny and nice, but doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a flexible hold by no means, but it&#x27;s just what my frizzy/wavy hair needs to tame the fly aways!</li>
            <li> It holds well without being super sticky and brushes out easily.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this hairspray at first because it holds super well, almost too much at times but overall it is a great spray with a nice scent</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite hairspray!  </li>
            <li> Smells so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> The smell is great, a bit fruity and not chemical or strange.</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase this product on this site for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> been using this product for a while, love it, goes on nice and light but has enough hold, would recommend it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong but not ridiculously stiff-feeling&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> This is by far my most fav hair spray!  </li>
            <li> Works great without stickiness or weighing down my fine hair.</li>
            <li> it is not stiff and has a nice perfume.</li>
            <li> I love Bed Head hair products, but for my bleached hair this hair spray really didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not a bad hairspray.</li>
            <li> I NEVER thought I&#x27;d be willing to pay this much for hairspray, but I can honestly say it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> I have tried so many so called \\&quot;Super\\&quot; and \\&quot;Freeze\\&quot; sprays that will not hold my volumnous style for more than 5 minutes, including Paul Mitchell&#x27;s with the red cap.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I am not in love with this but cannot find an alternative to Bumble and Bumble classic hairspray.</li>
            <li> Works very well!!</li>
            <li> Very well priced, came on time and huge bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all and Masterpiece always wins.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, the hold is medium, it keeps hair in place but isn&#x27;t stiff unless you&#x27;re specifically looking for that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years, and have tried some other hairsprays as well, but this is the best because&lt;</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time and love this hairspray!</li>
            <li> However, I still don&#x27;t know if its the right hair spray for me.</li>
            <li> I am sure to order extra to keep my shelf stocked</li>
            <li> the first time I attempted to hold the spray piece in.....</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I use several TIGI products that I love.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what it says...</li>
            <li> I have used this hair spray for the last couple of years and I love it.</li>
            <li> Bed Head really deserves the five star rating with Masterpiece!  </li>
            <li> My hair stylist was the first to use this on my hair.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the nozzle gets caked, so you have to run hot water over it to de-clog the spout.  </li>
            <li> I will certainly buy it aain.</li>
            <li> I think I have found my new hairspray!!</li>
            <li> Maybe too much hold to use as working spray.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> Excels in gentle hold with added shine..</li>
            <li> All it really does is make your hair smell like bubble gum.</li>
            <li> Seems to really help control the oily scalp issue, too, so I don&#x27;t have to shampoo as often as I used</li>
            <li> I was looking for a hairspray that wouldn&#x27;t leave my hair crispy or be visible on my light blonde hair, but this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I do use this when I really want a style to stay</li>
            <li> I am pretty picky and am very sensitive to scents when it comes to hairspray.</li>
            <li> with  more shine  for  less  money</li>
            <li> This spray is so expensive at my job, I was happy to find it up here so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> This hair spray works decently.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> This hairspray for high humidity areas.  </li>
            <li> Masterpiece spray has a fine mist, the hold is strong but not too stiff, doesn&#x27;t leave a white powdery finish, leaves your hair shiny.  </li>
            <li> You can comb through it once it dries and your hair feels normal.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of normal hairspray as it gives me that &amp;#34;piecey&amp;#34; look I have been searching for.  </li>
            <li> I will never use another hairspray and I was so glad to find it on Amazon, it&#x27;s half the price I&#x27;ve been paying!</li>
            <li> /rain since I live in GA and humidity is about 100% for 6 months of the year.</li>
            <li> I live in Houston.</li>
            <li> I live in New Jersey and the humidity here is the pits.</li>
            <li> TIGI Hard Head is also good and very similar to this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty comparable to any regular, drugstore brand hairspray.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and this stuff REALLY holds your style....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to reuse it a number of times throughout the day like I did with my old hair spray.</li>
            <li> Natural look, yet keeps it in place.  </li>
            <li> the scent - and the shine and natural hold.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is it is very hair spray scented</li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED SO MANY HAIRSPRAYS AND WASTED MONEY AND KEEP COMING BACK TO THIS.</li>
            <li> My limp dull hair has literally been transformed by this stuff; now it actually looks thick, smooth, shiny and healthy --- way better than I thought my hair ever could.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much, so a bottle lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comparable to Kenra 25, Redken&#x27;s Forceful 23, but not quite as strong as Sebastian&#x27;s Mega Hold which is hard for me to find.  </li>
            <li> have very long straight no-natural-body hair with an oily scalp to boot</li>
            <li> Actually, the Sebastian will leave a white finish if I accidentally spray too much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the very view hair care products I&#x27;ve found that actually delivers above and beyond what it promises.</li>
            <li> There is no other hairspray like this.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, zero body, hard to hold hair and now that I&#x27;ve turned gray and color my hair</li>
            <li> I feel like I have to layer it to get a good hold on my hair, which isn&#x27;t thick, but when I do that my hair becomes hard and crunchy.</li>
            <li> It holds very well but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li> My husband ended up trying to switch the bad nozzles out wiht the one good spray bottle nozzle but it didn&#x27;t fix it 100%.  </li>
            <li> IT MAKES MY HAIR SHINY , TOO, &amp; HOLDS MY SHORT STYLE ALL DAY LONG.</li>
            <li> If I have a long day or it&#x27;s windy outside, I use TIGI&#x27;s purple non-aerosol pump which has mega hold as step 3.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several times to push it back on with no success.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair and this keeps volume in while giving hair a slight shine.</li>
            <li> I have long layers</li>
            <li> Also, the cap is liable to gunk up and spray in a different direction!</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive, but you only need to use a small amount of it to get fabulous results, so one big can lasts quite awhile.&lt;br /&gt;LUV</li>
            <li> They would only spit a little hairspray out when pressing the nozzle.  </li>
            <li> A little extra spray keeps my bangs in place without any stiffness, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other hairsprays that end up making my hair flake up and curls never hold for very long.</li>
            <li> and I like to fluff up the crown a bit.  </li>
            <li> It comes out so wet that your style will fall before the spray dries.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually purchase this product from the local salon.</li>
            <li> Does not \\&quot;flake\\&quot; like other products.  </li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed  with this hairspray, and I&#x27;ve used it off and on for many years.</li>
            <li> When I ran out of my other styling products, this spray took the place of them all.</li>
            <li> I  decided to try  this  product  because  of  other reviews  claiming  shine.  </li>
            <li> I have cow licks .</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT ISNT TO HEAVY, AND IT DOESNT DULL MY HAIR (IM BLONDE) LIKE OTHER HAIRSPRAYS.</li>
            <li> leaving added fullness with a less stiff look.</li>
            <li> It was too heavy to suite me</li>
            <li> When I need it, approximately 5 days later, the nozzle was inoperable.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff and gives it a little bit of shine.</li>
            <li> it is too stiff and sticky to use.</li>
            <li> It holds without being stiff.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had to spray my bangs until their stiff,</li>
            <li> It kept my hair in place without being stiff and sticky.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad it has a nice smell because I think it&#x27;s awful when hairsprays have a nasty scent.</li>
            <li> If you want maximum hold and shine than look no more.</li>
            <li> Use with Bed Head Small Talk...</li>
            <li> The smell gave me a headache and eventually had a weird smell by mid morning.  </li>
            <li> Addsshine as well so your hair doesn&#x27;t look dried out like a lot of hairspray does!</li>
            <li> Not a very good product at all.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t even look that hard for it.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in my area</li>
            <li> It dried my scalp out terribly and left my hair dry.</li>
            <li> The cap was broken was</li>
            <li> I use those failed sprays as my step 1 working spray, then this TIGI Bed Head Masterpiece as step 2.  </li>
            <li> This one I was not impressed with.  </li>
            <li> and it does do what I need it to, which is hold curls like crazy.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Bed Head!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very expensive.</li>
            <li> So my experience with this can of spray has been bad.</li>
            <li> Disappointed as I am out of $17</li>
            <li> And not make it nasty looking.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SPRAY. IT MAKES MY HAIR SHINY , TOO, &amp; HOLDS MY SHORT STYLE ALL DAY LONG. I have been using it for years .</li>
            <li> My favorite spray, and cheaper than salon price.</li>
            <li> I Love this Bed Head Masterpiece Hairspray. I began using this spray 2 years ago and simply love it!! The ease of hold with out the crunchy stiffness is the best. I can&#x27;t seem to find it for such a great price like I can here on Amazon. I am sure to order extra to keep my shelf stocked</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this spray. It smells amazing and it holds perfectly. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp or make my head itch and to find it online at a price I can afford is awesome! I buy as many as I can at once. My sister found my stash though!</li>
            <li> I usually purchase this product from the local salon. Thought I&#x27;d try to save some money by purchasing several online.  However two of the three Bed Head TIGI Masterpiece Massive Shine Hairspray bottles&#x27; sprayers wouldn&#x27;t work.  They would only spit a little hairspray out when pressing the nozzle.  I&#x27;d beware of ordering this online in case you also encounter defective spray nozzles on your bottles.  My husband ended up trying to switch the bad nozzles out wiht the one good spray bottle nozzle but it didn&#x27;t fix it 100%.  Purchase with caution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years, and have tried some other hairsprays as well, but this is the best because&lt;br /&gt;1) It literally makes your hair several times thicker&lt;br /&gt;2) It smells so good that people will ask you if they can come up and smell you&lt;br /&gt;3) You can go a couple days without showering and not feel greasy&lt;br /&gt;4) It&#x27;s very strong but not ridiculously stiff-feeling&lt;br /&gt;5) It doesn&#x27;t take much, so a bottle lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only possible drawback to this product is you might not want to wear it if your perfume is not similarly fruity. But it smells so good you don&#x27;t even need perfume.</li>
            <li> Great hold.  Maybe too much hold to use as working spray.  I have tried so many so called \\&quot;Super\\&quot; and \\&quot;Freeze\\&quot; sprays that will not hold my volumnous style for more than 5 minutes, including Paul Mitchell&#x27;s with the red cap.  I use those failed sprays as my step 1 working spray, then this TIGI Bed Head Masterpiece as step 2.  If I have a long day or it&#x27;s windy outside, I use TIGI&#x27;s purple non-aerosol pump which has mega hold as step 3.  I have long layers and I like to fluff up the crown a bit.  It is also great for stray hairs like around the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Masterpiece spray has a fine mist, the hold is strong but not too stiff, doesn&#x27;t leave a white powdery finish, leaves your hair shiny.  It&#x27;s comparable to Kenra 25, Redken&#x27;s Forceful 23, but not quite as strong as Sebastian&#x27;s Mega Hold which is hard for me to find.  Actually, the Sebastian will leave a white finish if I accidentally spray too much so I don&#x27;t even look that hard for it.  The TIGI, Kenra, and Redken do not.  TIGI Hard Head is also good and very similar to this.  If I didn&#x27;t look at the can, I probably cannot tell the difference.  I buy whichever is on sale or lowest priced with store coupons like Ulta, JC Penney Salon, or mall salons/retailers.  Hope this helps you to choose.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before at different local salons.  When I purchased this on line and received it....the first time I attempted to hold the spray piece in.....it came apart.  I have tried several times to push it back on with no success.  I believe it was faulty when I received it.  Perhaps this vendor gets \\&quot;seconds\\&quot;.  Disappointed as I am out of $17</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  Light hold w/a great shine!  Smells good too!</li>
            <li> I love Bed Head hair products, but for my bleached hair this hair spray really didn&#x27;t work out. It dried my scalp out terribly and left my hair dry. My hair is even in very good condition, however this product did dry it out.</li>
            <li> This hairspray was recommended by hairstylist.  Hold, but provides flexibility.  Can go several days without washing hair because does not build up on your hair.  Does not \\&quot;flake\\&quot; like other products.  Amazon provided a great price for a wonderful product.  Shipping was quick.  I purchased enough to last me all year!</li>
            <li> If you want maximum hold and shine than look no more. This is what you want. The hair spray gives your hair great shine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time and love this hairspray! Doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff and gives it a little bit of shine. This isn&#x27;t a super hold hairspray but that&#x27;s what I love about it.</li>
            <li> Payless beauty has a great price on what my wife says is the \\&quot;best hairspray available\\&quot;. Ordering it from Amazon was the best way to garantee shipment and price. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite hairspray in the world! I have tried numerous, and this one has the best smell, hold, and texture. It is about $20 a bottle at our local beauty store so I buy in bulk from Amazon :) This is a must have for hair that gets ruined in humidity/rain since I live in GA and humidity is about 100% for 6 months of the year. It allows my hair to move, but doesn&#x27;t allow it to start curling up like it is prone to do. The smell is great, a bit fruity and not chemical or strange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Masterpiece hairspray for years! The smell is great, the hold is medium, it keeps hair in place but isn&#x27;t stiff unless you&#x27;re specifically looking for that. It CAN do that. I will never use another hairspray and I was so glad to find it on Amazon, it&#x27;s half the price I&#x27;ve been paying!</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described. Very happy with the service.  The product was rcvd in a timely manner. I would not hesitate to purchase from this buyer again.</li>
            <li> I first experienced this hair spray at the salon where I get my hair cut and colored. My stylist used it and I absolutely loved the scent....it smells GREAT. She told me what it was and I promptly went home and got on the computer and ordered about 6 cans of it. I still use it as a finishing spray. I have short hair and this stuff REALLY holds your style....all day. And it also gives your hair a BRILLIANT shine. Fabulous stuff. Best hair spray ever.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone, I love the product but it&#x27;s very expensive. I was able to purchase this product on this site for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> This spray is so expensive at my job, I was happy to find it up here so much cheaper. It really does add an impeccable shine ans it smells like strawberries!</li>
            <li> I live in Houston. The humidity here is a killer for any hairstyle. This hairspray keeps my hair in place even on rainy days.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray out there! Smells amazing and awesome hold! I don&#x27;t use anything else! Love it lots!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair spray ever! It brushes out so easily. It does no flakes. And does not get sticky.</li>
            <li> I use several TIGI products that I love.  This one I was not impressed with.  It was too heavy to suite me and I did not notice any improvement in shine.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Will always buy this product from Amazon from now on. Great price plus free shipping!  Cant beat it!</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says...massive shine! Use sparingly, you won&#x27;t need a lot. Excellent hold all day. Great for my fine hair. Use with Bed Head Small Talk...Excellent combination!</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  It smells great and has a great hold that isn&#x27;t too stiff but not too flexible either.</li>
            <li> would not recommend it. it is too stiff and sticky to use.</li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED SO MANY HAIRSPRAYS AND WASTED MONEY AND KEEP COMING BACK TO THIS. I HAVE VERY FINE HAIR. THIS PRODUCT ISNT TO HEAVY, AND IT DOESNT DULL MY HAIR (IM BLONDE) LIKE OTHER HAIRSPRAYS. IT ALSO SMELLS WONDERFUL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray.  It holds without being stiff. Works great in humid weather, even when rained on it isn&#x27;t sticky.  Hard to find in my area so I order it online,that way I never run out.  This provider was great. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed  with this hairspray, and I&#x27;ve used it off and on for many years. It&#x27;s especially great when I have a shorter &amp;#34;piecey&amp;#34; style. When I ran out of my other styling products, this spray took the place of them all. Great value.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and I&#x27;ve had to spray my bangs until their stiff, which is what I was trying to get away from. This hair spray helps. I don&#x27;t have to reuse it a number of times throughout the day like I did with my old hair spray.</li>
            <li> I have never used this hairspray before but have used there TIGI products.  I love this hairspray and will never use anything else.  It is not sticky, goes on well and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Great flexible hold hairspray. Leaves nice shine and scent. I&#x27;ve been using this spray for about 2 years now, I will not be using anything else.</li>
            <li> Holds without feeling like hairspray.  Hairstylist introduced me to this product and Im hooked. I buy on Amazon to save $$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: spray ever so lightly, and wait a couple of minutes, and lightly run your fingers through your hair. Natural look, yet keeps it in place.  A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the scent - and the shine and natural hold.  I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I have used this hair spray for the last couple of years and I love it.</li>
            <li> I am pretty picky and am very sensitive to scents when it comes to hairspray. This is the only hairspray that I have come across with a good scent, great holding power, and the ability to not stick all of your hairs together and get hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfect hairspray!</li>
            <li> This product has been my favorite for many years.  It holds well without being super sticky and brushes out easily.</li>
            <li> I cant believe the shine this gives my hair. Perfect hold without being sticky. I think I have found my new hairspray!! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have ever tried.  It is light weight on your hair but keeps the hold of the style.  I reccomend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love the citrus fragrance more than anything. It holds okay.</li>
            <li> I have used numerous hairsprays over the years and this is one of, if not, the best! I have fine, thin hair and this keeps volume in while giving hair a slight shine. It also has a very pleasant smell. I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray.  Would recommend to anyone.  Doesn&#x27;t have any buildup and holds great!  This was a great price too!</li>
            <li> Love it and it smells great too!</li>
            <li> love the product even in Mo. humidity it works well!!!</li>
            <li> Smells good. Performs it&#x27;s job. Thank you for the speed and accuracy.</li>
            <li> Fabulous hair spray. You can comb through it and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair in a helmet look. Doesn&#x27;t build up!</li>
            <li> It holds well and gives shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a TIGI girl, but Masterpiece is probably my favorite product. I&#x27;m not saying it doesn&#x27;t exist, but i have yet to find a hairspray that holds like this PLUS contains shine.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to purchase this item-especially through amazon. I received it quick &amp; it was packaged perfectly.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this hairspray at first because it holds super well, almost too much at times but overall it is a great spray with a nice scent and it does do what I need it to, which is hold curls like crazy.</li>
            <li> Bed Head really deserves the five star rating with Masterpiece!  It delivers the best shine of any spray I have used and smells wonderful. It&#x27;s a must have product for me!!!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist was the first to use this on my hair. I love it. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky but has great holding power. The scent doesn&#x27;t over power you. You can comb through it once it dries and your hair feels normal. I have fine curly hair and this spray works wonderfully for me. I recommend this to all. Amazon is a good place to find this product and they have it for a good price.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works very well!!</li>
            <li> This is a good hair spray and makes your hair shine. And there is no build up on your hair. I do not use anything else.</li>
            <li> Not a very good product at all.  Made my hair crispy and untouchable.  The smell gave me a headache and eventually had a weird smell by mid morning.  I threw it in the garbage after two uses.  Never again.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and I love the hold!! It&#x27;s not a flexible hold by no means, but it&#x27;s just what my frizzy/wavy hair needs to tame the fly aways!</li>
            <li> This hairspray holds!!! Addsshine as well so your hair doesn&#x27;t look dried out like a lot of hairspray does!</li>
            <li> Love this spray.  Excels in gentle hold with added shine.. Allows you to spray finished style but alo lets you comb through it leaving added fullness with a less stiff look.</li>
            <li> There is no other hairspray like this. I&#x27;ve tried them all and Masterpiece always wins.</li>
            <li> The cap was broken was I received this product. Thought nothing of it. Through away the box and put the product in the cabinet... When I need it, approximately 5 days later, the nozzle was inoperable. No paperwork to address the issue- had to eat the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is by far my most fav hair spray!  I love the hold.  And it smells good as well</li>
            <li> This is the best spray for all types of hair.  It also adds shine to lifeless hair.  I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It has great hold without having a sticky and it doen&#x27;t build up on your hair.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested this.  It is not a power spray. The hold is ok. it is not stiff and has a nice perfume.</li>
            <li> Very well priced, came on time and huge bottle. The only thing is it is very hair spray scented but I would order again.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Bed Head!</li>
            <li> Just love this hairspray and the smell.  I feel like its comperable to a perfume&#x27;ish smell.  Sometimes the nozzle gets caked, so you have to run hot water over it to de-clog the spout.  Otherwise, good stuff.</li>
            <li> Great hold and smells like pineapples!</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells and it&#x27;s not a bad hairspray.</li>
            <li> I  decided to try  this  product  because  of  other reviews  claiming  shine.  I  didn&#x27;t  see  any  noticeable difference.  I  would  not  recommend because of  its  price and  lackluster.  Tresemme works  better  with  more shine  for  less  money</li>
            <li> This helps me style my hair like a pro. I use this instead of normal hairspray as it gives me that &amp;#34;piecey&amp;#34; look I have been searching for.  Goes on great and makes my hair shiny and styled.</li>
            <li> Love this spray!! Hold and great shine all in one. I have baby fine, zero body, hard to hold hair and now that I&#x27;ve turned gray and color my hair I have cow licks . This spray workers great for me!! Holds where and when I need it !!! ❤️</li>
            <li> Like this hairspray, always use it and even have travel sizes.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist introduced me to this hairspray and I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else. It holds good, not sticky, smells good, and does the job. I&#x27;ve used other hairsprays that end up making my hair flake up and curls never hold for very long. LOVE THIS HAIRSPRAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish there were a travel size for this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> All it really does is make your hair smell like bubble gum. It&#x27;s supposed to make it shiny and nice, but doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> Everything I could ever want in a can. Everyone should use this if you want your hair to be perfect and it smells great.</li>
            <li> My favorite product, it takes a lot for me to to find a great hair spray, smell is important and hold.why smell, cause you don&#x27;t want to walk around smelling like alcohol.</li>
            <li> Huge gobs of spray come out. I have done everything to fix the spray and to no luck. So my experience with this can of spray has been bad. I can&#x27;t say I like it.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely one of the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve been raving about it to every one I know. I NEVER thought I&#x27;d be willing to pay this much for hairspray, but I can honestly say it&#x27;s worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;I have very long straight no-natural-body hair with an oily scalp to boot and this stuff has literally worked miracles on it. Just a light spraying all over my lacklustre mop in the morning gives it incredible body without any stiffness or stickiness at all and great shine that lasts all day. A little extra spray keeps my bangs in place without any stiffness, too. My limp dull hair has literally been transformed by this stuff; now it actually looks thick, smooth, shiny and healthy --- way better than I thought my hair ever could. Seems to really help control the oily scalp issue, too, so I don&#x27;t have to shampoo as often as I used to.&lt;br /&gt;For me, this Bed Head product has been like a miracle in a can. It&#x27;s one of the very view hair care products I&#x27;ve found that actually delivers above and beyond what it promises. Yes, it is expensive, but you only need to use a small amount of it to get fabulous results, so one big can lasts quite awhile.&lt;br /&gt;LUV THIS STUFF!!!!!! I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Smells so fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> Best hairspray ever for fast-drying and super hold without a huge buildup of residue...only Masterpiece for me!</li>
            <li> This hairspray smells so amazing- I wish Tigi made a perfume that smelled like this!</li>
            <li> Buy this spray if you want a crunchy, strong hold, just like with Rave harispray. It comes out so wet that your style will fall before the spray dries. I am not in love with this but cannot find an alternative to Bumble and Bumble classic hairspray.</li>
            <li> All time favorite hair spray!  Works great without stickiness or weighing down my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a hairspray that wouldn&#x27;t leave my hair crispy or be visible on my light blonde hair, but this isn&#x27;t it. It&#x27;s pretty comparable to any regular, drugstore brand hairspray. Don&#x27;t spend the extra money for this. Also, the cap is liable to gunk up and spray in a different direction!</li>
            <li> This hairspray for high humidity areas.  We vacationed in Florida and used this hairspray.  It kept my hair in place without being stiff and sticky.  I will certainly buy it aain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for awhile now. Love it!</li>
            <li> smells great, works great.</li>
            <li> I have short, fine hair and this hairspray is perfect. It holds very well but doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li> smells good, light hold/</li>
            <li> I live in New Jersey and the humidity here is the pits. This will hold your hair in a hurricane. And not make it nasty looking. Great product. Great hold. Great scent.</li>
            <li> This hair spray works decently. I&#x27;m really glad it has a nice smell because I think it&#x27;s awful when hairsprays have a nasty scent. I do use this when I really want a style to stay and I&#x27;m on the go. However, I still don&#x27;t know if its the right hair spray for me. I feel like I have to layer it to get a good hold on my hair, which isn&#x27;t thick, but when I do that my hair becomes hard and crunchy. I love touchable smooth hair, and this hairspray can&#x27;t give me that.</li>
            <li> been using this product for a while, love it, goes on nice and light but has enough hold, would recommend it</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite hairspray!  It holds nicely, it&#x27;s dry, it&#x27;s shiny and most of all it smells great!  It&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t seem to build up on my hair.  The application is fine and convenient.</li>
