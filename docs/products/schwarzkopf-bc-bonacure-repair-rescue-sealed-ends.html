            <li>It gives my fine hair body after washing and refreshes my doo in between.</li>
            <li>But this keeps my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I use it a couple times a week and seal with a light oil.</li>
            <li>Been using this off and on for many years really makes my ends look and feel smoother and more manageable  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent... for sure!  </li>
            <li>I love clear serum much better.</li>
            <li>It has made my life soooo much easier and my hair looks so much better after I use it.</li>

            <li>Love this product.i have used it for years and am pleased to buy for less than at the salon .</li>
            <li>Great hair product, I use it everyday!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now soft and manageable and doesn&#x27;t break as easily as before.</li>
            <li>I use it on a daily basis and my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Yours has water as it&#x27;s first ingredient.  </li>
            <li>A hairstylist friend of mine gave me a tube of this years ago (different color tube, the silver tube) and I have not found anything that works better on my hair since then.</li>
            <li>and my hair is much smoother and shinier!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent price here, so if you&#x27;re interested, try it!  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length, fine hair, and I use barely a dime sized amount</li>
            <li>I think it may help a little with split ends; I don&#x27;t get very many split ends, probably because of this product.  </li>
            <li>I will use this product until the end of time or they quite making it which is pretty much like the end of time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The fragrance isn&#x27;t strong - it&#x27;s like a white lotion and almost smells a bit like a lotion -</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the salon.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it does very well with split end repair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper on amazon compared to the salon.</li>
            <li>Just try not to use too much, it will make your hair somewhat greasy.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have as much breakage.  </li>
            <li>You cant really repair split ends.</li>
            <li>It arrived \\&quot;the real deal\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it really does seal the ends of hair, without a greasy feel at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Start with a little and work your way up each time you use it to see how much you need. :)</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to this product it&#x27;s a trial and error type of thing for how much to use on your hair type.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair smooth and shiny, and keeps split ends to a minimum even though I blow dry it almost every day.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new user of this product.  </li>
            <li>It makes it soft and silky and manageable!</li>
            <li>In fact, this is the OLD tube (colors are a grayish-blue, not the new red-and-white.).</li>
            <li>Also, product is seriously OLD ...</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair well conditioned and soft</li>
            <li>/&gt;This seems to be an older version of what is currently being sold at hair salons as &amp;#34;Repair Rescue&amp;#34;  Ingredients are almost identical though and the results I achieved were very close to the same.  </li>
            <li>But the main reason I bought this was  because it was one third the price it was at the salon.  </li>
            <li>reduced the amount of hot tools on my hair at the same time so that may be a big factor on why i am seeing improvement</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much as it is very concentrated and can weigh your hair down if you use too much.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that when I buy this from a salon it seems to work better than when I buy it online.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that tames my wild, curly hair when the ends get frizzy.</li>
            <li>The viscosity (the old tube is slippery) is not the same and the list of ingredients are different from my old tube.  </li>
            <li>but product was also very different very grainey not  smooth like the real product and was not 5.6 tube</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s better than other products I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>I use it on damp hair and let it air dry in a twisted bun(for extra conditioning) and it also works great before you blow dry.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for a long time and it really helps dry ends.</li>

            <li> I have used this product for a long time and it really helps dry ends.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and wavy and the tangles comb right out.</li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair that I dye and straighten regularly</li>
            <li> I do use a flat iron every day</li>
            <li> I have long hair and have quite a few split ends due to coloring and hot irons.  </li>
            <li> it comes out mostly clear and runny in color, not the usual creamy, thicker white.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must have for those who have long hair and split ends.</li>
            <li> I am going to keep using for a very long time.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and damaged for highlighting.</li>
            <li> My long hair tends to get a little frayed at the ends if I go too long between trims, and given my hectic schedule</li>
            <li> This product really helps my frizzy hair not look crazy and keeps it soft.</li>
            <li> I put it in my hair wet and it protects my hair, thickens, softens, helps give a fierce blowout, and even helps hold my style.</li>
            <li> Makes my thick hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this on one side of my hair (after washing, and again when dry - I just apply to lower half of hair) and have compared it to a couple of other products that are supposed to be similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a real long way.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only complaint.  </li>
            <li> Tames my ends without weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> There was no \\&quot;black wrapping\\</li>
            <li> If I want a slight flip, or slight under-curl, my hair does JUST THAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> no matter how small of an amount you put into your hair, it weighs it down and makes it look greasy.</li>
            <li> Super disappointed w/ this purchase.</li>
            <li> so my ends are usually in need of a little TLC.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount after washing my hair as a leave in conditioner.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Over the years I have had probably every hair product created underneath my sink. This is the absolute best hair product I have ever used. I put it in my hair wet and it protects my hair, thickens, softens, helps give a fierce blowout, and even helps hold my style. LOVE!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it.  Makes my hair really limp.</li>
            <li> Loved the size!...and price!</li>
            <li> This is a hair &amp;#34;must&amp;#34; in my book. It helps my hair feel full and healthy. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product really helps my frizzy hair not look crazy and keeps it soft. I use it on a daily basis and my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my hair!!!!  It makes it soft and silky and manageable!</li>
            <li> Great product and great value! I have used this product for a long time and it really helps dry ends.</li>
            <li> This will be a staple in my hair care regimen love this stuff</li>
            <li> I love this product! My hair is a tangled mess after washing it and I would not be able to brush it out if I didn&#x27;t use sealed ends. I highly recommend. It has made my life soooo much easier and my hair looks so much better after I use it.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! It makes my hair so soft and shiny and a healthy feeling!!! Much cheaper than the salon.</li>
            <li> This is a super great product. Does exactly what it says it does. But the main reason I bought this was  because it was one third the price it was at the salon.  And a bigger size!!</li>
            <li> I will use this product until the end of time or they quite making it which is pretty much like the end of time.</li>
            <li> i loved the product!!! it leaves my hair really soft, i liked it alot, i recommend, fast shipping, as described.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 4 years, and it works wonders on my hair.  It keeps my hair smooth and shiny, and keeps split ends to a minimum even though I blow dry it almost every day.  I would recommend this product to anyone who uses a lot of heat processing on their hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to every one. For smooth hair and less breakage try this product you will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> This is a staple for me. In fact if I could get it on subscribe and save with automatic shipments I would sign up in a heartbeat. My long hair tends to get a little frayed at the ends if I go too long between trims, and given my hectic schedule I don&#x27;t get in to the stylist all that option. But this keeps my hair smooth and shiny. I&#x27;ve never been able to grow my hair out to great lengths because the ends would end up too damaged but since using this, this is the longest my hair has ever been and still looks like it was recently trimmed. My holy grail of hair products!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, keeps hair soft and almost tangle free.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, always like Schwarzkopf but there may be parabens in the product.  That&#x27;s my only complaint.  Otherwise it does very well with split end repair.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s better than other products I&#x27;ve tried but I don&#x27;t think there is any magic treatment! I&#x27;ll continue using it for now</li>
            <li> Super disappointed w/ this purchase. Falsely advertised both in quantity/volume and packaging. It&#x27;s actually 2.6 oz. tube (NOT 5.1 as advertised -- both in description and packaging). In fact, this is the OLD tube (colors are a grayish-blue, not the new red-and-white.). Also, product is seriously OLD ... it comes out mostly clear and runny in color, not the usual creamy, thicker white. I know, because this is my go-to product. This is one of two bad-bad experiences I&#x27;ve had w/ Amazon Prime - a rarity, however, because I order here A LOT. Still, when a retailer has been misleading (deliberately, in this case), customers need to know!</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair soft and smooth. I especially like that I put it on after I wash my hair. No rinsing needed. My hair is thick and wavy and the tangles comb right out.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found so far on the market and have been using it for almost 3 years. It smooths your hair without causing any greasy build-up. Great product!</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how quickly it was delivered. While I do have a Prime membership, I ordered this last night and it was on my door step when I woke up the next morning. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years, my hair stylist introduced me to it, and when they switched products I started looking online for this Sealed Ends. It&#x27;s much cheaper on amazon compared to the salon. lol It makes my hair super soft! Just try not to use too much, it will make your hair somewhat greasy. If you&#x27;re new to this product it&#x27;s a trial and error type of thing for how much to use on your hair type. I have shoulder length, fine hair, and I use barely a dime sized amount and it&#x27;s enough. Start with a little and work your way up each time you use it to see how much you need. :)</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when I buy this from a salon it seems to work better than when I buy it online. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s exactly the same product or not. I still love it.</li>
            <li> My hair feels stronger and moisturized with this product. I use it a couple times a week and seal with a light oil.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed stylist. My hair is dry and damaged for highlighting. This fills in the porous ends so your hair looks smoother.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and have quite a few split ends due to coloring and hot irons.  I&#x27;ve tried so many products out there and always end up returning to Bonacure.  It keeps my hair well conditioned and soft and I don&#x27;t have as much breakage.  It&#x27;s a must have for those who have long hair and split ends.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that tames my wild, curly hair when the ends get frizzy.</li>
            <li> This product just made my hair look greasy. That&#x27;s all...</li>
            <li> love the smell and it also makes my ends feel smooth and look better. I have long wavy hair that I dye and straighten regularly so my ends are usually in need of a little TLC.</li>
            <li> This product must not be made by the Schwarzkopf co.  I noticed when I opened it yesterday that the color is whiter than the tube I purchased from my hairdresser.  The viscosity (the old tube is slippery) is not the same and the list of ingredients are different from my old tube.  Yours has water as it&#x27;s first ingredient.  I am afraid that I cannot use it and would like to return it.  It doesn&#x27;t deserve even one star.</li>
            <li> no matter how small of an amount you put into your hair, it weighs it down and makes it look greasy. don&#x27;t buy!! and it does NOTHING for split ends and flyaways. I love clear serum much better.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my hair stylist so I went and bought some and it has honestly had a drastic impact on my hair. I have horribly damaged, dry, and frizzy blonde hair and I swear that this product literally heals splint ends, which I know is probably impossible. The only thing that I don&#x27;t love is the smell of this product, but In a nut shell this product is magic</li>
            <li> I  received the 5.1oz size from ASAP Beauty.  So no problem with the size at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to be an older version of what is currently being sold at hair salons as &amp;#34;Repair Rescue&amp;#34;  Ingredients are almost identical though and the results I achieved were very close to the same.  FYI it doesn&#x27;t smell near as nice though.  For the cost though you can&#x27;t beat this deal.</li>
            <li> I have spent anywhere between 5-50 dollars on hair products to help with split ends and smoothing out my hair and this stuff is THE BEST. Great amount for the price, works awesome and almost completely hides split ends. Stop searching and get this product!</li>
            <li> I use a small amount after washing my hair as a leave in conditioner.  It works great and does not weigh down my hair.  It does not seem to build up in my fine hair.  There was a review that mentioned that this is not a leave in conditioner but I think they were mistaken.  I would prefer if it was not scented but at least the scent is not overpowering.  I prefer the scent of the product in the older silver tube but typically cannot find that anymore so I am content with the white and red tube.  I buy the larger container and it lasts for months.  I think it may help a little with split ends; I don&#x27;t get very many split ends, probably because of this product.  I do use a flat iron every day but I try not to go over my ends.  A hairstylist friend of mine gave me a tube of this years ago (different color tube, the silver tube) and I have not found anything that works better on my hair since then.</li>
            <li> Been using this off and on for many years really makes my ends look and feel smoother and more manageable  (African American Permed Hair)  I also use on my 13 year old daughter&#x27;s hair :)  keeps hair moist and shinny..Love it..</li>
            <li> Wife, daughter and I use it and have been very pleased!  Softens and controls...good stuff!</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and have been for about 3 years.  I use it all over, instead of just on the ends and my hair is much smoother and shinier!</li>
            <li> You cant really repair split ends. But this may help prevent your split ends from happening. I believe it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I reduced the amount of hot tools on my hair at the same time so that may be a big factor on why i am seeing improvement</li>
            <li> This was the treatment not the leave in conditioner.  I didn&#x27;t realize the difference till I received it.  Can&#x27;t use that on my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 20 years now. It&#x27;s great, seals ends perfectly and is not too greasy.</li>
            <li> This product is at an amazing price.  It was delivered before the estimated date.  I would recommend this to any one that uses this type of product.  I will definitely be a return customer!</li>
            <li> Love it. Great product. It was recommended to me and I love it. Great for binding my split ends and making my hair look smooth.</li>
            <li> LOVE sealed ends. The price is wayyyy cheaper than in any beauty salon. Beauty salon states that you aren&#x27;t getting the same product though.</li>
            <li> I will always use this stuff!  Love it!</li>
            <li> use it for years and still great for split ends and makes hair super soft..love it. you wont be disappointed</li>
            <li> I received this just over a week ago so yes.... I&#x27;m a new user of this product.  It arrived \\&quot;the real deal\\&quot;.  There was no \\&quot;black wrapping\\&quot; and there was no \\&quot;not to be separated; to be sold only as a package\\&quot; note.  It arrived in clear plastic, sealed perfectly, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having only used this product for a week or so, I feel compelled to say this product is just what I needed for my medium-length hair.  I&#x27;ve tried this on one side of my hair (after washing, and again when dry - I just apply to lower half of hair) and have compared it to a couple of other products that are supposed to be similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This BC Repair Rescue wins hands-down.  When I use my straightener, with this product in my hair, my hair RESPONDS beautifully!  If I want a slight flip, or slight under-curl, my hair does JUST THAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not making my hair feel heavy or greasy.  It provides a bit of shine and just makes my hair look healthier.  I&#x27;d say it really does seal the ends of hair, without a greasy feel at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance isn&#x27;t strong - it&#x27;s like a white lotion and almost smells a bit like a lotion - it&#x27;s pleasant, clean but not a lot of fragrance.  RECOMMEND!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  Been using this for 2 months and I see no difference at all in my hair&#x27;s \\&quot;health\\&quot;.  So I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.  It&#x27;s a decent price here, so if you&#x27;re interested, try it!  It&#x27;s decent... for sure!  It&#x27;s just not \\&quot;all that\\&quot; (for my hair, anyway)</li>
            <li> great stuff! used it for years! not greasy and washes out easily! and very economical bought in the large size from amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Works great and came with more than the salon I used to but it at... And it was cheaper! Great hair product, I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair softly and has a pleasant smell, in addition to protect it from heat, highly recommend it. After ironing your hair you can use as a fixative and to avoid static, it works great all day.</li>
            <li> Love this product.i have used it for years and am pleased to buy for less than at the salon .</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It is a life saver for my hair.  Makes my thick hair soft and manageable.  A little bit goes a real long way.</li>
            <li> I feel I&#x27;m giving my hair food every time I use.  I love this product. I am going to keep using for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with product! Packaging different didn&#x27;t have a problem with that but product was also very different very grainey not  smooth like the real product and was not 5.6 tube it was a 2.5</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it! Tames my ends without weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful leave in conditioning treatment for hair.  I use it on damp hair and let it air dry in a twisted bun(for extra conditioning) and it also works great before you blow dry.  You don&#x27;t need much as it is very concentrated and can weigh your hair down if you use too much.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a year.  Like it because it doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily.  My hair just looks better  than it did before I started using it.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It gives my fine hair body after washing and refreshes my doo in between.</li>
            <li> I love how this product has revitalized my hair. It&#x27;s now soft and manageable and doesn&#x27;t break as easily as before. Definitely a 5 star product!</li>
