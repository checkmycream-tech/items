            <li>best shampoo i have used.</li>
            <li>This is unequivocally the best shampoo that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It does not have an overly perfumey smell and it does an excellent job of cleansing hair without stripping all of the oils and without leaving a siliconey residue (get my drift Pantene?).</li>
            <li>Great for hair with Keratin treatments, color or glaze!</li>
            <li>Wonderful scent!  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful solution!</li>
            <li>Works great and smells awesome.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, just bought a 32 oz bottles</li>
            <li>So it could be the combination of the two, great products.</li>
            <li>Better deal than at the salon!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>Great Sulfate free shampoo with a nice smell, received it originally as a gift and have been looking for it since.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT..  </li>
            <li>Love the results and smell.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Best shampoo I have used in a long time.</li>
            <li>Clean fragrance, too!</li>
            <li>You might be able to ask seller if they have one with a pump or a pump that would go to it and fit it for sale.  </li>
            <li>If you like good shampoo that causes no waste of it&#x27;s product and produces nice smelling clean hair, then this shampoo is for you.  </li>
            <li>It does wonders for my baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>Worth every dollar, this shampoo is healthy for hair.</li>
            <li>The 32 ounce bottle lasts 9 months, so at a little more than $4.00/month, it&#x27;s a good bargain as well!</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo for my hair...makes it feel so clean and doesn&#x27;t dry my hair and protects the color!</li>
            <li>I could not find it locally any longer, so I am glad to find it again.</li>
            <li>My first purchase came with a pump but this one doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>PRETTY MUCH IN LINE WITH RETAIL PRICING.  </li>
            <li>Combined with a good conditioner, makes it soft and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>This product really leaves my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>One-third of the product was missing from the container and it looked like someone had put shrink wrap over the top.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo shipped fast and the product is the same as the one I bought at a much higher price at my salon.</li>
            <li>I received this product in the mail today and when I opened the package it was wet and full of shampoo.  </li>

            <li> I have poker straight, somewhat limp hair, but it&#x27;s highlighted, so I need a shampoo that keeps it moisturized, but not weighed down.  </li>
            <li> Recommended by my colorist, this cleans the hair well, doesn&#x27;t fade color, and doesn&#x27;t dry the hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry and frizzy hair</li>
            <li> It appears that it had been previously used.</li>
            <li> Purchased because it has no sulfates which will help prolong hair treatments listed previously.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing, but not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Was not quite used to less suds, but I adjusted!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended it a few years ago because it doesn&#x27;t have all the bad stuff in it, but I won&#x27;t use anything else because of what it does for my hair.  </li>

            <li> Wife exclusively uses this shampoo and rinse line.</li>
            <li> Better deal than at the salon!</li>
            <li> Great Sulfate free shampoo with a nice smell, received it originally as a gift and have been looking for it since. Shipped quickly.</li>

            <li> Recommended by my colorist, this cleans the hair well, doesn&#x27;t fade color, and doesn&#x27;t dry the hair. Great shampoo. My daughter uses it too.</li>
            <li> I received this product in the mail today and when I opened the package it was wet and full of shampoo.  One-third of the product was missing from the container and it looked like someone had put shrink wrap over the top.  I would not advise buying this product online.  It appears that it had been previously used.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, just bought a 32 oz bottles</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PRODUCT..  PRICE IS JUST ALRIGHT....PRETTY MUCH IN LINE WITH RETAIL PRICING.  HAVE, AND ALWAYS WILL, RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO OTHERS.</li>

            <li> I have extremely dry and frizzy hair and I&#x27;ve tried lots of different types of shampoo.  This is the only type I will use anymore because it is the only one that I found that actually made a difference in my hair.  My hairdresser recommended it a few years ago because it doesn&#x27;t have all the bad stuff in it, but I won&#x27;t use anything else because of what it does for my hair.  Combined with a good conditioner, makes it soft and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Love the results and smell.</li>
            <li> Worth every dollar, this shampoo is healthy for hair. It&#x27;ll last forever.</li>

            <li> This product really leaves my hair soft.  I do use the Bio mega moisture conditioner too. So it could be the combination of the two, great products.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. Works great and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing, but not too heavy.  Wonderful scent!  I have poker straight, somewhat limp hair, but it&#x27;s highlighted, so I need a shampoo that keeps it moisturized, but not weighed down.  This is a wonderful solution!</li>
