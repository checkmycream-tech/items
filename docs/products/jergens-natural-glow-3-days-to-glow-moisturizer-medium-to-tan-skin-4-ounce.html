            <li>The best ever.</li>
            <li>This is the best self tanner I have found.  </li>
            <li>Love it!!!</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin</li>
            <li>You look beautiful.</li>
            <li>You will have a great color in 2-3 days and it lasts for about a week.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin look great.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many products, and this one works the best.</li>
            <li>It has a beautiful color, nice and brownish.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this self tanning cream.</li>
            <li>Smells good, too.</li>
            <li>Cons -- Very potent odor.</li>
            <li>Love the color and how it makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li>Great stuff, easy to use, no smell.  </li>
            <li>Nice glow after just one application.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice going on, but then of course you do get that &#x27;sunless tanner scent&#x27; when it turns into a tan.</li>
            <li>It has never streaked on me and leaves me nice a tan looking.</li>
            <li>people have an issue with the smell, well to be honest</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, goes on evenly and 3days</li>
            <li>The streaking I&#x27;ll chalk up to user error as it&#x27;s mostly on the tops of my feet where I was scared to over apply</li>
            <li>Love jergens</li>
            <li>then I wouldn&#x27;t have to put sun tan lotion on top of it.</li>
            <li>Container is not the easiest to use, but better than Jergens.&lt;br /&gt;Caribbean Solutions.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to read the instructions.  </li>
            <li>Super fast delivery and great  price.</li>
            <li>Within 10 minutes of application, the odor was so strong I jumped in the shower to scrub off the lotion.</li>
            <li>Does have an odor, but not too strong.</li>
            <li>This gives a fantastic color and is so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Great for those last minute skirt parties!</li>
            <li>Smooth.</li>
            <li>There is still a light fragrance</li>
            <li>Make sure to rub in evenly just like hand lotion and then wash the palms of your hands right away.  </li>
            <li>He has a super strong nose.</li>
            <li>Pros - very good color, not as dark as Jergens, but not as orange.</li>
            <li>I imagine Caribbean Solutions will be used most frequently, because the color is almost as good as True Natural, and it is byfar the easiest to use.</li>
            <li>Pros - Mild odor.</li>
            <li>Definitely tacky and gets on clothes at first, but it does a great job with the color and doesn&#x27;t smell funny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a long time good price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Cons: Doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly, have to really rub it in.</li>
            <li>Tip: before applying the tanning lotion, apply REGULAR lotion lightly to knees, elbows and feet bottoms, then resume with the tanning lotion for a more even tan.</li>
            <li>Not as strongly as the older formula,</li>
            <li>: you don&#x27;t have to figure out a good time when you won&#x27;t stain anything, or be around other people to offend with the smell, or soil your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always exfoliate before first application.  </li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;m dropping off one star only because my hubby hates the smell.</li>
            <li>This product works really well!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to - except it still smells.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they have found a way to improve the fragrance --- if there was a product that was TOTALLY fragrance free I would definitely buy it.</li>
            <li>,True Natural:</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only does this give a pretty sun kissed tan look, but it also makes my skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>Very pretty &amp; natural color</li>
            <li>This one is too dark-too fast.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t do it absolutely evenly....</li>
            <li>Shower the lotion off before getting ready for the day.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Jergens product for years, but have been reading too much about the toxicity of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>and you can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>Apply too much and color goes to orange.</li>
            <li>course, with them all, you have to wash your palms really well after using so</li>
            <li>and it really does leave a realistic color after 3-days.  </li>
            <li>Previously, I purchased the &amp;#34;fair to medium&amp;#34; tone product, and that one is much better.</li>
            <li>I used several sites to research this, and found EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep to be most helpful.</li>
            <li>Decent color -- not orange.</li>
            <li>I will not use Jergens more than that because of the toxicity, smell and mess.</li>
            <li>later you have a golden brown tan.</li>
            <li>which means I left white spots...but the spots that aren&#x27;t white are kind of orange.</li>
            <li>The smell on the other hand is fine.</li>
            <li>I have tried plenty of different self tanners and for the most part they never live up to what they claim the product will do.</li>
            <li>A little streaky but effective in a short time.</li>
            <li>Tans you fast and pretty dark.</li>
            <li>natural glow</li>
            <li>Jergens Natural Glow - 3 Days to Glow Moisturizer Medium to Tan Skin</li>
            <li>All Natural Self Tanner Face &amp; Body, and Caribbean Solutions Beach Colors Natural Self Tanner.</li>
            <li>Natural.</li>
            <li>By far, the easiest to apply.</li>
            <li>So I narrowed them down, and tried True Natural and Caribbean Solutions.</li>
            <li>Maybe an application every other day for the first couple of days a month to get some rich color, and then touch up the rest of the month with the other two.</li>
            <li>Goes on as easily as any regular moisturizer and there is absolutely no scent!!</li>
            <li>Enough color like a normal self tanner</li>
            <li>My upper body (torso, arms, neck, face) seems fine, and I can already see a bit of color after a few hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already pretty tan naturally, I can usually get away with just picking whatever the middle shade is one the makeup counter without much issue.</li>
            <li>Very streaky even when I tried to be extremely careful.</li>
            <li>I find this product gives a nice subtle tan &#x27;glow&#x27; to my arms and legs after a few days of use, and it is natural looking -- not orange or blotchy for me.  </li>
            <li>THIS one get you dark and FAST, in fact its a little too fast, one day</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Avoid applying heavily on knees and other dry areas, or they&#x27;ll turn super dark, as your drier skin will absorb too much of it.</li>
            <li> ive been using this version this year, although I also use their general body &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; (med to dark) AND have used the smaller facial one too.</li>

            <li> I probably will use all three -- with Jergens use the least frequent.</li>
            <li> You have to be extremely careful how you apply it.</li>
            <li> I am half Asian, so I have a little yellow/olive tone in me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably use the gradual tan moisturizer on my legs every few days to build it up less drastically next time.</li>
            <li> My legs on the other hand are the reason for the one star deduction.</li>
            <li> Works fast, looks natural, smell is not as bad as others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I took another shower and scrubbed even harder using Dawn, and it still smelled afterward, although much less.</li>
            <li> Other than that this tanning cream never lets me down.</li>
            <li> Hard to get the last part out of the tube.</li>
            <li> this on is the one I use when I DO want to get dark...</li>
            <li> i used this product for one day and my body is blothced with dark orange spots cant even lighted them up with body scrub</li>
            <li> but it can streak a little, other than that I have no qualms about</li>
            <li> Just be careful to spread evenly you will have a hard line if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> everyday year-round.</li>
            <li> Odor is not potent.</li>
            <li> This is the only type of Natural Glow that doesn&#x27;t smell horrible.</li>
            <li> but I still smell like a dirty person by the end of the day, and that totally bums me out.</li>
            <li> It gets a bad review because it smells just like every other self-tanner on the market once it has time to react with your skin (after an hour or so).  </li>
            <li> It does not have that weird self tanner smell</li>
            <li> That is to say, it smells bad.</li>
            <li> We aren&#x27;t idiots.</li>
            <li> It still smells horrible!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Make no mistake, you will still smell like self-tanner. Within 10 minutes of application, the odor was so strong I jumped in the shower to scrub off the lotion. Even after the shower, though, it still smelled! I took another shower and scrubbed even harder using Dawn, and it still smelled afterward, although much less.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Nice glow after just one application.  I always exfoliate before first application.  Make sure to rub in evenly just like hand lotion and then wash the palms of your hands right away.  Want it darker...apply the next day and so on.</li>
            <li> Love this product, goes on evenly and 3days later you have a golden brown tan.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this self tanning cream. This is one of the only brands I use and have been for a year or so. It smells nice going on, but then of course you do get that &#x27;sunless tanner scent&#x27; when it turns into a tan. Other than that this tanning cream never lets me down. It has never streaked on me and leaves me nice a tan looking.</li>
            <li> ive been using this version this year, although I also use their general body &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; (med to dark) AND have used the smaller facial one too. THIS one get you dark and FAST, in fact its a little too fast, one day and you notice it! I use any of these 3 products everyday year-round. I use them all on my face and use them as my basic face cream. I don&#x27;t wear foundation and don&#x27;t want to.  this on is the one I use when I DO want to get dark... 2day. the other two I use for just regular daily bronzing.</li>
            <li> This is the only type of Natural Glow that doesn&#x27;t smell horrible. It has a beautiful color, nice and brownish.</li>
            <li> Tans you fast and pretty dark. Does have an odor, but not too strong. Color DOES rub off on your towels and clothing. &amp;#34;Tan&amp;#34; lasts 3-5 days before you need to reapply.</li>
            <li> Definitely tacky and gets on clothes at first, but it does a great job with the color and doesn&#x27;t smell funny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a long time good price on Amazon.  I get plenty  of color in just one application did not need to wait 3 days. Enough color like a normal self tanner</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT! This gives a fantastic color and is so easy to apply. Does not stink or turn orange. Great for those last minute skirt parties!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once and I did get the medium-tan. I&#x27;m already pretty tan naturally, I can usually get away with just picking whatever the middle shade is one the makeup counter without much issue. That being said I wanted a bit of a glow, and working indoors I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot. My upper body (torso, arms, neck, face) seems fine, and I can already see a bit of color after a few hours. My legs on the other hand are the reason for the one star deduction. The streaking I&#x27;ll chalk up to user error as it&#x27;s mostly on the tops of my feet where I was scared to over apply which means I left white spots...but the spots that aren&#x27;t white are kind of orange. Given the fact that my legs haven&#x27;t seen the sun in who knows how long I should have anticipated this but I didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ll probably use the gradual tan moisturizer on my legs every few days to build it up less drastically next time.</li>
            <li> Love jergens natural glow this one gives you color within 1st or 2nd day. Just be careful to spread evenly you will have a hard line if you don&#x27;t. I would recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> Previously, I purchased the &amp;#34;fair to medium&amp;#34; tone product, and that one is much better. This one is too dark-too fast. You have to be extremely careful how you apply it. If you don&#x27;t do it absolutely evenly....your mistakes will show up the next day!</li>
            <li> Very pretty &amp; natural color</li>
            <li> Works fast, looks natural, smell is not as bad as others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Very streaky even when I tried to be extremely careful.</li>
            <li> Works well. Have to rub it in quite a bit in order for it to be even. I plan to buy it again though.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, easy to use, no smell.  You will have a great color in 2-3 days and it lasts for about a week.  I wish it had an SPF of 50 then I wouldn&#x27;t have to put sun tan lotion on top of it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. You will see a big difference just after one use. I am half Asian, so I have a little yellow/olive tone in me. This makes my skin look great. I don&#x27;t notice the smell, but my husband hates it (but raves about my tan!). What I do is, take a shower at night and concentrate on exfoliating well. Dry off and then apply the lotion where you need a tan. I apply it all over, except my face. I use the face tanning lotion for that. Avoid applying heavily on knees and other dry areas, or they&#x27;ll turn super dark, as your drier skin will absorb too much of it. Tip: before applying the tanning lotion, apply REGULAR lotion lightly to knees, elbows and feet bottoms, then resume with the tanning lotion for a more even tan. I do this every time. Rub in vigorously and well. Be generous with the lotion and don&#x27;t skimp. Remember, if you miss a spot, that area won&#x27;t tan! Don&#x27;t put on your clothes until you&#x27;re dry to the touch (about 10 mins). In the morning, you&#x27;ll wake up with a deep tan. Shower the lotion off before getting ready for the day. No smell to share with others! :) I&#x27;m dropping off one star only because my hubby hates the smell. He has a super strong nose. I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner ever!! I got the medium to tan and apply it a couple times a week. Goes on as easily as any regular moisturizer and there is absolutely no scent!! I had been using FakeBake but will never go back!!</li>
            <li> A little streaky but effective in a short time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give this product a 4 out of 5. I would give it a 5 but it can streak a little, other than that I have no qualms about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have an issue with the smell, well to be honest I didn&#x27;t notice any smell when I applied it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this give a pretty sun kissed tan look, but it also makes my skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> Love the color and how it makes my skin feel! soooo! soft!I have to tell people it&#x27;s a lotion and not the sun!</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery and great  price. Thank you</li>
            <li> I was so dissapointed after I bought and used this as it claims that it has no odor anymore.  It still smells horrible!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! The best ever. It does make you tan in 3 days and even tanner as you keep using it. You look beautiful. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This is a review of three comparable products: Jergens Natural Glow - 3 Days to Glow Moisturizer Medium to Tan Skin,True Natural: All Natural Self Tanner Face &amp; Body, and Caribbean Solutions Beach Colors Natural Self Tanner. I have been using the Jergens product for years, but have been reading too much about the toxicity of the ingredients. I used several sites to research this, and found EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep to be most helpful. So I narrowed them down, and tried True Natural and Caribbean Solutions. I have been using the latter two for about a month now, and here is my findings.&lt;br /&gt;Jergens: Pros - It is the darkest color, two applications and you can really tell the difference. Cons -- Very potent odor. Smells your clothes and everything it touches, with the smell lingering for days. My family can&#x27;t stand the smell. It dyes fabrics that it comes into contact with, like sheets, even multiple hours after application. Hard to get the last part out of the tube. Apply too much and color goes to orange. Aforementioned toxicity fears.&lt;br /&gt;True Natural. Pros - very good color, not as dark as Jergens, but not as orange. Odor is not potent. Low toxicity and cancer concerns. Cons: Doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly, have to really rub it in. Container is not the easiest to use, but better than Jergens.&lt;br /&gt;Caribbean Solutions. Pros - Mild odor. By far, the easiest to apply. Low toxicity and cancer concerns. Smooth. Decent color -- not orange. Can apply any time. Cons: Color is the lightest of the three, but still makes a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion: I probably will use all three -- with Jergens use the least frequent. Maybe an application every other day for the first couple of days a month to get some rich color, and then touch up the rest of the month with the other two. I will not use Jergens more than that because of the toxicity, smell and mess. I imagine Caribbean Solutions will be used most frequently, because the color is almost as good as True Natural, and it is byfar the easiest to use. Really simple to use every two or three days: you don&#x27;t have to figure out a good time when you won&#x27;t stain anything, or be around other people to offend with the smell, or soil your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, with them all, you have to wash your palms really well after using so they don&#x27;t get the color.</li>
            <li> This gets one star, not because it doesn&#x27;t work (it probably will give me a tan, but I&#x27;m writing this review before the tan shows up).  It gets a bad review because it smells just like every other self-tanner on the market once it has time to react with your skin (after an hour or so).  That is to say, it smells bad. Please don&#x27;t lie to consumers.  We aren&#x27;t idiots.</li>
            <li> I have tried plenty of different self tanners and for the most part they never live up to what they claim the product will do. I tried it on my legs and it turned out streaky and blotchy. The smell on the other hand is fine. I threw it away!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products, and this one works the best.</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner I have found.  It does not have that weird self tanner smell and it really does leave a realistic color after 3-days.  I use it every time I go away in the winter.</li>
            <li> i used this product for one day and my body is blothced with dark orange spots cant even lighted them up with body scrub and i also agree the scent is still there too</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  Just make sure to read the instructions.  Smells good, too.</li>
            <li> I find this product gives a nice subtle tan &#x27;glow&#x27; to my arms and legs after a few days of use, and it is natural looking -- not orange or blotchy for me.  I have very fair skin so I am looking for something to take away the winter white!  Although the product says it is without odor, it is not totally fragrance-free.  There is still a light fragrance but I do not find it objectionable, the way the earlier products were.  I&#x27;m glad they have found a way to improve the fragrance --- if there was a product that was TOTALLY fragrance free I would definitely buy it.</li>
            <li> What a bummer.  This product works really well! It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to - except it still smells.  Not as strongly as the older formula, but I still smell like a dirty person by the end of the day, and that totally bums me out.</li>
