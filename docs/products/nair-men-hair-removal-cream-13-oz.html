    <ol>
            <li>- NAIR is an awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Smells great!</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>Awesome, almost like swiss army knife, it just gobbles the hair.</li>
            <li>Great size for the great price!</li>
            <li>works great</li>
            <li>Works great but the plastic pump broke after two uses</li>
            <li>This cream is amazing!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;You take good amounts of the cream and rub it onto your chest, within 3 mins</li>
            <li>good luck.  </li>
            <li>Its a good product.</li>
            <li>I am sure it works great for others but not me.</li>
            <li>received it and used it works great will get more when I run out</li>
            <li>The chemical is very strong on tender areas...</li>
            <li>The scent is way better than the original one, the sealable dispenser is a great idea...</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s much better and effective stuff out there.</li>
            <li>worked ok but needed to keep on longer than instructed</li>
            <li>Does it remove most if not all the hair you want it to?</li>
            <li>like I&#x27;m rocking most of the time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t take me more than 30 min to finish my arms, abs and chest.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s a men&#x27;s version.  </li>
            <li>It feels more like itchy than anything else.</li>
            <li>It sure feels that way.</li>
            <li>If you carefully follow the instructions you will get perfect results.</li>
            <li>Worked fine on the areas I tried, no issues at all.</li>
            <li>It removed my hair just fine</li>
            <li>Shipping was so quick too!</li>
            <li>It is not as effective as I thought thanks for trying</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It works and pretty good, but you MUST spot check first.  </li>
            <li>older 8oz version of this product is better even though it&#x27;s slightly more time consuming and it does not burn or irritate the skin like this does.</li>
            <li>The Nair Men hair removal system is quick, easy &amp; painless hair removal.</li>
            <li>Works great but don&#x27;t leave on to long</li>
            <li>You MUST thoroughly wash with soap, the areas you have wiped clean of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Applied a fair amount on chest and back &amp; within minutes all the hair washed off.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try nair because of how &amp;#34;painful&amp;#34; it was and how it felt &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; but honestly it&#x27;s not painful to me or does it feel like it&#x27;s burning.</li>
            <li>With that in mind, it took me three good pushes of the dispenser to gain the adequate amount necessary to &amp;#34;evenly&amp;#34; coat the areas where hair is to be removed...on one arm.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t actually tried it yet, but I had a similar one before and it works great!</li>
            <li>Would more clear instructions for use be beneficial?</li>
            <li>I can pump the cream right where I need it, in the lower part of my ear shell all the way up to and including the entry t.o the ear canal.</li>
            <li>and it seems like it closed some hair follicles because i feel a lot of smooth spaces, didn&#x27;t have any reaction what so ever even after I left the product on for more than 10 minutes on certain areas because of the thickness of the hair, very pleased would recommend to anyone and would buy again but don&#x27;t think I will need to.</li>
            <li>Efficient, consistent, economical, and low-maintenance.</li>
            <li>Great if you only regularly shave your knuckle hair and want an alternative.</li>
            <li>While some areas were easily wiped clean of hair, others were not over the same time period of 7 minutes in my case.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first thing that got here out of my whole order!</li>
            <li>It worked much better the second time around when I used and electric trimmer to buzz the hair first.</li>
            <li>I did have to reapply in some areas to get hair that was missed the first time.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>is my first issue.</li>
            <li>Sounds a lot better than working myself into an early financial grave for hygienically smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly,</li>
            <li>Just be very careful not to get it into your eyes since it uses some very strong alkaline materials.</li>
            <li>Following the directions it was all to remove the hair ever easily and painlessly (for the recommended areas-</li>
            <li>It did not burn my skin or irritate it much (very light irritation, but expected).</li>
            <li>absolutely have to follow instructions</li>
            <li>This is fantastic, especially for the nads.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Beats paying too much $$ for waxing.</li>
            <li>The whole bottle is equivalent to 2 legs.</li>
            <li>APPLY SMOOTHLY over entire area in one stroke.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never expected to get all of it in one application which came true.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than veet actually, and I do have coarse hair</li>
            <li>Works far better than expected, even on coarse hair.</li>
            <li>the claim of the product that I wanted to be try the most was a big let down.  </li>
            <li>your clean and new in less than 15 mins...</li>
            <li>, very hairy young male</li>
            <li>I guess it just depends on how sensitive your skin is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s already a bit uncomfortable due to the smell and texture so you want to make sure it&#x27;s okay for your skin.  </li>
            <li>Well first off let me say I was hesitant on purchasing due to many negative reviews.  </li>
            <li>Left actual burns on my more sensitive areas and the rest of my chest/stomach area was raw and sensitive for days afterwards.</li>
            <li>What I mean by that is mainly that this product was not designed to work on a full blown jungle of chest hair</li>
            <li>This seller definitely came thru with shipping the item in a very timely manner and actually got the product to me before the estimate arrival date.  </li>
            <li>I may have worked harder at it, but the results were consistent overall</li>
            <li>Ten minutes later I&#x27;ve got the ears of an eight year old!</li>
            <li>looking at electrolysis hair removal since it may be a large amount of money to pay to remove hair, but it is guaranteed &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; saving me minor expenses later multiplied over countless years of my life.</li>
            <li>So much easier and safer than shaving down there.</li>
            <li>Shaving may be a lot of work, but there is less cost, less time consumed in applying and waiting to shower, and the entire body can be completely shaven clean in a single sitting.</li>

            <li> There is promise in any product that can states it delivers an expected result.</li>
            <li> ( which is a fraction  of the time for any other cream)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trust me...use this and you will never use VEET or any other product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll look at other brands as well.</li>
            <li> Nair products always have a hard time removing coarse hair though o guess...</li>
            <li> it does burn a little..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a series of hair remover products but they all had two deficiencies; I had to use some sort of little makeshift spatula to get the stuff in my ears</li>
            <li> as the old screw off bottles let air in and rendered the product useless after a while.</li>
            <li> I was so frustrated with this product I simply threw it away, took up my shaver and shaving cream, took care of all of my arms and legs and other areas as well with only three squirts of shaving gel in about 25 minutes.</li>
            <li> and then it would slowly ooze out and down my neck.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I took a cloth and slowly started to wipe it off and guess what VOILA - Cleaner and smoother than a shave.</li>
            <li> and I have thick body hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m just using it wrong or if my skin just can&#x27;t handle nair</li>
            <li> you have sensistive skin it or broken skin</li>
            <li> Only use this if you are into feeling like you have had a bad sunburn!!!</li>
            <li> If that was the end of it I would give the product a five star but sadly</li>
            <li> Needless to say,I threw it awayThe</li>
            <li> Difficult to use</li>
            <li> but this was an extremely unpleasant experience for me both times that I tried it.</li>
            <li> This burnt my skin and I have a terrible rash like it was burnt by a flame thrower.</li>
            <li> This is terrible!</li>
            <li> It gave me severe chemical burns that caused some of the worst pain in my life.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Product was just as advertised.! Great size for the great price! I haven&#x27;t actually tried it yet, but I had a similar one before and it works great! Shipping was so quick too! It&#x27;s the first thing that got here out of my whole order! 👏👌</li>
            <li> it does burn a little if you have sensitive skin but the results are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;it works great and i only left it on for two mins. ( which is a fraction  of the time for any other cream)</li>
            <li> All it removed for me was skin. I am sure it works great for others but not me.</li>
            <li> Im not someone who writes reviews or helps promote a product. But trust me when is say this - NAIR is an awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You absolutely have to follow instructions and if you do ...your clean and new in less than 15 mins...&lt;br /&gt;You take good amounts of the cream and rub it onto your chest, within 3 mins I took a cloth and slowly started to wipe it off and guess what VOILA - Cleaner and smoother than a shave. Took a shower and was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensistive skin it or broken skin it does burn a little..but so does your cheek when you use after shave post a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me...use this and you will never use VEET or any other product again.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic, especially for the nads.  So much easier and safer than shaving down there.</li>
            <li> does what its suppose to</li>
            <li> Works well with no burn.</li>
            <li> I have no problem with burning, just follow directions</li>
            <li> It works and pretty good, but you MUST spot check first.  If it irritates you or you have an allergic reaction... good luck.  It&#x27;s already a bit uncomfortable due to the smell and texture so you want to make sure it&#x27;s okay for your skin.  It is convenient.</li>
            <li> Definitely deserves a five star, very hairy young male and I couldn&#x27;t believe what nair did for me, after two uses hair is coming out thinner and it seems like it closed some hair follicles because i feel a lot of smooth spaces, didn&#x27;t have any reaction what so ever even after I left the product on for more than 10 minutes on certain areas because of the thickness of the hair, very pleased would recommend to anyone and would buy again but don&#x27;t think I will need to.</li>
            <li> Its a good product. I like it</li>
            <li> Smells great! Works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> worked ok but needed to keep on longer than instructed</li>
            <li> received it and used it works great will get more when I run out</li>
            <li> It works very well. I used it and it removes the hair. The smell is bad but it is effective and did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m just using it wrong or if my skin just can&#x27;t handle nair but this was an extremely unpleasant experience for me both times that I tried it. Left actual burns on my more sensitive areas and the rest of my chest/stomach area was raw and sensitive for days afterwards. Does it remove most if not all the hair you want it to? Yes. Would more clear instructions for use be beneficial? Also YES. What I mean by that is mainly that this product was not designed to work on a full blown jungle of chest hair like I&#x27;m rocking most of the time. It worked much better the second time around when I used and electric trimmer to buzz the hair first. After trying my best to make it work twice though the pain and irritation (also, the terrible smell of burning hair during use) made me decide to just throw the rest of the bottle out.</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing! If you carefully follow the instructions you will get perfect results. Applied a fair amount on chest and back &amp; within minutes all the hair washed off. Beats paying too much $$ for waxing. Definitely will be buying this all the time.</li>
            <li> Remove everything including your skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome, almost like swiss army knife, it just gobbles the hair. Just be very careful not to get it into your eyes since it uses some very strong alkaline materials.</li>
            <li> Nope.  White male here and it doesn&#x27;t work at all on the &#x27;netherlands ..... there&#x27;s much better and effective stuff out there.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t remove all of the hair, even when I used it for longer than the instructions say to. Nair products always have a hard time removing coarse hair though o guess...</li>
            <li> works like a charm..just don&#x60;t leave onto long..</li>
            <li> This is not recommended. This burnt my skin and I have a terrible rash like it was burnt by a flame thrower. Only use this if you are into feeling like you have had a bad sunburn!!!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. The Nair Men hair removal system is quick, easy &amp; painless hair removal.</li>
            <li> Works far better than expected, even on coarse hair. It did not burn my skin or irritate it much (very light irritation, but expected). I was amazed to see it simply remove hair. Kept on for about 5-7 minutes total and wiped off with a damp rag in the shower. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Single use. You CAN&#x27;T use it on your head or face. I&#x27;m a guy, why would I want this if I can&#x27;t use it for my beard or head? The whole bottle is equivalent to 2 legs. Great if you only regularly shave your knuckle hair and want an alternative.</li>
            <li> Works great but the plastic pump broke after two uses</li>
            <li> Works great but don&#x27;t leave on to long</li>
            <li> Well first off let me say I was hesitant on purchasing due to many negative reviews.  This seller definitely came thru with shipping the item in a very timely manner and actually got the product to me before the estimate arrival date.  I personally have very coarse hair and ever this in patches.  I never expected to get all of it in one application which came true.  Following the directions it was all to remove the hair ever easily and painlessly (for the recommended areas- I accidentally got some on &amp;#34;the fellas&amp;#34; and let me tell you it burns like napalm. But that is not the products fault) I did have to reapply in some areas to get hair that was missed the first time.  If that was the end of it I would give the product a five star but sadly the claim of the product that I wanted to be try the most was a big let down.  That is the claim to be like you wont have to shave for days.  The very next morning I have stubble growing back and its like Velcro on all of my clothes.  That was the reason I stopped shaving my body years ago and looks like that will be the case again.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a local retail store and used it to get rid of unwanted hair.It does what it says and gets rid of the hair but OUCH! it burns and leaves red,painful splotches on the skin.Needless to say,I threw it awayThe older 8oz version of this product is better even though it&#x27;s slightly more time consuming and it does not burn or irritate the skin like this does.I&#x27;ll look at other brands as well.No product should hurt in order to work.</li>
            <li> It is not as effective as I thought thanks for trying</li>
            <li> The chemical is very strong on tender areas...you know where.</li>
            <li> It works great but smells horrible</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what people talking about it&#x27;s odor/burn smell. but this thing works. It&#x27;s better than veet actually, and I do have coarse hair I mind you. Just don&#x27;t wait too long between sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also doesn&#x27;t take me more than 30 min to finish my arms, abs and chest.</li>
            <li> This is what I&#x27;ve been looking for. I&#x27;m 65 and have been plagued by hair growing out of my ears. I was unsatisfied with trimmers. Difficult to use and I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the results. I&#x27;ve tried a series of hair remover products but they all had two deficiencies; I had to use some sort of little makeshift spatula to get the stuff in my ears and then it would slowly ooze out and down my neck.&lt;br /&gt;This product solves both of these and it WORKS! I can pump the cream right where I need it, in the lower part of my ear shell all the way up to and including the entry t.o the ear canal. It&#x27;s so thick that it stays right where I put it. Ten minutes later I&#x27;ve got the ears of an eight year old! And it doesn&#x27;t even smell! Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> WARNING: When using Nair please use an after shave lotion &amp; an ingrown hair prevention pmtreatments for a week. This will reduce your chances of irritation, bumps &amp; ingrown hairs which can become infected.</li>
            <li> The scent is way better than the original one, the sealable dispenser is a great idea...as the old screw off bottles let air in and rendered the product useless after a while. Its the same product under the skin but I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s a men&#x27;s version.  Worked fine on the areas I tried, no issues at all.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> There is promise in any product that can states it delivers an expected result. However, this product comes with conditions...a lot of them.&lt;br /&gt;1. You&#x27;ve got to apply A LOT of cream to the areas you want to remove hair.&lt;br /&gt;2. DO NOT RUB CREAM IN. APPLY SMOOTHLY over entire area in one stroke.&lt;br /&gt;2. You&#x27;ve got to apply it EVENLY AMONGST THE ENTIRE AREA you want to remove hair.&lt;br /&gt;3. ONLY FOR ARMS AND LEGS, NOT HEAD, NOT GENITALS, OR OTHER SENSITIVE AREAS.&lt;br /&gt;4. You CAN NOT exceed the 10 minute time frame.&lt;br /&gt;5. You MUST wash your hands after application.&lt;br /&gt;6. You MUST thoroughly wash with soap, the areas you have wiped clean of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my first issue. The instructions state to dispense cream into hand and apply evenly over areas where hair is to be removed. With that in mind, it took me three good pushes of the dispenser to gain the adequate amount necessary to &amp;#34;evenly&amp;#34; coat the areas where hair is to be removed...on one arm.&lt;br /&gt;And here is where it gets troublesome. Depending on the growth patterns of your arm/leg hair (patches vs stragglers), as well as hair strand sizes and lengths can dramatically effect how well this product performs. While some areas were easily wiped clean of hair, others were not over the same time period of 7 minutes in my case. Yes, I timed it. The chemical works at the same rate depending on chemical evenness over area, yet hair patches, sizes, lengths change the applicable wait time to properly kill the hair enough to be wiped off. I was so frustrated with this product I simply threw it away, took up my shaver and shaving cream, took care of all of my arms and legs and other areas as well with only three squirts of shaving gel in about 25 minutes. In contrast, in order to accommodate the wait time of 7 minutes without exceeding the time limit of 10 minutes, and &amp;#34;wipe&amp;#34; hair from both arms and legs with a damp towel &amp;#34;without letting the cream-covered areas come into contact with steam inthe shower&amp;#34; would take multiple applications over an entire week with variant results. Shaving may be a lot of work, but there is less cost, less time consumed in applying and waiting to shower, and the entire body can be completely shaven clean in a single sitting. I may have worked harder at it, but the results were consistent overall which is what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking at electrolysis hair removal since it may be a large amount of money to pay to remove hair, but it is guaranteed &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; saving me minor expenses later multiplied over countless years of my life. Efficient, consistent, economical, and low-maintenance. Sounds a lot better than working myself into an early financial grave for hygienically smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly,</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try nair because of how &amp;#34;painful&amp;#34; it was and how it felt &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; but honestly it&#x27;s not painful to me or does it feel like it&#x27;s burning. It feels more like itchy than anything else. It removed my hair just fine and I have thick body hair. I guess it just depends on how sensitive your skin is.</li>
            <li> This is terrible! It gave me severe chemical burns that caused some of the worst pain in my life. What&#x27;s in this stuff? Acid? It sure feels that way. It doesn&#x27;t even get rid of hair that well either. Please, I&#x27;m begging you, don&#x27;t buy this garbage.</li>
