            <li>My husband and I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite colognes.</li>
            <li>Hi All,  I was trying to find something sexy, and I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would like this perfume.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT...</li>
            <li>but girls absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>i love the smell of this</li>
            <li>Look--- is this my favorite fragrance?  </li>
            <li>Would gladly do repeat business with this vendor.</li>
            <li>Its ok.  </li>
            <li>Mostly my fault, but the pictures...</li>
            <li>but like many people have stated it wears off very quick</li>
            <li>Not too strong</li>
            <li>other than that, it is great and smells better than most colognes out there.</li>
            <li>Sexual is b y far one of my favorite colognes!</li>
            <li>First hour will be very strong.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>i enjoy and do enjoy........</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It was super strong.  </li>
            <li>One of the most amazing thing about this product is you can smell it for few days on your shirt or skin, all women like it, and it&#x27;s really Sexy (Sexual).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s my fault for not researching more, but for how much Amazon is trying to make it easy for you to impulse</li>
            <li>I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED THAT I PURCHASED THIS FRAGRANCE.</li>
            <li>, in my case it smells okay for the first hour</li>
            <li>I swear there is something special in this bottle.</li>
            <li>Dudes, everything you are reading about this cologne is right!</li>
            <li>Best part about this scent is that it&#x27;s not found on every second guy like an Acqua di Gio or D&amp;G Light Blue</li>
            <li>fantastic scent super masculine chics love the way it smells on me</li>
            <li>Wow...I was in a Winners Department Store, and saw this cologne and at first I thought it was another cheap cologne trying to cash in with</li>
            <li>Honestly in my opinion its a little more pungent than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember the amount of times girls have asked what I put on, or just simply said that I smelled nice to them.</li>
            <li>This has a classy, masculine, fairly understated scent that reminds me a bit of YSL.</li>
            <li>No lie EVERY SINGLE woman I have come across has told me how amazing I smell.</li>
            <li>I  bought this perfume for my husband and he likes it very much</li>
            <li>buy everything ever, with one-click and pay phrases and an intelligent behavior tracking heuristic, they really don&#x27;t try very hard to ensure accurate descriptions of their products.</li>
            <li>and since then I have been looking for it for a long time, finally I found it and at a great price</li>
            <li>I referred this to many male friends.</li>
            <li>My favorite can&#x27;t believe it i have paid $86 for the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>but it is an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; product that will smell really good after a few hours.</li>
            <li>Its soft grab and teaslingly poignant essence lends to its true nature of a sexual nature.....</li>
            <li>Every time I put on Sexual it feels like it&#x27;s too much, but its always just enough to bring them running.</li>
            <li>THIS MEN&#x27;S COLOGNE HAS A SOFT, FRESH, CRISP SMELL.  </li>
            <li>No to strong but seems to last.</li>
            <li>, I guess I will buy another one very soon</li>
            <li>and it was very well received.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t so much a review of the product itself, as it isn&#x27;t at all what I thought I was getting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon: Please vet customer images more carefully, or allow a flagging system to allow the community to do it for you (all I saw was a flag for abuse).</li>
            <li>I have been getting compliments on the way this cologne smells more than when i wear other colognes I have.</li>
            <li>Personally, this fragrance smells cheap and loud.  </li>
            <li>my expectations were high.  </li>
            <li>Definitely not the kind of scent you&#x27;d find everyday</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think its an original perfume inside of it other than the box and bottle.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t go too hard on it, two sprays on the chest and one on the back of the neck is more than enough.</li>
            <li>Most times you get really tired of the way just one cologne smells.</li>
            <li>out of 4 of the product pictures clearly show Sexual Secret by Michael Germain, which as I now know, is not the same thing as this.</li>

            <li> He had purchased Sexual several years ago on vacation and used it sparingly because he was afraid we could not find it locally.</li>
            <li> it last long for 2 days.</li>
            <li> The long and the short of it is that I bought this product because I trusted that what I saw in the picture was what I was getting.</li>
            <li> Maybe i got a batch that was in storage too long....</li>
            <li> cause all my other colognes last for a long time and i never get use to the smell as i can smell it all day.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was it seemed to wear off quicker than some other colognes I have.</li>
            <li> It is heavy and possibly should be only used at night</li>
            <li> I failed to do my homework and was looking for a different fragrance in the same line called Sexual Secret (a co-worker used it</li>
            <li> Absolutely not.  </li>
            <li> When I received it and smelled it, I was like &amp;#34;ewww&amp;#34; this is NOT what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how stupid I was paying FULL PRICE at major department stores for cologne.  </li>
            <li> I was naive and simply believed it</li>
            <li> As a previous post stated, it lasts for a very long time and it is not overwhelming.    </li>
            <li> but only is very small doses.</li>
            <li> but it is a hidden winner.</li>
            <li> This experience is with black women and a few Asians, so YMMV.</li>
            <li> It leaked out of the bottle a little</li>
            <li> i tend to pause a little and then say the name.</li>
            <li> Its a bit too heavy for summer in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Now I buy all of these products at AMAZON for almost half off!  </li>
            <li> and they only smelt a faint which is rather odd</li>
            <li> Use it everyday!</li>
            <li> However, the last bottle I bought had something wrong with it</li>
            <li> I have received the item, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t smell as same as the one I had before.</li>
            <li> or that at least by now the images would have been flagged and removed if they were incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I seriously could sit around all day smelling this</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY</li>
            <li> I have not gotten sick of it yet either</li>
            <li> VERY UNHAPPY CAMPER....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this cologne.  I always get compliments when I use it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best spray&#x27;s for men currently in the market. As a previous post stated, it lasts for a very long time and it is not overwhelming.    I would by this product again.     It would make a great gift for your special someone for the holidays.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells fantastic. Everyone I encountered commented on it and asked what it was. Three females actually said that it was the best cologne they had ever smelled. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was it seemed to wear off quicker than some other colognes I have.</li>
            <li> My husband really liked the smell of the perfume! I am happy that I received the perfume so quickly and that it was just what I wanted!!</li>
            <li> Sexual is b y far one of my favorite colognes! It is subtle yet intriguing especially to women, who by the way, ALWAYS want to smell me again and again...Its amazing!</li>
            <li> This is one of the sexiest smells I have and I seriously could sit around all day smelling this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed my co-worker around all day until he told me to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it the next day.</li>
            <li> I tried it once and since then I have been looking for it for a long time, finally I found it and at a great price, I guess I will buy another one very soon</li>
            <li> I  bought this perfume for my husband and he likes it very much and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> Its soft grab and teaslingly poignant essence lends to its true nature of a sexual nature..... i enjoy and do enjoy........</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews. I was in the movie theatre and this lady next to me asked me what I was wearing. I had on the Sexual cologne the night before yet she could still smell it on my skin (after showering by the way). When I told her the name, she said \\&quot;I see why its called that\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider it a night time cologne although its marketed as a day time.  I also prefer to wear it in the fall/winter/early spring.  Its a bit too heavy for summer in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this fragrance. We were do happy to find it again. He had purchased Sexual several years ago on vacation and used it sparingly because he was afraid we could not find it locally. Made his Christmas when he opened this gift!</li>
            <li> Great product and shipping was on time</li>
            <li> Great fragrance! Lots of compliments! Not too strong and it seems to last. One of my favorite colognes. Use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how stupid I was paying FULL PRICE at major department stores for cologne.  Now I buy all of these products at AMAZON for almost half off!  WHAT A DEAL!</li>
            <li> Every nose is different... with that being said, my take on this product is that for me, it was great! I can&#x27;t remember the amount of times girls have asked what I put on, or just simply said that I smelled nice to them.</li>
            <li> This scent is very sexy and I really enjoy it. I have not gotten sick of it yet either which is a big plus. Most times you get really tired of the way just one cologne smells.</li>
            <li> It is so sensual. I referred this to many male friends. Yummy.</li>
            <li> Hi All,  I was trying to find something sexy, and I wasn&#x27;t sure that I would like this perfume.  This is the best perfume I ever had, and I&#x27;ll buy more and more very soon.  One of the most amazing thing about this product is you can smell it for few days on your shirt or skin, all women like it, and it&#x27;s really Sexy (Sexual).</li>
            <li> THIS MEN&#x27;S COLOGNE HAS A SOFT, FRESH, CRISP SMELL.  I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED THAT I PURCHASED THIS FRAGRANCE. GREAT MEN&#x27;S FRAGRANCE!</li>
            <li> awesome still have it</li>
            <li> My favorite can&#x27;t believe it i have paid $86 for the exact same thing. I am so thrilled!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall for the name. If you want to deceive a girl or make a girl come and lick you in the neck, this is not the product you want. I was naive and simply believed it but it is an &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; product that will smell really good after a few hours. First hour will be very strong.</li>
            <li> Not inpress with the smell and it dose not hold up al day</li>
            <li> It does not smell&lt;br /&gt;Like what I had smelt beige man. I had a sample from Macy&#x27;s and I loved it! This stuff is different and it die sent last for&lt;br /&gt;More than 6 hrs! I only use it for the gym now. It should be cheaper for the quality</li>
            <li> BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS ONLINE... I WENT 2 MACY&#x27;S AND SPRAYED IT ON... LOVE IT... PURCHASE FROM U... DOES NOT SMELL THE SAME...!!!... I PURCHASE 2 BOTTLES ... NOT HAPPY AT ALL... VERY UNHAPPY CAMPER.... SEXUAL....!!!..&lt;br /&gt;JAMES........&lt;br /&gt;jwdisnuke@att.net</li>
            <li> Definitely not the kind of scent you&#x27;d find everyday but it is a hidden winner. It is heavy and possibly should be only used at night but girls absolutely love it. Just don&#x27;t go too hard on it, two sprays on the chest and one on the back of the neck is more than enough. Best part about this scent is that it&#x27;s not found on every second guy like an Acqua di Gio or D&amp;G Light Blue so you will immediately stand out.</li>
            <li> This has a classy, masculine, fairly understated scent that reminds me a bit of YSL. Very nice cologne and worth buying. However, the last bottle I bought had something wrong with it so I had to send it back - I had no smell to it.</li>
            <li> i love the smell of this but like many people have stated it wears off very quick, in my case it smells okay for the first hour then it vanishes after that....i know we adapt to the smell over time but i asked my friends and they only smelt a faint which is rather odd cause all my other colognes last for a long time and i never get use to the smell as i can smell it all day. Maybe i got a batch that was in storage too long....</li>
            <li> fantastic scent super masculine chics love the way it smells on me</li>
            <li> I have received the item, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t smell as same as the one I had before. I don&#x27;t think its an original perfume inside of it other than the box and bottle.</li>
            <li> Women love it!!! Always get good compliments.</li>
            <li> I saw this perfume in Macy&#x27;s. I tried over there and it last long for 2 days. I was amazed like voh!! . So, I ordered from amazon. Its fragrance goes in 10 mins. It also doesn&#x27;t smell same like the one I tried in Macy&#x27;s. Next time, I will buy from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Look--- is this my favorite fragrance?  Absolutely not.  I read all the reviews from everyone and listened to my bf rant and rave about it, so my expectations were high.  When I received it and smelled it, I was like &amp;#34;ewww&amp;#34; this is NOT what I expected.  It was super strong.  It leaked out of the bottle a little so I wrapped it up, put in the box it came in and I could still smell it.  Personally, this fragrance smells cheap and loud.  I can tolerate it though... but only is very small doses.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a gift. This smells absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> Wow...I was in a Winners Department Store, and saw this cologne and at first I thought it was another cheap cologne trying to cash in with&lt;br /&gt;a great name. I tried a sample and it was nice (reminded me of Jovan for Men, but better) Nevertheless I didn&#x27;t buy it, but when I stopped on my way home to pick up a couple of groceries, a very attractive cashier told me I smell great. It looks like I will be buying a bottle of this tomorrow</li>
            <li> My wife loves this scent on me. No to strong but seems to last.</li>
            <li> Dudes, everything you are reading about this cologne is right! I swear there is something special in this bottle. It&#x27;s like some kind of potion. No lie EVERY SINGLE woman I have come across has told me how amazing I smell. I put some in the middle of my chest, was on  date and i leaned over to show the girl something on my ipod and next thing i know, her face is buried in my chest because she is smelling me. Talking about how great I smelled.  I tried to talk to her about the pictures and she interrupted me every minute to remind me of how good I smell. I knew it had pheromones  and stuff, but didn&#x27;t know it had magic! I tried to test it on my cousin and ask her what makes this smell so good. She sprayed it on her arm and, honest to God, she would not remove her arm from her face for 15 minutes. This experience is with black women and a few Asians, so YMMV. Honestly in my opinion its a little more pungent than I&#x27;m used to. I like the mellow smell of Ferrari. Every time I put on Sexual it feels like it&#x27;s too much, but its always just enough to bring them running. It&#x27;s my go to home run cologne. If you are considering getting it, stop considering and buy!</li>
            <li> This is not the same fragrance! ! Don&#x27;t be fool with the price and pic.. I&#x27;ll advice you to buy at a retail store! !</li>
            <li> I have been getting compliments on the way this cologne smells more than when i wear other colognes I have. The only problem as someone else mentioned is when i am asked what cologne i am wearing. i tend to pause a little and then say the name. other than that, it is great and smells better than most colognes out there.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift and it was very well received. He loved it and he smelled great after he put it on.</li>
            <li> Met expectations most excellently! Arrived on time and exactly as described. Would gladly do repeat business with this vendor. Great experience all around!</li>
            <li> Its ok.  I prefer Calvin Klein Obsession.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hubby, and he smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t so much a review of the product itself, as it isn&#x27;t at all what I thought I was getting. I failed to do my homework and was looking for a different fragrance in the same line called Sexual Secret (a co-worker used it and I just had to know what it was!) Well what I didn&#x27;t realize is that the item on this page is a different product entirely. Mostly my fault, but the pictures...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 out of 4 of the product pictures clearly show Sexual Secret by Michael Germain, which as I now know, is not the same thing as this. I also didn&#x27;t realize they were customer images, but trusted that Amazon would have it&#x27;s stuff together and wouldn&#x27;t allow pictures of different products. or that at least by now the images would have been flagged and removed if they were incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my fault for not researching more, but for how much Amazon is trying to make it easy for you to impulse buy everything ever, with one-click and pay phrases and an intelligent behavior tracking heuristic, they really don&#x27;t try very hard to ensure accurate descriptions of their products. The long and the short of it is that I bought this product because I trusted that what I saw in the picture was what I was getting. I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon: Please vet customer images more carefully, or allow a flagging system to allow the community to do it for you (all I saw was a flag for abuse).</li>
