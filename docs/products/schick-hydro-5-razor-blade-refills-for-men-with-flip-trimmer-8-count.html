            <li>It is great.</li>
            <li>However, comfort is still excellent, the closeness is very nearly as good as the PG, the gel reservoir lasts and lasts, the fold-away blade top works great for edging, and best of all, I can get two weeks or more out of one blade--and I have a beard like copper wire.  </li>

            <li>So this is the cost of good close</li>
            <li>this is cheaper than gillette refills but just as good.  </li>
            <li>Good, sturdy, long-lasting blades as well.</li>
            <li>Exelent hydro 5 good price to</li>
            <li>This razor is loved by my husband and myself.</li>
            <li>good, close shave with no nicks or irritation.</li>
            <li>Bulk buying ie 8 blades also a good deal.</li>
            <li>Handle has a good heft to</li>
            <li>One of those blades you get in a 5 pack at the dollar store to me is about 50% as good as one of these.  </li>
            <li>and they cut good</li>
            <li>Good price for the amount I got.</li>
            <li>Love it and the price is great.  </li>
            <li>The price here online was great, and as always smooth shave!</li>
            <li>and they work great, better than all of the Headblade options I have tried.</li>
            <li>I still own and still use the Schick/Wilkinson 3-blade which is just about as good.</li>
            <li>was a good thing to get the 8 razors and husband liked the 8,only</li>
            <li>I received this razor for free and loved the close shave I received on my legs!</li>
            <li>This is the best shaving stuff I ever had....much better than any product available in todays Market...and price No one can ....</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>great product i love it , thanks for my schick hydro 5 blade , i recommend to buy one is a very good product !</li>
            <li>Love them!  </li>
            <li>Outstanding all the way around!</li>
            <li>Love this razor!</li>
            <li>I believe it was about 6 years ago that I picked up my boyfriend&#x27;s razor in the shower and realized that men&#x27;s razors are way better!  </li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>And at a better price !</li>
            <li>Easy to use and great job.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave, no nicks, and a great blade/handle combination.</li>
            <li>is amazing.</li>
            <li>They give you an amazingly close shave without creating the irritation you get from cheaper razors.</li>
            <li>Great, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Good but overkill for most of my shaving scenarios.  </li>
            <li>the blades seem to stay effective for longer(It</li>
            <li>I used it until the one blade included was worn out and then reordered the refills (nice work Schick).</li>
            <li>If you keep track of how many shaves you can get out of one razor, it works out to be fairly affordable.  </li>
            <li>The lotion/lubricant that comes on the blades provides a nice feel on my skin while shaving.  </li>
            <li>No wonder the scruffy look is so popular among men nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bottom line is that the Hydro 5 is one of the best razor&#x27;s out there, and reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li>If you have a heavy beard like me or just looking for an excellent razor, the Hydro 5 is your best bet.</li>
            <li>Excellent product fast shipping</li>
            <li>Good price for these blades, and yes, 5 IS better than 3.  </li>
            <li>Nice close shave ... on hubby&#x27;s beard and my legs.</li>
            <li>All in all, these are the best option for my dad and at a reasonable price at that.</li>
            <li>and I honestly don&#x27;t know how I used 1 blade for 2 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice not to have razor burn.</li>
            <li>The main reason I got this on Amazon is it was the best price at the time.</li>
            <li>I have mostly been a Gillette guy but these are very outstanding razors.</li>
            <li>Best new product I have tried in years.</li>
            <li>The best shave so far!</li>
            <li>Every tithing was very good Fast shipping</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving for years and these are by far the best I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>A $3.00 off coupon was unexpected, but every dollar saved is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Nice close shave and the each blade lasts for a many shaves.</li>
            <li>It is also the best for the price that I&#x27;ve seen thus far.</li>

            <li>Always was my favorite blade.</li>
            <li>Like having these delivered to my door and not having to remember to purchase more.</li>
            <li>Will buy more.  </li>
            <li>Ladies love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Schick Hydro 5 razor and blades for a couple of years now and love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Schick did provide a lubricant bar attached to the top of each blade.</li>
            <li>I have been satisfied with the shave etc.</li>
            <li>But since all of us have to shave from time to time, why not make it enjoyable and save some money in the process?</li>
            <li>Boy, am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure experience shaving had something to do with it, but I know for a fact that these blades play a role in the lack of nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>Love these blades.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite bladeS.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking 5 blades is too many for my not-so-thick beard.</li>
            <li>Favorite blades,  arrived on time.</li>
            <li>But to my surprise it&#x27;s better than gillette.</li>
            <li>Whatever they did for the lubrication slips along the top and bottom</li>
            <li>and I found I don&#x27;t have to use as many strokes.  </li>
            <li>best razor ever; been using the same one for years</li>
            <li>I use these mostly to shave my head</li>
            <li>I love these Schick blades.</li>
            <li>Awesome deal on a terrific product!  </li>
            <li>They shave better than the Mach 3.</li>
            <li>I have tried them all and these are my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love these blades.  </li>
            <li>It gives me a mostly close shave.</li>
            <li>much as I love Amazon and shop from them, razors aren&#x27;t one of those items I like to buy online.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great blades and much cheaper than chain store</li>
            <li>I used the Gillette Fusion blades for many years and found the Schick Hydro 5 to be as comparable at a lower price.</li>
            <li>For some reason the shave protection seemed better.</li>
            <li>C&#x27;mon how many razors have 5 blades almost none these razors rock and they knock the socks of any Gillette product</li>
            <li>I love these blades.</li>
            <li>I am a chick, yet feel the mens&#x27; razors are just better and don&#x27;t have any frou frou lotions surrounding the blade.</li>
            <li>I am female and I use these razors because I think they are the best out there.</li>
            <li>And I love the smooth glide!</li>
            <li>These blades provide a nice close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It is smooth working and effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand and model of razor for many years.  </li>
            <li>Smoother shave, longer lasting than any Gillette blade, together with King of Shaves Alphagel shaving cream the best shaving experience.</li>
            <li>what I wanted - been using for many years</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>, you can order all of these blades in bulk if you really like them and want to stick with them, so DSC is not that great of a</li>
            <li>He says it does better with his ingrown hair.</li>
            <li>The Schick blade cartridges are wider, top to bottom, to allow more blades in one cartridge.  </li>
            <li>plus I just use my bar soap for lather, the blade gives me a smooth feel!</li>
            <li>Would buy again when I need more.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you rinse them often from the backside</li>
            <li>One thing is for sure, it keeps your face moist and hydrated while you cut.</li>
            <li>Like many men out there, I got into the &amp;#34;old fashioned shaving&amp;#34; trend for awhile.</li>
            <li>, I can confidently say now that most of those selling points were bullcrap.</li>
            <li>This thing is so much better, in so many ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well... you can get Schick Hydro 5 replacement cartridges for slightly more, and the result is a simpler, quicker, more soothing shave.</li>
            <li>Having said that, I always knew that a better blade could be made just as I always knew that a car could be manufactured that gets 150 miles per gallon or more (a mechanical engineer proved this to me over 40 years ago).</li>
            <li>Most others I get about 1 week.</li>
            <li>I use to buy the cheap razors and never understood that they were ripping up my face!</li>
            <li>: my face feels so much better</li>
            <li>My husband, and I love these!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would definately recommend this blade to anyone who wants a good shave, and is mindful of the value in buying good blades over cheap blades.</li>
            <li>I get twice as many shaves that way.</li>
            <li>so even though these refills cost a bit more than some others they make up for it with longevity and performance.</li>
            <li>Better than Gillette.</li>
            <li>The gillette top blade always cuts me, whereas schick has a guard.</li>
            <li>Great value &amp; fast shipping, as always.</li>
            <li>Save your money and get more service out of these blades; they can take it.</li>
            <li>So much better than a disposable razor.</li>
            <li>I like these better than Gillette.  </li>
            <li>The cartridges also last somewhat longer and the liquid conditioner release is awesome.</li>
            <li>Men&#x27;s blades are invariably better than what is marketed to women; I had been using the Gilette Mach-something but moved on to these when my husband started using them.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many I&#x27;ve tried...</li>
            <li>What more can one ask for.</li>
            <li>I am able to buy 16 at a time.  </li>
            <li>though, I might try to buy more replacement blades, but it might just be time to move on to a newer razer model as well.</li>
            <li>They just work better than anything else.</li>
            <li>Love these razors.  </li>
            <li>I am going on week number 7 and even though most of the gel is gone from the reservoir I haven&#x27;t detected the slightest amount of burning or irritation as of yet.  </li>
            <li>I love these, they get the closest shave of anything ive ever owned, I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>The blades are great and gentle on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have to go over my face more times and one lasts me about 2 months.</li>
            <li>I love these razors</li>
            <li>love these blades,.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite blades to date.</li>
            <li>I get a nice smooth shave every time.</li>
            <li>Better deal than you can find at the store.  </li>
            <li>However, the more I&#x27;ve used them and compared to others (3 blade Gillette)</li>
            <li>and I think these do a better job</li>
            <li>Besides the gel, the blades are definitely the best I have used</li>
            <li>The price could be better, but these are my favorite blades and they delivered them to my house.</li>
            <li>I really love the aloe on the tips of these blades.</li>
            <li>Love the price and the one time coupon I got.</li>
            <li>and I find that the Schick Hydro 5 blade system works much better than the Gillette system.  </li>
            <li>Love these razors and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
            <li>love it my husband uses it a lot</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>That would depend on your beard :-)...</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Now with the subscription service, I can get them at a good price right to my door.</li>
            <li>Good deal if the price is right</li>
            <li>The five blades shaves the hair super close and is very comfortable!</li>
            <li>n is very friendly on my skin</li>
            <li>best blades last long and cut well and having 5 of them is the perfect amount for my face</li>
            <li>It always gets the job done with a nice, clean shave, and I have yet to get any razor bumps.</li>
            <li>The blades themselves get a nice, clean shave every time.</li>
            <li>This package of high quality blades represents about a year of shaving for me, and all at a great price.</li>
            <li>They work pretty good.</li>
            <li>And the price is pretty good for an 8 pack.</li>
            <li>These razor blades work pretty good.</li>
            <li>Great price, new blades to shave the head</li>
            <li>product is amazing and the shipping was really quick</li>
            <li>Good and very and better price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that some men enjoy DE shaving as pastime and artform, but it&#x27;s not for most of</li>
            <li>They really give a wonderful, close and smooth shave and they last a good amount of time.  </li>
            <li>The price was very good when compared to local stores.</li>
            <li>For years I used Gillette products - most recently the Fusion: a nice design and good functional shaver.</li>
            <li>Great Product  for those who have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is better than my 3 Blade Razor.&amp;#34; As I was drying my wife turned on the light</li>
            <li>My wife first got the Schick Hydro 5 with a free coupon and I loved</li>
            <li>But the Schick&#x27;s are more comfortable.</li>
            <li>This is the most comfortable and close shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a disposable razor.  </li>
            <li>and I think they shave better than the cheap disposable ones.</li>
            <li>the refil wouldn&#x27;t pop off the handle quite so easy.  </li>
            <li>The handle makes it easy to glide the blade across your skin.</li>
            <li>also I wish there was an easy way to remove the lube strip.</li>
            <li>Very well-made, giving a comfortable, close shave, with no face irritation, when used with a good shave foam.</li>
            <li>I totally love using these blades, they are so smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I like that part (and strongly recommend it).</li>
            <li>Like many here, I had shaved with Gillette for years prior to trying the Schick Hydro on a free trial (GREAT marketing move, Schick).  </li>
            <li>These razors are so much better than the older fashioned kind.  </li>
            <li>These are hands down the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>These are, hands down, the best blades I ever used..</li>
            <li>New blades at a good price.</li>
            <li>If you want to stick with the cartridge razor blades though, that is perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>I cut myself easily with cheap and/or disposable blades.  </li>
            <li>Same exact product, great value!</li>
            <li>Schick hydro 5 is by far the best blade i have used and the last me twice as long than fusion, best part is the blades are 1/2 the cost.</li>
            <li>Great blades for an extra close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s huge market capitalisation).</li>
            <li>I received Schick Hydro 5 in a bzzkit and tried them for free.  </li>
            <li>The hydrogel made the shave smooth and my skin felt smooth afterword.  </li>
            <li>They fit on the ladies schick hydro set up...except for way cheaper.  </li>
            <li>When cleaning the blades by lightly banging the handle against the side of the sink they tend to come off too often.</li>
            <li>This is an important feature in a box of disposable razor refills.</li>
            <li>Gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The blades last forever and they give a great close shave.</li>
            <li>Ask Obama how an minimum wage earner can afford these....should be free while he is in office</li>
            <li>The blades last longer and it gives a great shave every time i use it.</li>
            <li>She was always buying cheap razors.  </li>
            <li>I received a Schick Hyrdo 5 free, bundled with a two-pack of Edge shaving gel.</li>
            <li>I got a free razor in the mail and they hooked me for life.  </li>
            <li>I will never shave with the cheap 2 blade stuff again</li>
            <li>I recieved a free razor in the mail from Schick.  </li>
            <li>I was introduced to Hydro 5 Shick as a free sample on a Cruise Ship.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these blades for some time, and find them smooth, and longerlasting than most.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li>The Schick Hydro 5 gives me a close irritation free shave .</li>
            <li>but comfortable.</li>
            <li>So smooth</li>
            <li>I will admit though, if I&#x27;m shaving in the morning and have an important meeting, I use the Proglides.</li>
            <li>No nick and leaves skin baby smooth.</li>
            <li>If you are in the market for razor blades then these will fit the bill.</li>
            <li>smooth transaction.</li>
            <li>A SMOOTH SHAVE EVERYTIME</li>
            <li>The metal thingies that smooth the skin on each blade do this.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t fit the Gillette handle</li>
            <li>Smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I tried a free sample blade that Schick mailed to me</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t get the free sample, I never would have even given Schick a try.</li>
            <li>It provides a smooth shave every time I use it.</li>
            <li>Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom; no knicks.  </li>
            <li>every penny to get that smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Works great--the flip back edger is a great addition.</li>
            <li>These blades will give you a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>so smooth on skin</li>
            <li>But not as cheap as Dorco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gives an extremely smooth (no nick) shave.</li>
            <li>These are great, but I actually prefer the 3 blad option.</li>
            <li>this also helps with getting a precise shave</li>
            <li>but they are smooth.</li>
            <li>Smooth shaving experance.</li>
            <li>Use lightly and change weekly or every 2 weeks at the longest.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling baby smooth.</li>
            <li>After seven weeks I&#x27;m still getting a smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable and balanced.</li>
            <li>nice blades shave well at a reasonable price compare to store prices,also the service was fast,i would buy this product again</li>
            <li>The strips do not seem to wear out as fast as the Fusion blades do and they retain water better, contributing to a better shave.</li>
            <li>ten or more good shaves from each blade.</li>
            <li>The Hydro 5 offers a superior shave.</li>
            <li>thanks!!!</li>
            <li>I still enjoy lathering up classic shaving cream (the kind that comes in tubs).</li>
            <li>I still enjoy lathering up classic shaving cream (the kind that comes in tubs).</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, it&#x27;s smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Resonably price and original replacements</li>
            <li>With the addition of aloe to the lubrication strip, Schick Hydro 5 has significantly improved its soothing feel.  </li>
            <li>quick shave smooth shave</li>
            <li>The one-star knock, though, is owing to my inability to achieve a clean edge (on sideburns, etc.).  </li>
            <li>clean well despite the gel substance they leave behind&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is much more comfortable and won&#x27;t take as much layers of skin</li>
            <li>I have used thease blades for the past three years and fine this product to be the best for a good shave on a rough beard.  </li>
            <li>Good price but not as good as some other new shave club....</li>
            <li>Good blades, if only a bit $$.</li>
            <li>Give these a try - I really believe you will love them.</li>
            <li>I love that the skin guard (where the lotion/lubricant is located) folds back for when you need a more precise shave line.</li>
            <li>love these razors work very well.</li>
            <li>it is super close and clean.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pricey, but it is true that you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall good razor blades, I just wish you could buy them in bulk for a much larger discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have tried so many brands of razors and I never gave this brand a second glance until I began pretty extensive research on amazon for the best.</li>
            <li>I recommend using the Cremo Shave Cream which I just recently discovered - it&#x27;s really good for a close shave.</li>
            <li>Not bad price for number received.</li>
            <li>If you have fine to normal facial hair this product is going to make you so happy.</li>
            <li>sharp blades, great close shave</li>
            <li>The Hydro 5s are not quite as wonderful out of the box on the first shave in terms of closeness, so I make a few more passes than I have to with a brand new PG.  </li>
            <li>These blades cost much less and I get eight to ten great shaves out of one blade, unlike the three good shaves I got from Gillette.</li>
            <li>and I have to use a toothbrush to clean the hair off the blades to make the razor useful again.</li>
            <li>but there are so many different razors, I wasn&#x27;t sure where to begin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can shave quickly and closely without any concerns.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s because the Fusion blades shave more of the top layer of your skin off along with the hair, whereas these Schick blades glide over your skin and seem to cut the hair only.</li>
            <li>Great Product and much cheaper than in local stores</li>
            <li>I was reluctant to try these because I&#x27;ve heard a lot of friends say that 5 blades isn&#x27;t worth it, works the same as a 4 or even a good 3 blade.  </li>
            <li>and it really does do a good job with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>They have a learning curve (the injector has the lowest) but the shave is far more comfortable and way cheaper too.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly, to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li>It also will provide you with a quick and efficient cut.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the blades are so easy to clean that my &amp;#34;razor sharpening pad&amp;#34; (which really exists just to remove interstitial gunk) has become obsolete.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I received the Fusion proglide as a free promotion and it was by far the most costly per shave.</li>
            <li>My experience is that the M3s became&lt;br /&gt;dull quickly.  </li>
            <li>What I like most about this blade is that that Bluetip on the top tilts back allowing you to trim your mustache if need be.  </li>
            <li>Count yourself lucky if you don&#x27;t get MRSA.</li>
            <li>It can take over your face in 1 or 2 days, and your face can quickly sw&lt;br /&gt;ell</li>
            <li>Most razors actually hurt may face if I have more than a days growth.</li>
            <li>Only downside is a larger surface area, tougher for close spots, but no blade is perfect and these are the closest I&#x27;ve found to it.  </li>
            <li>buying them this way saved me quick a bit</li>
            <li>and I just love it - better than the ones especially designed for women.</li>
            <li>super shave.</li>
            <li>very good I am counting the days one razor gives me - up to 12 so far and still sharp and easy.</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased and have been using this razor for quite a while.</li>
            <li>Must used them with very hot water.</li>
            <li>Just what i needed and pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>I love these razors and it&#x27;s nice to not have to remember to buy them, it stops me from using that last blade for an entire month until I buy more.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t last a really long maybe a couple weeks at best.</li>
            <li>Why pay more for Gillette Fusion when this does as good a job, if not better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely the best razor that I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li>.. make sure you run the &amp;#34;conditioning bead strip&amp;#34; under hot water before use to emulsify it.. much cheaper than fusion- who can pay $20+ for 8-10 blades??</li>
            <li>I bought these on amazon because they are a much better price than anywhere else, the quality of the blades is much more advanced than Gillette, I used to used Gillette but the blades would last a few days at the most, if I used them more than that the blade would bend and cause me to get cuts on my head and face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure, they don&#x27;t have the same edge they had fresh out of the box; but even after a couple of months, they can cleanly and smoothly cut my bristly hair.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I found these quite a bit cheaper than in a certain &amp;#34;rollback&amp;#34; retail chain.</li>
            <li>and I liked it a little more that the Atra blades.  </li>
            <li>The 8 count package fit my wallet as much as my level of comfort.</li>
            <li>Fast and comfortable.</li>
            <li>these are the only kind of razors that my husband will use.</li>
            <li>The shave is nice and smooth and I can&#x27;t remember the last time I got so much as a nic.</li>
            <li>This refill pack was as expected for a good price.</li>
            <li>products.&lt;br /&gt;I have been thrilled with the Hydro 5 and will not go back to Gillette.</li>
            <li>You can flip back the lubricating strip and use it to hit more detailed areas like sideburns or under your nose.</li>
            <li>IT IS REALLY WORTH</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely worth upgrading to.</li>
            <li>My husband was very pleased because he usually pays much more.</li>
            <li>: these are worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is far better and 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li>These work much better for me, than the Schick Hydro 5 sensitive ones.  </li>
            <li>Those tend to cut me up, these work like a charm, no cuts and gives me a smooth, soft, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Cost too much to be worth using again...</li>
            <li>but I am not too thrilled about the gel above the blades.</li>
            <li>We now own three of them so that we always have a back up.</li>
            <li>8 cartridges worth the money.</li>
            <li>but the problem is that he&#x27;s always suffered with skin reactions on his neck (more sensitive area than the face).  </li>
            <li>So far I have been satisfied with quality of the blades.</li>
            <li>One of these can cover all of the hard-to-get depressions where a normal razor can&#x27;t easily get because of the bones sticking out, like around the knees.</li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>will cut right through it.  </li>
            <li>Right item.</li>
            <li>The Hydro 5 blades have a great lubricant which enables me to shave &amp;#34;against the grain&amp;#34; and not feel like my skin is raw.</li>
            <li>OMG the Hydro 5 is the BEST razor blade that I have ever experienced on my VERY TOUGH curly, black beard in the 50 years that I have been shaving.</li>
            <li>The blades don&#x27;t dull extremely easily, so I feel I got a good deal for the price paid.</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a new Super Razorblade on the block looking to take the Crown away from Gillette&#x27;s Fusion!</li>
            <li>I can use most single edge and injector razors somewhat comfortably against the grain there though.</li>
            <li>I love these Hydro 5 blades for the way they glide and their general longevity.  </li>
            <li>These blades will last a long time and with eight in a pack you are getting a really good value!  </li>
            <li>But these make it a little more enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>Still, I think it&#x27;s pretty impressive that I can use a single cartridge for roughly 3 months.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical of this idea, and never tried it before purchasing one of the razors about two years ago that was a great deal, and found the vibration was more beneficial than I</li>
            <li>I think the average person could easily go a month or more.  </li>
            <li>my need , thank you very much</li>
            <li>I like the pull back moisture strip, and the wide head makes shaving (especially after a warm shower) nice and easy.</li>
            <li>Clean, smooth shave, never gets any razor burn, and they last quite a while for a disposable razor.</li>
            <li>Great blade for my legs, hardly any nicks at all</li>
            <li>Exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li>Finally a blade that is cheaper and better than what Gillette is putting out.  </li>
            <li>*the top flips back</li>
            <li>/&gt;First it is no where near a maneuverable or comfortable against the contours of the face .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, isn&#x27;t that going to cut your face up?&amp;#34; In fact, you will get a closer shave with a double edged razor and I have nicked myself just as many times as I had with these exact razorblades.</li>
            <li>I used Gillette Fusion when I first started shaving, but I almost always cut my face.</li>
            <li>long lasting, great shave.</li>
            <li>So I am a female and this is my favorite razor ever.</li>
            <li>I ordered Schick Hydro 5 from Amazon and was skeptical that it would be as awesome as gillette.</li>
            <li>These blades cut close and last more than a month.  </li>
            <li>Most of all, they last through six uses.</li>
            <li>I really like the Schick and find it generally produces a smoother shave with greater ease.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t cost me more than going to the local barber</li>
            <li>First thing that I like is that the shaving stick can accommodate both the 3 and 5 blade refills.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many places that they make male razors better than female since they are used on the face rather than the legs, and I tend to agree.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>Schick places the blades farther apart, and they are thicker and of higher quality.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m willing to give it another chance or two.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what you see in stores</li>
            <li>I have never used a better blade and am definitely sold on The Schick Hydro 5.</li>
            <li>It works with no nicks or cuts for the first couple shaves.</li>
            <li>By far the best blades I&#x27;ve used, last forever, don&#x27;t cut me up, a bit wide of course</li>
            <li>Exactly like what you buy in the store, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I need the strip to get a smooth shave, but I don&#x27;t need it for anywhere near every stroke.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gillette blades cost a lot more and may not last as long as the Hydro 5 blades, but they win in one category - they actually work, unlike these.  </li>
            <li>beyond belief - for real!</li>
            <li>when I asked her to pick up a refill, the cost of these were way higher than&lt;br /&gt;the blades I had been using.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That was around 18 months or more ago and since then I&#x27;ve not returned back to Gillette as I find the Schick provides a cleaner, closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave a lot better than Gillette and last longer too.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if someone creatively sent back their used ones in a package or if these were fakes.</li>
            <li>The sub &amp; save price is the best, Gillette fusion is way too expensive</li>
            <li>These were the first blades I used to shave</li>
            <li>Delivery was exactly as quoted.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted for about a month.</li>
            <li>This is the only razor that my husband use, and he love them...</li>
            <li>Only shaver that I use, quick shower saves as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>I love how easily it shaves and it leaves my skin super soft for so much longer than any other razor</li>
            <li>These cartridges are typically ridiculously expensive even at a very popular discount store, so when I saw them on Amazon for this price I was stoked !</li>
            <li>In fact because of how long the blades last most of your shaves will be better than with the fusion.</li>
            <li>the life of these razors shocked me they are cheap well made and help you get the best shave ever.</li>
            <li>Since there are more blades, one of these lasts a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>It last much longer and shaves better than any Gillette Fusion blades.</li>
            <li>Worked as good as the more expensive ones .</li>
            <li>The blade looks large at first; get over it.</li>
            <li>At this time the blades are selling for around one-half the price of the much less comfortable Gillette Fusion ($2 or so versus $3.75 or so per blade depending on where and when you buy them) and the best part is I get twice as many shaves per blade (six shaves for the Hydro versus just three for the Fusion) over the Fusion, but as things usually go these won&#x27;t last long as Hydro becomes more popular and Schick seeking greater profits as market share increases will also increase the Hydro&#x27;s price and make the blades less sharp.</li>
            <li>Even folding down the top part to get straight at the blades, the Schick just doesn&#x27;t edge as cleanly as the Gillette did.  </li>
            <li>I know my friends dread the high cost of such a simple item and the liked the gift!</li>
            <li>It is so comfortable that I barely notice it as I pull over and around by cowlickey beard.</li>
            <li>fast fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>Just as good or if not better then Gillette Fusion or Pro Glide and the Hydro 5 is cheaper in price</li>
            <li>This is not possible with the hydro as the blade will poop out easily every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy for trimming or getting rid of the entire beard.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, the Hydro 5&#x27;s handle is smaller and thinner, allowing you to flip the blade easily in your hand to change the direction of strokes.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, fast delivery, thanks</li>
            <li>Also does well on thick stubble, with hot water and good face lube.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended so I tried. ...and loved  long lasting too!</li>
            <li>They give me a good shave and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Finally, the guard at the top of the head pivots away from the blades allowing the blades to be placed precisely in tight places (think &amp;#34;under the nose&amp;#34;) and allows for more precision in trimming side burns.</li>
            <li>I switched from a variety of Gillette razors including some of their premium versions to Schick as a result of a promotion where I bought a Schick 5 blade at a large discount.</li>
            <li>Be sure to look at new products as they are introduced as they will do the same job at an introductory price.</li>
            <li>They work just fine same as the store</li>
            <li>Smooth shave, the blades were sharp and it even had this cool lubrication built in.</li>
            <li>The four blade schick are pretty decent as well.</li>
            <li>If you want that &amp;#34;sure thing&amp;#34; shave on a daily basis, save your money and instead buy Schick Extreme 3 triple blade, I find those work great, cost less, and are still more maneuverable than the Hydro 5.</li>
            <li>Blades last super long and give a very smooth shave without pulling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As described (genuine) from a third party seller (Fast Ship Consumer Outlet).</li>
            <li>Thanks Schick for continuing to strive forward.</li>
            <li>but then again who wants to pay those prices.</li>
            <li>Biggest difference I noticed was how smooth the shave felt, and how multiple passes were easier than the Gillette products.  </li>
            <li>They worked well, were decently cheap, and held up to last a couple weeks each cartridge.</li>
            <li>I am saving so much money.</li>
            <li>and I figured if I didn&#x27;t like them as much</li>
            <li>Nothing has worked very well.  </li>
            <li>It was so much cheaper to buy these through Amazon than it was even at Walmart.</li>
            <li>I really like these razors.</li>
            <li>Gets you really smooth, and the hydrating gel definitely helps to moisturize!</li>
            <li>Leave off the toxic strip, it doesn&#x27;t help that much.</li>
            <li>the hydration strip in these razors really help with the razor burn.</li>
            <li>I get a really close shave and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>That said, it would seem to me that Schick should really undercut the Gillette price if they really want to make a dent in Gillettes dominance in disposable blades.</li>
            <li>These are still my favourite blades to shave with as it gives a really close shave and the hydrating effect from the aloe vera is very hydrating indeed.</li>
            <li>Item as described -- fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Much prefer the Mach 3 to this razor.</li>
            <li>Retailers charge too much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, the cost for replacement cartridges is reasonable.</li>
            <li>the hydro wears out fast.</li>
            <li>Not only is the shave comfortable</li>
            <li>It is very reliable and has a competitive price.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>It shaves very well.</li>
            <li>I really like the schtick hydro 5</li>
            <li>Gel runs out fast and it gets a bit droopy and sticky during the shave.</li>
            <li>The only problem is they aren&#x27;t as available as the Gillette blades, so getting them online is the way to go.</li>
            <li>As a woman, there are so many hair removal products and pink razors out there.  </li>
            <li>Reasonable price compared to the competition.</li>
            <li>The vibrating head of the Schick shaver gives a really close shave</li>
            <li>and I really did save.</li>
            <li>I really like these blades.</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>So you go cheap and get the costco hundred pack of twin blades and cut up your face for several months or you pay for a decent razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This hydro blade has a dispensing latch on the back that makes it easier to clean, and may be the reason why this lasts so much</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think these blades are really significantly better than any other brand of multi-blade device.  </li>
            <li>The blades are not that sharp, do not rinse and more is not bettter.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is it does a better job than any other blade I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Would be a 5 but clogs up/harder to clean out than others with lesser blades</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, only issue is to get them when they are on special, otherwise cheaper at Walmart.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t even know about the blades special flip precision trimmer until my husband recently pointed it out.</li>
            <li>have pretty sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This new Hydro 5 shave system gives me the absolutely closest shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li>Better shaves, less money; who could complain?&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>I am most likely going to be shifting back to Gillette</li>
            <li>The real deal (to me) is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>They came as advertised and at decent price.</li>
            <li>and I have to use a new one twice as fast as the cheap single blade razor.  </li>
            <li>I mean, a single unit will last you up to a year... and the good stuff smells better than cologne.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mean, a single unit will last you up to a year... and the good stuff smells better than cologne.&lt;br</li>
            <li>She was so very pleased with the price compared to prices she had paid at drug , grocery and big box stores on previous occasions .</li>
            <li>highly recommend using these blades.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Tough to clean - problem with many multi-blades.</li>
            <li>These blades are shave very smooth and last for a LONG time.</li>
            <li>Works okay, a little cheaper here than in the stores</li>
            <li>The Hydro 5 is a little better than the 3</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp and rinse well and easily.</li>
            <li>They are easy on his super sensitive skin and don&#x27;t cause excessive razor rash and bumps</li>
            <li>Great blades but expensive.</li>
            <li>I like this razor, and am happy to save some money on the replacement blades, although they are still ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li>I normally use the Schick twin-blade disposables and occasion the triple blade.  </li>
            <li>One of my top concerns whe purchasing razor blades is how long will they last.  </li>
            <li>It would be great if they were a little less exp</li>
            <li>I did a head to head, right side left side test with Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li>they hooked me when i first tried it out on a promo a few years ago  , best shave with the least irritation i had given myself in so long.</li>
            <li>I knew I needed to try something new</li>
            <li>I am a long-time Gillette fan, but decided to try this new Schick razor.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without my Hydro 5</li>
            <li>actually last longer than any I&#x27;ve used, I can generally get 4-5 full shaves from one cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for guys with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, so</li>
            <li>do usually have more irritation than I would have with Gillette Proglide</li>
            <li>These razors were designed to shave the most intricate areas like cheekbones and upper lips on men, so why would a lady&#x27;s knee or above the ankle be any different?  </li>
            <li>They cut clean, and stay sharp.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Again for comfort I highly recommend razors such as GEM, Ever Ready, and Schick injectors.</li>
            <li>Smooth, comfortable shave, less irritation than Fusion, slightly cheaper cartridges, releases conditioner.</li>
            <li>I typically shower without the light on.</li>
            <li>Its not harsh on the skin,and my skin is very sensitive .</li>
            <li>first it took me a few days to get used to the bulkier shaver (which I now like better) and the ability to go over the same area several times.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave and a single cartridge will last me 2-3 months.  </li>
            <li>I shave less frequently now, the blades last for many shaves.</li>
            <li>And on top of me receiving a product that I didn&#x27;t fully expect, using the blades feels exceptionally dull.</li>
            <li>I only used the razor once so far, but it worked really well.  </li>
            <li>With this one he gets a clean shave and a lot less issues with bumps and cuts.  </li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised with quality.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Second the design does not let you close nose- lip intersection or provide precision near the sideburns .</li>
            <li>but these last much longer</li>
            <li>If you have a dimple or, say, if you want to get into constricted spaces (like the hairs directly under your nose) it will be a lot tougher to get to those areas than a twin blade.  </li>
            <li>I like these refills, though I prefer the ones made specifically for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a relatively young guy, all of 25</li>
            <li>Edge for Sensitive Skin Shaving Gel</li>
            <li>Each blade lasts me about five days, but that fifth day is nearly lube-less.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and these don&#x27;t bother my skin at all.</li>
            <li>These last so much longer than Mach 3 and and have smoother edges</li>
            <li>I tried out another shaver, but it was far inferior to the Hydro 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Naturally, I signed up for the 6 blade razor they offered.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than the ones bought locally at Wally World!</li>
            <li>if Old Bond Street Sandalwood cream.</li>
            <li>Exactly as expected - this is the same that I buy in the local stores but at a better price</li>
            <li>I never entertained this type of item before and was really surprised by the quality of the 5 razors.  </li>
            <li>(Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus - which has become a common staph infection that is resistant to most antibiotics)</li>
            <li>Saved a few bucks with the free shipping too.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin on my face.  </li>
            <li>They hurt my face like an old blade.  </li>
            <li>I used use the old shick razor and blades.</li>
            <li>nicks or bleeding with this blade on my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>I have purchased disposable razors, which still cost about a third of the cost of these razors, but I am ready to toss them after half a dozen shaves, which, in the long run, I find more value in purchasing these razor blades over disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily for me, I don&#x27;t shave much in the mornings, it&#x27;s usually at night</li>
            <li>If you are staying clean shaven every morning, there&#x27;s no need to use this Hydro 5 product for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>Love the Hydro 5, did not love the hassle of having to find someone at the store (if they actually had the blades) to unlock the plastic case used to prevent theft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a place that sold these razor refills</li>
            <li>but they do last a long time when keep clean and  only trim that close twice a week.</li>
            <li>My beard is not very heavy.</li>
            <li>No more bumps n smooth head.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long time Gillette user, but I switched to these about 4 months ago because the Gillette Fusion blades, in addition to shaving very close, also seem to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin and these blades give me the smoothest closest shave of any other razor I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I have very corse facial hair which grows in all different directions.  </li>
            <li>My criticism is that blades are very expensive but this applies to most, if not all, blades!!  </li>
            <li>The price on this was better than on several other sites we visited and 8 blades should last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I will recommend this product to all my friends and family, to anyone in general!</li>
            <li>These razors last far longer than just throwing them out after the gel stuff is gone!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every major brand of shaver, and this s the one I have decided to sue long-term.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These items are all monopolized and we have no other choice then to shell-out mega bucks for these penny-worth razors.</li>
            <li>I used no other razor now ...</li>
            <li>using my last blade for about 2yrs, didn&#x27;t work really well and was rough on my skin, shaving cream helped it shave like normal though.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t like having to snap the top half of the razor down for those close spots (like under the nose).  </li>
            <li>Since I have such a thick beard that grows quickly, I realized I was going to need a real razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When combined with SH shaving cream and Bump Fighter aftershave, I highly recommend this product particularly for Black men.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Schick blades are simply a better product, last longer and cost less money than the other brands.</li>
            <li>The razor blades are very efficient and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive facial skin, below is a list of the products I use</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s my technique, and I&#x27;ll learn the trick, but I havent so far after several months of use.</li>
            <li>No drag.</li>
            <li>These are the only blades my husband will use on his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The blades last a long time and no more ripping my face up with cheap blades!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care how long these blades last, or how inexpensive they are - they barely perform the task they&#x27;re supposed to.  </li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t ever go back to the old ones.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to my old brand.</li>
            <li>I shave 4 to 5 times a week and would assume I have a pretty average rate of growth.  </li>
            <li>Like so many I&#x27;ve become tired of paying four dollars a cartridge at Costco (even) for the Gillette five blade cartridges.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used many different blades over my thirty some years of shaving, and would rank these blades among the top.  </li>
            <li>good parts: These are not near as expensive as Gillette&#x27;s five blade models.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>What I really like is the fact that the aloe seems to last right up until the blades start to get dull.</li>
            <li>last a long time and much cheaper than other brands, also much cheaper than buying at a store.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>He has fairly sensitive skin, and he said they really helped get a close shave with less irritation.</li>
            <li>The moisture strip is silly because it will all come off if you don&#x27;t keep the razor dry, but the blades give a good close shave.</li>
            <li>I only use this razor to shave my head each morning; my face is much too sensitive for anything other than a Braun electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>Not too much to say other than they work like razor blades.</li>
            <li>Much lower in price than the other brand.</li>
            <li>So far I have tried Mach 5 and other men&#x27;s razors, but Schick Hydro 5 has definitely been my favorite for the past several years.  </li>
            <li>This product is fabulous and works for at least 2 weeks (daily shaving).</li>
            <li>Secondly, the ability to scoop back the aloe/wet-bead head for a shaving near nose and side-burns is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In all honesty the Gillette fusion is a little bit better, but the hydro is less expensive and you will get a lot more shaves per blade.</li>
            <li>They last much longer and shave closer than any other product on the market.  </li>
            <li>I can use one blade for at least 2 weeks of shaves, as compared to most other blades which will give me 1 to 1.5 weeks at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;But if you, like me, got tired of hacking your face to bits... and spending half an hour or more using classic razors... and you could not find the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; aesthetically pleasing handle (for a Mach 3 or whatever)...</li>
            <li>/&gt;But if you, like me, got tired of hacking your face to bits... and spending half an hour or more using classic razors... and you could not find the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; aesthetically pleasing handle (for a Mach 3 or whatever)...</li>
            <li>also wanted to point out that the area above the blades flips back allowing you to shave the area above your lip directly below your nose.  </li>
            <li>Not sure how much bigger they can go, but I did the half face test (half another razor) and these really did work better.</li>

            <li> These razors blades work great.</li>
            <li> It is great.</li>
            <li> However, comfort is still excellent, the closeness is very nearly as good as the PG, the gel reservoir lasts and lasts, the fold-away blade top works great for edging, and best of all, I can get two weeks or more out of one blade--and I have a beard like copper wire.  </li>

            <li> These are good razor blades .</li>
            <li> good product thank you schick</li>
            <li> /&gt;Schick might be a good, lower cost alternative for shaving.  </li>
            <li> The Schick Hydro with 5 blades is quite good.</li>
            <li> i think except for cost of shipping a good purchase</li>
            <li> good, reliable,</li>
            <li> good product and value</li>
            <li> I am delighted with this item</li>
            <li> Cheaper than at target and its a good blade</li>
            <li> Best blades available.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m told there just as good, cheaper</li>
            <li> So this is the cost of good close</li>
            <li> this is cheaper than gillette refills but just as good.  </li>
            <li> Good, sturdy, long-lasting blades as well.</li>
            <li> Exelent hydro 5 good price to</li>
            <li> This razor is loved by my husband and myself.</li>
            <li> good, close shave with no nicks or irritation.</li>
            <li> Bulk buying ie 8 blades also a good deal.</li>
            <li> Handle has a good heft to</li>
            <li> One of those blades you get in a 5 pack at the dollar store to me is about 50% as good as one of these.  </li>
            <li> and they cut good</li>
            <li> Good price for the amount I got.</li>
            <li> Love it and the price is great.  </li>
            <li> The price here online was great, and as always smooth shave!</li>
            <li> and they work great, better than all of the Headblade options I have tried.</li>
            <li> I still own and still use the Schick/Wilkinson 3-blade which is just about as good.</li>
            <li> was a good thing to get the 8 razors and husband liked the 8,only</li>
            <li> I received this razor for free and loved the close shave I received on my legs!</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving stuff I ever had....much better than any product available in todays Market...and price No one can ....</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> great product i love it , thanks for my schick hydro 5 blade , i recommend to buy one is a very good product !</li>
            <li> Love them!  </li>
            <li> Outstanding all the way around!</li>
            <li> Love this razor!</li>
            <li> I believe it was about 6 years ago that I picked up my boyfriend&#x27;s razor in the shower and realized that men&#x27;s razors are way better!  </li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> And at a better price !</li>
            <li> Easy to use and great job.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave, no nicks, and a great blade/handle combination.</li>
            <li> is amazing.</li>
            <li> They give you an amazingly close shave without creating the irritation you get from cheaper razors.</li>
            <li> Great, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Good but overkill for most of my shaving scenarios.  </li>
            <li> the blades seem to stay effective for longer(It</li>
            <li> I used it until the one blade included was worn out and then reordered the refills (nice work Schick).</li>
            <li> If you keep track of how many shaves you can get out of one razor, it works out to be fairly affordable.  </li>
            <li> The lotion/lubricant that comes on the blades provides a nice feel on my skin while shaving.  </li>
            <li> No wonder the scruffy look is so popular among men nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bottom line is that the Hydro 5 is one of the best razor&#x27;s out there, and reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li> If you have a heavy beard like me or just looking for an excellent razor, the Hydro 5 is your best bet.</li>
            <li> Excellent product fast shipping</li>
            <li> Good price for these blades, and yes, 5 IS better than 3.  </li>
            <li> Nice close shave ... on hubby&#x27;s beard and my legs.</li>
            <li> All in all, these are the best option for my dad and at a reasonable price at that.</li>
            <li> and I honestly don&#x27;t know how I used 1 blade for 2 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice not to have razor burn.</li>
            <li> The main reason I got this on Amazon is it was the best price at the time.</li>
            <li> I have mostly been a Gillette guy but these are very outstanding razors.</li>
            <li> Best new product I have tried in years.</li>
            <li> The best shave so far!</li>
            <li> Every tithing was very good Fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is by far the best feature about these close shaving blades.</li>
            <li> Wow what a great shave!</li>
            <li> Best blades I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely nice to just be able to order on line and save a couple of bucks in the process.</li>
            <li> These blades are by far the best blades I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for years and these are by far the best I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> A $3.00 off coupon was unexpected, but every dollar saved is awesome.  </li>
            <li> Nice close shave and the each blade lasts for a many shaves.</li>
            <li> It is also the best for the price that I&#x27;ve seen thus far.</li>
            <li> They are by far the best razors I have found.</li>
            <li> it feels like a loving girl touching your face....smooth.....</li>
            <li> This Schick is by far thr best shave ever.</li>
            <li> they work pretty good but not as good as Gillette</li>
            <li> A STRONG BUY!</li>
            <li> This shaving blades are of great quality and what a great smooth soft skin it leaves after its use.</li>
            <li> It takes me about 7 more minutes to shave &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; but I get the closest shave I have ever experienced, I enjoy my shaving experience for once, and most importantly?</li>
            <li> Very smooth, sails through a 3 or 4 day beard stubble.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and effective</li>
            <li> One of my favorite shaving blades very smooth to use.</li>

            <li> Great shave, very close, very smooth, just with</li>
            <li> Always was my favorite blade.</li>
            <li> Like having these delivered to my door and not having to remember to purchase more.</li>
            <li> Will buy more.  </li>
            <li> Ladies love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Schick Hydro 5 razor and blades for a couple of years now and love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Schick did provide a lubricant bar attached to the top of each blade.</li>
            <li> I have been satisfied with the shave etc.</li>
            <li> But since all of us have to shave from time to time, why not make it enjoyable and save some money in the process?</li>
            <li> Boy, am I glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure experience shaving had something to do with it, but I know for a fact that these blades play a role in the lack of nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> Love these blades.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite bladeS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking 5 blades is too many for my not-so-thick beard.</li>
            <li> Favorite blades,  arrived on time.</li>
            <li> But to my surprise it&#x27;s better than gillette.</li>
            <li> Whatever they did for the lubrication slips along the top and bottom</li>
            <li> and I found I don&#x27;t have to use as many strokes.  </li>
            <li> best razor ever; been using the same one for years</li>
            <li> I use these mostly to shave my head</li>
            <li> I love these Schick blades.</li>
            <li> Awesome deal on a terrific product!  </li>
            <li> They shave better than the Mach 3.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all and these are my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I love these blades.  </li>
            <li> It gives me a mostly close shave.</li>
            <li> much as I love Amazon and shop from them, razors aren&#x27;t one of those items I like to buy online.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great blades and much cheaper than chain store</li>
            <li> I used the Gillette Fusion blades for many years and found the Schick Hydro 5 to be as comparable at a lower price.</li>
            <li> For some reason the shave protection seemed better.</li>
            <li> C&#x27;mon how many razors have 5 blades almost none these razors rock and they knock the socks of any Gillette product</li>
            <li> I love these blades.</li>
            <li> I am a chick, yet feel the mens&#x27; razors are just better and don&#x27;t have any frou frou lotions surrounding the blade.</li>
            <li> I am female and I use these razors because I think they are the best out there.</li>
            <li> And I love the smooth glide!</li>
            <li> These blades provide a nice close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It is smooth working and effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand and model of razor for many years.  </li>
            <li> Smoother shave, longer lasting than any Gillette blade, together with King of Shaves Alphagel shaving cream the best shaving experience.</li>
            <li> what I wanted - been using for many years</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> , you can order all of these blades in bulk if you really like them and want to stick with them, so DSC is not that great of a</li>
            <li> He says it does better with his ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> The Schick blade cartridges are wider, top to bottom, to allow more blades in one cartridge.  </li>
            <li> plus I just use my bar soap for lather, the blade gives me a smooth feel!</li>
            <li> Would buy again when I need more.</li>
            <li> Just make sure that you rinse them often from the backside</li>
            <li> One thing is for sure, it keeps your face moist and hydrated while you cut.</li>
            <li> Like many men out there, I got into the &amp;#34;old fashioned shaving&amp;#34; trend for awhile.</li>
            <li> , I can confidently say now that most of those selling points were bullcrap.</li>
            <li> This thing is so much better, in so many ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well... you can get Schick Hydro 5 replacement cartridges for slightly more, and the result is a simpler, quicker, more soothing shave.</li>
            <li> Having said that, I always knew that a better blade could be made just as I always knew that a car could be manufactured that gets 150 miles per gallon or more (a mechanical engineer proved this to me over 40 years ago).</li>
            <li> Most others I get about 1 week.</li>
            <li> I use to buy the cheap razors and never understood that they were ripping up my face!</li>
            <li> : my face feels so much better</li>
            <li> My husband, and I love these!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would definately recommend this blade to anyone who wants a good shave, and is mindful of the value in buying good blades over cheap blades.</li>
            <li> I get twice as many shaves that way.</li>
            <li> so even though these refills cost a bit more than some others they make up for it with longevity and performance.</li>
            <li> Better than Gillette.</li>
            <li> The gillette top blade always cuts me, whereas schick has a guard.</li>
            <li> Great value &amp; fast shipping, as always.</li>
            <li> Save your money and get more service out of these blades; they can take it.</li>
            <li> So much better than a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> I like these better than Gillette.  </li>
            <li> The cartridges also last somewhat longer and the liquid conditioner release is awesome.</li>
            <li> Men&#x27;s blades are invariably better than what is marketed to women; I had been using the Gilette Mach-something but moved on to these when my husband started using them.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many I&#x27;ve tried...</li>
            <li> What more can one ask for.</li>
            <li> I am able to buy 16 at a time.  </li>
            <li> though, I might try to buy more replacement blades, but it might just be time to move on to a newer razer model as well.</li>
            <li> They just work better than anything else.</li>
            <li> Love these razors.  </li>
            <li> I am going on week number 7 and even though most of the gel is gone from the reservoir I haven&#x27;t detected the slightest amount of burning or irritation as of yet.  </li>
            <li> I love these, they get the closest shave of anything ive ever owned, I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> The blades are great and gentle on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have to go over my face more times and one lasts me about 2 months.</li>
            <li> I love these razors</li>
            <li> love these blades,.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite blades to date.</li>
            <li> I get a nice smooth shave every time.</li>
            <li> Better deal than you can find at the store.  </li>
            <li> However, the more I&#x27;ve used them and compared to others (3 blade Gillette)</li>
            <li> and I think these do a better job</li>
            <li> Besides the gel, the blades are definitely the best I have used</li>
            <li> The price could be better, but these are my favorite blades and they delivered them to my house.</li>
            <li> I really love the aloe on the tips of these blades.</li>
            <li> Love the price and the one time coupon I got.</li>
            <li> and I find that the Schick Hydro 5 blade system works much better than the Gillette system.  </li>
            <li> Love these razors and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
            <li> love it my husband uses it a lot</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> That would depend on your beard :-)...</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Now with the subscription service, I can get them at a good price right to my door.</li>
            <li> Good deal if the price is right</li>
            <li> The five blades shaves the hair super close and is very comfortable!</li>
            <li> n is very friendly on my skin</li>
            <li> best blades last long and cut well and having 5 of them is the perfect amount for my face</li>
            <li> It always gets the job done with a nice, clean shave, and I have yet to get any razor bumps.</li>
            <li> The blades themselves get a nice, clean shave every time.</li>
            <li> This package of high quality blades represents about a year of shaving for me, and all at a great price.</li>
            <li> They work pretty good.</li>
            <li> And the price is pretty good for an 8 pack.</li>
            <li> These razor blades work pretty good.</li>
            <li> Great price, new blades to shave the head</li>
            <li> product is amazing and the shipping was really quick</li>
            <li> Good and very and better price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that some men enjoy DE shaving as pastime and artform, but it&#x27;s not for most of</li>
            <li> They really give a wonderful, close and smooth shave and they last a good amount of time.  </li>
            <li> The price was very good when compared to local stores.</li>
            <li> For years I used Gillette products - most recently the Fusion: a nice design and good functional shaver.</li>
            <li> Great Product  for those who have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is better than my 3 Blade Razor.&amp;#34; As I was drying my wife turned on the light</li>
            <li> My wife first got the Schick Hydro 5 with a free coupon and I loved</li>
            <li> But the Schick&#x27;s are more comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable and close shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> and I think they shave better than the cheap disposable ones.</li>
            <li> the refil wouldn&#x27;t pop off the handle quite so easy.  </li>
            <li> The handle makes it easy to glide the blade across your skin.</li>
            <li> also I wish there was an easy way to remove the lube strip.</li>
            <li> Very well-made, giving a comfortable, close shave, with no face irritation, when used with a good shave foam.</li>
            <li> I totally love using these blades, they are so smooth and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I like that part (and strongly recommend it).</li>
            <li> Like many here, I had shaved with Gillette for years prior to trying the Schick Hydro on a free trial (GREAT marketing move, Schick).  </li>
            <li> These razors are so much better than the older fashioned kind.  </li>
            <li> These are hands down the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> These are, hands down, the best blades I ever used..</li>
            <li> New blades at a good price.</li>
            <li> If you want to stick with the cartridge razor blades though, that is perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> I cut myself easily with cheap and/or disposable blades.  </li>
            <li> Same exact product, great value!</li>
            <li> Schick hydro 5 is by far the best blade i have used and the last me twice as long than fusion, best part is the blades are 1/2 the cost.</li>
            <li> Great blades for an extra close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s huge market capitalisation).</li>
            <li> I received Schick Hydro 5 in a bzzkit and tried them for free.  </li>
            <li> The hydrogel made the shave smooth and my skin felt smooth afterword.  </li>
            <li> They fit on the ladies schick hydro set up...except for way cheaper.  </li>
            <li> When cleaning the blades by lightly banging the handle against the side of the sink they tend to come off too often.</li>
            <li> This is an important feature in a box of disposable razor refills.</li>
            <li> Gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The blades last forever and they give a great close shave.</li>
            <li> Ask Obama how an minimum wage earner can afford these....should be free while he is in office</li>
            <li> The blades last longer and it gives a great shave every time i use it.</li>
            <li> She was always buying cheap razors.  </li>
            <li> I received a Schick Hyrdo 5 free, bundled with a two-pack of Edge shaving gel.</li>
            <li> I got a free razor in the mail and they hooked me for life.  </li>
            <li> I will never shave with the cheap 2 blade stuff again</li>
            <li> I recieved a free razor in the mail from Schick.  </li>
            <li> I was introduced to Hydro 5 Shick as a free sample on a Cruise Ship.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades for some time, and find them smooth, and longerlasting than most.&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li> The Schick Hydro 5 gives me a close irritation free shave .</li>
            <li> but comfortable.</li>
            <li> So smooth</li>
            <li> I will admit though, if I&#x27;m shaving in the morning and have an important meeting, I use the Proglides.</li>
            <li> No nick and leaves skin baby smooth.</li>
            <li> If you are in the market for razor blades then these will fit the bill.</li>
            <li> smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> A SMOOTH SHAVE EVERYTIME</li>
            <li> The metal thingies that smooth the skin on each blade do this.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t fit the Gillette handle</li>
            <li> Smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I tried a free sample blade that Schick mailed to me</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t get the free sample, I never would have even given Schick a try.</li>
            <li> It provides a smooth shave every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom; no knicks.  </li>
            <li> every penny to get that smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Works great--the flip back edger is a great addition.</li>
            <li> These blades will give you a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> so smooth on skin</li>
            <li> But not as cheap as Dorco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gives an extremely smooth (no nick) shave.</li>
            <li> These are great, but I actually prefer the 3 blad option.</li>
            <li> this also helps with getting a precise shave</li>
            <li> but they are smooth.</li>
            <li> Smooth shaving experance.</li>
            <li> Use lightly and change weekly or every 2 weeks at the longest.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling baby smooth.</li>
            <li> After seven weeks I&#x27;m still getting a smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable and balanced.</li>
            <li> nice blades shave well at a reasonable price compare to store prices,also the service was fast,i would buy this product again</li>
            <li> The strips do not seem to wear out as fast as the Fusion blades do and they retain water better, contributing to a better shave.</li>
            <li> ten or more good shaves from each blade.</li>
            <li> The Hydro 5 offers a superior shave.</li>
            <li> thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I still enjoy lathering up classic shaving cream (the kind that comes in tubs).</li>
            <li> I still enjoy lathering up classic shaving cream (the kind that comes in tubs).</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, it&#x27;s smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Resonably price and original replacements</li>
            <li> With the addition of aloe to the lubrication strip, Schick Hydro 5 has significantly improved its soothing feel.  </li>
            <li> quick shave smooth shave</li>
            <li> The one-star knock, though, is owing to my inability to achieve a clean edge (on sideburns, etc.).  </li>
            <li> clean well despite the gel substance they leave behind&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is much more comfortable and won&#x27;t take as much layers of skin</li>
            <li> I have used thease blades for the past three years and fine this product to be the best for a good shave on a rough beard.  </li>
            <li> Good price but not as good as some other new shave club....</li>
            <li> Good blades, if only a bit $$.</li>
            <li> Give these a try - I really believe you will love them.</li>
            <li> I love that the skin guard (where the lotion/lubricant is located) folds back for when you need a more precise shave line.</li>
            <li> love these razors work very well.</li>
            <li> it is super close and clean.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pricey, but it is true that you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall good razor blades, I just wish you could buy them in bulk for a much larger discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have tried so many brands of razors and I never gave this brand a second glance until I began pretty extensive research on amazon for the best.</li>
            <li> I recommend using the Cremo Shave Cream which I just recently discovered - it&#x27;s really good for a close shave.</li>
            <li> Not bad price for number received.</li>
            <li> If you have fine to normal facial hair this product is going to make you so happy.</li>
            <li> sharp blades, great close shave</li>
            <li> The Hydro 5s are not quite as wonderful out of the box on the first shave in terms of closeness, so I make a few more passes than I have to with a brand new PG.  </li>
            <li> These blades cost much less and I get eight to ten great shaves out of one blade, unlike the three good shaves I got from Gillette.</li>
            <li> and I have to use a toothbrush to clean the hair off the blades to make the razor useful again.</li>
            <li> but there are so many different razors, I wasn&#x27;t sure where to begin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can shave quickly and closely without any concerns.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because the Fusion blades shave more of the top layer of your skin off along with the hair, whereas these Schick blades glide over your skin and seem to cut the hair only.</li>
            <li> Great Product and much cheaper than in local stores</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to try these because I&#x27;ve heard a lot of friends say that 5 blades isn&#x27;t worth it, works the same as a 4 or even a good 3 blade.  </li>
            <li> and it really does do a good job with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> They have a learning curve (the injector has the lowest) but the shave is far more comfortable and way cheaper too.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly, to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> It also will provide you with a quick and efficient cut.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the blades are so easy to clean that my &amp;#34;razor sharpening pad&amp;#34; (which really exists just to remove interstitial gunk) has become obsolete.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I received the Fusion proglide as a free promotion and it was by far the most costly per shave.</li>
            <li> My experience is that the M3s became&lt;br /&gt;dull quickly.  </li>
            <li> What I like most about this blade is that that Bluetip on the top tilts back allowing you to trim your mustache if need be.  </li>
            <li> Count yourself lucky if you don&#x27;t get MRSA.</li>
            <li> It can take over your face in 1 or 2 days, and your face can quickly sw&lt;br /&gt;ell</li>
            <li> Most razors actually hurt may face if I have more than a days growth.</li>
            <li> Only downside is a larger surface area, tougher for close spots, but no blade is perfect and these are the closest I&#x27;ve found to it.  </li>
            <li> buying them this way saved me quick a bit</li>
            <li> and I just love it - better than the ones especially designed for women.</li>
            <li> super shave.</li>
            <li> very good I am counting the days one razor gives me - up to 12 so far and still sharp and easy.</li>
            <li> Overall, very pleased and have been using this razor for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Must used them with very hot water.</li>
            <li> Just what i needed and pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> I love these razors and it&#x27;s nice to not have to remember to buy them, it stops me from using that last blade for an entire month until I buy more.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t last a really long maybe a couple weeks at best.</li>
            <li> Why pay more for Gillette Fusion when this does as good a job, if not better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely the best razor that I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li> .. make sure you run the &amp;#34;conditioning bead strip&amp;#34; under hot water before use to emulsify it.. much cheaper than fusion- who can pay $20+ for 8-10 blades??</li>
            <li> I bought these on amazon because they are a much better price than anywhere else, the quality of the blades is much more advanced than Gillette, I used to used Gillette but the blades would last a few days at the most, if I used them more than that the blade would bend and cause me to get cuts on my head and face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure, they don&#x27;t have the same edge they had fresh out of the box; but even after a couple of months, they can cleanly and smoothly cut my bristly hair.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I found these quite a bit cheaper than in a certain &amp;#34;rollback&amp;#34; retail chain.</li>
            <li> and I liked it a little more that the Atra blades.  </li>
            <li> The 8 count package fit my wallet as much as my level of comfort.</li>
            <li> Fast and comfortable.</li>
            <li> these are the only kind of razors that my husband will use.</li>
            <li> The shave is nice and smooth and I can&#x27;t remember the last time I got so much as a nic.</li>
            <li> This refill pack was as expected for a good price.</li>
            <li> products.&lt;br /&gt;I have been thrilled with the Hydro 5 and will not go back to Gillette.</li>
            <li> You can flip back the lubricating strip and use it to hit more detailed areas like sideburns or under your nose.</li>
            <li> IT IS REALLY WORTH</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely worth upgrading to.</li>
            <li> My husband was very pleased because he usually pays much more.</li>
            <li> : these are worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is far better and 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li> These work much better for me, than the Schick Hydro 5 sensitive ones.  </li>
            <li> Those tend to cut me up, these work like a charm, no cuts and gives me a smooth, soft, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Cost too much to be worth using again...</li>
            <li> but I am not too thrilled about the gel above the blades.</li>
            <li> We now own three of them so that we always have a back up.</li>
            <li> 8 cartridges worth the money.</li>
            <li> but the problem is that he&#x27;s always suffered with skin reactions on his neck (more sensitive area than the face).  </li>
            <li> So far I have been satisfied with quality of the blades.</li>
            <li> One of these can cover all of the hard-to-get depressions where a normal razor can&#x27;t easily get because of the bones sticking out, like around the knees.</li>
            <li> The price was right</li>
            <li> will cut right through it.  </li>
            <li> Right item.</li>
            <li> The Hydro 5 blades have a great lubricant which enables me to shave &amp;#34;against the grain&amp;#34; and not feel like my skin is raw.</li>
            <li> OMG the Hydro 5 is the BEST razor blade that I have ever experienced on my VERY TOUGH curly, black beard in the 50 years that I have been shaving.</li>
            <li> The blades don&#x27;t dull extremely easily, so I feel I got a good deal for the price paid.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a new Super Razorblade on the block looking to take the Crown away from Gillette&#x27;s Fusion!</li>
            <li> I can use most single edge and injector razors somewhat comfortably against the grain there though.</li>
            <li> I love these Hydro 5 blades for the way they glide and their general longevity.  </li>
            <li> These blades will last a long time and with eight in a pack you are getting a really good value!  </li>
            <li> But these make it a little more enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> Still, I think it&#x27;s pretty impressive that I can use a single cartridge for roughly 3 months.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this idea, and never tried it before purchasing one of the razors about two years ago that was a great deal, and found the vibration was more beneficial than I</li>
            <li> I think the average person could easily go a month or more.  </li>
            <li> my need , thank you very much</li>
            <li> I like the pull back moisture strip, and the wide head makes shaving (especially after a warm shower) nice and easy.</li>
            <li> Clean, smooth shave, never gets any razor burn, and they last quite a while for a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> Great blade for my legs, hardly any nicks at all</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> Finally a blade that is cheaper and better than what Gillette is putting out.  </li>
            <li> *the top flips back</li>
            <li> /&gt;First it is no where near a maneuverable or comfortable against the contours of the face .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , isn&#x27;t that going to cut your face up?&amp;#34; In fact, you will get a closer shave with a double edged razor and I have nicked myself just as many times as I had with these exact razorblades.</li>
            <li> I used Gillette Fusion when I first started shaving, but I almost always cut my face.</li>
            <li> long lasting, great shave.</li>
            <li> So I am a female and this is my favorite razor ever.</li>
            <li> I ordered Schick Hydro 5 from Amazon and was skeptical that it would be as awesome as gillette.</li>
            <li> These blades cut close and last more than a month.  </li>
            <li> Most of all, they last through six uses.</li>
            <li> I really like the Schick and find it generally produces a smoother shave with greater ease.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t cost me more than going to the local barber</li>
            <li> First thing that I like is that the shaving stick can accommodate both the 3 and 5 blade refills.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many places that they make male razors better than female since they are used on the face rather than the legs, and I tend to agree.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> Schick places the blades farther apart, and they are thicker and of higher quality.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m willing to give it another chance or two.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what you see in stores</li>
            <li> I have never used a better blade and am definitely sold on The Schick Hydro 5.</li>
            <li> It works with no nicks or cuts for the first couple shaves.</li>
            <li> By far the best blades I&#x27;ve used, last forever, don&#x27;t cut me up, a bit wide of course</li>
            <li> Exactly like what you buy in the store, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I need the strip to get a smooth shave, but I don&#x27;t need it for anywhere near every stroke.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gillette blades cost a lot more and may not last as long as the Hydro 5 blades, but they win in one category - they actually work, unlike these.  </li>
            <li> beyond belief - for real!</li>
            <li> when I asked her to pick up a refill, the cost of these were way higher than&lt;br /&gt;the blades I had been using.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That was around 18 months or more ago and since then I&#x27;ve not returned back to Gillette as I find the Schick provides a cleaner, closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave a lot better than Gillette and last longer too.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if someone creatively sent back their used ones in a package or if these were fakes.</li>
            <li> The sub &amp; save price is the best, Gillette fusion is way too expensive</li>
            <li> These were the first blades I used to shave</li>
            <li> Delivery was exactly as quoted.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted for about a month.</li>
            <li> This is the only razor that my husband use, and he love them...</li>
            <li> Only shaver that I use, quick shower saves as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> I love how easily it shaves and it leaves my skin super soft for so much longer than any other razor</li>
            <li> These cartridges are typically ridiculously expensive even at a very popular discount store, so when I saw them on Amazon for this price I was stoked !</li>
            <li> In fact because of how long the blades last most of your shaves will be better than with the fusion.</li>
            <li> the life of these razors shocked me they are cheap well made and help you get the best shave ever.</li>
            <li> Since there are more blades, one of these lasts a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> It last much longer and shaves better than any Gillette Fusion blades.</li>
            <li> Worked as good as the more expensive ones .</li>
            <li> The blade looks large at first; get over it.</li>
            <li> At this time the blades are selling for around one-half the price of the much less comfortable Gillette Fusion ($2 or so versus $3.75 or so per blade depending on where and when you buy them) and the best part is I get twice as many shaves per blade (six shaves for the Hydro versus just three for the Fusion) over the Fusion, but as things usually go these won&#x27;t last long as Hydro becomes more popular and Schick seeking greater profits as market share increases will also increase the Hydro&#x27;s price and make the blades less sharp.</li>
            <li> Even folding down the top part to get straight at the blades, the Schick just doesn&#x27;t edge as cleanly as the Gillette did.  </li>
            <li> I know my friends dread the high cost of such a simple item and the liked the gift!</li>
            <li> It is so comfortable that I barely notice it as I pull over and around by cowlickey beard.</li>
            <li> fast fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> Just as good or if not better then Gillette Fusion or Pro Glide and the Hydro 5 is cheaper in price</li>
            <li> This is not possible with the hydro as the blade will poop out easily every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy for trimming or getting rid of the entire beard.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, the Hydro 5&#x27;s handle is smaller and thinner, allowing you to flip the blade easily in your hand to change the direction of strokes.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, fast delivery, thanks</li>
            <li> Also does well on thick stubble, with hot water and good face lube.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended so I tried. ...and loved  long lasting too!</li>
            <li> They give me a good shave and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Finally, the guard at the top of the head pivots away from the blades allowing the blades to be placed precisely in tight places (think &amp;#34;under the nose&amp;#34;) and allows for more precision in trimming side burns.</li>
            <li> I switched from a variety of Gillette razors including some of their premium versions to Schick as a result of a promotion where I bought a Schick 5 blade at a large discount.</li>
            <li> Be sure to look at new products as they are introduced as they will do the same job at an introductory price.</li>
            <li> They work just fine same as the store</li>
            <li> Smooth shave, the blades were sharp and it even had this cool lubrication built in.</li>
            <li> The four blade schick are pretty decent as well.</li>
            <li> If you want that &amp;#34;sure thing&amp;#34; shave on a daily basis, save your money and instead buy Schick Extreme 3 triple blade, I find those work great, cost less, and are still more maneuverable than the Hydro 5.</li>
            <li> Blades last super long and give a very smooth shave without pulling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As described (genuine) from a third party seller (Fast Ship Consumer Outlet).</li>
            <li> Thanks Schick for continuing to strive forward.</li>
            <li> but then again who wants to pay those prices.</li>
            <li> Biggest difference I noticed was how smooth the shave felt, and how multiple passes were easier than the Gillette products.  </li>
            <li> They worked well, were decently cheap, and held up to last a couple weeks each cartridge.</li>
            <li> I am saving so much money.</li>
            <li> and I figured if I didn&#x27;t like them as much</li>
            <li> Nothing has worked very well.  </li>
            <li> It was so much cheaper to buy these through Amazon than it was even at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I really like these razors.</li>
            <li> Gets you really smooth, and the hydrating gel definitely helps to moisturize!</li>
            <li> Leave off the toxic strip, it doesn&#x27;t help that much.</li>
            <li> the hydration strip in these razors really help with the razor burn.</li>
            <li> I get a really close shave and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> That said, it would seem to me that Schick should really undercut the Gillette price if they really want to make a dent in Gillettes dominance in disposable blades.</li>
            <li> These are still my favourite blades to shave with as it gives a really close shave and the hydrating effect from the aloe vera is very hydrating indeed.</li>
            <li> Item as described -- fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Much prefer the Mach 3 to this razor.</li>
            <li> Retailers charge too much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the cost for replacement cartridges is reasonable.</li>
            <li> the hydro wears out fast.</li>
            <li> Not only is the shave comfortable</li>
            <li> It is very reliable and has a competitive price.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> It shaves very well.</li>
            <li> I really like the schtick hydro 5</li>
            <li> Gel runs out fast and it gets a bit droopy and sticky during the shave.</li>
            <li> The only problem is they aren&#x27;t as available as the Gillette blades, so getting them online is the way to go.</li>
            <li> As a woman, there are so many hair removal products and pink razors out there.  </li>
            <li> Reasonable price compared to the competition.</li>
            <li> The vibrating head of the Schick shaver gives a really close shave</li>
            <li> and I really did save.</li>
            <li> I really like these blades.</li>
            <li> fast shipping</li>
            <li> So you go cheap and get the costco hundred pack of twin blades and cut up your face for several months or you pay for a decent razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This hydro blade has a dispensing latch on the back that makes it easier to clean, and may be the reason why this lasts so much</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these blades are really significantly better than any other brand of multi-blade device.  </li>
            <li> The blades are not that sharp, do not rinse and more is not bettter.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is it does a better job than any other blade I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Would be a 5 but clogs up/harder to clean out than others with lesser blades</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, only issue is to get them when they are on special, otherwise cheaper at Walmart.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t even know about the blades special flip precision trimmer until my husband recently pointed it out.</li>
            <li> have pretty sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This new Hydro 5 shave system gives me the absolutely closest shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Better shaves, less money; who could complain?&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> I am most likely going to be shifting back to Gillette</li>
            <li> The real deal (to me) is worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> They came as advertised and at decent price.</li>
            <li> and I have to use a new one twice as fast as the cheap single blade razor.  </li>
            <li> I mean, a single unit will last you up to a year... and the good stuff smells better than cologne.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean, a single unit will last you up to a year... and the good stuff smells better than cologne.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She was so very pleased with the price compared to prices she had paid at drug , grocery and big box stores on previous occasions .</li>
            <li> highly recommend using these blades.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Tough to clean - problem with many multi-blades.</li>
            <li> These blades are shave very smooth and last for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> Works okay, a little cheaper here than in the stores</li>
            <li> The Hydro 5 is a little better than the 3</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and rinse well and easily.</li>
            <li> They are easy on his super sensitive skin and don&#x27;t cause excessive razor rash and bumps</li>
            <li> Great blades but expensive.</li>
            <li> I like this razor, and am happy to save some money on the replacement blades, although they are still ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li> I normally use the Schick twin-blade disposables and occasion the triple blade.  </li>
            <li> One of my top concerns whe purchasing razor blades is how long will they last.  </li>
            <li> It would be great if they were a little less exp</li>
            <li> I did a head to head, right side left side test with Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li> they hooked me when i first tried it out on a promo a few years ago  , best shave with the least irritation i had given myself in so long.</li>
            <li> I knew I needed to try something new</li>
            <li> I am a long-time Gillette fan, but decided to try this new Schick razor.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without my Hydro 5</li>
            <li> actually last longer than any I&#x27;ve used, I can generally get 4-5 full shaves from one cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for guys with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so</li>
            <li> do usually have more irritation than I would have with Gillette Proglide</li>
            <li> These razors were designed to shave the most intricate areas like cheekbones and upper lips on men, so why would a lady&#x27;s knee or above the ankle be any different?  </li>
            <li> They cut clean, and stay sharp.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Again for comfort I highly recommend razors such as GEM, Ever Ready, and Schick injectors.</li>
            <li> Smooth, comfortable shave, less irritation than Fusion, slightly cheaper cartridges, releases conditioner.</li>
            <li> I typically shower without the light on.</li>
            <li> Its not harsh on the skin,and my skin is very sensitive .</li>
            <li> first it took me a few days to get used to the bulkier shaver (which I now like better) and the ability to go over the same area several times.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave and a single cartridge will last me 2-3 months.  </li>
            <li> I shave less frequently now, the blades last for many shaves.</li>
            <li> And on top of me receiving a product that I didn&#x27;t fully expect, using the blades feels exceptionally dull.</li>
            <li> I only used the razor once so far, but it worked really well.  </li>
            <li> With this one he gets a clean shave and a lot less issues with bumps and cuts.  </li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised with quality.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Second the design does not let you close nose- lip intersection or provide precision near the sideburns .</li>
            <li> but these last much longer</li>
            <li> If you have a dimple or, say, if you want to get into constricted spaces (like the hairs directly under your nose) it will be a lot tougher to get to those areas than a twin blade.  </li>
            <li> I like these refills, though I prefer the ones made specifically for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a relatively young guy, all of 25</li>
            <li> Edge for Sensitive Skin Shaving Gel</li>
            <li> Each blade lasts me about five days, but that fifth day is nearly lube-less.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and these don&#x27;t bother my skin at all.</li>
            <li> These last so much longer than Mach 3 and and have smoother edges</li>
            <li> I tried out another shaver, but it was far inferior to the Hydro 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Naturally, I signed up for the 6 blade razor they offered.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than the ones bought locally at Wally World!</li>
            <li> if Old Bond Street Sandalwood cream.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected - this is the same that I buy in the local stores but at a better price</li>
            <li> I never entertained this type of item before and was really surprised by the quality of the 5 razors.  </li>
            <li> (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus - which has become a common staph infection that is resistant to most antibiotics)</li>
            <li> Saved a few bucks with the free shipping too.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin on my face.  </li>
            <li> They hurt my face like an old blade.  </li>
            <li> I used use the old shick razor and blades.</li>
            <li> nicks or bleeding with this blade on my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> I have purchased disposable razors, which still cost about a third of the cost of these razors, but I am ready to toss them after half a dozen shaves, which, in the long run, I find more value in purchasing these razor blades over disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily for me, I don&#x27;t shave much in the mornings, it&#x27;s usually at night</li>
            <li> If you are staying clean shaven every morning, there&#x27;s no need to use this Hydro 5 product for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> Love the Hydro 5, did not love the hassle of having to find someone at the store (if they actually had the blades) to unlock the plastic case used to prevent theft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a place that sold these razor refills</li>
            <li> but they do last a long time when keep clean and  only trim that close twice a week.</li>
            <li> My beard is not very heavy.</li>
            <li> No more bumps n smooth head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time Gillette user, but I switched to these about 4 months ago because the Gillette Fusion blades, in addition to shaving very close, also seem to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and these blades give me the smoothest closest shave of any other razor I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I have very corse facial hair which grows in all different directions.  </li>
            <li> My criticism is that blades are very expensive but this applies to most, if not all, blades!!  </li>
            <li> The price on this was better than on several other sites we visited and 8 blades should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I will recommend this product to all my friends and family, to anyone in general!</li>
            <li> These razors last far longer than just throwing them out after the gel stuff is gone!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every major brand of shaver, and this s the one I have decided to sue long-term.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These items are all monopolized and we have no other choice then to shell-out mega bucks for these penny-worth razors.</li>
            <li> I used no other razor now ...</li>
            <li> using my last blade for about 2yrs, didn&#x27;t work really well and was rough on my skin, shaving cream helped it shave like normal though.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t like having to snap the top half of the razor down for those close spots (like under the nose).  </li>
            <li> Since I have such a thick beard that grows quickly, I realized I was going to need a real razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When combined with SH shaving cream and Bump Fighter aftershave, I highly recommend this product particularly for Black men.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Schick blades are simply a better product, last longer and cost less money than the other brands.</li>
            <li> The razor blades are very efficient and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive facial skin, below is a list of the products I use</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s my technique, and I&#x27;ll learn the trick, but I havent so far after several months of use.</li>
            <li> No drag.</li>
            <li> These are the only blades my husband will use on his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The blades last a long time and no more ripping my face up with cheap blades!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care how long these blades last, or how inexpensive they are - they barely perform the task they&#x27;re supposed to.  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t ever go back to the old ones.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to my old brand.</li>
            <li> I shave 4 to 5 times a week and would assume I have a pretty average rate of growth.  </li>
            <li> Like so many I&#x27;ve become tired of paying four dollars a cartridge at Costco (even) for the Gillette five blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many different blades over my thirty some years of shaving, and would rank these blades among the top.  </li>
            <li> good parts: These are not near as expensive as Gillette&#x27;s five blade models.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> What I really like is the fact that the aloe seems to last right up until the blades start to get dull.</li>
            <li> last a long time and much cheaper than other brands, also much cheaper than buying at a store.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> He has fairly sensitive skin, and he said they really helped get a close shave with less irritation.</li>
            <li> The moisture strip is silly because it will all come off if you don&#x27;t keep the razor dry, but the blades give a good close shave.</li>
            <li> I only use this razor to shave my head each morning; my face is much too sensitive for anything other than a Braun electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> Not too much to say other than they work like razor blades.</li>
            <li> Much lower in price than the other brand.</li>
            <li> So far I have tried Mach 5 and other men&#x27;s razors, but Schick Hydro 5 has definitely been my favorite for the past several years.  </li>
            <li> This product is fabulous and works for at least 2 weeks (daily shaving).</li>
            <li> Secondly, the ability to scoop back the aloe/wet-bead head for a shaving near nose and side-burns is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In all honesty the Gillette fusion is a little bit better, but the hydro is less expensive and you will get a lot more shaves per blade.</li>
            <li> They last much longer and shave closer than any other product on the market.  </li>
            <li> I can use one blade for at least 2 weeks of shaves, as compared to most other blades which will give me 1 to 1.5 weeks at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;But if you, like me, got tired of hacking your face to bits... and spending half an hour or more using classic razors... and you could not find the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; aesthetically pleasing handle (for a Mach 3 or whatever)...</li>
            <li> /&gt;But if you, like me, got tired of hacking your face to bits... and spending half an hour or more using classic razors... and you could not find the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; aesthetically pleasing handle (for a Mach 3 or whatever)...</li>
            <li> also wanted to point out that the area above the blades flips back allowing you to shave the area above your lip directly below your nose.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how much bigger they can go, but I did the half face test (half another razor) and these really did work better.</li>
            <li> The razors seam to last long enough too!</li>
            <li> They last a lot longer than the other major brand I used to use.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer strip works well, and last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting close shaves.</li>
            <li> These blades last an incredibly long time.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, 2 1/2 -3 1/2 weeks per blade.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> Disappointing vs Gillette fusion Proglide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to find the  Schick Hydro razor and 17 blades at major wholesale club, at half price of the Gillette&#x27;s fusion.  </li>
            <li> Also cheaper than the other major brand with 5 blades.</li>
            <li> He says they last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> maybe) with a super thick beard a lot of younger guys wish they had half of....</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried DOZENS of razors, electric, traditional, even single blade.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re less expensive, they last longer, and they do a better job than the Gillette blades.</li>
            <li> To start, I shave my head and face daily, sometimes every other day, but usually daily.</li>
            <li> I shave my entire head and face and have been using the same Hydro 5 blade for almost 2 months, and it&#x27;s still sharp.  </li>
            <li> The main reason i bought them are because they never cut my skin to end up with small bleeds.</li>
            <li> costly, but worth it if you have a tough beard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, and I do not know why, but I have been cutting myself more with the 5 blade refills than I did with the Gillette Fusion.</li>
            <li> This gets the job done without cutting me and makes my skin silky smooth !</li>
            <li> i have been using Gillette fusion pro glide for a long time, so i did some research and found these.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t seem to have those strange patches where the razor missed a patch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will use these for as long as Schlick sells them</li>
            <li> Trying to shave even the lightest amount of stubble was an exercise in frustration, and no matter how carefully I shaved, my face (and especially my neck)</li>
            <li> Not to make you paranoid, but 3 - 4 weeks is too long to use any razor - even if it lasts that long.</li>
            <li> For a long time I thought Mach3 is the blade in market till I found the Hydro 5.</li>
            <li> I was originally not much of a fan of this entire Hydro shaving system.  </li>
            <li> I am continue to be amazed that you can purchase disposable razors for less, and still receive the same close shave as these, however I don&#x27;t like the feel of the overall disposable product</li>
            <li> There very sharp when new and last a maximum of 2 weeks, shaving everyday.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and stays sharp ( 1)</li>
            <li> There were promises of dramatic savings (who can argue with replacement razor blades that cost &amp;#60;$0.50 each?), closer shaves (once you got past the cut-prone learning curve), and the addition of a satisfying morning ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> The same cannot be said of any other manual</li>
            <li> A very long time.</li>
            <li> I use these while showering and dry the blades each day.</li>
            <li> Note &#x3D; thoroughly rinse and dry the blades after use - wipe and &amp;#34;blow dry&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> After each use I wash the blade and dry it up on the towel.  </li>
            <li> The blades are great and although still too expensive, it is cheaper than the Gillette brands that rob you blind.</li>
            <li> Keeping them dry helps extend the life of the blades.</li>
            <li> Dry heads.....</li>
            <li> I still have a fairly thick beard, even though I am older.  </li>
            <li> I might miss the single blade Gillette has for shaving tough-to-reach spots under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to test one of those single edge razors.</li>
            <li> When these run out, I plan to try an old-school single blade &amp;#34;safety razor&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Works wet or dry and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, if we could only get the price down.</li>
            <li> I can typically utilize each blade for 5 to 6 shavings receiving the same quality shave each time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually not sure how they sell these blades for such a low price.  </li>
            <li> I paid way less than I would locally.</li>
            <li> As a man with Black facial hair, I looked long and hard to find something that could cut close, but isn&#x27;t too rough on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp, cut very well, and it&#x27;s really hard for me to cut myself with them.  </li>
            <li> Preferred the feel of these blades plus they seem to last a little longer.  </li>
            <li> A little scared buying these outside of a store I can trust.</li>
            <li> The Hydro 5 blades are very sharp out of the box and, unlike other 5 blade brands, they actually work as advertised and provide a smoother, closer shave.  </li>
            <li> However, the price of new cartridges is simply ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> I used a different brand for at least ten years.  </li>
            <li> I actually got a few of these for stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> Since the cartridge is not as wide, it&#x27;s easier move around</li>
            <li> Harder to find now with the &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; to these,</li>
            <li> Anthony Logistics Ingrown Hair Treatment (Expensive, but worth every penny)</li>
            <li> They give the closest shave with minimal learning curve but trying to shave ATG on my chin feels like rubbing a cheese grater there.</li>
            <li> Because of this, cuts were minimal.</li>
            <li> so that can sometimes cause some issues, but it is 5 blades, so that is expected.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, been buying these for a while.</li>
            <li> They last a lot longer than that when they are dried after each use.</li>
            <li> I have used quit a few different razors.</li>
            <li> no pull or drag.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here...</li>
            <li> These are one of the only few razors that doesn&#x27;t give me rashes or pimples</li>
            <li> Half the $$$ of fusion and lasts twice as long.</li>
            <li> If you cut yourself with a razer it is usually due to making a sideways motion with the blade while shaving unless of course you drag the razor across &amp;#34;lumps and bumps&amp;#34; without being careful.</li>
            <li> I have both and the Schick seems to cut easier, have less drag, and leave my face less red.</li>
            <li> It has been hard for  me to find a razor that is going to last long and cut with no blood spilled.</li>
            <li> It still works well as before, but occasional irritation occurs, also minor cuts if you press too hard.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin, so this bad boys are the softest on your skin.</li>
            <li> I generally shave 5 - 6 days per week, and can get at least 5 to 6 weeks out of one blade.  </li>
            <li> My complaint about this category of product in general is the cost for what you get.  </li>
            <li> I probably get about 6 shaves before I notice that it&#x27;s not quite as sharp.</li>
            <li> I use Hydro 5 to shave both my face and head and the lubrication on the blade lasts longer than any other system I have tried, and I have tried a lot.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy Gillette shaving products exclusively, and tried the Schick Hydro 5 razor mostly due to the price difference.  </li>
            <li> Oh and there is zero skin irritation on my face from using these blades versus other cartridge blades.</li>
            <li> However this may have also added to the other design flaws..</li>
            <li> I usually can make these blades last me a week or two each, depending on my usage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought a Hydro 5, I found it performs the same if not better.  </li>
            <li> Sharp.</li>
            <li> This is all I buy after 10 years of experimenting with other blades.</li>
            <li> Helpful if you can&#x27;t find one or the other.</li>
            <li> Other men</li>
            <li> Every blade stays sharp for about 15 uses.</li>
            <li> Since i switched to schick, i never consider using other product.</li>
            <li> But the blade will continue to cut sharp, just with no aloe.</li>
            <li> that other multi-bladed razors couldn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> but these blades don&#x27;t seem to be as sharp as the ones I bought in the store.</li>
            <li> The ones I got are defective or in some other way tampered with.  </li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t hurt like some other multiblades do.</li>
            <li> Until now I always used the other brand.</li>
            <li> Move over Gillette there is a new game in town.</li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard, and find these blades do well at cutting, but I do have to make two or three passes in some areas to get a good shave, but I have this issue with other razors also.  </li>
            <li> bad parts: They aren&#x27;t exactly easy to find in stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these blades for quite a long time, but a few months ago I ordered six blade razor from DORCO, a bargain at about half the price.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is price.  </li>
            <li> Worse than any old blade I&#x27;ve ever used, in fact.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, I bought a 16-pack of these blades from a particular brick-and-mortar wholesale store, and now I have to figure out what to do with the other 15 blades.  </li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to get the spot right by your nose!</li>
            <li> Now that I have it down</li>
            <li> Price needs to come down on refills.</li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;m a girl, but I can&#x27;t use any other razor on my legs, underarms, or anywhere!</li>
            <li> yet less</li>
            <li> Attention fellow shavers: I used the Schick Hydro 5 blade cartridges for about 2 and a half years.</li>
            <li> Irritation is less on skin and on my wallet.  </li>
            <li> So durability is about 2-3 times that of the PG, for much, much less money.</li>
            <li> It also lasts a day or so longer than the previous versions.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I think that these are even more expensive than the comparable Atra&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Just like what you&#x27;d buy at the store, but way less inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The shave I got from the Hydro 5 was as close as from Fusion, but with less irritation and less pull.</li>
            <li> They work well and cost less than the Fusion razors.  </li>
            <li> my previous brand?)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The gel/hydration strip is about half what I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li> Less cost than Gillette blades.  </li>
            <li> The Schick Hydro 5 is not as expensive as some high end blades but works well.</li>
            <li> They stay sharp for longer than previous models and cope with the extended stubble I am usually trying to scrape</li>
            <li> decided to try these cause gillette fusion is getting too expensive and the don&#x27;t last as long as they used to</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re expensive, but they last a long time</li>
            <li> The moisture strip can get a little sticky/gooey as the water soaks into your skin, but it&#x27;s not like a hagfish or anything.</li>
            <li> The hydro strip helps add a little moisture to my skin, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> always like Schick hydro and buying in bulk and with little sales tax</li>
            <li> This blade, however, also lasted a little while longer than the Atra.  </li>
            <li> With the cheaper disposable razors he gets all cut up and little bumps on his neck.  </li>
            <li> Hands down!  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is when the blades start to become dull</li>
            <li> My only negative comment about them is that the moisturizing gel is hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> Used them for a few years and like that they don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Heck, you could probably get away with shaving everyday with these Schick blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved a few times already</li>
            <li> so they aren&#x27;t as harsh.</li>
            <li> I have dried them after each use.  </li>
            <li> will try to update this review after a few weeks of using the Schick razor.</li>
            <li> why waste your time agonizing over which chic, all-metal handle to get - you know, one that goes along with your chrome badger brush, chrome bowl, and chrome stand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously, these are not cheap disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> firm is best&lt;br</li>
            <li> I shave my head and trim my face with it a couple times a week, and it usually holds up for a month and a half, or two months.</li>
            <li> They also seems to go dull faster than other razors I&#x27;ve use and knick easier.</li>
            <li> After completing my shave,  I usually give the Gillette&#x27;s handle a few robust taps  against the sink rim to flick out any gunk that did not rinse out.</li>
            <li> I have VERY tough black hair on my chin and almost everything I&#x27;ve tried tugs horribly there especially against the grain- straight razors, double edge razors.</li>
            <li> blades it will cost you NO MORE than $15 off amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is the blade guards or the number of blades, but I have yet to cut my face</li>
            <li> Still way to expensive but still cheaper here than my local Walmart..</li>
            <li> Not sure I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> This seems to be one of those instances where moving past the sticker shock and paying the arm and leg pays off.  </li>
            <li> I use Slick Water preshave and Colonel Conk shave</li>
            <li> I usually get between 19/25 shaves per blade with no nicks or iration.</li>
            <li> In fact, he usually doesn&#x27;t get them unless he shaves every day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve usually use Gillette Fusion razors</li>
            <li> I seriously doubt having used both for a few weeks now that there is any benefit to 3 vice 5 blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time gillette razor user and always wanted to find a substitute product as gillette blades are expensive.</li>
            <li> Use this for when you have let your beard go for a long weekend, but keep a Schick twin blade around for the difficult to reach spots.  </li>
            <li> These weren&#x27;t very sharp and blades were poorly aligned.</li>
            <li> Could be a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> , the Schick Hydro 5 has marked my bittersweet departure from my purist &amp;#34;classic shaving&amp;#34; experiment - and I couldn&#x27;t give less of a crap.</li>
            <li> Never shave a week with a dull blade again, waiting to get to store.</li>
            <li> It hurts, and it&#x27;s hard to rid yourself of the infection.)</li>
            <li> Before using these blades I would get razor irritation like crazy, even regularly changing my blades out.  </li>
            <li> (At least at the time of our purchase)</li>
            <li> By the way, I use each of these razors for at least two months before tossing in the trash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m expecting to get at least another week out of it before I change it.</li>
            <li> For those complaining about cuts etc.... use some common sense when using a razor.</li>
            <li> The Dorco razor&#x27;s handle is too thick and</li>
            <li> We just have to wait until Profits and Politics are out of the Way and War no more!</li>
            <li> Not perfect yet, but a progress from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that I preferred the previous design with flexible blade.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Once you use this, it is almost impossible to go back to whatever you were using before.</li>
            <li> Moreover, MRSA on your face can be quite serious.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m taking one star off because the irritation can be bad, especially on my head.</li>
            <li> They are expensive, however, I get six close shaves with each blade and have a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> It becomes really sticky and nasty and hard to wash</li>
            <li> I no longer have to feel like a sucker every time I buy the Gillette blades for an exorbitant price!</li>
            <li> In the razors defense my hair is very thick and course.</li>
            <li> and I find that somewhat irritating.</li>
            <li> HANDLE IS VERY POOR DESIGN,AND HARD TOO HANDLE</li>
            <li> By reducing skin friction with a cold cream like Noxema, a gel shaving cream, and at least 3 bladed refill, I have cut the need for blades to 2 a year.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t give less of a crap.</li>
            <li> just like the ones on the store shelves just without having to actually go to the store and stand in the Awful lines</li>
            <li> Boy were my friends wrong about that.  </li>
            <li> Razors are ridiculously expensive.  </li>
            <li> I just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> the shave can be a bit uncomfortable, but i suppose thats how it is with any blade.</li>
            <li> Every multi bladed cheese grater I&#x27;ve ever used is horribly uncomfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> The worst of the bunch is cartridges: I&#x27;ve used Schick (obviously), Gillette Fusion, Personna, Dorco pace 3.</li>
            <li> This razor left me with the worst razor</li>
            <li> My wife likes it, but I take away one star because razors shouldn&#x27;t be that expensive</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> They work and they are not as expensive as gillette</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it lives everywhere these days - the gym, hospitals, even in your house.</li>
            <li> The handle is a weird shape and not balanced.</li>
            <li> I am really sorry it took me all this time to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard</li>
            <li> I think these are fake because they cut my skin up like crazy.  </li>
            <li> I understand that people are afraid of change.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but all things of quality are!</li>
            <li> but I hate that they are so expensive.  </li>
            <li> Something is very wrong with these blades, they cut and burn.  </li>
            <li> And a bad company.</li>
            <li> BAD:  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed with these blades, they are very expensive</li>
            <li> Gillette is stupid.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving.  </li>
            <li> Who gives a crap.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving.</li>
            <li> These blades are terrible.</li>
            <li> I nicked myself twice, both nasty cuts.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly what we were looking for. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> They work pretty good. They are cheaper then their competitors so I&#x27;ve gone with them.</li>
            <li> Good and very and better price.</li>
            <li> CANNOT SHAVE UNDER YOUR NOSE WITH THESE, I WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN.  HANDLE IS VERY POOR DESIGN,AND HARD TOO HANDLE</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re less expensive, they last longer, and they do a better job than the Gillette blades. And, apparently, this review has to be 20 words long. So there you go. Gillette is stupid. And a bad company.</li>
            <li> The only razors we buy</li>
            <li> Finally a blade that is cheaper and better than what Gillette is putting out.  Thanks Schick for continuing to strive forward.</li>
            <li> they work pretty good but not as good as Gillette but then again who wants to pay those prices. they good but they don&#x27;t last a really long maybe a couple weeks at best.</li>
            <li> Always was my favorite blade. Now with the subscription service, I can get them at a good price right to my door.</li>
            <li> Good blades, if only a bit $$. I like the pull back moisture strip, and the wide head makes shaving (especially after a warm shower) nice and easy. The moisture strip can get a little sticky/gooey as the water soaks into your skin, but it&#x27;s not like a hagfish or anything. Since there are more blades, one of these lasts a pretty long time. I probably get about 6 shaves before I notice that it&#x27;s not quite as sharp. Also does well on thick stubble, with hot water and good face lube.</li>
            <li> Blades last super long and give a very smooth shave without pulling.</li>
            <li> They work just fine same as the store</li>
            <li> I received Schick Hydro 5 in a bzzkit and tried them for free.  I only used the razor once so far, but it worked really well.  The hydrogel made the shave smooth and my skin felt smooth afterword.  I had no razor burns or cuts either.  I  recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Used them for a few years and like that they don&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the Hydro 5, did not love the hassle of having to find someone at the store (if they actually had the blades) to unlock the plastic case used to prevent theft.  I use Hydro 5 to shave both my face and head and the lubrication on the blade lasts longer than any other system I have tried, and I have tried a lot.  Like having these delivered to my door and not having to remember to purchase more.</li>
            <li> these are the only kind of razors that my husband will use. i use them also. i got them online because i saw a coupon for them. very happy. just like the ones on the store shelves just without having to actually go to the store and stand in the Awful lines</li>
            <li> I used to buy Gillette shaving products exclusively, and tried the Schick Hydro 5 razor mostly due to the price difference.  Pleasantly surprised with quality.  Biggest difference I noticed was how smooth the shave felt, and how multiple passes were easier than the Gillette products.  The moisturizer strip works well, and last for a long time.  I shave my head and trim my face with it a couple times a week, and it usually holds up for a month and a half, or two months.</li>
            <li> Love it and the price is great.  Will buy more.  No more bumps n smooth head.  Ladies love it.</li>
            <li> Long lasting close shaves. I use these while showering and dry the blades each day. One blade lasts me... A very long time. Months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To all the reviews complaining about not reaching under their nose, **the top flips back** to expose an unguarded blade! This is by far the best feature about these close shaving blades. Oh and there is zero skin irritation on my face from using these blades versus other cartridge blades. And the price is pretty good for an 8 pack. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> They fit on the ladies schick hydro set up...except for way cheaper.  Pick these up ladies!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Schick Hydro 5 razor and blades for a couple of years now and love it. The shave is nice and smooth and I can&#x27;t remember the last time I got so much as a nic. Why pay more for Gillette Fusion when this does as good a job, if not better.</li>
            <li> Disappointing vs Gillette fusion Proglide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to find the  Schick Hydro razor and 17 blades at major wholesale club, at half price of the Gillette&#x27;s fusion.  I found it just doesn&#x27;t measure up in in the following ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First it is no where near a maneuverable or comfortable against the contours of the face .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second the design does not let you close nose- lip intersection or provide precision near the sideburns . Whereas the  Gillette&#x27;s sleeker blade design and trim blade availability make this a breeze&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades bulky design and attachment mechanism does not lend it self to cleaning by comparison. After completing my shave,  I usually give the Gillette&#x27;s handle a few robust taps  against the sink rim to flick out any gunk that did not rinse out. This is not possible with the hydro as the blade will poop out easily every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly Fusion&#x27;s attachment mechanism is  superior yet less obtrusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schick did provide a lubricant bar attached to the top of each blade. This did work well, and as a result a close shave without a burn was possible. However this may have also added to the other design flaws..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a Schick disposable user before discovering Fusion proglide, so I had great hopes. For now it&#x27;s  back to four dollars a blade. Ugh!</li>
            <li> This is a great razor This is a great razor This is a great razor This is a great razor&lt;br /&gt;Why wont it go.  Let me out let me out.</li>
            <li> Great shave, very close, very smooth, just with the refil wouldn&#x27;t pop off the handle quite so easy.  When cleaning the blades by lightly banging the handle against the side of the sink they tend to come off too often.</li>
            <li> Good product! I continue to use these on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Good value on replacement razor blades. I have been satisfied with the shave etc.</li>
            <li> Attention fellow shavers: I used the Schick Hydro 5 blade cartridges for about 2 and a half years. They worked well, were decently cheap, and held up to last a couple weeks each cartridge. Recently though, I have gone &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; and picked up a safety razor for Christmas. I know what you may be thinking, &amp;#34;Why would you do that, isn&#x27;t that going to cut your face up?&amp;#34; In fact, you will get a closer shave with a double edged razor and I have nicked myself just as many times as I had with these exact razorblades. The best part though? For 100 (yes 100!) blades it will cost you NO MORE than $15 off amazon. Think of the money you will save by switching to this form of shaving. There are cons though: it takes longer to shave, there is an initial upfront cost of about $50 for the brush and razor. It takes me about 7 more minutes to shave &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; but I get the closest shave I have ever experienced, I enjoy my shaving experience for once, and most importantly? I am saving so much money. If you want to stick with the cartridge razor blades though, that is perfectly fine. I understand that people are afraid of change. But since all of us have to shave from time to time, why not make it enjoyable and save some money in the process? Look into going the safety razor route, and I assure you that you wont look back.</li>
            <li> I have only been shaving for a handful of years, but these are the only blades I trust with my face anymore. I used Gillette Fusion when I first started shaving, but I almost always cut my face. I knew I needed to try something new but there are so many different razors, I wasn&#x27;t sure where to begin.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try the Schick Hydro 5. Boy, am I glad I did. I&#x27;m not sure if it is the blade guards or the number of blades, but I have yet to cut my face and I started using these years ago! I&#x27;m sure experience shaving had something to do with it, but I know for a fact that these blades play a role in the lack of nicks and cuts. The hydro strip helps add a little moisture to my skin, which is a plus. I usually can make these blades last me a week or two each, depending on my usage.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend using these blades. The 8-pack is well priced and it is great to have extras when you need to change blades.</li>
            <li> Still way to expensive but still cheaper here than my local Walmart..</li>
            <li> Love these blades. long lasting, great shave.</li>
            <li> always like Schick hydro and buying in bulk and with little sales tax this was a good buy.  I actually got a few of these for stocking stuffers. I know my friends dread the high cost of such a simple item and the liked the gift!</li>
            <li> What a shave, I say no mre</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cause your house to be infested by a swarm of human-sized killer bees from an alternate dimension hell-bent on eating the cat. This is an important feature in a box of disposable razor refills.</li>
            <li> decided to try these cause gillette fusion is getting too expensive and the don&#x27;t last as long as they used to but these last much longer I will keep buying these</li>
            <li> These blades are terrible. Fakes</li>
            <li> Gives a smooth shave. Good price.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite bladeS.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> These blades are awesome. My husband uses them for his face and his head. The handle makes it easy to glide the blade across your skin. Yeah, I stole a blade for myself and used it on my legs. Wow what a great shave! The blades get so close to your skin. You virtually eliminate razor burn since you don&#x27;t have to keep going back and forth over an area. The blades seem to last longer than the 3 or 4 blade refills.</li>
            <li> Just what my beard needed</li>
            <li> Resonably price and original replacements</li>
            <li> In all honesty the Gillette fusion is a little bit better, but the hydro is less expensive and you will get a lot more shaves per blade. In fact because of how long the blades last most of your shaves will be better than with the fusion.</li>
            <li> Hands down!  These are the best razor blades on the market</li>
            <li> Of all the blades I have tried, this one gives the cleanest and closest shave possible. Expensive, but all things of quality are!</li>
            <li> So I am a female and this is my favorite razor ever. The blades last forever and they give a great close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking 5 blades is too many for my not-so-thick beard. Not sure I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> Ask Obama how an minimum wage earner can afford these....should be free while he is in office</li>
            <li> Favorite blades,  arrived on time.</li>
            <li> As a man with Black facial hair, I looked long and hard to find something that could cut close, but isn&#x27;t too rough on sensitive skin. Behold--Schick Hydro! When combined with SH shaving cream and Bump Fighter aftershave, I highly recommend this product particularly for Black men. It always gets the job done with a nice, clean shave, and I have yet to get any razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Great blades for an extra close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I can shave quickly and closely without any concerns.</li>
            <li> always like Schick for me is smother shave.  The Army commisary has the same price. it&#x27;s close to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time gillette razor user and always wanted to find a substitute product as gillette blades are expensive. I ordered Schick Hydro 5 from Amazon and was skeptical that it would be as awesome as gillette. But to my surprise it&#x27;s better than gillette. The blades last longer and it gives a great shave every time i use it. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this to shave my head every 22 days ...Its not harsh on the skin,and my skin is very sensitive . I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Got these for my wife.  She was always buying cheap razors.  Finally got her this razor and she loves it.  This refill pack was as expected for a good price.</li>
            <li> From my experience, Shick&#x27;s Hyrdo 5 razor is one of the best you can buy. However, refills are more expensive than a gallon of gasoline. Fortunately, I found these quite a bit cheaper than in a certain &amp;#34;rollback&amp;#34; retail chain. Smooth shave, no nicks, and a great blade/handle combination. Easy for trimming or getting rid of the entire beard. Works wet or dry and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry. Love it! Keep it up Schick!</li>
            <li> My husband loves these!  They are easy on his super sensitive skin and don&#x27;t cause excessive razor rash and bumps</li>
            <li> Good but overkill for most of my shaving scenarios.  I still have a fairly thick beard, even though I am older.  I normally use the Schick twin-blade disposables and occasion the triple blade.  They are great.  I received a Schick Hyrdo 5 free, bundled with a two-pack of Edge shaving gel. (Edge is great by the way).  I&#x27;ve used it a couple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST IMPRESSIONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD:Very smooth, sails through a 3 or 4 day beard stubble.  Great at the straightaways (cheeks and jaw).&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD:  Constrained at the curves.  EXAMPLES:  If you have a dimple or, say, if you want to get into constricted spaces (like the hairs directly under your nose) it will be a lot tougher to get to those areas than a twin blade.  Hyrdo 5 Refills can be pricey ($2.68 apiece if purchased in 12-pack form).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY ADVICE:  Use this for when you have let your beard go for a long weekend, but keep a Schick twin blade around for the difficult to reach spots.  If you are staying clean shaven every morning, there&#x27;s no need to use this Hydro 5 product for everyday use.  If you want that &amp;#34;sure thing&amp;#34; shave on a daily basis, save your money and instead buy Schick Extreme 3 triple blade, I find those work great, cost less, and are still more maneuverable than the Hydro 5.</li>
            <li> For years I used Gillette products - most recently the Fusion: a nice design and good functional shaver. But one day I saw these Schick Hydro shavers in the store and decided to give them a try. The price was right and I figured if I didn&#x27;t like them as much I could just go back to my trusty Gillette products.&lt;br /&gt;I have been thrilled with the Hydro 5 and will not go back to Gillette. These blades last an incredibly long time. They shave wonderfully close and do not irritate my skin. Whatever they did for the lubrication slips along the top and bottom is amazing. The strips do not seem to wear out as fast as the Fusion blades do and they retain water better, contributing to a better shave. Finally, the guard at the top of the head pivots away from the blades allowing the blades to be placed precisely in tight places (think &amp;#34;under the nose&amp;#34;) and allows for more precision in trimming side burns. Give these a try - I really believe you will love them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Gillette for decades and ProGlide since it came out.  However, the price of new cartridges is simply ridiculous.  I paid those costs for years, but recently I just got fed up after my ProGlide started to degrade after it fourth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought a Hydro 5, I found it performs the same if not better.  Since the cartridge is not as wide, it&#x27;s easier move around and I found I don&#x27;t have to use as many strokes.  Irritation is less on skin and on my wallet.  I&#x27;m sold, Gillette can take a leap.</li>
            <li> I like these refills, though I prefer the ones made specifically for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> blows away the best gillette has! lass longer and gives a great great shave</li>
            <li> great product at a great price</li>
            <li> These work great, and I recommend them.  It would be great if they were a little less exp</li>
            <li> I always recommend the Schick Hydro 5 to anyone i know who shaves. The price here online was great, and as always smooth shave!</li>
            <li> best razor ever; been using the same one for years</li>
            <li> Finally, a blade that works.  I use these mostly to shave my head and they work great, better than all of the Headblade options I have tried.</li>
            <li> After having tried disposables, and &amp;#34;the best a man can get&amp;#34; I think Schick is the one for me. The 8 count package fit my wallet as much as my level of comfort. It was a good buy and will probably do so again</li>
            <li> I got a free razor in the mail and they hooked me for life.  I will never shave with the cheap 2 blade stuff again</li>
            <li> Great price, new blades to shave the head</li>
            <li> Note &#x3D; thoroughly rinse and dry the blades after use - wipe and &amp;#34;blow dry&amp;#34;.  Then soak in &amp;#34;baby oil&amp;#34;.  Leave submerged until the next use.  Extends the life of each blade for months!</li>
            <li> great blades/razor, very good price!</li>
            <li> I love these Schick blades. I&#x27;m a long time Gillette user, but I switched to these about 4 months ago because the Gillette Fusion blades, in addition to shaving very close, also seem to irritate my skin. I think it&#x27;s because the Fusion blades shave more of the top layer of your skin off along with the hair, whereas these Schick blades glide over your skin and seem to cut the hair only. I highly recommend this for guys with sensitive skin. Heck, you could probably get away with shaving everyday with these Schick blades.</li>
            <li> i can only get about 2 shaves with these blades where those that i buy at wal marts i can get 6 or 7 shaves out of them</li>
            <li> Awesome deal on a terrific product!  The five blades shaves the hair super close and is very comfortable!</li>
            <li> I prefer the Schick Hydro over the Gillette Fusion for two reasons. 1 The Hydro blades are easier to rinse off while shaving. 2 the blades seem to stay effective for longer(It may just be a comfort thing but I find the blades last longer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Props to Amazon for speedy shipping!</li>
            <li> ok....so they got me. I recieved a free razor in the mail from Schick.  I used it until the one blade included was worn out and then reordered the refills (nice work Schick). I have mostly been a Gillette guy but these are very outstanding razors. I THINK they are also a tad cheaper than the Gillettes I was using with no difference in performance.</li>
            <li> These blades cut close and last more than a month.  I use an electric shaver when in a hurry</li>
            <li> sharp blades, great close shave</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Hydro 5 Shick as a free sample on a Cruise Ship.  I have used thease blades for the past three years and fine this product to be the best for a good shave on a rough beard.  The price I paid is the best I can find anywhere.</li>
            <li> I have been using these blades for some time now. They shave better than the Mach 3. I am a man of color with coarse hair and I have no issues with these blades. Most of all, they last through six uses. There is nothing I dislike about the Hydro 5. The item arrived on time and was properly packed. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Great Product and much cheaper than in local stores</li>
            <li> Great blades. Long lasting, 2 1/2 -3 1/2 weeks per blade.  An excellent buy with the Amazon &amp;#34;shave club&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not bad price for number received. I still own and still use the Schick/Wilkinson 3-blade which is just about as good. Harder to find now with the &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; to these, and I find that somewhat irritating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these blades for some time, and find them smooth, and longerlasting than most.&lt;br /&gt;More costly, but worth it if you have a tough beard.</li>
            <li> Best. Razor. Ever!&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I&#x27;m a girl, but I can&#x27;t use any other razor on my legs, underarms, or anywhere! I love how easily it shaves and it leaves my skin super soft for so much longer than any other razor I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was excellent also.</li>
            <li> quick shave smooth shave</li>
            <li> My husband  says they are great. Saved us some money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a relatively young guy, all of 25 and I&#x27;ve tried DOZENS of razors, electric, traditional, even single blade.  Nothing has worked very well.  I was reluctant to try these because I&#x27;ve heard a lot of friends say that 5 blades isn&#x27;t worth it, works the same as a 4 or even a good 3 blade.  Boy were my friends wrong about that.  I have pretty sensitive skin and these blades give me the smoothest closest shave of any other razor I&#x27;ve used.  Before using these blades I would get razor irritation like crazy, even regularly changing my blades out.  If you have sensitive facial skin, below is a list of the products I use and I NEVER get any razor burn/bumps anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Edge for Sensitive Skin Shaving Gel&lt;br /&gt;2.) Schick Hydro 5 Blade Razor&lt;br /&gt;3.) Anthony Logistics Ingrown Hair Treatment (Expensive, but worth every penny)</li>
            <li> Razors are ridiculously expensive.  So you go cheap and get the costco hundred pack of twin blades and cut up your face for several months or you pay for a decent razor. This seems to be one of those instances where moving past the sticker shock and paying the arm and leg pays off.  If you keep track of how many shaves you can get out of one razor, it works out to be fairly affordable.  I have tried them all and these are my favorite.  The four blade schick are pretty decent as well.</li>
            <li> The Schick Hydro 5 gives me a close irritation free shave . I shave my entire head , except for goatee .</li>
            <li> Good blades. Sharp. but comfortable.Tough to clean - problem with many multi-blades. I subscribed.</li>
            <li> These razors are so much better than the older fashioned kind.  One of these can cover all of the hard-to-get depressions where a normal razor can&#x27;t easily get because of the bones sticking out, like around the knees.</li>
            <li> This is all I buy after 10 years of experimenting with other blades. So smooth and it really does do a good job with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very good product would buy again</li>
            <li> Like many here, I had shaved with Gillette for years prior to trying the Schick Hydro on a free trial (GREAT marketing move, Schick).  I really like the Schick and find it generally produces a smoother shave with greater ease.  The one-star knock, though, is owing to my inability to achieve a clean edge (on sideburns, etc.).  Even folding down the top part to get straight at the blades, the Schick just doesn&#x27;t edge as cleanly as the Gillette did.  Maybe it&#x27;s my technique, and I&#x27;ll learn the trick, but I havent so far after several months of use.</li>
            <li> I love these blades.  My reference product is the Gillette Fusion Proglide (PG), which are about 60% more expensive.  The Hydro 5s are not quite as wonderful out of the box on the first shave in terms of closeness, so I make a few more passes than I have to with a brand new PG.  However, comfort is still excellent, the closeness is very nearly as good as the PG, the gel reservoir lasts and lasts, the fold-away blade top works great for edging, and best of all, I can get two weeks or more out of one blade--and I have a beard like copper wire.  I think the average person could easily go a month or more.  So durability is about 2-3 times that of the PG, for much, much less money.</li>
            <li> With the addition of aloe to the lubrication strip, Schick Hydro 5 has significantly improved its soothing feel.  It also lasts a day or so longer than the previous versions.  Each blade lasts me about five days, but that fifth day is nearly lube-less.  There has GOT to be a way to increase the durability of the lubrication strip without decreasing its improved feel.</li>
            <li> Best Way to buy multi-packs at razors. It was so much cheaper to buy these through Amazon than it was even at Walmart.</li>
            <li> best shave ive ever had, and ive tried &amp;#34;Harry&#x27;s&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> To start, I shave my head and face daily, sometimes every other day, but usually daily. I have a couple of things I look for in razors:&lt;br /&gt;They last long&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t irritate my skin&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t cost me more than going to the local barber shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hydro 5 is the fourth Schick razor I&#x27;ve used (over 20 years of shaving head and face). I&#x27;ve also used the Schick Tracer (way back), the Quad Titanium and the Hydro 3. This Hydro 5 is and probably should be the best of these Schick razors. It gives me a mostly close shave. I use Slick Water preshave and Colonel Conk shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good parts: These are not near as expensive as Gillette&#x27;s five blade models.&lt;br /&gt;They actually last longer than any I&#x27;ve used, I can generally get 4-5 full shaves from one cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;They clean well despite the gel substance they leave behind&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad parts: They aren&#x27;t exactly easy to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;As much as I love Amazon and shop from them, razors aren&#x27;t one of those items I like to buy online.&lt;br /&gt;I do usually have more irritation than I would have with Gillette Proglide&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m taking one star off because the irritation can be bad, especially on my head. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because the blades are wider than the Proglide. I also would rate the Proglide, a 4 star overall. These are probably considered my go to razor just because of the value. I will admit though, if I&#x27;m shaving in the morning and have an important meeting, I use the Proglides. Luckily for me, I don&#x27;t shave much in the mornings, it&#x27;s usually at night and I can rub some aloe on my head to take care of the irritation.</li>
            <li> Great blades and much cheaper than chain store</li>
            <li> I used the Gillette Fusion blades for many years and found the Schick Hydro 5 to be as comparable at a lower price. For some reason the shave protection seemed better.</li>
            <li> I really like these razors. I have sensitive skin and these don&#x27;t bother my skin at all. You can flip back the lubricating strip and use it to hit more detailed areas like sideburns or under your nose. My wife likes to use them too.</li>
            <li> C&#x27;mon how many razors have 5 blades almost none these razors rock and they knock the socks of any Gillette product</li>
            <li> These blades work great. I just wish they weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Works great!! Price is good!</li>
            <li> These blades will last a long time and with eight in a pack you are getting a really good value!  I love these blades and the shaver is the best that I have used.  Gets you really smooth, and the hydrating gel definitely helps to moisturize!</li>
            <li> Overall shaving is a breeze using the Hydro 5 blade.  I can typically utilize each blade for 5 to 6 shavings receiving the same quality shave each time.  The only reason I gave the blades an overall rating of a 4 is based on the cost of each unit.  I am continue to be amazed that you can purchase disposable razors for less, and still receive the same close shave as these, however I don&#x27;t like the feel of the overall disposable product and I think it is a waste to throw that much of the product away.</li>
            <li> i have been using Gillette fusion pro glide for a long time, so i did some research and found these. Schick hydro 5 is by far the best blade i have used and the last me twice as long than fusion, best part is the blades are 1/2 the cost. i would recommend these to anyone</li>
            <li> These work great. I can use one blade about 5 times before I switch. I have the hydro power razor but I uses these in it and it is excellent. Also cheaper than the other major brand with 5 blades.</li>
            <li> best multi blade razor ever. the life of these razors shocked me they are cheap well made and help you get the best shave ever.</li>
            <li> My husband shaves both his face and his head. This razor is perfect for both. No nick and leaves skin baby smooth. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I love these razors and it&#x27;s nice to not have to remember to buy them, it stops me from using that last blade for an entire month until I buy more.</li>
            <li> I shifted to the Schick/Wilkinson Sword Hydro series to break away from the mould (Gillette &amp; it&#x27;s huge market capitalisation). First thing that I like is that the shaving stick can accommodate both the 3 and 5 blade refills. Helpful if you can&#x27;t find one or the other. Secondly, the ability to scoop back the aloe/wet-bead head for a shaving near nose and side-burns is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, and I do not know why, but I have been cutting myself more with the 5 blade refills than I did with the Gillette Fusion. I am most likely going to be shifting back to Gillette once I get through the 8 blades.</li>
            <li> Not too much to say other than they work like razor blades. If you are in the market for razor blades then these will fit the bill.</li>
            <li> I love these blades. The moisture strip is silly because it will all come off if you don&#x27;t keep the razor dry, but the blades give a good close shave.</li>
            <li> Like so many I&#x27;ve become tired of paying four dollars a cartridge at Costco (even) for the Gillette five blade cartridges. I&#x27;ve shaved a few times already and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I will be going with Schickfrom here on out.</li>
            <li> Blades that last forever if you use them after you shower or in the shower.</li>
            <li> Best shaver for men and women.  A friend recommended so I tried. ...and loved  long lasting too!</li>
            <li> Totally awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than in stores, and these razors give the biggest bang for the buck. Buy these!</li>
            <li> Beats Wal-Mart prices!  A STRONG BUY!</li>
            <li> I bought these on amazon because they are a much better price than anywhere else, the quality of the blades is much more advanced than Gillette, I used to used Gillette but the blades would last a few days at the most, if I used them more than that the blade would bend and cause me to get cuts on my head and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schick blades are simply a better product, last longer and cost less money than the other brands. If you are considering to change brands, do it, it will save you money and pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually not sure how they sell these blades for such a low price.  I will purchase again if the price stays low.</li>
            <li> Great item for a great price</li>
            <li> Best blades I have tried so far. Period.</li>
            <li> no worries. smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> These razors are spendy for a reason. They give you an amazingly close shave without creating the irritation you get from cheaper razors. When it comes to razors, you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> LOVED THIS PRODUCT IT IS REALLY WORTH THE MONEY I PAYED FOR IT GIVES ME A SMOOTH SHAVE EVERYTIME THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Bought these for my girlfriend to use, she loves them.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Schick Hydro 5 since the day it came out years and years ago. I am a chick, yet feel the mens&#x27; razors are just better and don&#x27;t have any frou frou lotions surrounding the blade. This gets the job done without cutting me and makes my skin silky smooth ! These cartridges are typically ridiculously expensive even at a very popular discount store, so when I saw them on Amazon for this price I was stoked !</li>
            <li> The razor industry is such a racquet.  This is a great deal and this is how I&#x27;ll purchase my razors from now on.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with these blades, they are very expensive and I have to use a new one twice as fast as the cheap single blade razor.  Also it concerns me that I am shaving with poisons on my razor. Leave off the toxic strip, it doesn&#x27;t help that much.</li>
            <li> This new Hydro 5 shave system gives me the absolutely closest shave I have ever had. The Hydro 5 blades have a great lubricant which enables me to shave &amp;#34;against the grain&amp;#34; and not feel like my skin is raw. Move over Gillette there is a new game in town. These blades cost much less and I get eight to ten great shaves out of one blade, unlike the three good shaves I got from Gillette. In my book that is tops. Better shaves, less money; who could complain?&lt;br /&gt;At first it took me a few days to get used to the bulkier shaver (which I now like better) and the ability to go over the same area several times. Now that I have it down pat I no longer have to feel like a sucker every time I buy the Gillette blades for an exorbitant price! Hello Schick-Goodby Gillette!</li>
            <li> Just as good or if not better then Gillette Fusion or Pro Glide and the Hydro 5 is cheaper in price</li>
            <li> Good blade for a good price. The Schick Hydro 5 is not as expensive as some high end blades but works well.</li>
            <li> I should give these blades a 5 star rating but I hate that they are so expensive.  I have very corse facial hair which grows in all different directions.  The Hydro 5 blades are very sharp out of the box and, unlike other 5 blade brands, they actually work as advertised and provide a smoother, closer shave.  The lotion/lubricant that comes on the blades provides a nice feel on my skin while shaving.  I love that the skin guard (where the lotion/lubricant is located) folds back for when you need a more precise shave line.</li>
            <li> Always the best razor on the market. These last so much longer than Mach 3 and and have smoother edges so they aren&#x27;t as harsh. I&#x27;ve used these for a while and never have had a severe cut/nick..</li>
            <li> Never shave a week with a dull blade again, waiting to get to store.</li>
            <li> Good price for these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these razors work very well.</li>
            <li> I am female and I use these razors because I think they are the best out there. I&#x27;ve read many places that they make male razors better than female since they are used on the face rather than the legs, and I tend to agree. I have very sensitive skin, so the hydration strip in these razors really help with the razor burn. Overall, very pleased and have been using this razor for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift so i guess well see how it goes...but it arrived when it said it would..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely nice to just be able to order on line and save a couple of bucks in the process.</li>
            <li> LOVE THEM--LOVE THEM-- LOVE THEM!!!</li>
            <li> These razors last far longer than just throwing them out after the gel stuff is gone!  Which is great for quality!  And I love the smooth glide!</li>
            <li> Best value and great shave....extremely good lubricating strip Best value and great shave....extremely good lubricating strip. Good deal if the price is right</li>
            <li> these are the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used. and that&#x27;s from a guy who shaves his head every day. and you wont find them cheaper any where else.....but by all means PROVE ME WRONG and message me if you do :)</li>
            <li> Best shave out there, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every major brand of shaver, and this s the one I have decided to sue long-term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the shavers in this group will only give your a few really close shaves, and then they degrade.  This shaver lasts about twice that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is overpriced; you&#x27;ll have to take a chill pill when you buy them.  Wal-Mart often as deals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with a great shaving cream:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009WQH8SA/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> Good, dependable blades.  I just wish they lasted longer than a week. I have tried the techniques suggested for making ehm last.  I have dried them after each use.  All these blades basically only last for one week.</li>
            <li> These blades are by far the best blades I have ever used.  They are expensive, however, I get six close shaves with each blade and have a heavy beard.  Other men I know tell me they get ten or more good shaves from each blade.</li>
            <li> These blades provide a nice close and smooth shave. &amp;#34;Hydro&amp;#34; describes the feeling perfectly. My only complaint is when the blades start to become dull the shave can be a bit uncomfortable, but i suppose thats how it is with any blade.</li>
            <li> Not perfect yet, but a progress from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that I preferred the previous design with flexible blade.&lt;br /&gt;But this one is still very good.</li>
            <li> A while back, I took a survey and said that I would never use a razor with 5 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely the best razor that I have had in a long time. It is smooth working and effective. I don&#x27;t seem to have those strange patches where the razor missed a patch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely worth upgrading to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand and model of razor for many years.  I get a really close shave and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Smoother shave, longer lasting than any Gillette blade, together with King of Shaves Alphagel shaving cream the best shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Timely delivery.  Good price.</li>
            <li> Why people continue to buy cartridges is beyond me. Every multi bladed cheese grater I&#x27;ve ever used is horribly uncomfortable to use.  I have VERY tough black hair on my chin and almost everything I&#x27;ve tried tugs horribly there especially against the grain- straight razors, double edge razors. I can use most single edge and injector razors somewhat comfortably against the grain there though. The worst of the bunch is cartridges: I&#x27;ve used Schick (obviously), Gillette Fusion, Personna, Dorco pace 3. They give the closest shave with minimal learning curve but trying to shave ATG on my chin feels like rubbing a cheese grater there. No wonder the scruffy look is so popular among men nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This specific razor Shaves TOO close. The metal thingies that smooth the skin on each blade do this. This razor left me with the worst razor burn I ever experienced. If you&#x27;re into Schick Hydros, get the Hydro 3 version. It is much more comfortable and won&#x27;t take as much layers of skin off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh also I wish there was an easy way to remove the lube strip. It becomes really sticky and nasty and hard to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again for comfort I highly recommend razors such as GEM, Ever Ready, and Schick injectors. They have a learning curve (the injector has the lowest) but the shave is far more comfortable and way cheaper too. For my injector I get 100 Personna injector blades for about $23. Every blade stays sharp for about 15 uses.</li>
            <li> Good price. Good product. My husband was very pleased because he usually pays much more. He loves these blades because he has never nicked himself since using them.</li>
            <li> These are good razor blades .</li>
            <li> what I wanted - been using for many years</li>
            <li> These are hands down the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;d recommend them to friend and stranger alike.</li>
            <li> Great shave. Nice and smooth.  No drag. Half the $$$ of fusion and lasts twice as long. Completely satisfied !!!</li>
            <li> works great and lasts for a good amount of times- several re-shaves are no issue at all.. make sure you run the &amp;#34;conditioning bead strip&amp;#34; under hot water before use to emulsify it.. much cheaper than fusion- who can pay $20+ for 8-10 blades?? good product thank you schick</li>
            <li> This shaving blades are of great quality and what a great smooth soft skin it leaves after its use. I will recommend this product to all my friends and family, to anyone in general!</li>
            <li> Back when I was youger I was shaving with a double bladed disposable razor. I was getting cuts everywhere, and shaving was taking forever. Since I have such a thick beard that grows quickly, I realized I was going to need a real razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Hydro 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually tried out the Hydro 5 by chance. It was a kick ass sampler in a package of shaving cream. I tried it once and I was hooked. Smooth shave, the blades were sharp and it even had this cool lubrication built in. Because of this, cuts were minimal. I tried out another shaver, but it was far inferior to the Hydro 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently out of curiosity, I signed up for Dollar Shave Club. You might have heard of them - they made a brilliant viral marketing video on youtube. Naturally, I signed up for the 6 blade razor they offered. As it turns out, their supplier is Dorco USA. Needless to say, I wasn&#x27;t impressed. The Hydro 5 offers a superior shave. Dorco&#x27;s razor has 6 blades, but they are spaced out closer. Schick places the blades farther apart, and they are thicker and of higher quality. Furthermore, the Hydro 5&#x27;s handle is smaller and thinner, allowing you to flip the blade easily in your hand to change the direction of strokes. The Dorco razor&#x27;s handle is too thick and bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, you can order all of these blades in bulk if you really like them and want to stick with them, so DSC is not that great of a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that the Hydro 5 is one of the best razor&#x27;s out there, and reasonably priced as well. If you have a heavy beard like me or just looking for an excellent razor, the Hydro 5 is your best bet.</li>
            <li> Saved 50% compared to buying it from the store. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Only shaver that I use, quick shower saves as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. Long lasting and stays sharp ( 1)</li>
            <li> husband prefers this over the Gillette. He says it does better with his ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Gillette user since I started shaving.  But the cost of shaving cartridges is forcing me to look for cheaper options.  I&#x27;ve now tried this Schick razor, with mixed results.  I nicked myself twice, both nasty cuts.  But I&#x27;m willing to give it another chance or two.  The Schick blade cartridges are wider, top to bottom, to allow more blades in one cartridge.  The wider shaving area will take time to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;Schick might be a good, lower cost alternative for shaving.  I might miss the single blade Gillette has for shaving tough-to-reach spots under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;I will try to update this review after a few weeks of using the Schick razor.</li>
            <li> Best blades ever and a great price....wil be reordering again.</li>
            <li> I have had excellent results with this product.</li>
            <li> I am a long-time Gillette fan, but decided to try this new Schick razor. Very well-made, giving a comfortable, close shave, with no face irritation, when used with a good shave foam.</li>
            <li> Great Product  for those who have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> These multi blade razor blades are great!</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly, to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t fit the Gillette handle</li>
            <li> Arrived in just one day.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Great, smooth shave. The real deal (to me) is worth the extra cost. Have found nothing but bumpy cuts and abrasive feeling from the second hand brands.</li>
            <li> Works well. The main reason I got this on Amazon is it was the best price at the time.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave. Long lasting.</li>
            <li> These are great blades. I tried a free sample blade that Schick mailed to me and I liked it a little more that the Atra blades.  Unfortunately, I think that these are even more expensive than the comparable Atra&#x27;s.  This blade, however, also lasted a little while longer than the Atra.  That said, it would seem to me that Schick should really undercut the Gillette price if they really want to make a dent in Gillettes dominance in disposable blades. If I didn&#x27;t get the free sample, I never would have even given Schick a try.</li>
            <li> These are still my favourite blades to shave with as it gives a really close shave and the hydrating effect from the aloe vera is very hydrating indeed.</li>
            <li> Item as described -- fast delivery.</li>
            <li> These items are all monopolized and we have no other choice then to shell-out mega bucks for these penny-worth razors.</li>
            <li> Great blade for my legs, hardly any nicks at all if any, plus I just use my bar soap for lather, the blade gives me a smooth feel!</li>
            <li> The razor blades are very efficient and last a long time.  It provides a smooth shave every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Great, and love the subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a place that sold these razor refills and I&#x27;ve finally found it here on Amazon. Best bang for you buck. I will continue to purchase my refills from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I think these are fake because they cut my skin up like crazy.  When I bought them from a box store, they never cut my skin up.  I would suggest purchasing from a store.</li>
            <li> Thhe best razor on the market today. I usually get between 19/25 shaves per blade with no nicks or iration.</li>
            <li> Used these razors for a year.  Went back to my Mach 3.  Much prefer the Mach 3 to this razor.</li>
            <li> Love the blades, and this is the best price I can find on a refill. Would buy again when I need more.</li>
            <li> The price on this was better than on several other sites we visited and 8 blades should last a long time.  My criticism is that blades are very expensive but this applies to most, if not all, blades!!  Be sure to look at new products as they are introduced as they will do the same job at an introductory price.</li>
            <li> The Hydro 5 is the best razor out there!</li>
            <li> Have used the Hydro 5 for a couple of years now. There very sharp when new and last a maximum of 2 weeks, shaving everyday. Must used them with very hot water. Wish Schick would bring back the FX Tracer.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving.  But these make it a little more enjoyable.  The blades last forever, or so it seems.  I sometimes go three days between shaves and these will cut right through it.  Just make sure that you rinse them often from the backside and they should last quite a while.  I&#x27;ve been shaving for years and these are by far the best I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you see in stores</li>
            <li> I have never used a better blade and am definitely sold on The Schick Hydro 5.</li>
            <li> Great price for the over priced world of shaving. Seems like every day I find something else to buy on Amazon and save money!</li>
            <li> Wonderful value.  A $3.00 off coupon was unexpected, but every dollar saved is awesome.  Retailers charge too much.</li>
            <li> The Schick Hydro with 5 blades is quite good. It works with no nicks or cuts for the first couple shaves. Then I started getting nicked over and over again. In the razors defense my hair is very thick and course. It has been hard for  me to find a razor that is going to last long and cut with no blood spilled. If you have fine to normal facial hair this product is going to make you so happy. It also will provide you with a quick and efficient cut. One thing is for sure, it keeps your face moist and hydrated while you cut.</li>
            <li> These are the only blades my husband will use on his sensitive skin. So much cheaper than the ones bought locally at Wally World!</li>
            <li> i think except for cost of shipping a good purchase</li>
            <li> Like many men out there, I got into the &amp;#34;old fashioned shaving&amp;#34; trend for awhile. There were promises of dramatic savings (who can argue with replacement razor blades that cost &amp;#60;$0.50 each?), closer shaves (once you got past the cut-prone learning curve), and the addition of a satisfying morning ritual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I can confidently say now that most of those selling points were bullcrap. I&#x27;m sure that some men enjoy DE shaving as pastime and artform, but it&#x27;s not for most of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I for one have kept my badger brush and Taylor if Old Bond Street Sandalwood cream. I like that part (and strongly recommend it). But I just had to ditch the old-style DE razor. This thing is so much better, in so many ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the cost for replacement cartridges is reasonable. Competitor 5 blade manufacturers laud their $2 replacement cartridges (e.g. Harrys). Well... you can get Schick Hydro 5 replacement cartridges for slightly more, and the result is a simpler, quicker, more soothing shave. I have yet to cut myself with the Schick Hydro 5. The same cannot be said of any other manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why waste your time agonizing over which chic, all-metal handle to get - you know, one that goes along with your chrome badger brush, chrome bowl, and chrome stand. Who gives a crap. One day someone will manufacture a sleek, chrome handle that accepts Schick Hydro 5 heads but until then... the sheer functionality of this thing outweighs aesthetics by a mile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally there is the matter of longevity. I shave 2-3 times a week. My beard is not very heavy. Still, I think it&#x27;s pretty impressive that I can use a single cartridge for roughly 3 months. Furthermore, the blades are so easy to clean that my &amp;#34;razor sharpening pad&amp;#34; (which really exists just to remove interstitial gunk) has become obsolete. Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, the Schick Hydro 5 has marked my bittersweet departure from my purist &amp;#34;classic shaving&amp;#34; experiment - and I couldn&#x27;t give less of a crap. I still enjoy lathering up classic shaving cream (the kind that comes in tubs). I mean, a single unit will last you up to a year... and the good stuff smells better than cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you, like me, got tired of hacking your face to bits... and spending half an hour or more using classic razors... and you could not find the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; aesthetically pleasing handle (for a Mach 3 or whatever)... do yourself a favor and just switch to a Schick Hydro 5.4; experiment - and I couldn&#x27;t give less of a crap. I still enjoy lathering up classic shaving cream (the kind that comes in tubs). I mean, a single unit will last you up to a year... and the good stuff smells better than cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you, like me, got tired of hacking your face to bits... and spending half an hour or more using classic razors... and you could not find the &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; aesthetically pleasing handle (for a Mach 3 or whatever)... do yourself a favor and just switch to a Schick Hydro 5.</li>
            <li> the hydro wears out fast.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected - this is the same that I buy in the local stores but at a better price</li>
            <li> Move over Harry (like in Harry&#x27;s Blades) there&#x27;s a new Super Razorblade on the block looking to take the Crown away from Gillette&#x27;s Fusion! OMG the Hydro 5 is the BEST razor blade that I have ever experienced on my VERY TOUGH curly, black beard in the 50 years that I have been shaving. It is so comfortable that I barely notice it as I pull over and around by cowlickey beard. Not only is the shave comfortable it is super close and clean. At this time the blades are selling for around one-half the price of the much less comfortable Gillette Fusion ($2 or so versus $3.75 or so per blade depending on where and when you buy them) and the best part is I get twice as many shaves per blade (six shaves for the Hydro versus just three for the Fusion) over the Fusion, but as things usually go these won&#x27;t last long as Hydro becomes more popular and Schick seeking greater profits as market share increases will also increase the Hydro&#x27;s price and make the blades less sharp. Having said that, I always knew that a better blade could be made just as I always knew that a car could be manufactured that gets 150 miles per gallon or more (a mechanical engineer proved this to me over 40 years ago). We just have to wait until Profits and Politics are out of the Way and War no more!</li>
            <li> its a replacement cartridge, works with my current handle and it comes with 8 of them. what else can you ask for. great price for the amount of cartridges.</li>
            <li> good, reliable, the price ws excellent too.</li>
            <li> By far the best blades I&#x27;ve used, last forever, don&#x27;t cut me up, a bit wide of course so that can sometimes cause some issues, but it is 5 blades, so that is expected.</li>
            <li> Good Savings with subscribe &amp; save!</li>
            <li> Best cartridge style razor that I have found. I can get 3 to 4 weeks of daily shaving out of one of these. Most others I get about 1 week.</li>
            <li> I wear a beard and use these to trim the edges.&lt;br /&gt;I think they have priced this product out of my reach but they do last a long time when keep clean and  only trim that close twice a week. I use a Ronson  beard trimmer every day.  I like the combination.</li>
            <li> great product i love it , thanks for my schick hydro 5 blade , i recommend to buy one is a very good product !</li>
            <li> My husband won&#x27;t use anything else. He shaves his head and face every day and loves these.</li>
            <li> Love them!  I use to buy the cheap razors and never understood that they were ripping up my face! I friend gave me one in a deployment and I have used this brand ever since!&lt;br /&gt;Bad: can be pricey to buy refills&lt;br /&gt;Good: my face feels so much better&lt;br /&gt;Overall: these are worth the price. The blades last a long time and no more ripping my face up with cheap blades!  I will use these for as long as Schlick sells them</li>
            <li> As per the description great item. I would purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it, but I take away one star because razors shouldn&#x27;t be that expensive</li>
            <li> Excellent product fast shipping</li>
            <li> Smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom; no knicks.  Fast and comfortable.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite shaving blades very smooth to use.</li>
            <li> Just as described A++++++</li>
            <li> Used an Amazon Coupon to snag these refillable razors. Can&#x27;t get&lt;br /&gt;much closer of a shave. I have seen these on sale in my local drugstore&lt;br /&gt;and the manufacturer does put out coupons. I would say that these are&lt;br /&gt;worth every penny to get that smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Great razor blades. I received this razor for free and loved the close shave I received on my legs! Yes I am a female and use this for shaving my legs. I shave less frequently now, the blades last for many shaves.</li>
            <li> Way cheaper than the store, great razors</li>
            <li> good product and value</li>
            <li> As always, this product provides excellent shaves.  It is very reliable and has a competitive price.</li>
            <li> My husband, and I love these!&lt;br /&gt;The best price i&#x27;ve ever seen razors sold for, and they work!!&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again&lt;br /&gt;Great price!!!!!! (At least at the time of our purchase)</li>
            <li> product is amazing and the shipping was really quick</li>
            <li> For the price this is in my opinion the best razor on the market today</li>
            <li> My husband loves these blades!! I&#x27;ve tried to get him to try others but he won&#x27;t switch! So now I buy them in bulk!</li>
            <li> Good product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I have been using these blades for about two years now, and find that I get an excellent shave from the blades.  I have a very tough beard, and find these blades do well at cutting, but I do have to make two or three passes in some areas to get a good shave, but I have this issue with other razors also.  I use the power razor with the vibration on.  I was skeptical of this idea, and never tried it before purchasing one of the razors about two years ago that was a great deal, and found the vibration was more beneficial than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted to point out that the area above the blades flips back allowing you to shave the area above your lip directly below your nose.  I did not read the instructions and was initially concerned that the razor would not shave that location, but it works well once you know how the razor blade operates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, these are not cheap disposable razors.  One of my top concerns whe purchasing razor blades is how long will they last.  I generally shave 5 - 6 days per week, and can get at least 5 to 6 weeks out of one blade.  I have purchased disposable razors, which still cost about a third of the cost of these razors, but I am ready to toss them after half a dozen shaves, which, in the long run, I find more value in purchasing these razor blades over disposable razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many different blades over my thirty some years of shaving, and would rank these blades among the top.  I would definately recommend this blade to anyone who wants a good shave, and is mindful of the value in buying good blades over cheap blades.</li>
            <li> I am delighted with this item&lt;br /&gt;The firm is best&lt;br /&gt;He advised all to buy this item and forget about skin irritation</li>
            <li> Works great--the flip back edger is a great addition. With the electric handle you get a shave like you will not believe.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving stuff I ever had....much better than any product available in todays Market...and price No one can ....</li>
            <li> Excellent product with unbeatable price, what else to say about it. Also, shipped just in time, I will say just go for it!</li>
            <li> Works okay, a little cheaper here than in the stores</li>
            <li> Its one of the best shavei want without the razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Hubby says great item!  fast fast shipping!  thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Cheaper than at target and its a good blade</li>
            <li> Best blades available.  Without a doubt.</li>
            <li> These blades give a close shave every time.</li>
            <li> Been shaving my head for 10 years with the mach 3.  These babies blow the mach 3 AWAY!  I&#x27;m a truly converted Hydro 5 man now!</li>
            <li> Great just great, rated with razor I did a head to head, right side left side test with Gillette Fusion. This is far better and 1/2 the price. I&#x27;d like to test one of those single edge razors. I&#x27;m told there just as good, cheaper yet.&lt;br /&gt;Updated:&lt;br /&gt;All razors give a close shave for different lengths of time,. I prolong the life of blades by storing the razor in vegetable oil after each use. I get twice as many shaves that way. So this is the cost of good close shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Schick Hydro  .07c shave&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Fusion.proglide  .18c&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Pro Glide .10c&lt;br /&gt;I received the Fusion proglide as a free promotion and it was by far the most costly per shave.</li>
            <li> Love the Hydro 5 razor, it shaves close and very smoothly. One blade lasts me weeks  so even though these refills cost a bit more than some others they make up for it with longevity and performance. I have not had any issues with bumps or skin irritation since using these. These blades will give you a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I cut myself easily with cheap and/or disposable blades.  The Hydro 5 blade razors are great.  They are very sharp, cut very well, and it&#x27;s really hard for me to cut myself with them.  My only problem is if I don&#x27;t shave every day the hair gets caught up in the blades clogging them and I have to use a toothbrush to clean the hair off the blades to make the razor useful again.</li>
            <li> These work much better for me, than the Schick Hydro 5 sensitive ones.  Those tend to cut me up, these work like a charm, no cuts and gives me a smooth, soft, comfortable shave.  The blades don&#x27;t dull extremely easily, so I feel I got a good deal for the price paid.</li>
            <li> this is cheaper than gillette refills but just as good.  They still only last about a month though so that hasn&#x27;t changed</li>
            <li> best blades last long and cut well and having 5 of them is the perfect amount for my face I give them a 5 out of 5!!</li>
            <li> Since i switched to schick, i never consider using other product. so smooth on skin and you never feel bumps</li>
            <li> Exactly like what you buy in the store, at a fraction of the price. I&#x27;ve used these and they are just like store-bought. Great product.</li>
            <li> Once you use this, it is almost impossible to go back to whatever you were using before. I have to take off one star because the aloe stops working after a short while. Just gets used up. But the blade will continue to cut sharp, just with no aloe.</li>
            <li> I like the Hydro 5 razor for one very specific reason: The lubrication strip folds back, so it lasts a lot longer. That&#x27;s the scam with Gillette -- the strip runs out after 1-2 shaves. I need the strip to get a smooth shave, but I don&#x27;t need it for anywhere near every stroke. The Hydro 5 allows me to use the lubrication strip when I want it (maybe 1 in 10 strokes) and pull it back and out of the way when I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, the blade refills are cheaper than Gillette Fusion. But not as cheap as Dorco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Gillette, you&#x27;ve lost my money.</li>
            <li> Outstanding all the way around!</li>
            <li> They work well for me. One cartridge last about a month. Much lower in price than the other brand.</li>
            <li> Good price for these blades, and yes, 5 IS better than 3.  Not sure how much bigger they can go, but I did the half face test (half another razor) and these really did work better.</li>
            <li> Gives an extremely smooth (no nick) shave. A bit expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> My complaint about this category of product in general is the cost for what you get.  These are great, but I actually prefer the 3 blad option.</li>
            <li> I never entertained this type of item before and was really surprised by the quality of the 5 razors.  Thanks again.</li>
            <li> My husband prefers these blades.  Nice close shave and the each blade lasts for a many shaves.</li>
            <li> These took the fore in our household over Fusion, which had been the family standard. Nice close shave ... on hubby&#x27;s beard and my legs. Good, sturdy, long-lasting blades as well.</li>
            <li> These blades just won&#x27;t quit.  I&#x27;m a former mach three blade user.  My experience is that the M3s became&lt;br /&gt;dull quickly.  I shave my entire head and face and have been using the same Hydro 5 blade for almost 2 months, and it&#x27;s still sharp.  After each use I wash the blade and dry it up on the towel.  What I like most about this blade is that that Bluetip on the top tilts back allowing you to trim your mustache if need be.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Good price but not as good as some other new shave club.... Sorry. Cancelled my subscribe &amp; save</li>
            <li> item works just as described, j</li>
            <li> Not much to say, been buying these for a while. I think they&#x27;re a bit pricey, but hey they do the job. I haven&#x27;t ever used anything else.</li>
            <li> Cost too much to be worth using again...</li>
            <li> Just like what you&#x27;d buy at the store, but way less inexpensive. I paid way less than I would locally.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these. He says they last for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I used no other razor now ...smoothest shave ever</li>
            <li> Better than Gillette. The gillette top blade always cuts me, whereas schick has a guard. Price needs to come down on refills.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin, so this bad boys are the softest on your skin. The main reason i bought them are because they never cut my skin to end up with small bleeds.</li>
            <li> I have been a schick (or Wilkinson Sword in the UK), user for 25 years.  I love these Hydro 5 blades for the way they glide and their general longevity.  They stay sharp for longer than previous models and cope with the extended stubble I am usually trying to scrape off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As described (genuine) from a third party seller (Fast Ship Consumer Outlet).</li>
            <li> It shaves very well. I deducted a star because the soap head is slimy when used but u can lift that part up and use the blades alone. this also helps with getting a precise shave</li>
            <li> Exelent hydro 5 good price to</li>
            <li> cleanest and safest shave I have found</li>
            <li> They are blades, what can you say about them. They work and they are not as expensive as gillette</li>
            <li> I like the product, especially when I&#x27;m in a pinch and don&#x27;t have time to lather up.</li>
            <li> Very good articuluo , curbio my need , thank you very much</li>
            <li> Best razors on the market.</li>
            <li> Great blades.  Best price I could find</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care how long these blades last, or how inexpensive they are - they barely perform the task they&#x27;re supposed to.  Trying to shave even the lightest amount of stubble was an exercise in frustration, and no matter how carefully I shaved, my face (and especially my neck) would end up cut all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette blades cost a lot more and may not last as long as the Hydro 5 blades, but they win in one category - they actually work, unlike these.  Sadly, I bought a 16-pack of these blades from a particular brick-and-mortar wholesale store, and now I have to figure out what to do with the other 15 blades.  I guess I&#x27;ll throw them away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these blades are really significantly better than any other brand of multi-blade device.  Personally I think all of these blades are way overpriced.  Schick and Gillett must be making a killing for their CEO.  When these run out, I plan to try an old-school single blade &amp;#34;safety razor&amp;#34;.  Those blades are still pennies.</li>
            <li> The best shave so far!</li>
            <li> Love this razor! Great shave. (The refills are the same price at Walmart as on Amazon, but it&#x27;s convenient not to have to go to the store - if you plan ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Just a note: Men, I read this in several comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  **If you are using any razor for 3 or 4 weeks and complaining that you&#x27;re getting bumps all over your face, it&#x27;s not the razor&#x27;s fault. It&#x27;s very likely a Staph infection. You probably need antibiotics. Count yourself lucky if you don&#x27;t get MRSA. (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus - which has become a common staph infection that is resistant to most antibiotics) It can take over your face in 1 or 2 days, and your face can quickly sw&lt;br /&gt;ell beyond belief - for real! It starts with one white head looking bump. Unfortunately, it lives everywhere these days - the gym, hospitals, even in your house. Moreover, MRSA on your face can be quite serious. It can go to the brain. You might even already have it hiding in your nose. It likes to hide and grow there. Not to make you paranoid, but 3 - 4 weeks is too long to use any razor - even if it lasts that long. (Just attempting to rid you of that pesky nightmare. It hurts, and it&#x27;s hard to rid yourself of the infection.) Please see your doctor if this is your case. Cheers!</li>
            <li> I really like the schtick hydro 5 but I am not too thrilled about the gel above the blades. Gel runs out fast and it gets a bit droopy and sticky during the shave.</li>
            <li> Great value &amp; fast shipping, as always. The razors hold up well without causing razor burn.</li>
            <li> These are the very best!  They last much longer and shave closer than any other product on the market.  Haven&#x27;t even had one &#x27;knick&#x27; while shaving.</li>
            <li> Best price anywhere! This razor is loved by my husband and myself. We now own three of them so that we always have a back up. Won&#x27;t ever go back to the old ones.</li>
            <li> Overpriced but the best ones I have found.</li>
            <li> My husband asks for these blades by name. Getting them here with subscribe and save is the best price I can find.</li>
            <li> New blades at a good price.</li>
            <li> I buy these for my dad. He shaves daily and says each blade lasts for a week. What I like about them is they do not seem to make him bleed from nicks. He&#x27;s on blood thinners, so I worry. All in all, these are the best option for my dad and at a reasonable price at that.</li>
            <li> Used $3 off coupon. 8 cartridges worth the money. Double priced in retail. Will recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product, perfect! I was using another brand and I thought I would give these a try!  I will never go back to my old brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these blades for quite a long time, but a few months ago I ordered six blade razor from DORCO, a bargain at about half the price.  It was no bargain; the lube strips are ineffective at best, and compared to Schick, it is no contest.  They&#x27;re pricey, but it is true that you get what you pay for.  I pitched the bargain blades in the trash.</li>
            <li> I typically shower without the light on. One morning having grabbed the &amp;#34;Schick Hydro 5 Blade Razor&amp;#34; I hopped in the shower and shaved and thought &amp;#34;Wow! This is better than my 3 Blade Razor.&amp;#34; As I was drying my wife turned on the light and I had used the 3 Blade Razor. I seriously doubt having used both for a few weeks now that there is any benefit to 3 vice 5 blades. The 3 Blade Razor has a heavier handle which I prefer but they cut the same.</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s how the water-activated aloe works...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using my last blade for about 2yrs, didn&#x27;t work really well and was rough on my skin, shaving cream helped it shave like normal though. I shave twice a week and I honestly don&#x27;t know how I used 1 blade for 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value pack too, about $2 cheaper than my local stores.</li>
            <li> I only use this razor to shave my head each morning; my face is much too sensitive for anything other than a Braun electric shaver.  Nevertheless, it&#x27;s smooth and clean. By the way, I use each of these razors for at least two months before tossing in the trash. They last a lot longer than that when they are dried after each use. Sure, they don&#x27;t have the same edge they had fresh out of the box; but even after a couple of months, they can cleanly and smoothly cut my bristly hair. Save your money and get more service out of these blades; they can take it.</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to get the spot right by your nose! It also tears up my skin. I&#x27;m buying something else!</li>
            <li> These blades are so great.  They really give a wonderful, close and smooth shave and they last a good amount of time.  So much better than a disposable razor. I will order again and again.</li>
            <li> This package of high quality blades represents about a year of shaving for me, and all at a great price.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and effective</li>
            <li> Just what i needed and pretty cheap. Saved a few bucks with the free shipping too.</li>
            <li> I like these better than Gillette.  The only problem is they aren&#x27;t as available as the Gillette blades, so getting them online is the way to go.</li>
            <li> So my husband was blessed (?maybe) with a super thick beard a lot of younger guys wish they had half of....but the problem is that he&#x27;s always suffered with skin reactions on his neck (more sensitive area than the face).  With the cheaper disposable razors he gets all cut up and little bumps on his neck.  With this one he gets a clean shave and a lot less issues with bumps and cuts.  In fact, he usually doesn&#x27;t get them unless he shaves every day.  Definitely suggest purchasing this product!  The razors seam to last long enough too!</li>
            <li> Smooth, comfortable shave, less irritation than Fusion, slightly cheaper cartridges, releases conditioner. The shave I got from the Hydro 5 was as close as from Fusion, but with less irritation and less pull. The cartridges also last somewhat longer and the liquid conditioner release is awesome.</li>
            <li> good, close shave with no nicks or irritation. Men&#x27;s blades are invariably better than what is marketed to women; I had been using the Gilette Mach-something but moved on to these when my husband started using them. He&#x27;s now switched to a safety razor for his face, but I&#x27;m just going to stick with these.</li>
            <li> Right item. Could of been a bit cheaper...</li>
            <li> I have used quit a few different razors. I know they look gimicky with 5 blades but they are smooth. I have sensitive skin on my face.  Most razors actually hurt may face if I have more than a days growth. These are awesome no pain even with 2-3 days of growth.</li>
            <li> The blades are great and although still too expensive, it is cheaper than the Gillette brands that rob you blind.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS AGREAT DEAL ON THESE REFILL BLADES. I HAVE PAID ALMOST $15 FOR 4 REFILLS AT STORES IN TOWN.</li>
            <li> As a woman, there are so many hair removal products and pink razors out there.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many I&#x27;ve tried... Venus this and lady shaver that.  I believe it was about 6 years ago that I picked up my boyfriend&#x27;s razor in the shower and realized that men&#x27;s razors are way better!  These razors were designed to shave the most intricate areas like cheekbones and upper lips on men, so why would a lady&#x27;s knee or above the ankle be any different?  So far I have tried Mach 5 and other men&#x27;s razors, but Schick Hydro 5 has definitely been my favorite for the past several years.  It is also the best for the price that I&#x27;ve seen thus far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve usually use Gillette Fusion razors but I thought I would try this for a change.  They work well and cost less than the Fusion razors.  I would definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> My wife first got the Schick Hydro 5 with a free coupon and I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;But when I asked her to pick up a refill, the cost of these were way higher than&lt;br /&gt;the blades I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after looking around, I noticed that Amazon had these and they were on sale,&lt;br /&gt;so I ordered 2 packs which will last me awhile. (Did I mention these last way longer&lt;br /&gt;than my previous brand?)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, only issue is to get them when they are on special, otherwise cheaper at Walmart.</li>
            <li> They give me a good shave and last a long time. What more can one ask for. Bulk buying ie 8 blades also a good deal.</li>
            <li> I always save money with Amazon.  These refills are not counterfeit.  I am able to buy 16 at a time.  Costco seems to have a deal with Gillette and its not my brand!</li>
            <li> was a good thing to get the 8 razors and husband liked the 8,only wish they were a couple dollars cheaper</li>
            <li> Tried these blades and Gillette profusion.  Preferred the feel of these blades plus they seem to last a little longer.  Only downside is a larger surface area, tougher for close spots, but no blade is perfect and these are the closest I&#x27;ve found to it.  Reasonable price compared to the competition.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave and a single cartridge will last me 2-3 months.  Nice not to have razor burn.</li>
            <li> Best blades &amp; razor ever.</li>
            <li> es un producto muy comodo, hermoso,  muy llamativo, llama mucho la atencion cuando hablo por telefono lo recomiendo sinceramente., lo lo dudo en ningun momento</li>
            <li> For a long time I thought Mach3 is the blade in market till I found the Hydro 5. This product is fabulous and works for at least 2 weeks (daily shaving).</li>
            <li> And on top of me receiving a product that I didn&#x27;t fully expect, using the blades feels exceptionally dull. Almost as if the product was used.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the razer model though, I might try to buy more replacement blades, but it might just be time to move on to a newer razer model as well.</li>
            <li> I used a different brand for at least ten years.  I tried these and have never turned back.  They just work better than anything else.</li>
            <li> Love these razors.  These are the best razors I have ever used.  They cut clean, and stay sharp.  Best price I can find anywhere as well.</li>
            <li> Bought these for a friend for her husband.  She was so very pleased with the price compared to prices she had paid at drug , grocery and big box stores on previous occasions .</li>
            <li> These blades are shave very smooth and last for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and great job.</li>
            <li> I have never used a Shick razor before starting to use the Hydro 5 but....Wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smooth, non-irritating shave.  Gel &amp;#34;reservoir&amp;#34; works like a champ.  Handle has a good heft to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part though is blade life.  I shave 4 to 5 times a week and would assume I have a pretty average rate of growth.  I used to use a Gillette 5 blade razor and got a max of one week out of it before the burning and irritation started.  I am going on week number 7 and even though most of the gel is gone from the reservoir I haven&#x27;t detected the slightest amount of burning or irritation as of yet.  I&#x27;m expecting to get at least another week out of it before I change it.</li>
            <li> These things cut my beard like Shaka Zulu</li>
            <li> I love these, they get the closest shave of anything ive ever owned, I would recommend to anyone. love it.</li>
            <li> Awesome price and shipped on time.  The blades are great and gentle on my face.  Keeping them dry helps extend the life of the blades.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!!! Works great n is very friendly on my skin</li>
            <li> Something is very wrong with these blades, they cut and burn.  It feels like if you are using a tiger claw to shave.</li>
            <li> Great shave for a good price. No complaints</li>
            <li> By reducing skin friction with a cold cream like Noxema, a gel shaving cream, and at least 3 bladed refill, I have cut the need for blades to 2 a year.  The vibrating head of the Schick shaver gives a really close shave that other multi-bladed razors couldn&#x27;t.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great blades but expensive. One cartridge lasts me 6 months.  One of those blades you get in a 5 pack at the dollar store to me is about 50% as good as one of these.  I have to go over my face more times and one lasts me about 2 months. But the Schick&#x27;s are more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I like this razor, and am happy to save some money on the replacement blades, although they are still ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me but these blades don&#x27;t seem to be as sharp as the ones I bought in the store.</li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable and close shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a disposable razor.  My only complaint is price.  Could be a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item using the subscribe and save service and I really did save. I love these razors they are my favorite brand but are expensive. buying them this way saved me quick a bit</li>
            <li> And now not only they are a reality, but work great!!&lt;br /&gt;I wish they would come in larger counts than 8.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my schick &amp;#34;female&amp;#34; handle in error. I decided &#x27;what the heck&#x27; let&#x27;s use it and I just love it - better than the ones especially designed for women. A friend had mentioned this to me a while ago and I just never followed through until now and only by mistake! Love!</li>
            <li> super shave. no pull or drag.</li>
            <li> Dry heads.....last longer</li>
            <li> love these blades,. they hooked me when i first tried it out on a promo a few years ago  , best shave with the least irritation i had given myself in so long. i had always had problems with razor burn and sensitivity/irritation no matter what i tried and all it took was changing to the schick Hydro 5. whenever they go on sale i buy a bunch</li>
            <li> very good I am counting the days one razor gives me - up to 12 so far and still sharp and easy.</li>
            <li> I switched from a variety of Gillette razors including some of their premium versions to Schick as a result of a promotion where I bought a Schick 5 blade at a large discount. That was around 18 months or more ago and since then I&#x27;ve not returned back to Gillette as I find the Schick provides a cleaner, closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall good razor blades, I just wish you could buy them in bulk for a much larger discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the price - 4 stars only.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite blades to date.</li>
            <li> They do the job and do it well. I get a nice smooth shave every time. A five pack should last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I really like these blades. The shave a lot better than Gillette and last longer too. Also, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel scraped or burned, like before. Truly 5 stat product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without my Hydro 5</li>
            <li> Every tithing was very good Fast shipping I love this works very good.</li>
            <li> Smooth shaving experance. Work&#x27;s as advertized. Check WalMart before ordering replacements.eaper plus you don&#x27;t have to pay shipping.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here...they&#x27;re razors. They came as advertised and at decent price. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for over a year now and keep ordering them.  They are by far the best razors I have found.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE&lt;br /&gt;AND THE BEST BLADES EVER</li>
            <li> It still works well as before, but occasional irritation occurs, also minor cuts if you press too hard. Use lightly and change weekly or every 2 weeks at the longest. It works best in combination with shaving oil and shaving cream for me.</li>
            <li> What can I say about razer blade refills. I have not had any problem with them. If you cut yourself with a razer it is usually due to making a sideways motion with the blade while shaving unless of course you drag the razor across &amp;#34;lumps and bumps&amp;#34; without being careful. For those complaining about cuts etc.... use some common sense when using a razor.</li>
            <li> Have been using disposable razors because of cost, but now I feel the comfort of the Hydro shave justifies the extra cost.</li>
            <li> I would get the razors again!</li>
            <li> Better deal than you can find at the store.  My husband swears by these.  Clean, smooth shave, never gets any razor burn, and they last quite a while for a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving. This is the best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. It last much longer and shaves better than any Gillette Fusion blades.</li>
            <li> I was originally not much of a fan of this entire Hydro shaving system.  The razor seemed big and bulky to me and I didn&#x27;t like having to snap the top half of the razor down for those close spots (like under the nose).  However, the more I&#x27;ve used them and compared to others (3 blade Gillette) I have come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if we could only get the price down.</li>
            <li> The ones I got are defective or in some other way tampered with.  They hurt my face like an old blade.  Worse than any old blade I&#x27;ve ever used, in fact.  The gel/hydration strip is about half what I&#x27;m used to.  I&#x27;m wondering if someone creatively sent back their used ones in a package or if these were fakes.</li>
            <li> We have tried so many brands of razors and I never gave this brand a second glance until I began pretty extensive research on amazon for the best. most affordable razor, this is the best over any Mach 3, Gillette, or Remington razors. Both my husband and I use only this brand despite it being for men, women&#x27;s blades suck at getting a close shave. The sub &amp; save price is the best, Gillette fusion is way too expensive and I think these do a better job anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisture gel strip doesn&#x27;t come off like the Gillette&#x27;s do and I didn&#x27;t even know about the blades special flip precision trimmer until my husband recently pointed it out. The blade lasts about 2 weeks with daily shaving for me and a bit longer for my husband. I recommend using the Cremo Shave Cream which I just recently discovered - it&#x27;s really good for a close shave. The Hydro 5 is a little better than the 3 but I buy whatever is the best value.</li>
            <li> fast shipping and they cut good</li>
            <li> I totally love using these blades, they are so smooth and comfortable. I bought these online to save a couple bucks. My only negative comment about them is that the moisturizing gel is hard to wash out. I often find myself rewashing my face to remove the gel. Besides the gel, the blades are definitely the best I have used (I have tried all the &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; brands).</li>
            <li> These cost like $20 in the store but I got them from here for a fraction of the price. Same exact product, great value!</li>
            <li> The price could be better, but these are my favorite blades and they delivered them to my house. No complaints.</li>
            <li> These work great, however, I bought with the expectation that they would have an edging tool. They also seems to go dull faster than other razors I&#x27;ve use and knick easier.</li>
            <li> I really love the aloe on the tips of these blades. It leaves my face feeling baby smooth. The blades themselves get a nice, clean shave every time. What I really like is the fact that the aloe seems to last right up until the blades start to get dull. I shave about once every 3-4 days and these blades last me about 2-3 months. These were the first blades I used to shave and I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, fast delivery, thanks</li>
            <li> I am a repeat buyer of these blades.They last a lot longer than the other major brand I used to use.And at a better price !</li>
            <li> Love the price and the one time coupon I got.</li>
            <li> After seven weeks I&#x27;m still getting a smooth and close shave.</li>
            <li> In my opinion these have to be the best disposable razor on the market. And my lady also agrees because she keeps using it for her shaving needs so I was happy to buy one for her.</li>
            <li> Good price for the amount I got.</li>
            <li> The item was perfect.  Delivery was exactly as quoted.</li>
            <li> Best razors I have used.</li>
            <li> Great value! I&#x27;m still using these after years!&lt;br /&gt;It last a long time and much cheaper than other brands, also much cheaper than buying at a store.&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty sensitive skin. These are one of the only few razors that doesn&#x27;t give me rashes or pimples</li>
            <li> I used use the old shick razor and blades. I stopped and switched to gillette. When this came on the market I wanted to try it. BIG mistake. The handle is a weird shape and not balanced. The blades are not that sharp, do not rinse and more is not bettter. Suffice to say I went back to gillette. The handle is comfortable and balanced. The blades are sharp and rinse well and easily.</li>
            <li> These weren&#x27;t very sharp and blades were poorly aligned.</li>
            <li> These are, hands down, the best blades I ever used.. The price was very good when compared to local stores.</li>
            <li> My husband loves these, and this was a great price. He has fairly sensitive skin, and he said they really helped get a close shave with less irritation.</li>
            <li> Worked as good as the more expensive ones .</li>
            <li> Great product.  Blades are the best, hubby loves these.</li>
            <li> Been using this blade for years and I get several shaves before needing a blade change.</li>
            <li> I always get my razor blade refills from Amazon because they are cheaper for the same product. These razors blades work great. I was skeptical of needing more than 3 blades before I tried it, and now I only use these.</li>
            <li> A little scared buying these outside of a store I can trust. Will definitely buy again, without hesitation</li>
            <li> Would be a 5 but clogs up/harder to clean out than others with lesser blades</li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard and I find that the Schick Hydro 5 blade system works much better than the Gillette system.  I have both and the Schick seems to cut easier, have less drag, and leave my face less red.</li>
            <li> Love these razors and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  These don&#x27;t hurt like some other multiblades do.</li>
            <li> love it my husband uses it a lot</li>
            <li> These razor blades work pretty good. They&#x27;re expensive, but they last a long time and I think they shave better than the cheap disposable ones.</li>
            <li> great for perfect sheaving.....it feels like a loving girl touching your face....smooth.....uh.uh</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave. Less cost than Gillette blades.  Love these.</li>
            <li> Best blade I have ever used. Until now I always used the other brand. I had this in my closet, had never used it and thought I would give it a try. Bottom line is it does a better job than any other blade I have ever used. I am really sorry it took me all this time to give it a try. The blade looks large at first; get over it. It is great. Best new product I have tried in years. Go for it!</li>
            <li> So far I have been satisfied with quality of the blades. The first one lasted for about a month. That would depend on your beard :-)...</li>
            <li> My husband likes these</li>
            <li> nice blades shave well at a reasonable price compare to store prices,also the service was fast,i would buy this product again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the blades, and the Schick Hydro has the CLOSEST SHAVE and LASTS THE LONGEST. I can use one blade for at least 2 weeks of shaves, as compared to most other blades which will give me 1 to 1.5 weeks at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hydro blade has a dispensing latch on the back that makes it easier to clean, and may be the reason why this lasts so much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No nicks or bleeding with this blade on my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette Sensor forever and thought a 5 blade with s battery was a bunch of hooey.  This Schick is by far thr best shave ever. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is the only razor that my husband use, and he love them...</li>
