            <li>This product is awesome!</li>
            <li>But if you do but this, it does work perfectly.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome!</li>
            <li>Great product an</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>This works great on your face but also on neck, chest, hands and arms covering scars, veins and spots.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better that mineral powders and gives a flawless look.  </li>
            <li>I used all the sample products that were provided (I&#x27;m in the warm tone range), and the colors work great with my skin.  </li>
            <li>Not even good plastic.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li>and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>Today, my skin is peeling and flaking off, which is a slightly more attractive look than the horror hag make up job that Luminesse was able to deliver.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It does its main job on my face by providing flawless makeup covering substantial scars from Mohs surgeries.  </li>
            <li>I love the ease and quickness of application.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS</li>
            <li>I started using that stylus for airbrushing my nails, and it works better that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommend, I&#x27;m in love with my airbrush</li>
            <li>The Heiress System is very easy to use and the makeup is so comfortable and long-wearing.  </li>
            <li>I find this just as easy as applying my mineral foundation, but the coverage is much better and the results are better looking.</li>
            <li>The first pump I received did not work, and it looked and felt VERY cheap, and is made in China!</li>
            <li>more light tan than</li>
            <li>Easy to clean as well!</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you clean after each use</li>
            <li>It had the ability to highlight fine lines that I did not know were there.</li>
            <li>I did this experiment with two shade sets, medium and light.</li>
            <li>One would have been a good match for Wednesday Adams, and the other would be a nice fit for Malibu Barbie, or just about any person who lived with no sunscreen on a deserted island with no shade for about 35 years.</li>
            <li>When it arrived I was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>Just remember to clean out the nozzle after each application</li>
            <li>The airbrush itself was ok, all made of stainless steel.</li>
            <li>The first day she did her own and 4 of her friends make up even though she only had one tone she was able to make it work for all of them.</li>
            <li>stylus kept getting clogged on the first use, and the makeup itself accentuated my pores and fine lines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and fast before leaving</li>
            <li>I love a natural look and this system delivers!  </li>
            <li>That is where the fun</li>
            <li>I picked the color that closely resembled my skin tone, and got right to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>kit!&lt;br /&gt;Thank very much</li>
            <li>tried the tanning first, which came with a separate stylus.</li>
            <li>I was able to blend the two and come up with something that looked close enough to my skin tone.</li>
            <li>It works great and she will keep using this for a long long time.  </li>
            <li>I have used and loved Dinair in the past, and after this nightmare experience bought myself a Dinair system.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, I was excited to try the actual makeup products.</li>
            <li>My wife loves it she is able to do her makeup much faster and use less product.</li>
            <li>I bought a Luminess Air airbrush system for my girlfriend, and there are SO many hidden costs and fees.</li>
            <li>Love the overall look and coverage, wish it would last longer than an hour before having to take off and start again</li>
            <li>I read a little more and the manual said to mix the two foundation colors in order to achieve the desired color.</li>
            <li>I got compliments almost immediately from friends (without telling them I was trying new makeup).  </li>
            <li>Will never use my old makeup again!</li>
            <li>Both were too dark, and I am not even that light..</li>
            <li>Luminesse make up clearly has something off about it.</li>
            <li>They are scam artists and lied about their complete 30 day trial and refund.</li>
            <li>it developed blotchy anyway, despite all the precision and care that was taken.&lt;br /&gt;Instead,</li>
            <li>Simply wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful makeup and everything very well packed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could not remove that horror hag make up fast enough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely an investment, but worth it if you wear makeup even just a few times a year.  </li>

            <li> you just have to spray it slowly and run over your face evenly to ge tthe right results.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin, and have used other brands of airbrush foundation plenty of times without having the napalm-like burning results.</li>
            <li> Next, I had strange charges on my account that I did not receive a notification about.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BECOME A VICTIM OF SCAM</li>
            <li> It was actually less in price than the Luminesse, and Dinair has an ACTUAL guarantee.</li>
            <li> It looked so thick and heavy and felt very greasy.</li>
            <li> Make up flakes after awhile and streakers when wet.  </li>
            <li> continued anyway, just curious to see the end result.</li>
            <li> The tubing provided was really flimsy thin plastic as well.</li>
            <li> It is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I watched the videos, I had it down.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as quick as their promos show.</li>
            <li> It covers as much or as little as you want.  </li>
            <li> Looking at it now, though, the other less expensive sets are basically set up the same way</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about buying an airbrush system, but wanted to have a home system after getting airbrush makeup professionally done for an event.  </li>
            <li> I went ahead and bought this pricier one because I didn&#x27;t want to waste money on one that wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I found that the spray was uneven, and some spots were darker than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this system everyday, she loves the feel and coverage of this makeup.  </li>
            <li> The notification that you have incurred this monthly fee is hidden and hard to spot in the order process.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful at first</li>
            <li> By burning I mean my face felt like it had been sandblasted and then dipped in acid.</li>
            <li> When I got it all off, my skin continued to burn horribly for the next 5 hours.</li>
            <li> Luminess Air will stick you with a monthly recurring charge (their monthly club membership) that is difficult to stop and impossible to reverse charges (even on credit cards).</li>
            <li> the product hit my skin, it turned orange and made me look extremely awkward.</li>
            <li> I called the company to cancel the membership, and it was very difficult to do.</li>
            <li> bad....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have bad skin like that, but it looked like I</li>
            <li> This is where the bad part comes in....</li>
            <li> It burned so bad I was in tears as I tried to wash that stuff off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use makeup often and hate liquid foundation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It looks terrible on.</li>

            <li> This product is awesome! LOVE THIS! Will never use my old makeup again!</li>

The notification that you have incurred this monthly fee is hidden and hard to spot in the order process. DO NOT PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it she is able to do her makeup much faster and use less product. The first day she did her own and 4 of her friends make up even though she only had one tone she was able to make it work for all of them.</li>
            <li> I love a natural look and this system delivers!  It&#x27;s even better that mineral powders and gives a flawless look.  Easy to clean as well!</li>
            <li> Bought the luminess air system and returned it after only 4 days of use because I was dissatisfied with service and was not refunded the total amount I paid for. They are scam artists and lied about their complete 30 day trial and refund. Beware if you buy from Luminess Air.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about buying an airbrush system, but wanted to have a home system after getting airbrush makeup professionally done for an event.  After a lot of research, and comparing costs and features, I decided to try this one.  It&#x27;s definitely an investment, but worth it if you wear makeup even just a few times a year.  The Heiress System is very easy to use and the makeup is so comfortable and long-wearing.  I got compliments almost immediately from friends (without telling them I was trying new makeup).  I used all the sample products that were provided (I&#x27;m in the warm tone range), and the colors work great with my skin.  I even applied the bronzer to my eyelids for a glowing look and it brightened up my look.  I don&#x27;t use makeup often and hate liquid foundation.  I find this just as easy as applying my mineral foundation, but the coverage is much better and the results are better looking. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and bought this pricier one because I didn&#x27;t want to waste money on one that wouldn&#x27;t work. Looking at it now, though, the other less expensive sets are basically set up the same way and I probably should have saved some money and bought one of those. But if you do but this, it does work perfectly. Just remember to clean out the nozzle after each application</li>
            <li> I love the ease and quickness of application.  It covers as much or as little as you want.  Great product an I am glad I purchased it.  It doesn&#x27;t get any easier than this to apply makeup.  I am done in 5 minutes and it lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t transfer to clothing.</li>
            <li> The instrument did not function and splashed the male up everywhere.</li>
            <li> It will take some time to get aquainted with this method. Not nearly as quick as their promos show.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase from Luminess Air! They are scam artists! I bought a Luminess Air airbrush system for my girlfriend, and there are SO many hidden costs and fees. The first pump I received did not work, and it looked and felt VERY cheap, and is made in China! It is not worth the money. Next, I had strange charges on my account that I did not receive a notification about. It turns out that when you buy a product, you are automatically signing up for a $45.06 a month membership! I called the company to cancel the membership, and it was very difficult to do. DO NOT BECOME A VICTIM OF SCAM LIKE I DID!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! you just have to spray it slowly and run over your face evenly to ge tthe right results. i will never use regular make up again!! LOVE THIS</li>
            <li> This product was nothing short of a let down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a bundle with the tanning system from their website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the tanning first, which came with a separate stylus. I sprayed my legs and asked my fiance to spray the rest of me to ensure an even spray.&lt;br /&gt;While it was on.... it stunk...... bad.... putrid!&lt;br /&gt;And it developed blotchy anyway, despite all the precision and care that was taken.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I started using that stylus for airbrushing my nails, and it works better that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I was excited to try the actual makeup products. I watched the videos, I had it down. I picked the color that closely resembled my skin tone, and got right to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the product hit my skin, it turned orange and made me look extremely awkward. So I tried another lighter shade and it did the same. So I mixed two of the closest shades together and it still turned me orange. I did this experiment with two shade sets, medium and light. Both were too dark, and I am not even that light.. more light tan than anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continued anyway, just curious to see the end result. I found that the spray was uneven, and some spots were darker than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stylus kept getting clogged on the first use, and the makeup itself accentuated my pores and fine lines. I don&#x27;t even have bad skin like that, but it looked like I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been sitting in storage ever since, and I vow to never open the box again because it&#x27;s not going to end well, lol</li>
            <li> This works great on your face but also on neck, chest, hands and arms covering scars, veins and spots.  Lasts for days thru showers, dishwashing, hand washing, lotions, etc.  I am in my seventies and this has been heaven sent for me.  It does its main job on my face by providing flawless makeup covering substantial scars from Mohs surgeries.  It&#x27;s fast and easy.  I was doubtful at first but now I am a believer.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 6 months and it&#x27;s great. Easy to use and fast before leaving and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> Simply wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful makeup and everything very well packed.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend, I&#x27;m in love with my airbrush kit!&lt;br /&gt;Thank very much</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this system everyday, she loves the feel and coverage of this makeup.  It works great and she will keep using this for a long long time.  Just make sure that you clean after each use so it does not clog up.</li>
            <li> I got one of these as a deal on some deal site. When it arrived I was excited to try it out. That is where the fun ended.&lt;br /&gt;The machine is made out of plastic. Not even good plastic. The airbrush itself was ok, all made of stainless steel. The tubing provided was really flimsy thin plastic as well. I cannot see how this would hold up any longer than 2 weeks before cracking and breaking.&lt;br /&gt;The actual make up colors are like no colors any living human being would actually have for skin tones. I had chosen the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; shades, and two colors arrived. One would have been a good match for Wednesday Adams, and the other would be a nice fit for Malibu Barbie, or just about any person who lived with no sunscreen on a deserted island with no shade for about 35 years. That is quite a range! I read a little more and the manual said to mix the two foundation colors in order to achieve the desired color. I was able to blend the two and come up with something that looked close enough to my skin tone. Applying the make up was simple enough, you point and spray. This is where the bad part comes in....&lt;br /&gt;It looks terrible on. I might as well have used Spackle. It looked so thick and heavy and felt very greasy. It had the ability to highlight fine lines that I did not know were there. I looked like a horror movie hag.&lt;br /&gt;Then, the burning started. By burning I mean my face felt like it had been sandblasted and then dipped in acid. It burned so bad I was in tears as I tried to wash that stuff off. I could not remove that horror hag make up fast enough. When I got it all off, my skin continued to burn horribly for the next 5 hours. Today, my skin is peeling and flaking off, which is a slightly more attractive look than the horror hag make up job that Luminesse was able to deliver.&lt;br /&gt;The Luminesse make up clearly has something off about it. I do not have sensitive skin, and have used other brands of airbrush foundation plenty of times without having the napalm-like burning results. I have used and loved Dinair in the past, and after this nightmare experience bought myself a Dinair system. It was actually less in price than the Luminesse, and Dinair has an ACTUAL guarantee. If you want to try airbrushing your make up, DO NOT use a Luminesse.</li>
            <li> Just as stated Thank you</li>
