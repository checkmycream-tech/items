            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no fully satisfied with this hair dryer</li>
            <li>Love this hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Pretty good dryer.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer easily glides through the hair.</li>
            <li>A good buy for those with natural hair!</li>
            <li>The only not so great thing is</li>
            <li>I had the original one for 8 years</li>
            <li>i originally bought the original version without the Argan Oil strip over a year ago, I gave it to my mom and decided to try this one.</li>
            <li>Argon oil strip leaves both our hair well-conditioned, shiny and full of body.</li>
            <li>Its not as powerful as the original</li>
            <li>Smooths hair, dries quickly and is lightweight.</li>
            <li>Of course, detangle first though!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It was perfect for my thick natural hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty light weight and smaller than most, and it gets pretty hot on a high setting.</li>
            <li>If you have kinky, or really curly hair that needs to be prepped before being straightened, you NEED this blow dryer!</li>
            <li>I would recommend coating your hair with a heat protectant before blow drying cause this mugs gets hot.</li>
            <li>They made it to be better than it actually is!</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have thick natural hair and this blow dryer by far is the best dryer we have ever used!!</li>
            <li>though to be honest it takes practice as my hair is not quite shoulder-length and perhaps a little.</li>
            <li>I ended up just leaving it off because I don&#x27;t think it does much anyway.  </li>
            <li>An absolute dream.</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t get your hair bone straight.</li>
            <li>Love this dryer, even though my hair is super curly &amp; thick</li>
            <li>The previous attachment look like it was better.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>As a natural hair girl it takes forever to dry my hair and this hair dryer cuts that time in half, love it!</li>
            <li>Gets the job done and healthy for your hair less tension pull of a regular blow dryer.</li>
            <li>If you prefer to do your blowouts the old school way (with a brush), then the comb attachment comes off and you can attach a concentrator or just use it as is.</li>
            <li>I have about type 4 natural hair.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and my daughter is transitioning.</li>
            <li>It pulls the hair straight while blowing it out at the same time.</li>
            <li>I was able to blow dry my hair with little frizz.</li>
            <li>The dryer allow you to adjust the thickness of the comb in 4 settings (fine to thick).</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll never own another blow dryer again. I get my hair dried and straight in a fraction of the time that it used to take. The little comb attachment has a replaceable argan oil strip that nourishes your hair as you comb through, and the configuration of the teeth makes straightening a breeze. If you prefer to do your blowouts the old school way (with a brush), then the comb attachment comes off and you can attach a concentrator or just use it as is. If you have kinky, or really curly hair that needs to be prepped before being straightened, you NEED this blow dryer!</li>
            <li> Great dryer though to be honest it takes practice as my hair is not quite shoulder-length and perhaps a little. Love it though</li>
            <li> Not sure if this saves me any time and take a bit of practice</li>
            <li> Love it. I have about type 4 natural hair. This blow dryer easily glides through the hair. Of course, detangle first though! It&#x27;s pretty light weight and smaller than most, and it gets pretty hot on a high setting. It gave an awesome blow out! I would recommend coating your hair with a heat protectant before blow drying cause this mugs gets hot. A good buy for those with natural hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hairdryer for years.  The only not so great thing is the Argan Oil felt thing doesn&#x27;t stay on the dryer.  I ended up just leaving it off because I don&#x27;t think it does much anyway.  I do like Argan oil so I use it in a spray.</li>
            <li> I had the original one for 8 years and i loved it! Its not as powerful as the original and I&#x27;m not sure I like the aragon oil strip(makes hair a little sticky) but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer. I have thick, shoulder length (when stretched) 4c natural hair. The tension this dryer gives makes it simple to have a sleeker look when blowdrying, making it easier to flat iron. This dryer has given me the shiniest blowout I&#x27;ve had in years!!</li>
            <li> The argan stick keeps falling</li>
            <li> An absolute dream. Smooths hair, dries quickly and is lightweight.</li>
            <li> Love it! Gets the job done and healthy for your hair less tension pull of a regular blow dryer.</li>
            <li> i originally bought the original version without the Argan Oil strip over a year ago, I gave it to my mom and decided to try this one. Works even better!!! My hair was smoother then the previous one. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Best dryer I have ever used</li>
            <li> Pretty good dryer. Only issue is my hair got caught a couple of times. Play with the tension setting. Even with my kinky curly hair, I needed to lowest tension setting.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer, even though my hair is super curly &amp; thick it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Product was packaged great and works wonderful.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this. Plus the strips are a plus</li>
            <li> AWESOME! This blow dryer saved my life.</li>
            <li> I was admittedly skeptical about this product. I have very thick, tightly coiled afro textured hair (aka &amp;#34;natural hair&amp;#34;, and I wanted to cut back the time of blow drying my hair when I would blow it out. This dryer worked great. After showering and detanglong my hair, it took be a total of 20 minutes to finished blowing out my hair! It used to take as long has 1.5 hours. The dryer allow you to adjust the thickness of the comb in 4 settings (fine to thick). I would highly recommend this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I have used this dryer twice since purchasing. I&#x27;m a little clumsy with this dryer. I think if used it more often it wouldn&#x27;t feel as awkward to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no fully satisfied with this hair dryer The previous attachment look like it was better. The Argon strip is just in the way and it didn&#x27;t help improve anything.</li>
            <li> As a natural hair girl it takes forever to dry my hair and this hair dryer cuts that time in half, love it!</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever used. I have natural hair and my daughter is transitioning. Argon oil strip leaves both our hair well-conditioned, shiny and full of body.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have thick natural hair and this blow dryer by far is the best dryer we have ever used!! It pulls the hair straight while blowing it out at the same time. I would encourage all natural hair woman to purchase this blow dryer by ConAir excellent buy!!. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> As described. Cuts drying and styling time.</li>
            <li> Not for me.  Had to return this.</li>
            <li> They made it to be better than it actually is!</li>
            <li> returned this item..  i guess this is for those with really thick stubborn hair..</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer! Great buy!</li>
            <li> Know if you are African American and have kinky coarse hair like I do this won&#x27;t get your hair bone straight. My hair looked like it was blow dried only and needed to flat iron. The plates to help straighten pulled my hair out no matter what level of tension I put it on. If your hair is on the finer, thinner, less dense side it should work for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is working properly the combs keep tugging my hair and breaking it off.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer blew my mind! It was perfect for my thick natural hair! I was able to blow dry my hair with little frizz. I even recommended this blow dryer to family members!</li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer. Straightens my hair in a matter of minutes. I still finish with a flat iron.</li>
