            <li>As much as I love this product, I believe this site is doing us a grave disservice by (1) doubling the price and (2) imposing a separate shipping charge for each bottle ordered.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than 25 years.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over twenty years, still love it.</li>

            <li>Hope it continues to be available</li>
            <li>AND AMAZON HAS DROPPED IT FROM LIST OF AVAILABLE AFTERSHAVES -</li>

            <li>and I wish another manufacturer would buy formula and make it available again.</li>
            <li>This is awesome stuff but is getting hard to find.  </li>
            <li>Quick turnaround.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s old time favorite aftershave cream is Saxon.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this aftershave takes the red away and feels great.  </li>
            <li>If it continuos to do so then it would be the time to look for a better product for the same price.</li>
            <li>The ad didn&#x27;t specify how many but did state, as above, boxes.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It was not until recently that I discovered that I was able to purchase it online at a lesser price than I was paying for it at a retail store</li>
            <li>It seems more and more difficult</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s both professional and intimate.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, but much more expensive than when previously purchased.  </li>
            <li>Our first purchase was from a local pharmacy,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Excellent product..a little on the expensive side, but a lot of things are that way nowdays.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this aftershave for many years, its hard to find,  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for at least 20 years, maybe more.  </li>
            <li>Even as recently as 2-3 years ago, I was buying the product for about $11 per bottle directly from leepharmaceuticals.com.  </li>

            <li> The price has quadrupled but I will continue to buy as long as I can get it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff a long time.</li>
            <li> I started using Saxon in the late 80&#x27;s, back when it cost $5-$6 per bottle and was sold at Walgreens.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE USED SAXON FOR 20 YEARS, SUDDENLY IT IS NOT AVAILABLE IN STORES</li>
            <li> I usually bought a dozen bottles at a time to minimize the shipping cost.  </li>

            <li> I tell them a hard on, but I didn&#x27;t think they could smell it.</li>
            <li> I gave it only 4 stars simply because the cost is outrageous.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this for 20 years but difficult to find, it appears Lee Pharma stopped manufacturing this product</li>
            <li> It is way too expensive, however.</li>
            <li> But its way to expensive now.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand why it is so expensive!</li>

            <li> Excellent product..a little on the expensive side, but a lot of things are that way nowdays.  I will use it as long as it exists.</li>
            <li> did not get it.  but I do like it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I definitely like using Saxon wood spice</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with my purchase.  It was not until recently that I discovered that I was able to purchase it online at a lesser price than I was paying for it at a retail store</li>
            <li> used this product for years. Hope it continues to be available</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED SAXON FOR 20 YEARS, SUDDENLY IT IS NOT AVAILABLE IN STORES AND AMAZON HAS DROPPED IT FROM LIST OF AVAILABLE AFTERSHAVES - WILL BUY IF MADE AVAILABLE</li>
            <li> I have to reluctantly agree with Berj Hogtanyan&#x27;s review.  I started using Saxon in the late 80&#x27;s, back when it cost $5-$6 per bottle and was sold at Walgreens.  Even as recently as 2-3 years ago, I was buying the product for about $11 per bottle directly from leepharmaceuticals.com.  I usually bought a dozen bottles at a time to minimize the shipping cost.  As much as I love this product, I believe this site is doing us a grave disservice by (1) doubling the price and (2) imposing a separate shipping charge for each bottle ordered.  Aftra by Mennen or Walgreen&#x27;s Conditioning After Shave doesn&#x27;t smell quite as nice, but I know I can still get it at a fraction of the current cost for Saxon and get the same skin benefits.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 25 years. For the price this product has been very suitable for me, but for the recent years the price jumped up pretty good. If it continuos to do so then it would be the time to look for a better product for the same price.</li>
            <li> I think the fragrance has changed. Not sure I like it. If it did wish they would have mentioned it!!</li>
            <li> Good stuff, but much more expensive than when previously purchased.  Nex time I shall buy the Musk.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Same as the one I used to Purchase in the 80&#x27;s for $3.99. Quick turnaround.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over twenty years, still love it.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for 30 years. It is excellent. The aroma is good and the lotion quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite aftershave.  I gave it only 4 stars simply because the cost is outrageous.  Don&#x27;t understand why it is so expensive!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for 20 years but difficult to find, it appears Lee Pharma stopped manufacturing this product and I wish another manufacturer would buy formula and make it available again. Great fragrance and skin conditioner. NO Razor burn.</li>
            <li> The ad didn&#x27;t specify how many but did state, as above, boxes. Thought that there would be more than one box. Please clarify in the future. Thanks. Was a speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> This is awesome stuff but is getting hard to find.  I have been using it for at least 20 years, maybe more.  The price has quadrupled but I will continue to buy as long as I can get it.  Smells great, lasts all day, and the lotion disappears into your skin.  it is not a bit greasy and I love the lotion.  If I had to use a watery liquid I would use nothing at all.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s old time favorite aftershave cream is Saxon. I bought this for him for his birthday a couple of years ago and he was thrilled to have it once again. Likewise, so was I. As the wife and the one who smells him the most, I love the scent!  It&#x27;s both professional and intimate. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> My son and I have used Saxon Wood Spice Aftershave Cream for almost 20 years.  Our first purchase was from a local pharmacy,&lt;br /&gt;and after that supply stopped, we have ordered by phone and amazon web page for years.  It seems more and more difficult&lt;br /&gt;to find a supplier, and we may have to change to another product is it is going to be this difficult.&lt;br /&gt;Jim Duffey</li>
            <li> So happy to be able to find the Saxon after shave I&#x27;ve been using for many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff a long time. Love it but hard to find</li>
            <li> Look , the stuff is good, smells great and no razor burn. It is way too expensive, however. It is hard to find so I guess I have to pay through the nose.</li>
            <li> My husband has used it before and I liked it.  Terrific aroma.  Would recommend it to friends.  Soothing to his FACE.</li>
            <li> Always love this aftershave, no matter what the cost. I have sensitive skin and this aftershave takes the red away and feels great.  My wife has always loved the fragrance.  I&#x27;ve been using this aftershave for many years, its hard to find,  I&#x27;m glad Amazon  has it.</li>
            <li> I started using Saxon 30 years ago for the soothing effect it provided after shaving. I have continued using it for the scent - this is a great product!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff. Have used it for 30 years or more. But its way to expensive now. Wont be buying any more!</li>
            <li> Love the stuff.  When people ask me what I have on.  I tell them a hard on, but I didn&#x27;t think they could smell it.</li>
