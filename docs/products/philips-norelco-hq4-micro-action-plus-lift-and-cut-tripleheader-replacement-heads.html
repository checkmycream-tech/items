    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I was very happy to get the replacement parts for my Norelco.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads were in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>These blades are very good</li>
            <li>Almost as good as a razor!</li>
            <li>The shaver heads work great.</li>
            <li>Good service.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>But all-in-all a good choice.</li>
            <li>(Make SURE you order the correct replacement model!)  </li>
            <li>Oh well, they should be good for a year or more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the mailman wondered if anything was in the box.    </li>
            <li>In no time all was well and we were completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Mostly the fact that they operate on a battery.</li>
            <li>Too many times have I seen the wife&#x27;s rechargeable shaving hardware disappoint when needed.</li>
            <li>It arrived promptly and he seems happy with it, even though he is in the hospital, not on the cruise where he PLANNED to use the new razor!</li>
            <li>very well received in excellent condition thanks!</li>
            <li>The razor works great with the new blades.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always good to be able to get parts for thirty-plus year old equipment.</li>
            <li>Installation was easy - everything worked fine.  </li>
            <li>It was a good option as opposed to buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>This Co. had the replacement blades that will keep my face smooth and happy for the next 2 years.</li>
            <li>I enjoy my Norelco shaver, and I can appreciate the precision</li>

            <li>&lt;br /&gt;needed to produce such a good product,</li>
            <li>Cleaning the blades after each use is a must for good shaving results, and also for making the blades last longer.</li>

            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>Replacing the heads made sense to me - why toss out a perfectly good shaver if the unit can be made to work as if new with the purchase of new heads?</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are three complaints: 1) choosing the right replacement should be easier, 2)</li>
            <li>They are easy to install and made the razor shave like new.</li>
            <li>If a major component goes, I&#x27;ll have to junk it because it will cost more and take longer to fix than to buy a newer model.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads essentially give you a new razor if the razor&#x27;s battery and mechanics are in good condition</li>

            <li>Thank you very much, Steven G Shipley</li>
            <li>Just buy a new set of Norelco replacement heads for it, clean the razor a bit, install the new heads, and I have a satisfying new razor shaving experience any time I want (...providing that Mother Nature doesn&#x27;t find a way to drop another tree on a nearby power line).</li>
            <li>this product and sell them at a reasonable price, and cash in!</li>
            <li>That being said, while I shave daily with the electric, I still do blade shave when I want 100% of the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow gone and a super smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Quick, cheap and simple.</li>
            <li>I always use a one inch soft cheep paint brush to clean out the cut beard pieces from the blades,  and then spraying the blades with Norelco Shaving head cleaning spray.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, these heads are almost as good as the originals, and, though expensive, still make it worth keeping the old shaver.</li>
            <li>It really works well for what I need .</li>
            <li>My Philips Norelco shaver replacement heads arrived promptly and work very well.  </li>
            <li>and I am ready to go again.</li>
            <li>But lack of consumables shouldn&#x27;t mean the end of a good device.</li>
            <li>I got my Norelco shaver used, and this is the first time I&#x27;ve used new heads.</li>
            <li>The hard part was making sure I was ordering the right part (thanks to the Norelco website</li>
            <li>My old Norelco has worked just fine since I got it as a Christmas present in 1982.</li>
            <li>I have an older Norelco Rototrack razor that I won&#x27;t give up to these \\&quot;plastic\\&quot; versions they now offer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s from all those years of teasing back in elementary.</li>
            <li>But what you pay for replacement cutters could take you almost half-way to a new razor.</li>
            <li>But the alternative is to buy a new shaver, at 3X the cost of the heads.  </li>
            <li>I splurged on a new set of Norelco HQ4 replacement heads.</li>
            <li>However, it saves some money and the new blades saved face.</li>
            <li>They made the shaver cut like new</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think that getting new heads will do that with any shaver</li>
            <li>so I searched for a new head for it and Bingo --</li>
            <li>My Norelco is very old but keeps working.</li>
            <li>there was a good deal of wasted packaging, and 3) the cost of the heads was over half the cost of an new razor.</li>
            <li>So, I just cleaned up the old set, &amp; am using them.  </li>
            <li>The replacement heads have really made a difference in daily use of this razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a long time and the old blades were really worn.</li>
            <li>If these heads last as long as the first set they will outlast me.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;still not as close as a razor, but not expected to be.</li>
            <li>I have thought about purchasing a new razor but as long as I can get replacements</li>
            <li>They slipped into my old razor easily and now my old razor is cutting the way it did when it was new.  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s to the new ones lasting just as long!</li>

            <li> Shaves off stubble as expected.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to get the replacement parts for my Norelco. It really works well for what I need . Thank you very much, Steven G Shipley</li>
            <li> What I needed when I need them at a great price; these are replaceable very simply and make your razor literally, like new!!</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t bought replacement heads in quite some time. They are easy to install and made the razor shave like new. The only downside is the cost of the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> When I got these replacements, I took out my old blades, &amp; found out they were encrusted &amp; jammed with hair.  I thought that the under faucet rinse feature was taking care of that.  So, I just cleaned up the old set, &amp; am using them.  I now have a spare set.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads have really made a difference in daily use of this razor.  I&#x27;ve had it for a long time and the old blades were really worn. It was a good option as opposed to buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> My Philips Norelco shaver replacement heads arrived promptly and work very well.  I have now had a closer shave than I&#x27;ve had for years.  I recommend them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always good to be able to get parts for thirty-plus year old equipment. My old Norelco has worked just fine since I got it as a Christmas present in 1982. But parts are always a concern, especially consumables. If a major component goes, I&#x27;ll have to junk it because it will cost more and take longer to fix than to buy a newer model. But lack of consumables shouldn&#x27;t mean the end of a good device. Fortunately, these heads are almost as good as the originals, and, though expensive, still make it worth keeping the old shaver.</li>
            <li> The heads arrived ahead of schedule and were well packaged.They slipped into my old razor easily and now my old razor is cutting the way it did when it was new.  If these heads last as long as the first set they will outlast me.  Good service. Good product.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads were in excellent condition. However, they were pretty expensive...almost half the cost of a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I enjoy my Norelco shaver, and I can appreciate the precision &lt;br /&gt;needed to produce such a good product, but I have to say, &lt;br /&gt;that I feel that these blades/heads should last a heck of a lot longer, &lt;br /&gt;OR they should be a LOT cheaper! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Sorry to say, but I hope a company will start making a generic version &lt;br /&gt;of this product and sell them at a reasonable price, and cash in!</li>
            <li> The replacement heads essentially give you a new razor if the razor&#x27;s battery and mechanics are in good condition (Make SURE you order the correct replacement model!)  But what you pay for replacement cutters could take you almost half-way to a new razor.</li>
            <li> I ordered the razor at my husband&#x27;s request.  It arrived promptly and he seems happy with it, even though he is in the hospital, not on the cruise where he PLANNED to use the new razor!</li>
            <li> These blades replaced my 9-year-old blades. Here&#x27;s to the new ones lasting just as long! As long as the battery still charges, why replace the razor when the blades can be swapped? I&#x27;m all about having a small carbon footprint. It&#x27;s from all those years of teasing back in elementary. I still shudder thinking about it. Hairy Bigfeet.</li>
            <li> very well received in excellent condition thanks!</li>
            <li> The pack of Norelco replacement heads arrived quickly.  The product package is about 3\\&quot;x5\\&quot;x.2\\&quot;.   It was shipped in an Amazon book box approximately 12\\&quot; x10\\&quot;x4\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m sure the mailman wondered if anything was in the box.    About the product, they sure are expensive.  But the alternative is to buy a new shaver, at 3X the cost of the heads.  Oh well, they should be good for a year or more.</li>
            <li> I got my Norelco shaver used, and this is the first time I&#x27;ve used new heads. Almost as good as a razor!</li>
            <li> Anyone like me who doesn&#x27;t want to replace my whole shaver every time my heads ware out will appreciate a good quality Philips Norelco HQ4 Micro Action Plus Lift-and-Cut Tripleheader Replacement HeadsPhilips Norelco HQ4 Micro Action Plus Lift-and-Cut Tripleheader Replacement Heads.  These blades are very good quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time when to replace the blades is when you get five o&#x27;clock shadow after shaving,  even after doing a thorough cleaning and lubricating of the blades.  I always use a one inch soft cheep paint brush to clean out the cut beard pieces from the blades,  and then spraying the blades with Norelco Shaving head cleaning spray.  Cleaning the blades after each use is a must for good shaving results, and also for making the blades last longer. The last blades lasted me for about two years.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  In original packaging.  The shaver heads work great. The only downside is that they don&#x27;t last long.  They cost about $30 and only last about 12 to 18 months.</li>
            <li> Installation was easy - everything worked fine.  &#x27;still not as close as a razor, but not expected to be.</li>
            <li> I hate to give anything the deep six if it is still working. Therefore, instead of dumping my trusty 4825XL I splurged on a new set of Norelco HQ4 replacement heads. In less than five minutes, I was in business. I was quite surprise to find that the old heads which even though recommended to change every year was so dull after eight years. We rather got dull together. Now I know and I will be a little sharper with their replacement next time. This was an experiment as a completely new razor is not much more. However, it saves some money and the new blades saved face.</li>
            <li> I have an older Norelco Rototrack razor that I won&#x27;t give up to these \\&quot;plastic\\&quot; versions they now offer. This Co. had the replacement blades that will keep my face smooth and happy for the next 2 years.</li>
            <li> After using my shaver for 3 years I finally broke down and ordered a new set of heads.  They made the shaver cut like new and I would recommend them.  That being said, while I shave daily with the electric, I still do blade shave when I want 100% of the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow gone and a super smooth shave.  Don&#x27;t think that getting new heads will do that with any shaver (that I know of).</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s Norelco razor just didn&#x27;t work as it should so I searched for a new head for it and Bingo -- Amazon.com had just what we needed. In no time all was well and we were completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> son de buena calidad y me han salido muy buenas, hasta ahora no he tenido ningun tipo de problemas con este producto</li>
            <li> Did not order this product recently.</li>
            <li> It is not suitable for my shaver I want to return the items</li>
            <li> Quick, cheap and simple. The hard part was making sure I was ordering the right part (thanks to the Norelco website it wasn&#x27;t too difficult). Replacing the heads made sense to me - why toss out a perfectly good shaver if the unit can be made to work as if new with the purchase of new heads? The razor works great with the new blades. They were simple to install. Note: it took longer to open the industrial strength packaging than it did to install the heads. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There are three complaints: 1) choosing the right replacement should be easier, 2) there was a good deal of wasted packaging, and 3) the cost of the heads was over half the cost of an new razor. But all-in-all a good choice.</li>
            <li> My Norelco is very old but keeps working. I just keep replacing the heads and I am ready to go again. I have thought about purchasing a new razor but as long as I can get replacements I think I will keep doing just that.</li>
            <li> What do I have against rechargeable razors? Mostly the fact that they operate on a battery. A battery that may go belly up at an inconvenient time - either from running out of stored electrons or simply can&#x27;t hold enough electricity any more to finish a shaving session. Too many times have I seen the wife&#x27;s rechargeable shaving hardware disappoint when needed. Which is why I want to hang on as long as I can to my dependable corded rotary razor. Just buy a new set of Norelco replacement heads for it, clean the razor a bit, install the new heads, and I have a satisfying new razor shaving experience any time I want (...providing that Mother Nature doesn&#x27;t find a way to drop another tree on a nearby power line).</li>
