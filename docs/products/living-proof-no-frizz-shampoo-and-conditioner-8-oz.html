            <li> and I allows me to flat iron it less</li>

            <li> My hair is a little coarse, definitely color treated then highlighted, thick hair with a slight wave and plenty of frizz.  </li>
            <li> This took down the frizziness of my hair a lot.</li>
            <li> I wash and condition every other day and used Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Round Trip to define the curl (and I don&#x27;t touch it).</li>
            <li> The less I shampoo, the brighter my hair color is.  </li>
            <li> I also find that my hair stays less oily.  </li>
            <li> I will buy this product again as it does what it is suppose to do.... leave my hair a lot less frizzy and manageable.</li>
            <li> something previously unheard of for me!  </li>
            <li> It also takes very little primer to coat my hair, just a dab or two.  </li>
            <li> I use very little of each and then use Prime Style Extender.  </li>
            <li> I use a small amount of this conditioner as well.  </li>
            <li> And the styling products come in really small sizes to boot.  </li>
            <li> A little on the expensive side</li>
            <li> LP products are expensive, there&#x27;s no doubt about that.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner do exactly what they claim:  they eliminate frizz and keep hair cleaner longer.  I have medium texture, somewhat wavy, dry hair that&#x27;s prone to frizz.  I also color my hair frequently and use a curling iron several times a week, which both lead to dryness, and consequently, FRIZZ!  It takes very little of this shampoo to make a head full of soapy suds.  My hair is below shoulder length and I use a dollop about the size of a quarter.  This shampoo is sulfate and silicone free, which protects my precious color and adds no heavy weight to my tresses.  I use a small amount of this conditioner as well.  It has a lot of &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; which makes detangling easy.  It feels different from any other conditioner I&#x27;ve used.  I can&#x27;t really explain it, but it&#x27;s true.  I can go several days without shampooing, thanks to this special formula.  The less I shampoo, the brighter my hair color is.  When my hair is damp, I use the Living Proof Prime Style Extender cream from roots to ends.  This primer also helps keep oil and dirt from adhering to the hair and not only increases the effectiveness of styling products, but also keeps my style in place into the next day, something previously unheard of for me!  I also use the LP No Frizz Weightless Styling Spray, which also works to eliminate frizz and delivers impeccable hold but is totally invisible (I can&#x27;t feel any product in my hair at all!).  I live in Florida where the humidity is atrocious and this routine keeps my usually wayward hair looking sleek and smooth.  I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s done because there&#x27;s no smoothing silicone in any LP product, but hey, I&#x27;m happy with having a good hair day every day.  LP products are expensive, there&#x27;s no doubt about that.  And the styling products come in really small sizes to boot.  But the shampoo and conditioner will last a long time because so little product is needed to do the job.  It also takes very little primer to coat my hair, just a dab or two.  The styling spray is another matter.  The container is quite tiny and the $24 size doesn&#x27;t last me a full month.  However, the largest size is much more economical (almost twice the size and only $12 more) and it lasts quite a while.  I&#x27;m sure my excellent results are due to the fact that I use these four LP products together, but I have used the primer and styling spray individually and my results were still good (not as good but close).  I really love this shampoo and conditioner.  The patented molecule that LP invented certainly makes them different from others on the market (high end or drugstore).  They have definitely made a difference for me.  I no longer have a frizzball hairdo that I loathe.  And when the humidity climbs, my hair stays frizz free.  It&#x27;s amazing!  I heartily recommend these LP products.ing spray is another matter.  The container is quite tiny and the $24 size doesn&#x27;t last me a full month.

            <li> This shampoo and conditioner are great. Well recommended!</li>
            <li> A lot of money for a bottle of shampoo and conditioner that after using it did absolutely nothing to reduce frizz in the humid summer air...  On the plus side it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I have to admit this stuff is good !!!  Just wish it was not so expensive because of the cost I won&#x27;t be able to use on a regular basis but if I could I would.  Made a huge difference with the frizz even in 96%humidity today.  Not too much frizz and hair looks healthy and soft.  The smell is ok reminds me of the spa smell more like Aveda smell so if you like that you will like the smell.  This really is a great product and worth the 5 stars but the cost more like 2 stars !!!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is amazing. I have recommended this product to everyone who deals with frizz like I do. It really keeps my haor tame making it easier to manage and I allows me to flat iron it less</li>

            <li> I have naturally curly hair and it loves to frizz in spots. This is the best shampoo and conditioner to keep my hair soft pretty and frizz free. Well worth the money. I absolutly love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product line.  It really works. This is a reorder</li>
            <li> Smells really good, still have curls. From my experience i see a lot of hair fall when i use the shampoo. Conditioner is good.</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair, but lots of it, that is very sensative to humidity. During the humid summers and when it rains, my hair gets very frizzy and basically looks like cotton candy, no joke. This shampoo and conditioner changed that. I wash and condition every other day and used Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Round Trip to define the curl (and I don&#x27;t touch it). Viola, no frizz. The combination is perfect for me. I&#x27;ve tried the products in different combinations and not gotten the same results. They have to be used together.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  Give it a 5.  My issue was with the packaging.  I sent an email to the sender, asking if they would correct the problem because the conditioner arrived open and leaking and I lost about 20% of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Living Proof Shampoo and Conditioner has improved my hair&#x27;s texture and body tremendously.  It took about a week for my hair to improve, and now it&#x27;s the only product I use.</li>
            <li> Great product line.  I use very little of each and then use Prime Style Extender.  My hair stays soft and clean whether I let it air dry or blow dry with the Nourishing Styling Cream.  I feel these products are very good for my color treated hair.</li>
            <li> This took down the frizziness of my hair a lot. I don&#x27;t think my hair will ever qualify as not frizzy (it&#x27;s naturally blonde and therefore very fine), but this shampoo and condition combo is the closest I&#x27;ve gotten to normal-looking hair. It is a bit pricey, but not enough to make it any less than 4-stars. The value is worth it.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of shampoos and conditioner. This product is the only one that actually delivered. My hair looks like Jennifer Anniston&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;hair :D</li>
            <li> Meh.  It smells good.  My hair is between straight and wavy (depending upon the amount of wind while drying, as I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair).&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t do much for me.  Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in love with living proof since the first time I used it. I&#x27;ve used the no frizz and the restore and have been incredibly happy with both products. My hair is much more manageable with this product line, and it smells heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is light wieght and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, and the shampoo gets a great lather even in Soft water.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many very expensive products, midrange products, etc.  My hair is a little coarse, definitely color treated then highlighted, thick hair with a slight wave and plenty of frizz.  This product makes it look healthy and shiny.  I also use WEN, which is another favorite.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful products for controlling frizz. I have blond, color treated hair and have problems with humidity.  These definitely help.</li>
            <li> Really controls flyaways-hair is silkier and smoother.  A little on the expensive side but you don&#x27;t have to use as much of the product at each wash.  I also find that my hair stays less oily.  I use to have to wash my hair/around my face every day.  I can go a day or two longer.</li>
            <li> I will buy this product again as it does what it is suppose to do.... leave my hair a lot less frizzy and manageable.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery. Amazing product</li>
            <li> Love it!  I have natural wavy, coarse hair that is also color treated. The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair much smoother and soft.... Much easier to control with a straightener.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite no frizz shampoo. It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that this shampoo combo did nothing for my hair. I even called the company to ask for an exchange and was told I was stuck with what I purchased. This isn&#x27;t the best service and since the product doesn&#x27;t seem to help de-frizz my hair, I have given a low rating. I wonder if Jennifer Aniston would think to help me if she knew.</li>
            <li> Love this product! My hair looks and feels like silk</li>
