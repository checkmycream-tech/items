            <li>Folds neatly and looks good on my dressing table.  </li>
            <li>The 7X side is a good all around magnification to keep yourself looking like a movie star...</li>
            <li>Good looking, but the two pivot points are not adjustable.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>Nice mirror.</li>
            <li>Kinda nice since I just hang it on the wall after I use it every morning.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice mirror.</li>
            <li>This mirror is a very useful and great d&amp;eacute;cor for my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I viewed many mirrors sold on Amazon, and although many were good, this mirror was just what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Very clear and magnification is perfect.</li>
            <li>Very nice and will be useful.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product very highly and think it would make an excellent bon voyage gift for someone special who is taking a trip.</li>
            <li>I really liked this mirror when it arrived; the optics seemed fine.</li>
            <li>I am highly satisfied.</li>
            <li>looks much more expense.</li>
            <li>I had one mirror like this and love it.  </li>
            <li>So glad to have found in on Amazon</li>
            <li>I am also able to catch blackheads before they become a problem.</li>
            <li>I needed a mirror to place on a counter top for traveling to put on makeup.</li>
            <li>I am really glad i purchased this for traveling.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>In addition to that, the optics of the mirrors on both sides are excellent and there&#x27;s no eyestrain resulting from using this mirror for the time it takes to put on make-up (eye make-up especially).  </li>
            <li>This mirror is very nice, however the magnification is too much</li>
            <li>The 7x magnification is more than I need, other than that this mirror is excellent.</li>
            <li>Very attractive mirror with sharp images.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice mirror, but it&#x27;s very, very heavy, which doesn&#x27;t make it ideal for travel.</li>
            <li>It really is worth the price I paid!</li>
            <li>Good price, simple design.</li>
            <li>a larger and better quality mirror is going to weigh more.</li>
            <li>I wanted a smaller sized double sided mirror to prop on my bathroom storage rack and this is perfect for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>This item is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the pennies it costs.</li>
            <li>These are priced right on Amazon and if found elsewhere they&#x27;re almost twice the price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just right.  </li>
            <li>I used it the first day it arrived, and it worked just as described.</li>
            <li>Overall satisfied.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I am exactly looking for this type of mirror.</li>
            <li>Looks better hanging there than the blue plastic one from K-Mart</li>
            <li>and it looks neat and kinda pretty.</li>
            <li>Love this mirror, bought several as gifts.</li>
            <li>But the first time I tried using it as a travel mirror, the two metal parts came apart in the carrying pouch.</li>
            <li>Rather, it looks strikingly lovely on the counter, waiting for your next use.</li>
            <li>However, since it is so short, I have to place it on top of something</li>
            <li>Exactly as what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect because it folds flat and takes up very little room.  </li>
            <li>Other than being cheeply made, it does do the job, mirror is not distorted and folds nicely for travel.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, and has much less distortion.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just as big as how you want the mirror on your desktop to look like :) clear on both sides!</li>
            <li>and it came so fast from the seller.</li>
            <li>It is a real quality product.</li>
            <li>The 7X is revealing, may be a bit much.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier now.</li>
            <li>Very nice, Just a little smaller than I thought</li>
            <li>Other reviewers noted that the magnification is a bit much, and it is more than I have used before, but after a couple days I didn&#x27;t notice it anymore.  </li>
            <li>The mixed nickel and brass frame is rich looking.  </li>
            <li>I trust Amazon to be as consistent as Yellowstone&#x27;s \\&quot;Old Faithful\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have taken this mirror on a couple of trips now and have been more satisfied with it than with a more expensive, lighted one I had previously purchased from another online seller (a travel specialty company).  </li>
            <li>It is also a lot lighter than the older version.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the side hinges on the new mirror were looser.  </li>
            <li>Just like all other Jerdon products I&#x27;ve purchased, this is top quality and exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Its simple and low profile makes it easy to pack, if I choose to take it for travel, and it works well in the bathroom for daily use, as well, particularly because of the sleek architecture.</li>
            <li>Only thing is can&#x27;t use the magnified side because it makes everything appear to large.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  much nicer than what you can find at the local drug store.</li>
            <li>This would be a fine mirror to use for travel, but it is so small, and magnified so much that you can only see an eye or a mouth at one time.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s large enough (5\\&quot;) to actually see your face, can stand on</li>
            <li>The mirror barely holds it&#x27;s position.  </li>
            <li>I chose to look for another mirror with a more secure base.</li>
            <li>But it should, it was quite a little higher in terms of cost.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this mirror thinking it would be the exact same mirror I purchased a few years ago.  </li>

            <li> I purchased this mirror thinking it would be the exact same mirror I purchased a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I bought this mirror because it folds up for travel, but also because I have broken two stand type mirrors and wanted something with a lower center of gravity, that wouldn&#x27;t be so easy to knock over.  </li>
            <li> I do a lot of traveling and this mirror folds flat and is a life saver for putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> I am a new contact user and having trouble getting them in my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not the clear 7x of my older broken mirror</li>
            <li> The mirror has a strong base that seems to be very durable.</li>
            <li> Regular view on one side and magnification on the other.  </li>
            <li> Wish it came in a larger size for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It is a little small, but I can&#x27;t dock a point for that when the measurements are clearly indicated.</li>
            <li> It is heavy/substantial not the flimsy little mirrors I saw in local stores, but not too heavy to pack for a trip.  </li>
            <li> It is a little on the small side, so if you need a larger mirror, this one is not for you.</li>
            <li> This is hard for me to rate since I haven&#x27;t opened the box - I intend to give it as a gift, therefore, I have not, personally, seen this item</li>
            <li> I also purchased it for travel so that I don&#x27;t have to take along a big, clumsy mirror.  </li>
            <li> However it is a bit heavy for a travel mirror, weighing in at 14 oz.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy for travel, but I wouldn&#x27;t part with it.  </li>
            <li> A poor soldering job made this inevitable.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> Plastic is lighter weight, but the mirrors usually distort.</li>
            <li> I have not traveled with it yet, so I am not sure how well it will travel.</li>
            <li> I got it for a very small space</li>
            <li> I wanted another and had a very hard time finding it.  </li>
            <li> Mine was broken ,but l am going to reorder.</li>
            <li> Now I can see what I am doing and where I&#x27;ve gotten sloppy with application.</li>

            <li> This would be a fine mirror to use for travel, but it is so small, and magnified so much that you can only see an eye or a mouth at one time.  You have to hold it in your hand to use and not being lighted is a handicap as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror because it folds up for travel, but also because I have broken two stand type mirrors and wanted something with a lower center of gravity, that wouldn&#x27;t be so easy to knock over.  It is an attractive mirror that I don&#x27;t mind leaving out.  This was a good value for the price. It is a little on the small side, so if you need a larger mirror, this one is not for you.</li>
            <li> I am exactly looking for this type of mirror. I am highly satisfied.</li>
            <li> This mirror is very nice, however the magnification is too much it makes the image distorted, so I only use the regular mirror.</li>
            <li> The Jerdon MC229CG Folding Travel Mirror is a good quality mirror. I like that it&#x27;s large enough (5\\&quot;) to actually see your face, can stand on it&#x27;s own, and has much less distortion. However it is a bit heavy for a travel mirror, weighing in at 14 oz.  That&#x27;s the trade off - a larger and better quality mirror is going to weigh more. Plastic is lighter weight, but the mirrors usually distort. So, this is a great mirror if weight isn&#x27;t an issue for you.</li>
            <li> I have taken this mirror on a couple of trips now and have been more satisfied with it than with a more expensive, lighted one I had previously purchased from another online seller (a travel specialty company).  This is lightweight and the stand is quite stable. I am very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very attractive mirror with sharp images.  Hopefully the finish will hold up.  I have not traveled with it yet, so I am not sure how well it will travel.</li>
            <li> looks much more expense.</li>
            <li> This is an attractive mirror that matches my fixtures in the bathroom where I have it.  Kinda nice since I just hang it on the wall after I use it every morning.  Looks better hanging there than the blue plastic one from K-Mart did.  But it should, it was quite a little higher in terms of cost.  It is a little small, but I can&#x27;t dock a point for that when the measurements are clearly indicated. Other reviewers noted that the magnification is a bit much, and it is more than I have used before, but after a couple days I didn&#x27;t notice it anymore.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror thinking it would be the exact same mirror I purchased a few years ago.  The quality was not the same.  I noticed the side hinges on the new mirror were looser.  The mirror barely holds it&#x27;s position.  It is also a lot lighter than the older version.  Other than being cheeply made, it does do the job, mirror is not distorted and folds nicely for travel.</li>
            <li> This item is just as descibed. The 7X is revealing, may be a bit much. It is a plus that it can fold for travel. Great for make up application.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just as big as how you want the mirror on your desktop to look like :) clear on both sides! and it looks neat and kinda pretty.</li>
            <li> This was just what I needed.I am in a wheelchair,so I need a mirror I can set on a table to do makeup,hair,etc.This one meets the bill.</li>
            <li> I have the wall mounted version of this mirror and wanted one to take on trips. It is perfect and has its own case</li>
            <li> Very nice and will be useful.</li>
            <li> I had one mirror like this and love it.  I wanted another and had a very hard time finding it.  So glad to have found in on Amazon........they have EVERYTHING!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to take with me when traveling.  It really is worth the price I paid!</li>
            <li> This mirror arrived in perfect condition.  Whatever position you put it into, it holds without a problem.      The 7x magnification is more than I need, other than that this mirror is excellent.</li>
            <li> I needed a magnifying mirror to apply makeup and this fits the bill perfectly. Now I can see what I am doing and where I&#x27;ve gotten sloppy with application. I am also able to catch blackheads before they become a problem. I don&#x27;t know how I did it before I had this mirror. Good price, simple design.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy for travel, but I wouldn&#x27;t part with it.  It&#x27;s a must have when I leave home.</li>
            <li> Love this mirror, bought several as gifts. It&#x27;s  much nicer than what you can find at the local drug store.</li>
            <li> Great product,great value. This item is well worth the money. My girlfriend loves it.fast shipping to. This is perfect for traveling as it \\&quot;folds up\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This mirror is just what I wanted. I needed a mirror to place on a counter top for traveling to put on makeup. The mirror has a strong base that seems to be very durable.</li>
            <li> I really liked this mirror when it arrived; the optics seemed fine. But the first time I tried using it as a travel mirror, the two metal parts came apart in the carrying pouch. A poor soldering job made this inevitable. I chose to look for another mirror with a more secure base.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for my wife and she is happy with the product. The zoom level is good. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This comes in a travel bag with wrap material that you can use to pack your mirror.  It has 7X magnification--perfect for applying makeup.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great in that it stands  up and looks good, but case also collapse and travel.  Regular view on one side and magnification on the other.  I use it for eye make up application.</li>
            <li> Very clear and magnification is perfect. I am really glad i purchased this for traveling. Wish it came in a larger size for everyday use.</li>
            <li> This is a nice mirror. I use it at work. Only thing is can&#x27;t use the magnified side because it makes everything appear to large. Don&#x27;t need to use that side anyway.</li>
            <li> I wanted a smaller sized double sided mirror to prop on my bathroom storage rack and this is perfect for that purpose.  The mixed nickel and brass frame is rich looking.  There is no distortion to either side of the glass, sometimes a problem with magnified glass.  Because of its size, it would work perfectly for its intended purpose:  as a travel mirror.  It comes with pouch for traveling.  It also works as a good looking mirror in my bathroom.  Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> This is hard for me to rate since I haven&#x27;t opened the box - I intend to give it as a gift, therefore, I have not, personally, seen this item but I believe it to be what it is advertised. It seems to be a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product. I trust Amazon to be as consistent as Yellowstone&#x27;s \\&quot;Old Faithful\\&quot;. This is not \\&quot;blind\\&quot; trust, but the terrific ongoing consistency you afford. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I broke the one I had and ordered the identical one... great tool for makeup application</li>
            <li> The two-tone design of this mirror contributes to the elegance of its design, and the pampered feeling I get using it for regular makeup application. Its simple and low profile makes it easy to pack, if I choose to take it for travel, and it works well in the bathroom for daily use, as well, particularly because of the sleek architecture. This is no clunky, pedestrian tool that you will want to tuck in a drawer when finished using it. Rather, it looks strikingly lovely on the counter, waiting for your next use. Worth the pennies it costs.</li>
            <li> Very nice, Just a little smaller than I thought</li>
            <li> Folds neatly and looks good on my dressing table.  It also matches my faucet and sink hardware.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great travel mirror.  I do a lot of traveling and this mirror folds flat and is a life saver for putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> I like how this mirror folder for packing. The bottom support can be used to hang it needed</li>
            <li> In the last year I&#x27;ve purchased 4 of the Jerdon Travel Mirrors for family members and everyone loves &#x27;em; three 7x 5.5 inch and one 10x 3 inch. Very nice well made attractive mirrors for home use or travel and they look and function perfectly. These are priced right on Amazon and if found elsewhere they&#x27;re almost twice the price. The 7X side is a good all around magnification to keep yourself looking like a movie star...well, the best possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update Nov 19 2012...Just made another purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this to see up close on my face to put on makeup.  However, since it is so short, I have to place it on top of something so I&#x27;m not hunched over at my desk to look into it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as what I was expecting.  Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> This mirror is a very useful and great d&amp;eacute;cor for my bathroom.</li>
            <li> very nice mirror, folds and opens well, has good metal quality and the magnification is good, but I should have ordered 10X. as 7X for me is a bit not enough.</li>
            <li> Mirror works great. I am a new contact user and having trouble getting them in my eyes. It&#x27;s much easier now.</li>
            <li> Good looking, but the two pivot points are not adjustable.  The mirror will not stay in a vertical position.  A bit of material inserted into the pivot solved the problem.</li>
            <li> Just like all other Jerdon products I&#x27;ve purchased, this is top quality and exactly what I expected.  I got it for a very small space and it&#x27;s just right.  I also purchased it for travel so that I don&#x27;t have to take along a big, clumsy mirror.  This is perfect because it folds flat and takes up very little room.  In addition to that, the optics of the mirrors on both sides are excellent and there&#x27;s no eyestrain resulting from using this mirror for the time it takes to put on make-up (eye make-up especially).  I recommend this product very highly and think it would make an excellent bon voyage gift for someone special who is taking a trip.</li>
