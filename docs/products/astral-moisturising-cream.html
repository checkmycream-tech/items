            <li>TOTALLY LOVE THIS!!  </li>
            <li>Love astral, great on the skin!!</li>
            <li>the skin perfectly without overwhelming it by making you feel it&#x27;s there.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product;it does an excellent job of moisturizing both my face and bady.</li>
            <li>i loved it.</li>
            <li>I remembered  that  she  got this and loved it</li>
            <li>Even good for ecezma breakouts.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cream ever!</li>
            <li>One day at a beauty counter selling Clinique the salesperson asked me if I was using Clinique because my skin was so nice.</li>
            <li>whereupon they both agreed it was just that I had nice skin.</li>
            <li>This may be the best moisturizer in the world, but the scent is just wayyyyy too much.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>There are many moisturizers but none quite matches up to astral.</li>
            <li>It does the job and protects my manhood :)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It is simply the best.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t return it because I opened it, but I haven&#x27;t even put it on my body because the smell is so antiquated and overwhelming.</li>
            <li>my favorite cream.</li>
            <li>It smells overwhelmingly of soap.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t use the latest things like retinols, peptides, etc.</li>
            <li>im glad i listened to the reviews and just went for it.</li>
            <li>but thats ok</li>
            <li>I love this skin cream.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin very soft &amp; beautiful, I&#x27;ve been using Astral for 5yrs</li>
            <li>Love this fantastic cream.</li>
            <li>fast delivery good product</li>
            <li>What a wonderfully large jar for such a great price!  </li>
            <li>The smell is very settle and nice.  </li>
            <li>Should be made available in the states.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face and skin really smooth.</li>
            <li>so it turns a cheap product into a $30 one.</li>
            <li>great for facial cream, a true moisturizer</li>
            <li>Thanks so much, Amazon, for all your good work.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been a loyal customer of the product ever since.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many moisturizers within last 10 years &amp; nothing works like Astral !</li>
            <li>Delivery was very fast and the pot is sealed.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth waiting to get here from the U.K.</li>
            <li>but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>but its so worth it.</li>
            <li>Plus it came in a very large  container  </li>
            <li>Very absorbing.  </li>
            <li>will really appreciate the fact the they do not have to send/bring me Astral</li>
            <li>much more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best cold cream ever, I have used it for years, my daughters and granddaughters use it too</li>
            <li>and she gets what she wants and likes.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say my face really went downhill as I tried night moisturizers from Vichy, biotherm, and estee lauder.</li>
            <li>Luv it so much.</li>
            <li>This cream is great, and all you need is a very little like German brand Nivea!  </li>
            <li>I get more compliments on my skin, and it is all down to astral.</li>
            <li>How quickly they discounted this inexpensive, terrific cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this cream for your body.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended it to anyone who needs a moisture cream.</li>
            <li>It keeps your skin in such good condition, far better than all these fancy expensive so called anti wrinkle skin creams..</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and does, indeed, keep the skin soft.</li>
            <li>must have  made them look really expensive and attractive.  </li>
            <li>Especially during the winter or cool times, this does a job like no other.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it man.  </li>
            <li>Have super dry skin, close to eczema and</li>
            <li>First tried it several years ago when my mother-in-law went to England.</li>
            <li>My English wife introduced me to Astral when we married</li>
            <li>Before it was available in Amazon, I used to hunt people who are going to England down to get some for me.  </li>
            <li>I have used prior to this purchase and was lucky enough to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li>morning I was checking how much I had left  </li>
            <li>I have 60 year old combination skin</li>
            <li>It makes all my skin feel so soft and supple.</li>
            <li>First of all, i have dry skin and Astral moistruries</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because, due to it&#x27;s rich thickness, it takes a lot of cream to spread over the body.  </li>
            <li>It is okay for a body cream but NOT good as a facial moisterizer.  </li>
            <li>I have used Astral as far back as I can remember.  </li>
            <li>the only thing is because i live in the states i have to pay an extreme amount of shipping</li>

            <li> Way too thick, doesn&#x27;t blend in, too much perfume in it, and then when it has finally blended in, leaves a coat of oily lanolin on your skin that you have to blot with a cloth.  </li>
            <li> My English wife could not live without it.</li>
            <li> so she won&#x27;t have to replace  it for a long  time.  </li>
            <li> Tried other moisturising cream over the years and always come back to Astral.  </li>
            <li> and I like as few and simple ingredients as possible.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use creams every single day</li>
            <li> Dude, I am a black male, I don&#x27;t want everyone to know that I use lotion.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was all fine, until I discovered they stole my Astral stash, I went crazy man.  </li>
            <li> I do as little as possible to my skin.</li>
            <li> Not available in the U.S, only from the U.K</li>
            <li> Lifelong customer here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve easily spent $200 on these other creams, not including the moisture serums ...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I wasted money all these years in the super expensive face creams</li>
            <li> This cream beats any other lotion and moisturizer out there!</li>
            <li> while i was on accutane, it seriously would have been a life-saver.</li>
            <li> Stick to Astral, you will not go wrong.</li>
            <li> I am using it up, but I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate those punks.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have used this product for over 50 years.  My daughter also uses Astral.  Tried other moisturising cream over the years and always come back to Astral.  It is the Best!  Reasonably priced and does, indeed, keep the skin soft.</li>
            <li> Like others before me, I&#x27;m from Britain and have used Astral since I was a teen--am 76 now and still use it. One day at a beauty counter selling Clinique the salesperson asked me if I was using Clinique because my skin was so nice. I said that I used Astral cream, whereupon they both agreed it was just that I had nice skin. How quickly they discounted this inexpensive, terrific cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning I was checking how much I had left  (my sister always bring me it from England and she hasn&#x27;t been here for a couple of years), and that was when th thought occurred to try Amazon and there it was--saved! Now when she comes she can bring me Tunnock&#x27;s caramel wafers instead. Thanks so much, Amazon, for all your good work.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. I will buy it time and time again. I can&#x27;t believe I wasted money all these years in the super expensive face creams</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cream ever! Have super dry skin, close to eczema and this works miracles!</li>
            <li> Love astral, great on the skin!! Not available in the U.S, only from the U.K but I love it!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. I will never be without it.  I wish it were easier to get but it&#x27;s worth waiting to get here from the U.K.</li>
            <li> I have used Astral as far back as I can remember.  I just cannot use anything else on my skin.  I have been living in USA for over 30 years and finally I can get Astral here...through AMAZON!!!  Thank you Amazon, my family and friends will really appreciate the fact the they do not have to send/bring me Astral everytime they visit London.  WAY TO GO AMAZON!!!</li>
            <li> It makes your skin very soft &amp; beautiful, I&#x27;ve been using Astral for 5yrs I just love it.I would recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li> This cream is great, and all you need is a very little like German brand Nivea!  I have 60 year old combination skin, I take a couple of daps with a qtip, and soften it and applying to my neck, sides of my face and under my eyes, and massage!  I let it sink in for 10 minutes, and it feels so heavenly, thus it&#x27;s name Astral !</li>
            <li> There are many moisturizers but none quite matches up to astral. Especially during the winter or cool times, this does a job like no other. This is one of the things I always request when my family or friends are coming to visit. Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I recently found information about this cream in an online article and decided I had to try it.  What a wonderfully large jar for such a great price!  The best part is that Astral is a wonderful moisturizer, nothing else I&#x27;ve tried can beat it.  I&#x27;ll definitely be a return customer.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because, due to it&#x27;s rich thickness, it takes a lot of cream to spread over the body.  I may try the lighter version next time (or not!).</li>
            <li> It is okay for a body cream but NOT good as a facial moisterizer.  I am using it up, but I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was and still the best ever I will always buy from you guys just keep up with the good deals</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t understand.  This lotion is the bomb.  I can&#x27;t live without it man.  Before it was available in Amazon, I used to hunt people who are going to England down to get some for me.  I always store a ton of them.&lt;br /&gt;Recently, we had a burglary and they stole all my electronics, laptops, iPad, wife&#x27;s jewelry and much more.&lt;br /&gt;It was all fine, until I discovered they stole my Astral stash, I went crazy man.  Who steals lotion?  I still curse them to this day.&lt;br /&gt;The way I stored them must have  made them look really expensive and attractive.  I hate those punks.  I had to go for a month without Astral.&lt;br /&gt;Why do I like Astral?  Because it is perfect.  First of all, i have dry skin and Astral moistruries the skin perfectly without overwhelming it by making you feel it&#x27;s there.  The smell is very settle and nice.  Dude, I am a black male, I don&#x27;t want everyone to know that I use lotion.  Astral is perfect for that.  It does the job and protects my manhood :)</li>
            <li> TOTALLY LOVE THIS!!  TRY IT...</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better product;it does an excellent job of moisturizing both my face and bady. Will continue to order.</li>
            <li> I love this product. First tried it several years ago when my mother-in-law went to England. I looked everywhere, even contacted the distributer to try and get some. I was so happy when I found out it was being sold on Amazon. This is the only moisturizer I use now. It takes about 2-3 weeks to receive but well worth the wait. You can beat the price, a 500ml jar last will me about 2 months and I use it generously. Lifelong customer here.</li>
            <li> i loved it. thankyou.</li>
            <li> mum finally got some astral without travelling to the UK</li>
            <li> the best moisturizing cream that&#x27;s on the market</li>
            <li> great for facial cream, a true moisturizer</li>
            <li> The best cold cream ever, I have used it for years, my daughters and granddaughters use it too</li>
            <li> My English wife introduced me to Astral when we married and I&#x27;ve been a loyal customer of the product ever since.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many moisturizers within last 10 years &amp; nothing works like Astral ! This cream is simply amazing !!!</li>
            <li> fast delivery good product</li>
            <li> Gave  this as a gift  and my mom loved it!  She  couldn&#x27;t  believe  I remembered  that  she  got this and loved it I might add while  over seas in Europe.  Plus it came in a very large  container  so she won&#x27;t have to replace  it for a long  time.  So I look like a hero  and she gets what she wants and likes.  We are both winners!  Thank you Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this cream for your body. I have used prior to this purchase and was lucky enough to find on Amazon. This cream beats any other lotion and moisturizer out there!</li>
            <li> Very absorbing.  Even good for ecezma breakouts. That was a quote from my daughter.  She has  a medicine but uses this instead.</li>
            <li> Way too thick, doesn&#x27;t blend in, too much perfume in it, and then when it has finally blended in, leaves a coat of oily lanolin on your skin that you have to blot with a cloth.  Yuck!</li>
            <li> I get more compliments on my skin, and it is all down to astral. I couldn&#x27;t get it in north America for a while and I have to say my face really went downhill as I tried night moisturizers from Vichy, biotherm, and estee lauder. I&#x27;ve easily spent $200 on these other creams, not including the moisture serums ... What was I thinking?  Astral does it all and I&#x27;m so happy to find it here on Amazon!  My knees, hands, and elbows are as happy as my face too!</li>
            <li> My English wife could not live without it. We can&#x27;t bring it home when we travel to England as we only take carry on luggage.</li>
            <li> This is a product I have used for years.  It is simply the best.  Should be made available in the states.</li>
            <li> This may be the best moisturizer in the world, but the scent is just wayyyyy too much. I can&#x27;t return it because I opened it, but I haven&#x27;t even put it on my body because the smell is so antiquated and overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and years. Luv it so much. I highly recommended it to anyone who needs a moisture cream.</li>
            <li> I am hooked on Astral. I was introduced to this product by a friend. Keeps my face and skin really smooth. Now I don&#x27;t have to bother my friends travelling to England to get it. Way to go, Amazon.</li>
            <li> my favorite cream. Great moisturising cream.</li>
            <li> It was beautiful, just as I remembered from years ago in the UK when I lived there. It keeps your skin in such good condition, far better than all these fancy expensive so called anti wrinkle skin creams.. Stick to Astral, you will not go wrong.</li>
            <li> It smells overwhelmingly of soap. I had to wash it off thirty seconds after applying it because I couldn&#x27;t bear the smell. It was like having a bar of Safeguard taped under my nose.</li>
            <li> This cream deserves the good reviews! I don&#x27;t use creams every single day and I like as few and simple ingredients as possible. And I don&#x27;t use the latest things like retinols, peptides, etc. I do as little as possible to my skin. I&#x27;m planning to reorder Astral when I finish my jar.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t have any allergic reaction either!&lt;br /&gt;So yes, I&#x27;d recommend this cream! Delivery was very fast and the pot is sealed.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
            <li> so awesome im glad i listened to the reviews and just went for it. my skin has NEVER been smoother.&lt;br /&gt;i wish i knew about this while i was on accutane, it seriously would have been a life-saver. but thats ok cause i have it now.&lt;br /&gt;i recommend it to everyone. the only thing is because i live in the states i have to pay an extreme amount of shipping so it turns a cheap product into a $30 one. but its so worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this skin cream. It makes all my skin feel so soft and supple. I would buy again and will!!!</li>
            <li> Love this fantastic cream.</li>
