            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing hair cream.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good to maintain the hair moisturized specially during the winter season.</li>
            <li>First off, the smell was great.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff because it wont flake and leaves a flexible hold.  </li>
            <li>so glad I found this.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel healthy</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>My hair wan&#x27;t drenched but more than damp.  </li>
            <li>Argan Magic Nourishing Hair Cream helped her through it.</li>
            <li>makes hair healthy.</li>
            <li>This is the best product that I have used since my hair has been natural and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, it smells FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>I applys softly, keeps my hair nourished and lasts a good while.  </li>
            <li>Very good product to enhance the curls without leaving hair tacky, delivery took a little longer but I was notified of this.</li>
            <li>Although its great for any other time.  </li>
            <li>It gives a more natural hold.</li>
            <li>I applied to my hair once I absorbed some of the water.  </li>
            <li>so I have to hold it under scalding hot water and poke at it with hair pins to get it to unclog.</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>Great product, very long lasting, will purchase again</li>
            <li>didnt really do anything</li>
            <li>It is very sticky.</li>
            <li>My hair is also much, much softer and shinier after using.</li>
            <li>My ends feel so much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>I have long naturally curly fine hair.</li>
            <li>all in all happy enough,did find the delivery charge expensive.</li>
            <li>It means I can wear my hair in curls the way it naturally is!</li>
            <li>(clean, maybe slightly citrusy?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite sensitive to smell and can&#x27;t take anything</li>
            <li>I have soft curls that need some coaxing to hold their shape.</li>
            <li>Second, it absorbs really, really well.</li>
            <li>Here is an inexpensive product that does what it says it will do:  Hydrate &amp; condition; eliminate frizz and provide a soft flexible hold.  </li>
            <li>it give a natural shine and look.</li>
            <li>I used to have very very damaged and dry ends</li>
            <li>so it was getting pretty dry.</li>
            <li>Also goes a long way since you dont need much on each application.  </li>
            <li>I believe that this product would work well on all hair types, you just need a dab for fine tresses and a dollop if you&#x27;ve got thick, long hair like I do.</li>

            <li> It doesnt smell weird and not as strong as macadamia oil products.</li>
            <li> I tried it on dry hair, as the directions say it can be used.  </li>
            <li> My dry hair didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> After surgery, my mother&#x27;s hair was dry to the point of breaking off.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my very dry hair.</li>
            <li> Granted, I have to use a little at a time and rub it between my hands before I put it on, but I used to do that with other products and either have them not make any difference or immediately make it look like I&#x27;d dumped Shellac over my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a relatively inexpensive product and if it failed like everything else, well, I was still in the same position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have long, thick and wavy hair.</li>
            <li> If your hair does get messed up for any reason, just add a little water and re-style without having to put anymore.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so thick it usually takes FOREVER to air dry</li>
            <li> but this cut the time in almost half!</li>
            <li> The cream is very thick and the application is not smooth on dry hair and my hair did not absorb the product.  </li>
            <li> then I break it, because it make the hair a little hard.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that the cream plugs up the nozzle thing sometimes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find something that has hold to contain the frizz but still not make it crunchy!</li>
            <li> I really hate this product is no longer at CVS.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This hair cream is very nice. I applys softly, keeps my hair nourished and lasts a good while.  It does have build-up; so use it somewhat sparingly.</li>
            <li> I apply a dime sized amount of this to my med. length curly hair before using mousse.  It calms the frizz and awakens the curl.  I&#x27;m quite sensitive to smell and can&#x27;t take anything perfume-y and this smells mild and wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff because it wont flake and leaves a flexible hold.  I wouldnt recommend it on windy days since its only a medium hold product.  Although its great for any other time.  If your hair does get messed up for any reason, just add a little water and re-style without having to put anymore.  Also goes a long way since you dont need much on each application.  Smells really good too! :)</li>
            <li> I have soft curls that need some coaxing to hold their shape. This product is great because it reduces frizz, holds the curl, and doesn&#x27;t make hair crunchy. It gives a more natural hold. I also use it to revive my curls after sleeping on them over night.</li>
            <li> I was at my wit&#x27;s end with my frizzy, curly, wavy hair. It never behaved. But a friend on Tumblr mentioned that she used this, and since her hair was similar to mine in type and texture, I figured I&#x27;d try. Why not? This was a relatively inexpensive product and if it failed like everything else, well, I was still in the same position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought it. And I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I was amazed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it smells FANTASTIC. Second, it absorbs really, really well. I can put it in my hair and not have it feel greasy or waxy or sticky. Granted, I have to use a little at a time and rub it between my hands before I put it on, but I used to do that with other products and either have them not make any difference or immediately make it look like I&#x27;d dumped Shellac over my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product. The only bad thing is that the cream plugs up the nozzle thing sometimes so I have to hold it under scalding hot water and poke at it with hair pins to get it to unclog. Or i just take off the cap and squeeze it out, which is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I found this. It means I can wear my hair in curls the way it naturally is!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel healthy</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Will definitely order more. Love the way it makes my hair feel. It works great on my hair.</li>
            <li> didnt really do anything</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my very dry hair. It is very sticky.</li>
            <li> Here is an inexpensive product that does what it says it will do:  Hydrate &amp; condition; eliminate frizz and provide a soft flexible hold.  I used this hair cream after I shampooed and conditioned.  I applied to my hair once I absorbed some of the water.  My hair wan&#x27;t drenched but more than damp.  This cream gave me shine, definition, and softness.  I tried it on dry hair, as the directions say it can be used.  My dry hair didn&#x27;t like it.  The cream is very thick and the application is not smooth on dry hair and my hair did not absorb the product.  This 8 oz. bottle will last me for a long time.  I am happy with the ingredients and the scent.  I believe that this product would work well on all hair types, you just need a dab for fine tresses and a dollop if you&#x27;ve got thick, long hair like I do.</li>
            <li> Already knew the product before the order which is why I did order. Very good product to enhance the curls without leaving hair tacky, delivery took a little longer but I was notified of this. all in all happy enough,did find the delivery charge expensive.</li>
            <li> I really hate this product is no longer at CVS.  This is the best product that I have used since my hair has been natural and it is reasonably priced. I haven&#x27;t found another product that even comes close to this.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only products that work on my hair. I have long naturally curly fine hair. It&#x27;s hard to find something that has hold to contain the frizz but still not make it crunchy!</li>
            <li> After surgery, my mother&#x27;s hair was dry to the point of breaking off. Argan Magic Nourishing Hair Cream helped her through it. I would recommend this product for damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Takes out the frizz of my curly hair!</li>
            <li> I have tried several different oils on my hair throughout the year and had yet to find one that worked well before this oil. I have long, thick and wavy hair. I color it occasionally and straighten/curl it daily so it was getting pretty dry. I applied this oil after the shower on my damp hair and noticed a difference immediately! It smells great (clean, maybe slightly citrusy? smell). My hair is so thick it usually takes FOREVER to air dry but this cut the time in almost half! My hair is also much, much softer and shinier after using. This one is a keeper!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good to maintain the hair moisturized specially during the winter season. it give a natural shine and look. I prefer after I put it to keep it a while then I break it, because it make the hair a little hard.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing hair cream. makes hair healthy.</li>
            <li> First off, the smell was great. It doesnt smell weird and not as strong as macadamia oil products. Second, it does what it claims: moisturizing, eliminating frizz, adding shine. I used to have very very damaged and dry ends but after about a month of using this product I notice the different. My ends feel so much smoother and softer. I believe it prevents and eliminate breakage as well. Great product, very long lasting, will purchase again</li>
            <li> Excellent Product!!!! Gives hair one of the best looks of all products Ive used, gives hair shine, flexibility and volume</li>
