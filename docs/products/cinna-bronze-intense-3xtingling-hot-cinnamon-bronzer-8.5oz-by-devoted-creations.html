            <li>this is the best one I have used yet!</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;ve had the best results</li>
            <li>Great price on amazon to boot!!</li>
            <li>Oh &amp; the smell is amazing!!</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, but not too happy with the watery texture.</li>
            <li>Hope it works as good as it smells!</li>
            <li>Smells great both before AND after getting out of the tanning bed.  </li>
            <li>But the effects are great.</li>
            <li>Smells great just like the cereal</li>
            <li>This tingle lotion gives amazing color!</li>
            <li>I received this product in good timing and still in packaging.  </li>
            <li>I like to smell good after a tanning session and not like burnt skin.</li>
            <li>but they work really good</li>
            <li>Very Pleased</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion because I wanted to get a nice tan relatively quickly, and after reading the reviews, this one sounded perfect!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!  </li>
            <li>First, this is the best smelling tanning lotion you&#x27;ll find.  </li>
            <li>i have referred so many customers &amp; we cannot keep this on the shelves!</li>
            <li>but it smells amazing</li>
            <li>She asked me if I liked the tingle lotion</li>
            <li>and it smell so good you will love it</li>
            <li>Most people have said that they like the smell, but I think it kind of smells like Christmas.</li>
            <li>The tingle is very strong and lasts a good 3-4 hours; however, it is totally worth it considering the amount of color it gives you!</li>
            <li>so I took a shower, and it got alot better.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s more of a warming than a tingling.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was perfect, I would definitely order this product again as well as recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a better product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only is the price of CinnaBronze the cheapest I have ever paid for a lotion(under $15), it is also the BEST lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Actually have yet to &amp;#34;use&amp;#34; it to see if it helps with the tanning but the smell alone is AMAZING!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Love the smell too.</li>
            <li>anyway that&#x27;s when it burned the most &amp;</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, it has a very strong cinnamon smell to it, but boy is it hot!  </li>
            <li>pay--- definitely a strong tingle, but everyone&#x27;s skin handles it differently, love the scent!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can say my 5 star rating is genuine &amp; I am officially in love with this product.</li>
            <li>fast service, loved the product</li>
            <li>Thanks for good product.  </li>
            <li>so I tan fairly easily.  </li>
            <li>the rest of me was fine</li>
            <li>I did notice a huge difference in my tan though</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome for $20 and less!</li>
            <li>The smell is a perfect cinnamon sweet smell and by golly it gets you soo dark!</li>
            <li>I love the Cinna Bronze, used it last tanning season after borrowing it from my daughter, this year I got my own.</li>
            <li>Nice tingle (not too hot, could be hotter), but fairly intense.  </li>
            <li>I decided to get this over the Swedish Beauty Pink Diamond, which I heard is a great tingling lotion for beginners, because it was cheaper.  </li>
            <li>This is seriously one of the best tingle lotions ever!</li>
            <li>After 3 more tanning sessions of using this lotion I went into work to hear an older coworker exclaim &amp;</li>
            <li>It works pretty good, you just probably shouldn&#x27;t go in public within 2 hours after using it.</li>
            <li>i get soooo dark &amp; i love the smell!!</li>
            <li>My husband even commented on how much darker I looked today!!</li>
            <li>is not a $40 salon lotion, but is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I put it on and went in the tanning bed and the tingle was not too strong but strong enough.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it states:  </li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty hot.</li>
            <li>This is the first tingling lotion I&#x27;ve used, however I have used the Devoted Creations Steamy Confessions</li>
            <li>It was hot.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li>It got me pretty dark, and I really love the smell!</li>
            <li>I would recommend not putting this on your stomach if you have sensitive skin, but if you want to get dark quick like I do, this is the right lotion!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy! :)</li>
            <li>That is pretty much the downside to it.</li>
            <li>I have never been so thrilled with a product before &amp; will never buy a tanning lotion other than this!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the first tingle lotion I have ever used, so I was very nervous about trying it out at first especially given my light skin.</li>
            <li>Anyway hours later I saw a huge difference in my color.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>When I started up in the booth the whole time I was anticipating this rush of a burning sensation all over, but before I knew it my 8 minutes were up and the booth shut off.</li>
            <li>, I went into a tanner that was offering the whole cereal line</li>
            <li>Please if you have slightly sensitive skin do not use this!!!</li>
            <li>I look more brown than orange with this lotion versus other tingle lotions that I have tried.</li>
            <li>Pretty surprised by this lotion!</li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely LOVES this new tingle bronzer lotion!</li>
            <li>I am a blonde hair, blue eyed, VERY light skinned person, so tanning has always been a struggle for me.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t use it the first couple times I tan because it is hot and the skin becomes very red.</li>
            <li>i have tried MANY MANY tingles &amp; i was skeptical of a tingle that was so inexpensive &amp; smelled like cereal.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, the bronzer gets me dark and the tingle is just right, not painfully strong, but not weak.</li>
            <li>Today was the 7th day I used my new bed, &amp;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely excited to try the other scents in this line!</li>
            <li>it is very hot and makes me red but only for about 45 mins after then leaves.</li>
            <li>The lotion does smell like cinnamon, but it&#x27;s not an overpowering smell, and so far I haven&#x27;t had any after tan odor with it.</li>
            <li>, I was considerably darker.  </li>
            <li>definitely works really well.</li>
            <li>It was not to expensive, works and smells good.</li>
            <li>It got me super dark!  </li>
            <li>I came home, put it on &amp; it didn&#x27;t really burn like some of the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I actually had people telling me how it&#x27;s to much sun tan, because it looked like a deep red ( a little golden) sunburn.</li>
            <li>but I could barely tolerate it.</li>
            <li>I have only used this once so far</li>
            <li>but it was almost enjoyable and cozy feeling, especially because I live on the east coast where it&#x27;s been snowing everyday.</li>
            <li>I just have to use some of the other 3 bottles up first, of different stuff!!</li>
            <li>As a seasoned tanner, I was VERY skeptical about this product, I originally only bought this lotion because I lost my old lotion and thought this would get me through until I bought something better...</li>
            <li>It really does smell like Gingerbread to me or any other cookie with cinnamon in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it make me dark fast</li>
            <li>If you are a fan of tingling lotions and want a dark tan fast, I would definitely recommend this lotion.  </li>
            <li>If you are new to tingling lotions however I might try something else, like Swedish Beauty Pink Diamond, which is what I&#x27;ll probably get next.</li>

            <li> Tried several other bronzers and this is one that actually worked for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s an added bonus that it has also left me with a nicer tan than any other lotion.  </li>
            <li> I am SO DARK now &amp; look as I would after months of tanning with a different lotion &amp; laying out all summer.</li>
            <li> I have yet to use this again since I used the stand up and because it was crazy hot outside last time</li>
            <li> The only con to this lotion is it was a little runny, but for how well this product works and the price...that&#x27;s no problem for me.</li>
            <li> next morning I looked in the mirror and thought I looked a little darker but</li>
            <li> but the tingle was not very hot.</li>
            <li> I said no not really</li>
            <li> I was definitely red, &amp; I could see the places I missed putting the lotion from my pale skin showing up in blotches compared to the rest of my lobster body.</li>
            <li> might just as well do the other.)</li>
            <li> My body got crazy hot and red, my heart started pounding I had to kneel down in the stand up to get myself together.  </li>
            <li> I used this in a level 5 stand up bed, which in my opinion was a bad idea, especially for my first time using this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Leaves me dark.</li>
            <li> The lotion was very watery Which made it difficult to apply on all areas without making a mess.</li>
            <li> For the price, smell and quality if you don&#x27;t mind the slight burn you get with a tingle lotion</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for a little over a week now</li>
            <li> I saw reviews saying to not shower or put on lotion for a few hours after using this lotion, so I wanted to shower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few tingles and this one</li>
            <li> A little while after, my legs and stomach started to itch pretty bad</li>
            <li> I was a big dummy a long time ago &amp; didn&#x27;t like the tingle &amp; took a shower to try to wash it off &amp; it made it 1000 times worse!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> fast service, loved the product</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  Does exactly what it states:  Nice tingle (not too hot, could be hotter), but fairly intense.  Smells great both before AND after getting out of the tanning bed.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because I wanted to get a nice tan relatively quickly, and after reading the reviews, this one sounded perfect!  I am not a big tingle fan but decided to try it. I put it on and went in the tanning bed and the tingle was not too strong but strong enough. I noticed when I got home that I was red, but i was expecting that. A little while after, my legs and stomach started to itch pretty bad so I took a shower, and it got alot better. It got me pretty dark, and I really love the smell! I would recommend not putting this on your stomach if you have sensitive skin, but if you want to get dark quick like I do, this is the right lotion!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy! :)</li>
            <li> I received this product in good timing and still in packaging.  I really like it.  I find for me it is very hot and makes me red but only for about 45 mins after then leaves. But the effects are great. Leaves me dark. I was looking for my next step to darkening and this was it.  Thanks for good product.  Very Pleased</li>
            <li> Smells great just like the cereal but the tingle was not very hot.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty hot. I like a lot of tingle, so I didn&#x27;t mind. Most people have said that they like the smell, but I think it kind of smells like Christmas. It also lingers for awhile. That is pretty much the downside to it.</li>
            <li> Tried several other bronzers and this is one that actually worked for me. With others I just did not seem to tan.  It was not to expensive, works and smells good. I would definitely buy this product again</li>
            <li> After you&#x27;re finished using it, it&#x27;ll leave you SO RED. I actually had people telling me how it&#x27;s to much sun tan, because it looked like a deep red ( a little golden) sunburn. It works pretty good, you just probably shouldn&#x27;t go in public within 2 hours after using it.</li>
            <li> Giving it 5 stars because it&#x27;s excellent for the price you pay--- definitely a strong tingle, but everyone&#x27;s skin handles it differently, love the scent!&lt;br /&gt;This is not a $40 salon lotion, but is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> First, this is the best smelling tanning lotion you&#x27;ll find.  It really does smell like Gingerbread to me or any other cookie with cinnamon in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an added bonus that it has also left me with a nicer tan than any other lotion.  I look more brown than orange with this lotion versus other tingle lotions that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I love the Cinna Bronze, used it last tanning season after borrowing it from my daughter, this year I got my own. I just don&#x27;t use it the first couple times I tan because it is hot and the skin becomes very red.</li>
            <li> This tingle lotion gives amazing color! The tingle is very strong and lasts a good 3-4 hours; however, it is totally worth it considering the amount of color it gives you! The color I get from using this lotion once is probably equivalent to tanning 3 times. The lotion does smell like cinnamon, but it&#x27;s not an overpowering smell, and so far I haven&#x27;t had any after tan odor with it. I&#x27;m definitely excited to try the other scents in this line!</li>
            <li> i work at a tanning salon &amp; i am a tingle fanatic!!! i have tried MANY MANY tingles &amp; i was skeptical of a tingle that was so inexpensive &amp; smelled like cereal. but let me tell you it is AMAZING!!!!! i get soooo dark &amp; i love the smell!! i have referred so many customers &amp; we cannot keep this on the shelves! if you want to be super dark, try it you will not be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I bought this tingling lotion from the salon I tan at but thought I&#x27;d share my thoughts on here.  I&#x27;ve been tanning for about 3 months now, I have olive skin so I tan fairly easily.  This is the first tingling lotion I&#x27;ve used, however I have used the Devoted Creations Steamy Confessions but that&#x27;s more of a warming than a tingling.  I decided to get this over the Swedish Beauty Pink Diamond, which I heard is a great tingling lotion for beginners, because it was cheaper.  It smells amazing, it has a very strong cinnamon smell to it, but boy is it hot!  I used this in a level 5 stand up bed, which in my opinion was a bad idea, especially for my first time using this lotion.  My body got crazy hot and red, my heart started pounding I had to kneel down in the stand up to get myself together.  It was like millions of red ants biting my body.  The feeling lasted for about an hour afterwards and I was probably red for another 2 1/2 hours after.  I saw reviews saying to not shower or put on lotion for a few hours after using this lotion, so I wanted to shower.  I did notice a huge difference in my tan though, I was considerably darker.  I have yet to use this again since I used the stand up and because it was crazy hot outside last time I went tanning.  I&#x27;ll probably only using this lotion when I use the bronzing beds.  If you are a fan of tingling lotions and want a dark tan fast, I would definitely recommend this lotion.  If you are new to tingling lotions however I might try something else, like Swedish Beauty Pink Diamond, which is what I&#x27;ll probably get next.</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely LOVES this new tingle bronzer lotion! It works really well. Smells really delicious. Can&#x27;t go wrong with the purchase of this product! Give it a try! You will NOT be disappointed!</li>
            <li> As a seasoned tanner, I was VERY skeptical about this product, I originally only bought this lotion because I lost my old lotion and thought this would get me through until I bought something better...turns out, this $9.00 bottle of lotion is the BEST I&#x27;ve ever used..LOVE IT! The smell is amazing, the bronzer gets me dark and the tingle is just right, not painfully strong, but not weak. The only con to this lotion is it was a little runny, but for how well this product works and the price...that&#x27;s no problem for me. Shipping was perfect, I would definitely order this product again as well as recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a better product. The lotion was very watery Which made it difficult to apply on all areas without making a mess. It smells wonderful, but not too happy with the watery texture.</li>
            <li> I am a blonde hair, blue eyed, VERY light skinned person, so tanning has always been a struggle for me. In the past going to tanning salons, I would start going in January &amp; come summer time I would have a very faint base tan after months of laying in tanning beds. In the past I have used a couple devoted creations lotions, none of which had done anything for me. As of last year I was using JWOWW, which was just alright. So when I started up tanning again this January I didn&#x27;t want to splurge on an expensive lotion given the chance it might not work well for me. But boy did I luck out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is the price of CinnaBronze the cheapest I have ever paid for a lotion(under $15), it is also the BEST lotion I have ever used. To start off with the smell, if you like cinnamon toast crunch &amp; can imagine yourself taking a bath in a bowl of it, this is for you! Even AFTER tanning, I came home and sat across the room from my mom who said &amp;#34;What is that smell?! It&#x27;s like someone just opened a Cinnabon store in the house&amp;#34;. So you&#x27;ll never have to worry about ATO when leaving the tanning salon, in fact you&#x27;ll leave smelling better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first tingle lotion I have ever used, so I was very nervous about trying it out at first especially given my light skin. When I started up in the booth the whole time I was anticipating this rush of a burning sensation all over, but before I knew it my 8 minutes were up and the booth shut off. When I got out of the booth and looked at my body I was definitely red, &amp; I could see the places I missed putting the lotion from my pale skin showing up in blotches compared to the rest of my lobster body. I felt warm/hot but it was almost enjoyable and cozy feeling, especially because I live on the east coast where it&#x27;s been snowing everyday. I wouldn&#x27;t say the redness went away in 20 minutes like some people have described, but definitely within 2 hours it had subsided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning I looked in the mirror and thought I looked a little darker but that could have just been me wanting to believe I was. After 3 more tanning sessions of using this lotion I went into work to hear an older coworker exclaim &amp;#34;My god you&#x27;re tan!&amp;#34; Something I have NEVER in my life heard before, especially after going tanning for just 3 times. I have been using this lotion for a little over a week now and I can say my 5 star rating is genuine &amp; I am officially in love with this product. I am SO DARK now &amp; look as I would after months of tanning with a different lotion &amp; laying out all summer. I have never been so thrilled with a product before &amp; will never buy a tanning lotion other than this!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!! As I&#x27;m writing this I&#x27;m itching like crazy!! I went tanning at 10:30 am yesterday. After I was burning and red but I could barely tolerate it. It all went away around 5:00pm. Now I woke up around 3:30am itching like crazy!! I can&#x27;t stand it. I am considering going to the ER so they can do something about it because it&#x27;s unbearable! Please if you have slightly sensitive skin do not use this!!!</li>
            <li> Actually have yet to &amp;#34;use&amp;#34; it to see if it helps with the tanning but the smell alone is AMAZING!!!!!! I&#x27;m sure it sounds silly to buy a product just for the smell, but that is truly what made me buy it, I went into a tanner that was offering the whole cereal line and I can not begin to explain how incredible the Cinna Bronze smells! I like to smell good after a tanning session and not like burnt skin. Hope it works as good as it smells!</li>
            <li> great product will order again!</li>
            <li> Pretty surprised by this lotion! It was hot. It got me super dark!  It&#x27;s awesome for $20 and less! I&#x27;ve tried a few tingles and this one definitely works really well. Love the smell too. Awesome lotion!</li>
            <li> I have only used this once so far but it smells amazing and I got the darkest tan I have ever gotten with a lotion before. For the price, smell and quality if you don&#x27;t mind the slight burn you get with a tingle lotion this is the best one I have used yet!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been tanning for about a year. My husband just bought me a tanning bed for my birthday. 100watt bed. Today was the 7th day I used my new bed, &amp; also the 1st day I used this lotion. I went to my salon &amp; bought a sample package. She asked me if I liked the tingle lotion I said no not really but they work really good &amp; I&#x27;ve had the best results w/ the tingle but that&#x27;s after u get the burn. I don&#x27;t like the burn. I came home, put it on &amp; it didn&#x27;t really burn like some of the more expensive brands. I though hmmm...! That&#x27;s weird. I&#x27;ve used some lotions &amp; it burned just rubbing it in let alone under the bed. I went under &amp; felt the tingle but it wasn&#x27;t so over bearing that I couldn&#x27;t stand it. Got out &amp; I still felt the tingle, but it was bearable. I then put some hempz on. WOW!! Then I felt the burn. I was a big dummy a long time ago &amp; didn&#x27;t like the tingle &amp; took a shower to try to wash it off &amp; it made it 1000 times worse!! Let&#x27;s just say I put the hempz on my legs &amp; left the rest alone, (I already had it on 1 leg might just as well do the other.) anyway that&#x27;s when it burned the most &amp; the rest of me was fine &amp; I could still feel the tingle but it was plenty tolerable!! Anyway hours later I saw a huge difference in my color. Wasn&#x27;t orange but tan!! My husband even commented on how much darker I looked today!! I will be purchasing a big bottle of this. I just have to use some of the other 3 bottles up first, of different stuff!! Oh &amp; the smell is amazing!! Just like a cinnamon bun!! Hope this helps!! Great price on amazon to boot!!</li>
            <li> I love this it&#x27;s hot it make me dark fast and it smell so good you will love it</li>
            <li> This is seriously one of the best tingle lotions ever! The smell is a perfect cinnamon sweet smell and by golly it gets you soo dark! this is a tingle lotion so it does tingle however this lotion should def be in your lotion rotation.</li>
