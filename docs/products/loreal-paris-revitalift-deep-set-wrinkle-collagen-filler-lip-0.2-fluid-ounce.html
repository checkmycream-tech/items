            <li>THIS IS PERFECT</li>

            <li>Not work as good as this one does...</li>
            <li>, I RECOMEN IT , REALY WORKS AND LOOK GOOD</li>
            <li>so that is the good part.  </li>
            <li>It is a really good product and a lot cheaper than a face lift.</li>
            <li>After falling in love with this product it gets&#x27; discontinued!  </li>
            <li>I love this product and buy it every chance I get for my stock pile!</li>
            <li>I used this product when it was in retail stores and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest here, no product could do that.  </li>
            <li>It is the most effective product I have found to correct the lines that develop around and on the lips</li>
            <li>It is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>this is a great product and was happy to order it for the second time, thank you</li>
            <li>This product did the BEST job with filling these lines smoothly and very naturely.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Wish I knew of a better product to purchase for those lip lines.</li>
            <li>Great product and very timely shipping it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the more pricy brands and they&lt;</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my lips and it makes them look better</li>
            <li>love this product</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to try ordering more.</li>
            <li>I had more time to use the product now.  </li>
            <li>sure if it helps them for a longer period of time, then each time you use it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products to help with lines around my lips.  </li>
            <li>to me this is nothing more than a moisterizer...</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift is easy to apply and cover most of the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>The two products are joined together into one tube with an applicator at each end which makes it very convenient and easy to apply and the fragrance is pleasant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy, and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Make lips smooth and helps,wrinkles,around the lips.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>product WORKS to Plump up my lips and smooth them out..</li>
            <li>Didnt smooth or plump my lips at all, it did moisturize well, but thats all.</li>
            <li>, This is just a lip gloss/or cheap stick.</li>
            <li>this product really works!!!</li>
            <li>I like this product very much and will reorder for sure.</li>
            <li>However it is good for a deep moisture treatment when needed on the lips.</li>
            <li>Best product for least amount of money.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to purchase it at a low price.  </li>
            <li>But pretty sure the on the lip part doesn&#x27;t do much at all.</li>
            <li>I really love this product because it makes my lips really soft!</li>
            <li>It did not work, maybe covered and filled for 1/2 an hour or so but not even that much.  </li>
            <li>and It&#x27;s fresh.</li>
            <li>This products isn&#x27;t worth the tube it came in.</li>
            <li>right around 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I suspect other higher end cosmetic lines have better quality product, though I know I&#x27;ll be paying more?  </li>
            <li>This simply didn&#x27;t have the kind of ingredients that are soothing, though it does a little good in helping the vertical above lip lines.  </li>
            <li>lol, somehow they seem to have deflated over the last few years</li>
            <li>very temporary.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see any improvement.</li>
            <li>You need to use it daily for smooth looking lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It needs to do more than just work a little - and it needs to be soothing, not irritating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a older women, and my Lips have become thiner , and not as plump and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quadrupled since I bought it and found another cheaper option with a high feedback rating on makeupalley.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>But I put it on whenever I apply new lipstick and it softens the appearance.  </li>
            <li>The lips are very sensitive to chemicals of any/all kinds...</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>it dry&#x27;s, smooth the white tube on like lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>Was clearly used and had to trow it in the garbage....</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li>This stuff has Hyaluronic Acid which is vital to aging skin as it helps in the reproduction of collagen.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several months and when I use it , it really does hide the lines in your lips,,not</li>
            <li>tasteless, odorless and works way better than I expected, good product to use while you are young enough to PREVENT lines around your lips, I don&#x27;t think there is really any different product out there like this, anyway,</li>
            <li>this soft</li>
            <li>So far I see no results from this product...</li>
            <li>In fact I use mainly the white tube which keep my lips hydrated for a whole day with only one application!</li>
            <li>I began using Revitalift Deep Set Wrinkle Collagen filler for the lips when L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s \\&quot;high end\\&quot; brand, Lancome, discontinued a similar lip treatment being sold for $40.  </li>
            <li>The product sent must be old stock since it is totally ineffective.  </li>
            <li>I am 72 years old and have deep wrinkles around my mouth, UNTIL, I use this product, then they go away.  </li>
            <li>Although I found the cream that applies to the lips works to some degree, making the lip lines somewhat disappear, I found the cream that applies on the outside of the lips useless and did noting for bleeding lipstick or creating a nice edge for applying lipliner.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> no real filler quality and no plump look, just deeply moisturized.</li>
            <li> Ive tried other fillers to help with the creases that formed above my lips through years of sun damage and drinking through a straw.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this very long...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how these companies get away with making these false claims, but this one certainly did.</li>
            <li> It was just enough to fill in little lines around the lips and plump my lips up a bit.  </li>
            <li> After using for only a few weeks have already noticed a difference .</li>
            <li> have few to no wrinkles and noticed a couple of lines on my lip, I totally freaked!!</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward on using it and sadly I was left with minus $$$$ on my pocket.</li>
            <li> It does moisturize but  no more than a regular chapstick.</li>
            <li> I have used this product previously, always before buying it at the cosmetics counter at my drugstore.  </li>
            <li> so it seems like it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> wore it to bed and woke up with lips like I used to have a few years ago</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and your money.</li>
            <li> Money wasted.</li>
            <li> (have been using for a few weeks now)...</li>
            <li> I have used this every day for the past month around my mouth to get rid of lines -- but the lines are still there so am just not real sure what this product is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> You can feel a very slight tingle on the lips from the lip plumper and the collagen filler is basically a moisturizing treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> what a shame and waste of money!</li>
            <li> Not sure yet.</li>
            <li> A must buy just hard to find</li>
            <li> genious was behind that idea</li>
            <li> The claim this product makes is completely false.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the results of the product this time, did not perform as it has in the past.</li>
            <li> So sad to see it go.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before but have been unable to find in stores.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t real expensive</li>
            <li> :((</li>
            <li> This was a terrible experience.</li>
            <li> It was disgusting and I will NEVER order from them again!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible terrible terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this product when it was in retail stores and really liked it.  It was just enough to fill in little lines around the lips and plump my lips up a bit.  Disappointed with the results of the product this time, did not perform as it has in the past. However it is good for a deep moisture treatment when needed on the lips.</li>
            <li> After using for only a few weeks have already noticed a difference . Highly recommend. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this quite a while ago.  It did not work, maybe covered and filled for 1/2 an hour or so but not even that much.  I had bought 2 tubes so I had used it a while to see and they say you are suppose to do but nope.</li>
            <li> After falling in love with this product it gets&#x27; discontinued!  WHAT!?!?  I have been buying all the &amp;#34;rest&amp;#34; that is left.  WHY OH WHY did you (L&#x27;Oreal) stop making it???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I beg you to bring back this lip treat.  Especially after having any &amp;#34;derm&amp;#34; work done it just helps with the lines and some plumping.  So sad to see it go.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this very long...right around 3 weeks. So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference whatsoever. It feels greasy and takes awhile to soak into my lips. It keeps lip liner from adhering as it should. It does moisturize but  no more than a regular chapstick. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I would feel some tingling when I used it, but I didn&#x27;t see any difference in the lines around my lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for awhile and it&#x27;s okay.  Wish I knew of a better product to purchase for those lip lines.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell that this product has made any difference.</li>
            <li> Great product and very timely shipping it.  Make lips smooth and helps,wrinkles,around the lips.  A must buy just hard to find</li>
            <li> It is the most effective product I have found to correct the lines that develop around and on the lips</li>
            <li> I have used this product before but have been unable to find in stores. Goes on smooth. No gumminess or stickiness to it.</li>
            <li> very temporary.  it looks and feels ok at application but does not last and was too expensive for the value I received.  The lip plumper eliminates the ability to use allday lip color.</li>
            <li> In fact I use mainly the white tube which keep my lips hydrated for a whole day with only one application!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a older women, and my Lips have become thiner , and not as plump and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product WORKS to Plump up my lips and smooth them out..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just put a line around your lips with the blue tube.&lt;br /&gt;When it dry&#x27;s, smooth the white tube on like lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;Then put your lipstick on if you want..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy, and inexpensive.I have tried the more pricy brands and they&lt;br /&gt;do Not work as good as this one does...&lt;br /&gt;No smell or taste..</li>
            <li> This product is a two-fer.  The two products are joined together into one tube with an applicator at each end which makes it very convenient and easy to apply and the fragrance is pleasant. You can feel a very slight tingle on the lips from the lip plumper and the collagen filler is basically a moisturizing treatment.</li>
            <li> Didnt smooth or plump my lips at all, it did moisturize well, but thats all. Rather use chapstick. What a shame, had so much potential. I used it for a couple months and no diffrence.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this combination wrinkle filler/lip plumper for years. It is the best I&#x27;ve found so far. You can feel and see the difference almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I buy in bulk and save lots of $$ compared to going to the local drug store.</li>
            <li> This was a terrible experience. When I got the box it was opened, there was no plastic or security seal on the tube and both ends had been used before. Yuck! It was disgusting and I will NEVER order from them again!!! Terrible terrible terrible!</li>
            <li> this is a great product and was happy to order it for the second time, thank you</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift is easy to apply and cover most of the wrinkles.  I do not have deep wrinkles around the mouth, but just enough to want to conceal them.  This product comes closest to doing that.&lt;br /&gt;quick delivery!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t sealed as it would have been in the store so I did not trust that it had not been used. I did not use the product because I did not trust is wasn&#x27;t contaminated.</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered ~ perfect</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  I like this product very much and will reorder for sure.</li>
            <li> this product really works!!!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my lips and it makes them look better, I use it every time I go out before putting on lipstick and it does make a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I was able to purchase it at a low price.  It&#x27;s quadrupled since I bought it and found another cheaper option with a high feedback rating on makeupalley.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely wonderful product!  Ive tried other fillers to help with the creases that formed above my lips through years of sun damage and drinking through a straw.  This product did the BEST job with filling these lines smoothly and very naturely.  My foundation went over it perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product however it seems they are discontinuing it for some reason.  :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try ordering more.</li>
            <li> I could not believe the PRICE so I ordered it along with a Wen item from the same seller. I was expecting it to be expired but I went on the cosmetic checker website and It&#x27;s fresh. I am a smoker, 40, have few to no wrinkles and noticed a couple of lines on my lip, I totally freaked!! This stuff has Hyaluronic Acid which is vital to aging skin as it helps in the reproduction of collagen. I&#x27;m not sure if the lip plumper did It&#x27;s job as I didn&#x27;t feel any lip tingle like you do with plumber but if this seller has more, I&#x27;m going to buy them all!!</li>
            <li> The Revitalift comes with two products in the sleeve. One is a cream for around the outside of the lips and one is for applying to the lips. Although I found the cream that applies to the lips works to some degree, making the lip lines somewhat disappear, I found the cream that applies on the outside of the lips useless and did noting for bleeding lipstick or creating a nice edge for applying lipliner.  I would purchase again if I didn&#x27;t have to pay $20 for shipping!  Update:  I had more time to use the product now.  I learned that the blue end of the tube that is meant line the outside of your lips (your skin area) has ingredients that make me breakout into pimples/blisters where ever I put it.  I no longer use that end at all.</li>
            <li> does not work at all,  following instructions it just gums up after putting my lipstick on  wish I returned</li>
            <li> THIS IS PERFECT, YOU FEAL THAT YOUR LIPS ARE FILL IN SECONDS , I RECOMEN IT , REALY WORKS AND LOOK GOOD</li>
            <li> And they stop making it,lol great:(&lt;br /&gt;What genious was behind that idea&lt;br /&gt;All the others drain your wallet,sting and burn your lips and do nothing else</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t real expensive so that is the good part.  I have used this every day for the past month around my mouth to get rid of lines -- but the lines are still there so am just not real sure what this product is supposed to do.  There is no odor and it goes on well but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an update.  I used the entire tube and didn&#x27;t see anything different -- no change.  so it seems like it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months and when I use it , it really does hide the lines in your lips,,not sure if it helps them for a longer period of time, then each time you use it. But, it works ...</li>
            <li> tasteless, odorless and works way better than I expected, good product to use while you are young enough to PREVENT lines around your lips, I don&#x27;t think there is really any different product out there like this, anyway, wore it to bed and woke up with lips like I used to have a few years ago lol, somehow they seem to have deflated over the last few years&lt;br /&gt;GOOD STUFF!</li>
            <li> moisturizes well and seems to help a bit but no real lasting effect. no real filler quality and no plump look, just deeply moisturized.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and your money. I didn&#x27;t  work for me. I never saw any improvement. I will not order again.</li>
            <li> I receive it yesterday and my product didn&#x27;t had a seal or anything like this. Was clearly used and had to trow it in the garbage....what a shame and waste of money! I was really looking forward on using it and sadly I was left with minus $$$$ on my pocket. :((</li>
            <li> Maybe I need to give it time, but I am just not seeing any difference. I will have to wait and see.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see any improvement. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I really love this product because it makes my lips really soft! Chapstick, Burt&#x27;s Bees, Camax, none of them have ever made my lips this soft</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my wife</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money! I just got this today and I&#x27;m sending it back today, This is just a lip gloss/or cheap stick.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It&#x27;s not a wonder-worker but it does help to fill in lines and I do notice fuller lips after I put it on.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to help with lines around my lips.  This collagen filler smoothes the lines.  It doesn&#x27;t get rid of them.  Let&#x27;s be honest here, no product could do that.  But I put it on whenever I apply new lipstick and it softens the appearance.  Best product for least amount of money.  A great buy.</li>
            <li> I have used this product previously, always before buying it at the cosmetics counter at my drugstore.  They do not carry it any longer, therefore I ordered it from Amazon.  The product sent must be old stock since it is totally ineffective.  Money wasted.</li>
            <li> So far I see no results from this product...(have been using for a few weeks now)...to me this is nothing more than a moisterizer...oh well, I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle...:(</li>
            <li> I love this product and buy it every chance I get for my stock pile! I don&#x27;t know why they discontinued it.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet. But pretty sure the on the lip part doesn&#x27;t do much at all. The around the lip area may have some benefits. Unclear at this time. Probably will not order again.</li>
            <li> The claim this product makes is completely false. This products isn&#x27;t worth the tube it came in. I don&#x27;t know how these companies get away with making these false claims, but this one certainly did.</li>
            <li> I began using Revitalift Deep Set Wrinkle Collagen filler for the lips when L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s \\&quot;high end\\&quot; brand, Lancome, discontinued a similar lip treatment being sold for $40.  I personally like the L&#x27;Oreal treatment because it not only smooths lip lines but it \\&quot;plumps\\&quot; the lips.  However, it does not moisturize your lips.  You will need to use another product such as moisturizing lipstick or gloss to attain this benefit.</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and have deep wrinkles around my mouth, UNTIL, I use this product, then they go away.  I look 20 years younger in about 10 minutes.  It is a really good product and a lot cheaper than a face lift.</li>
            <li> The lips are very sensitive to chemicals of any/all kinds...I found after two days?  This simply didn&#x27;t have the kind of ingredients that are soothing, though it does a little good in helping the vertical above lip lines.  I suspect other higher end cosmetic lines have better quality product, though I know I&#x27;ll be paying more?  It needs to do more than just work a little - and it needs to be soothing, not irritating.</li>
            <li> This product works great and I can tell a big difference in the wrinkles on my lips. I highly recommend it. You need to use it daily for smooth looking lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered L&#x27;Oreal  Collagen Filler Eye Treatment but haven&#x27;t received it yet. I&#x27;m looking forward to using this product too.</li>
