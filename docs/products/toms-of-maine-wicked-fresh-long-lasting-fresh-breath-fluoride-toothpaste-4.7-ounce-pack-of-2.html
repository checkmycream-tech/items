            <li>Very minty, wonderful, and mentholy, in a good way.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Tastes good, works fine.  </li>
            <li>Love all Tom&#x27;s products</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy toms until something better for the environment and for me comes along.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this for the taste.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t been able to find in stores here, anymore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s products for more then 20 years.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite flavor in this brand.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean and breath is fresh lie any good working toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d come around and like a natural toothpaste, but this is a great product for skeptics.</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste with no whitening, very pepperminty and just slightly sweet.</li>
            <li>PEPPERMINT WICKED FRESH is awesome and the only one that I like!</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the peppermint flavor.</li>
            <li>Amazon.com reviewers that I could find such a great product.</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s products are fabulous.</li>
            <li>They originally marketed this a milder mint-flavored toothpaste for kids, but mine found this a bit too spicy.</li>
            <li>Fresh breath!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still good toothpaste, but my husband and I are the only ones who use it in our family.</li>
            <li>Better that what the dentist offers!</li>
            <li>Leaves you with fresh smelling breath.</li>
            <li>so when the Wicked Fresh dental care products came out I was extra thrilled.  </li>
            <li>This toothpaste makes your mouth feel fresh and also cleans your teeth</li>
            <li>Stock up if the price is right</li>
            <li>(she perceives them as spicy -including any carbonation), but she will use the Tom&#x27;s of Maine clove-flavored toothpaste, so I had higher hopes for this mint flavor.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite and the only toothpaste that I will use.  </li>
            <li>Granted, my five year old is very sensitive to strong flavors</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Tom&#x27;s of Maine&#x27;s policies and practices and their cruelty free products.  </li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also a big fan of a clean (and clean-feeling) mouth</li>
            <li>also think it is doing a decent job in avoiding dental issues.</li>
            <li>However, I feel that buying this product will influence other people and companies that ethics are important to consumers.</li>
            <li>but if you like soft runny toothpaste with a bite !</li>
            <li>I normally purchase them at Whole Foods store, but I found it convenient to purchase on-line  (at the same price as brick store).&lt;br</li>
            <li>far as taste goes, you either like or not ( I happen to like it).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There is too much fluoride in public water.</li>
            <li>last is ok but a little gritty.  </li>
            <li>Going back to my old reliable Tom&#x27;s peppermint toothpaste.</li>

            <li> Awesome toothpaste. Leaves you with fresh smelling breath. I like it because it scores a good grade of 2 on EWG website.</li>
            <li> Tastes good, works fine.  I buy this because I try to buy products not tested on animals.  I realize that this company is owned by a larger one that does test on animals.  However, I feel that buying this product will influence other people and companies that ethics are important to consumers.</li>
            <li> Love all Tom&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> They originally marketed this a milder mint-flavored toothpaste for kids, but mine found this a bit too spicy.

It&#x27;s still good toothpaste, but my husband and I are the only ones who use it in our family.</li>
            <li> Bracing!  I&#x27;m a big fan of Tom&#x27;s of Maine&#x27;s policies and practices and their cruelty free products.  I&#x27;m also a big fan of a clean (and clean-feeling) mouth so when the Wicked Fresh dental care products came out I was extra thrilled.  I like the mouth wash too.  And did you know they make floss?</li>
            <li> This toothpaste makes your mouth feel fresh and also cleans your teeth well and I enjoy the peppermint flavor.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste. Have used it for years, and haven&#x27;t had any problems with my teeth, so I guess it works.</li>
            <li> We use nothing but Toms NON-whitening toothpaste.  If you have a tendency to get canker sores, give this product a try.</li>
            <li> The best darn toothpaste I ever used! Better that what the dentist offers! Has helped me control gingivitis for years. Thank you Tom&#x27;s of Maine, for making a superior product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to get away from chemicals in my food and in product I used. I switched to Tom&#x27;s and haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet! My teeth feel clean and breath is fresh lie any good working toothpaste. I will continue to buy toms until something better for the environment and for me comes along.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I never thought I&#x27;d come around and like a natural toothpaste, but this is a great product for skeptics. Taste and texture are great and I my sensitivity has all but gone away! So thankful for all you Amazon.com reviewers that I could find such a great product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite and the only toothpaste that I will use.  Some of the other Tom&#x27;s of Maine have metals in them.  I absolutely LOVE this for the taste.  I can smell it on my boyfriends breath from across the room!  Good smell, for sure!  Very minty, wonderful, and mentholy, in a good way.  Fresh breath!  wonderful taste.  I do not like the spearmint one at all!  The spearmint one is not good tasting or fresh breath, tingly, at all.  Sometimes, I have gotten the spearmint one and I  was just been very, very disappointed.  PEPPERMINT WICKED FRESH is awesome and the only one that I like!</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste with no whitening, very pepperminty and just slightly sweet.</li>
            <li> My favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know how good it is clinically but the taste is amazingly good. Stock up if the price is right</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t been able to find in stores here, anymore. Really like it.</li>
            <li> Very Healthy and refreshing!!</li>
            <li> Worst Toothpaste Ever. Does it SAY on the front that it&#x27;s LICORICE flavored? No.  That&#x27;s the dominant flavor, though.  Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! I really hate this toothpaste! Going back to my old reliable Tom&#x27;s peppermint toothpaste. Blech!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s products for more then 20 years. I normally purchase them at Whole Foods store, but I found it convenient to purchase on-line  (at the same price as brick store).&lt;br /&gt;As far as taste goes, you either like or not ( I happen to like it).&lt;br /&gt;I also think it is doing a decent job in avoiding dental issues.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite flavor in this brand. Cheaper price then at local grocery store. Tom&#x27;s products are fabulous. There is too much fluoride in public water. This fluoride-free toothpaste is the way to go!</li>
            <li> very thin texture, almost runny in fact.  last is ok but a little gritty.  Not my thing but if you like soft runny toothpaste with a bite !</li>
