            <li>I love this bag</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I bought it from amazon.</li>
            <li>I found many at retail stores, but never lower than $8 - I couldn&#x27;t see spending more on the bag than on the makeup.</li>
            <li>I love it  ðŸ’œ</li>
            <li>I was nervous at first when I ordered this because the price was so cheap, but it is a great item.</li>
            <li>m pretty happy you cant complain with it being so cheap and all  the shipping was about 4 or 5 days</li>

            <li>and  i  can  easily find  them.</li>
            <li>Its a makeup bag and its pretty nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute, but it has no support to keep it standing, so unless it&#x27;s completely full it just slouches.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it is fine and suits my need.</li>
            <li>I am able to fit full size brushes in there like my concealor and blush brush.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t keen on the color choices available, but I have no complaints after purchasing.</li>

            <li>I am able to store hair accessories in top &amp; makeup below, doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li>This cosmetics bag is so super cute and useful.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I bought two of them!</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the bottom compartment is kind of collapsing under the weight of the top.</li>
            <li>There is a really handy tiny mirror in the top compartment.</li>
            <li>Item was shipped and arrived a lot earlier than was stated, which is good.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of makeup, and I was able to fit nearly ALL of it into this cosmetic bag without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This thing is neat; I can keep loads of stuff in it, but when not so full, it kind of tends to accordion so that it stays as compact as possible at all times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking of buying several more to give as gifts!</li>
            <li>This is a great little make-up bag.  </li>
            <li>I think it was well worth the price though.</li>
            <li>not nearly as big as I thought it would be, but it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>The material was nice and the bag looks durable, but I think it is really tiny.</li>
            <li>but it was super smelly when I first received it.</li>
            <li>The design is clever and very useful.</li>
            <li>I really like this bag because It was able to hold my makeup and brushes it had a cute little mirror it came with</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very spacious!</li>
            <li>My only issue I have with it is that the weight of everything in the top seems to cause the bottom to fold in on itself.</li>
            <li>and it was exactly what I was hoping for..</li>
            <li>I keep all my cosmetics in bags (and pretty boxes/trains) as I don&#x27;t like them exposed to dust and</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was expecting to get.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly like the picture, is a satiny material.  </li>
            <li>and this does exactly that.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the few dollars if you need a nice medium sized cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li>Due to the low price I thought this make up bag would maybe not be that great.</li>
            <li>I never use it because I prefer to do my makeup with large mirrors or compacts)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not for a woman with a large selection of makeup.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s small enough to be so cute and handy.</li>
            <li>Item was decent size, sturdy, zippers worked well, color was exactly as shown on the picture.</li>
            <li>The little mirror comes in handy too.</li>
            <li>It took a little bit waiting to come in, but when it finally came it was great.</li>
            <li>Very Sturdy , fits a lot in it too.</li>
            <li>So fancy and cute to keep makeup and other items in.</li>
            <li>This was a little smaller than I expected, but it will work perfectly for traveling with my makeup.</li>
            <li>I had read the reviews for this makeup bag and decided to purchase because it looks cute over all, and I was in need of a new makeup bag since my other one was too full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has two compartments to separate your makeup, and the top compartment has a little mirror.</li>
            <li>Cute little bag.</li>
            <li>you will enjoy this put what every you like in the bottom my daughter puts make-up on the top zipper and bottom zipper makeup remover and other little things you would want to take with you on a vacation</li>
            <li>The two compartments easily separates my larger pieces (such as eyeshadow, blush..</li>
            <li>I love this little bag!</li>
            <li>The only minor issue about it is that it sags a little but other than that the quality is great!</li>
            <li>When I received it, thought wow</li>
            <li>Second, this is a very flimsy bag.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not even that much I keep in the top other than a few brushes and mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too large, just right for my small amount of makeup when traveling.</li>
            <li>sides are not stiff enough.</li>
            <li>It can also be used for young girls just starting to wear makeup.</li>
            <li>this is tiny but was surprised when I opened it up.</li>
            <li>After trying to use it for a couple of days, I switched back to my old bag and gave this to my daughter.</li>

            <li> And it&#x27;s small enough to be so cute and handy.</li>
            <li> Item was decent size, sturdy, zippers worked well, color was exactly as shown on the picture.</li>
            <li> The little mirror comes in handy too.</li>
            <li> It took a little bit waiting to come in, but when it finally came it was great.</li>
            <li> Very Sturdy , fits a lot in it too.</li>
            <li> So fancy and cute to keep makeup and other items in.</li>
            <li> This was a little smaller than I expected, but it will work perfectly for traveling with my makeup.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews for this makeup bag and decided to purchase because it looks cute over all, and I was in need of a new makeup bag since my other one was too full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has two compartments to separate your makeup, and the top compartment has a little mirror.</li>
            <li> Cute little bag.</li>
            <li> you will enjoy this put what every you like in the bottom my daughter puts make-up on the top zipper and bottom zipper makeup remover and other little things you would want to take with you on a vacation</li>
            <li> The two compartments easily separates my larger pieces (such as eyeshadow, blush..</li>
            <li> I love this little bag!</li>
            <li> The only minor issue about it is that it sags a little but other than that the quality is great!</li>
            <li> When I received it, thought wow</li>
            <li> Second, this is a very flimsy bag.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not even that much I keep in the top other than a few brushes and mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too large, just right for my small amount of makeup when traveling.</li>
            <li> sides are not stiff enough.</li>
            <li> It can also be used for young girls just starting to wear makeup.</li>
            <li> this is tiny but was surprised when I opened it up.</li>
            <li> After trying to use it for a couple of days, I switched back to my old bag and gave this to my daughter.</li>
            <li> Though it looks small, it&#x27;s spacy &amp; can hold a ton of make-up &amp; the second layer is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I became skeptical of it because it looked tiny, and I thought there was no way I&#x27;d fit all my makeup in it...</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> It arrived later than expected and severely smaller than expected.  </li>
            <li> Big enough for all of my makeup yet small enough to carry in my purse for short trips.  </li>
            <li> But when I purchased it I expected it to last longer.</li>
            <li> First, I was unaware that this was shipping from overseas, so waiting over a month was very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected.</li>
            <li> It was all I expected.  </li>
            <li> In the bottom compartment they can hold single eye shadows (as I have done), powders, small palettes or any other cosmetics that should be stored flat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This works extremely well as a travel case.</li>
            <li> It does not stand up like in the picture, nor does it have any type of bracing in it, it flops over and just gets smashed down.</li>
            <li> little  </li>
            <li> The lid portion have, I think, five little slots for you to slide brushes in and a band that keeps them there.  </li>
            <li> It is not too small and it holds lots of things.</li>
            <li> Might be a lil small for someone who has tons of make.</li>
            <li> This is not that small.</li>
            <li> Not  for  small!</li>
            <li> Will have to be used next year for Christmas. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this product at all.</li>
            <li> I was SO wrong!</li>
            <li> But it smelled bad</li>
            <li> So even though I was disappointed I can&#x27;t blame anyone but myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in the product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was nervous at first when I ordered this because the price was so cheap, but it is a great item. It is not too small and it holds lots of things. It even has the holders for make-up brushes!</li>
            <li> So I bought the bag thinking it was way bigger, until it got here of course. So even though I was disappointed I can&#x27;t blame anyone but myself. Besides for what it does hold its doing a good job. No complaints.</li>
            <li> At 7 bucks, this is a great value cosmetic case. It has two compartments to separate your makeup, and the top compartment has a little mirror. (disclaimer: I never use it because I prefer to do my makeup with large mirrors or compacts)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works extremely well as a travel case. However, don&#x27;t expect it to hold all your makeup especially if you&#x27;re a hoarder of makeup like I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit irking to me that it sort of collapses in on itself. It would&#x27;ve been nice if the case held itself up or had more support in it to maintain its shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this makeup case is a great value and does the job.</li>
            <li> Its a makeup bag and its pretty nice im not that picky its bigger then i thought it would be im pretty happy you cant complain with it being so cheap and all  the shipping was about 4 or 5 days</li>
            <li> Cute, great price, but very floppy... sides are not stiff enough.</li>
            <li> Works great but it was super smelly when I first received it.</li>
            <li> Love this bag!  I like the two separate spaces for cosmetics and toiletries!  Loved the price as well.  Took awhile to get to me since it was coming from China.</li>
            <li> I cut the mirror out because I would never use it and it was in the way.  This bag holds a lot and keeps it well organized.  It is my go to cosmetic bag for travel.</li>
            <li> Item was decent size, sturdy, zippers worked well, color was exactly as shown on the picture. Item did take a while to arrive, but overall item exceeded my expectations for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift. It was made well and will work perfectly for makeup. It will keep everything well organized. I liked this product a lot.</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than I expected. Seams already coming apart before I took it out of the plastic. I will see how durable it is....not counting on it though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute, but it has no support to keep it standing, so unless it&#x27;s completely full it just slouches.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very spacious! My only issue I have with it is that the weight of everything in the top seems to cause the bottom to fold in on itself. There&#x27;s not even that much I keep in the top other than a few brushes and mascara. Even when there&#x27;s nothing in the top at all, it still folds. I think it was well worth the price though.</li>
            <li> This is great for travelers or if you&#x27;re going on vacation and need something to put a couple of makeup items in. It can also be used for young girls just starting to wear makeup. Not for a woman with a large selection of makeup.</li>
            <li> This bag is great for travel and home use. There are pockets to hold everything you need. Certainly a great value</li>
            <li> This thing is neat; I can keep loads of stuff in it, but when not so full, it kind of tends to accordion so that it stays as compact as possible at all times. Being someone with an incessantly cluttered purse, I like that.</li>
            <li> Great size and the quality of it and the zippers seem really nice. Would recommend this to any one too</li>
            <li> Item was shipped and arrived a lot earlier than was stated, which is good. It wasn&#x27;t as big as I thought but it is big enough to hold all that I need. All in all a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Flimsy. Not really what I expected.</li>
            <li> This bag has two separate areas and holds a lot of stuff! I use it for cosmetics, but it would also be great for medications or whatever else you need a bag this size for. It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space and packs and stores easily. I&#x27;ve seen smaller, more expensive bags in local stores that can&#x27;t compare with this bag! I plan to purchase more for gifts. I wasn&#x27;t keen on the color choices available, but I have no complaints after purchasing.</li>
            <li> Great quality product for a very cheap price :) Very Sturdy , fits a lot in it too.Love it, Awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in the product.  It arrived later than expected and severely smaller than expected.  Will have to be used next year for Christmas. :(</li>
            <li> Love my make up bag,ready to travel just filling  it up will be fun it has 2 compartments&lt;br /&gt;Which gives you lots of room for brushes,polishes,soap,and has a mirror&lt;br /&gt;So you can power your nose!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for all my cosmetics,very fast delivery and it was exactly what I was hoping for..I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This was a little smaller than I expected, but it will work perfectly for traveling with my makeup. I love the colors and the fact that it ahs two separate sections.</li>
            <li> I love this little bag! It&#x27;s a quality steal! I&#x27;ve had mine for over 6 months, washed it a few times (in the sink with a dish brush), &amp; its still awesome. I carry it to work daily. The top holds some touch up makeup &amp; brushes. The bottom holds my snacks, vitamins, etc. The little mirror comes in handy too. I&#x27;m thinking of buying several more to give as gifts!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she seems to love it, good quality and holds plenty of her makeup.</li>
            <li> This is a cute bag. It&#x27;s nice and compact and holds lots of make up and brushes. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is because when I unboxed it the mirror had three cracks in it. I was very disappointed cause it was a nice mirror otherwise.</li>
            <li> This cosmetics bag is so super cute and useful. I love it so much I bought two of them! In the bottom compartment they can hold single eye shadows (as I have done), powders, small palettes or any other cosmetics that should be stored flat. The top compartment can hold pencils, brushes and lip glosses as I have placed mine. The design is clever and very useful. And it&#x27;s small enough to be so cute and handy. I keep all my cosmetics in bags (and pretty boxes/trains) as I don&#x27;t like them exposed to dust and these bags are a must have for me. Love, love, love them!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for a great price.  It looks better in person than it does in the pictures on the site.</li>
            <li> Quite handy and value priced... I thought it was going to be larger but it is still a good buy.</li>
            <li> I really like this bag because It was able to hold my makeup and brushes it had a cute little mirror it came with and it&#x27;s two parts to it so it&#x27;s really good it took a while to get it though</li>
            <li> When I received it, thought wow this is tiny but was surprised when I opened it up. Much larger than it looks. Holds more than you think it will.</li>
            <li> I received my bag weeks before the shipment date and I am extremely happy with this purchase!  Big enough for all of my makeup yet small enough to carry in my purse for short trips.  I will definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Not sturdy, fell apart after two months having it. But when I purchased it I expected it to last longer. But you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This is a great little make-up bag.  I love the two compartments to keep my lotions separate from my make-up/</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the bottom compartment is kind of collapsing under the weight of the top. Otherwise it is fine and suits my need.</li>
            <li> I love the bag it&#x27;s big and holds all of my make up. It&#x27;s a good traveling bag also. But it smelled bad so I have t air t out and them it was ok t use!</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews for this makeup bag and decided to purchase because it looks cute over all, and I was in need of a new makeup bag since my other one was too full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived I became skeptical of it because it looked tiny, and I thought there was no way I&#x27;d fit all my makeup in it...I was SO wrong! I have a lot of makeup, and I was able to fit nearly ALL of it into this cosmetic bag without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has sliding compartments for things such as lip gloss, eyeliner, concealer, etc...And two pouches for just about anything else. I love this bag and I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase. Recommended.</li>
            <li> not nearly as big as I thought it would be, but it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> The material was nice and the bag looks durable, but I think it is really tiny. That&#x27;s the problem, for people who want to put make up in it. The packaging was ok, but I think they should have placed it in a box since I ordered 4 of these bags.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this product at all. First, I was unaware that this was shipping from overseas, so waiting over a month was very frustrating. Second, this is a very flimsy bag. It does not stand up like in the picture, nor does it have any type of bracing in it, it flops over and just gets smashed down. After trying to use it for a couple of days, I switched back to my old bag and gave this to my daughter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my bag for a couple of months &amp; absolutely LOVE how mini and fashionable this item is. Though it looks small, it&#x27;s spacy &amp; can hold a ton of make-up &amp; the second layer is very convenient. The only minor issue about it is that it sags a little but other than that the quality is great! It&#x27;s got a nice feel(texture) &amp; very well put together.. I&#x27;m extremely satisfied :)</li>
            <li> Cute little bag. I plan on ahving it embroidered to give as a gift. Great price and durable. I would buy from this seller again</li>
            <li> Comfortable! Good  made! But.... for  big  bags! Not  for  small! I  like  it - all  my  cosmetic  little  things  i put in  and  i  can  easily find  them. They  all  are  here and  i  do  not need  to  look  for  them .</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a gift. It was exactly what I was expecting to get. The person I bought it for loved it!</li>
            <li> It took a little bit waiting to come in, but when it finally came it was great. Great find. I love that it has three compartments as well as a spot for brushes considering that I use brushes alot. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> Good for makeup and clothes.</li>
            <li> well constructed, I liked the 2 sections. I love polka dots. It was all I expected.  price was better than most comparable cosmetic bags.</li>
            <li> Due to the low price I thought this make up bag would maybe not be that great. But it is! It&#x27;s exactly like the picture, is a satiny material.  It seems to be well made, and has a lot of space.  There are even slots in the lid for brushes, etc.  There is a mirror inside as well. Totally worth the few dollars if you need a nice medium sized cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Wife loved it, great to put in all her &amp;#34;TONS&amp;#34; of nail polish!</li>
            <li> So fancy and cute to keep makeup and other items in. My niece loved this item and says she will use forever.</li>
            <li> Seller was prompt and price great bought this for my daughter she loved it and holds all your makeup a comb and brush you  will enjoy this product color was nice feels silky you will enjoy this put what every you like in the bottom my daughter puts make-up on the top zipper and bottom zipper makeup remover and other little things you would want to take with you on a vacation</li>
            <li> This is a very nice cosmetic bag.  it has plenty of room for all your makeup.  I love the two compartments.  i am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this bag.  The two compartments easily separates my larger pieces (such as eyeshadow, blush..etc) and smaller pieces (pencils, tweezers, yaa know) from jumbling together making easier to find and organize stuff.  I was looking for something convenient for me to just grab and go when I needed while keeping my makeup brushes safe and this does exactly that.  The lid portion have, I think, five little slots for you to slide brushes in and a band that keeps them there.  I am able to fit full size brushes in there like my concealor and blush brush.</li>
            <li> This kit was just what i needed. I&#x27;m glad that I bought it from amazon. It perfectly holds all my make-up items in the two compartments. There is a really handy tiny mirror in the top compartment. The kit is made of a good quality material with an easy zip system. If you are looking for a kit to arrange your make-up items or your jewelry, then look no further! This could be just what you need!!</li>
            <li> Good make up bag for the amount of stuff I have. Might be a lil small for someone who has tons of make. Does well for my stuff.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for a cheap but good quality makeup bag. I found many at retail stores, but never lower than $8 - I couldn&#x27;t see spending more on the bag than on the makeup. Quality of bag was impressive for the price - it&#x27;s a very cute bag. I am able to store hair accessories in top &amp; makeup below, doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. It&#x27;s not too large, just right for my small amount of makeup when traveling.</li>
            <li> This is not that small. It&#x27;s a cute and can fit in your purse. I love it  ðŸ’œ</li>
