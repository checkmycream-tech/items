            <li> My only suggestions would be to offer it in a larger size and the cost is rather high for no more than you get.</li>
            <li> Totally fills in grey roots, washes away when you shampoo.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to ship.</li>
            <li> Superior product to color base of hair in-between coloring hair.</li>
            <li> Should have gotten the dark blonde but it does work.  </li>

            <li> hair is medium brown and where I spray the product it looks black.</li>
            <li> Buying this product on Amazon is half the price of buying it at the salon.</li>
            <li> I used to use fillers that you shake on and it gets really messy.</li>
            <li> You have to spray it so heavy to see any color</li>
            <li> Maybe if you are trying to cover gray roots, made my hair stiff and it looked like I used spray paint.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to anyone that needs a little volume added to their hair!</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair and my scalp shows big time!</li>
            <li> Not like powder type of products which I do not like because they change the texture of hair and looks dull.</li>
            <li> and then to fill in a thin spot, it makes the hair have a film on it.</li>

            <li> I love this spray! I have very thin hair and my scalp shows big time! I used to use fillers that you shake on and it gets really messy. This spray is easy to use and covers well. My only suggestions would be to offer it in a larger size and the cost is rather high for no more than you get.</li>
            <li> Seems I have to spray quite a bit in order to get the desired effect.  I do not like the mist that is emitted when I spray as I wonder what effect it has on me health wise.  The product does rub off on my pillow.  The benefit is it does conceal well once you spray enough product. It does give an appearance of thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Worked exactly as I expected...it is a great product to use when you want to stretch times between hair appointments.. My daughter also uses it and she can&#x27;t say enough good things about it....we used this product mostly to cover the gray but it does help make our hair  look a little thicker but don&#x27;t expect miracles ....</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!!! I hope it is always available!</li>
            <li> Not sticky, covers well, doesn&#x27;t seem to rub off on pillow-case.  I have light brown hair with a lot of blonde highlights and the medium/light brown was a good match for my roots.  Does make your part less noticeable.  Lets me stretch the time between hair color appointments out another 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me.  You have to spray it so heavy to see any color and then to fill in a thin spot, it makes the hair have a film on it.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product. I intend to order it again and again. I truly recommend this product for any one wiith extrafine and/or thining hair. LOve IT !! I would love to have reorder info at my fingertips so that I do not risk the danger of runnning out. My hairdresser is in awe of the results.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Totally fills in grey roots, washes away when you shampoo. It&#x27;s a really great product, reasonably priced as well.</li>
            <li> This product is really great!  It easily covers grey, sprays on easily, makes hair seem fuller, feels and looks natural!  I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> The New! Style Edit doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as the older one.  I find myself having to spray more to cover the grey.  I loved the older one.</li>
            <li> I do like this hair filler, it does the job very well, except the Medium/Light Brown looks like black when sprayed on your head.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is medium brown and where I spray the product it looks black.</li>
            <li> Love it ,makes your hair fuller</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to cover roots between coloring, and also great to camouflage exposed scalp due to thinning hatr</li>
            <li> Great product when you need a little lift! Would recommend this product to anyone that needs a little volume added to their hair!</li>
            <li> Perfect for those desperate for root color!  I use when my roots need a touch up and I have no time to get to the salon. This is great coverage and does not run.  Usually lasts until the next hair wash!</li>
            <li> Product is really good. Took a long time to ship. But overall would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for touching up roots between salon visits. Women who color their hair look unkempt when the roots are visible to all and Style edit eliminates this problem very well. It is easy to apply and washes out.</li>
            <li> Should have gotten the dark blonde but it does work.  Comes out easily with brushing or washing.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you are trying to cover gray roots, made my hair stiff and it looked like I used spray paint. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Covers well and is odorless. I would not use this product during the warm weather months. I have a tendency to sweat when I am out in the heat and this product will run and/or come off on your hand or a towel if you touch it to your head.</li>
            <li> Works great. Doesn&#x27;t flake or feel yucky.  Working with it is like hairspray with coloring to it.  You spray it on your roots and it makes your thinning hair and wide part look full again.  Nice to forget about your thinning hair for a while!</li>
            <li> This product is AWESOME per my wife. She hopes this product continues to be available.</li>
            <li> Superior product to color base of hair in-between coloring hair. Not like powder type of products which I do not like because they change the texture of hair and looks dull. This product sprays on your hair and has the same texture as hair. It also gives extra body to your hair. Although it washes out easily, it does not rub off your hair easily between washings. Buying this product on Amazon is half the price of buying it at the salon.</li>
            <li> It is great!  It fills in the thin areas of my hair and matches the color nicely.  It does NOT crumble, itch, or come off until is wash it out.  It is easy to apply and does not go on too thick or clumpy.  I like it for coloring roots, too (even though that is not its primary purpose).</li>
