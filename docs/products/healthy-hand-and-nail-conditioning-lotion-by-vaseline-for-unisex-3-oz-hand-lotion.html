            <li>He likes it because it is not greasy and isn&#x27;t overly perfumed, so it is good for men as well as women !</li>
            <li>Use a good nail hardner</li>
            <li>And use a good nail polish remover with strengthening  enriched with protein equate and cutex remover is good</li>
            <li>This is a good hand lotion.</li>
            <li>I have been using Vaseline &amp;#34;Healthy Hand &amp; Nail&amp;#34; since the nineties, and I always absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered more of this great product.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion!</li>
            <li>sure hope this product is never discontinued!</li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>Nails and hands are nicely conditioned, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that they&#x27;re &amp;</li>
            <li>It is very light, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li>However, it used to be better.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if the manufacture no longer made it or not, but when I looked on Amazon, I was relieved to find this product.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the primary reason I really love this lotion and</li>
            <li>Needless to say I was so happy to see that it would be very easy to purchase it from Amazon now!!</li>
            <li>The scent is simply amazing and makes hands sooooo soft.</li>
            <li>.You will see great results and your nails will be brick hard and healthy.</li>
            <li>I was having a problem finding it, but when I checked on-line I was advised that it was available at Amazon and at a very comparable price!  </li>
            <li>and right before you go to bed amazing results within days your nails are healthy hard and strong.</li>
            <li>Hard to find in store, but absolutely the best.</li>
            <li>This product is very good and is the only product that has worked for my husband&#x27;s dry hands and skin.</li>
            <li>It also seems to help the nails to grow faster and healthier, which is a real benefit for me!</li>
            <li>I use the vaseline Iotion first, poke a hole with pin in the vitamin E pill to release the oil rubbed it on my cuticles all over my nails.</li>
            <li>I recently ran out of my supply and had to buy more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I do really like the lotion!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years and for some reason they cut back on distributing to certain locations.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it is Amazing.</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of the new scent, and the product smells more strongly in general.  </li>
            <li>The new formula is slightly more greasy and the scent is a bit different.  </li>
            <li>This product really seems to help strengthen nails.</li>
            <li>This stuff really helps, both hands and nails.  </li>
            <li>After 2 weeks, my nails don&#x27;t flake at all, and if I chip them, the whole nail doesn&#x27;t peel off.</li>
            <li>This lotion works if you really follow the steps in how I use the lotion.</li>
            <li>And do not change your polish so much every two weeks</li>
            <li>It really is something to use for your hands and&lt;br /&gt;nails.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really say that it was this lotion alone that made my nails stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is subtle but nice, and it rubs it much more quickly than other lotions.</li>
            <li>why I&#x27;d highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>Lotion is very moisturizing and leaves a nice, subtle scent on hands.</li>
            <li>My cuticles now look normal...</li>
            <li>which I was very surprised, because I like the Vaseline products a lots and always use them</li>
            <li>should add that this hand lotion gets absorbed by the skin faster than just about any other product I have tried, but not as fast as the old formula.  </li>
            <li>I have some for Very dry skin on the sides of my index fingers, that it doesn&#x27;t quiet get smooth, but I&#x27;ve never found a lotion to cure it.</li>
            <li>Since using this for 2 weeks my nails are growing and are stronger and have completely stopped splitting.  </li>
            <li>this Vaseline product completely resolved the issue.  </li>
            <li>I have a sensitive nose and tend to buy products based on scent, so this matters to</li>
            <li>It does heal dry skin fast, though!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This product is very good and is the only product that has worked for my husband&#x27;s dry hands and skin. He likes it because it is not greasy and isn&#x27;t overly perfumed, so it is good for men as well as women ! It also seems to help the nails to grow faster and healthier, which is a real benefit for me!</li>
            <li> I just ordered more of this great product.  Hard to find in store, but absolutely the best.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this product.  Does what it says.  I will reorder as long as I can find it!</li>
            <li> I liked it but I became allergic to it. My hands  break out from it which I was very surprised, because I like the Vaseline products a lots and always use them but this I had to stop go back using the Vaseline with the Aloe Vera.</li>
            <li> This product really seems to help strengthen nails.</li>
            <li> Use this constantly after washing dishes.  This stuff really helps, both hands and nails.  But cannot find in stores anymore, so stockpiled from Amazon.  Will miss this if I can&#x27;t get it in the future.</li>
            <li> I have the most pathetic nails that constantly flake and break off, often making them no longer than the end of my fingertips. I could tell a difference with this lotion after a week, my nails were longer, faster, and much harder to break. After 2 weeks, my nails don&#x27;t flake at all, and if I chip them, the whole nail doesn&#x27;t peel off. I LOVE this lotion. It has a very subtle smell, that even my boyfriend with his super smelly senses can deal with and use. It is very light, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. The only downside is  I have some for Very dry skin on the sides of my index fingers, that it doesn&#x27;t quiet get smooth, but I&#x27;ve never found a lotion to cure it. Other than that it is Amazing.</li>
            <li> Since using this for 2 weeks my nails are growing and are stronger and have completely stopped splitting.  I apply this lotion sparingly about 4-5 times a day</li>
            <li> This lotion works if you really follow the steps in how I use the lotion.I purchase also some vitamin E pills the gel capsule.I use the vaseline Iotion first, poke a hole with pin in the vitamin E pill to release the oil rubbed it on my cuticles all over my nails.I took the pill after I squeeze all the oil out and rubbed it under each nails I always use 2 capsules.Do this in the morning and right before you go to bed amazing results within days your nails are healthy hard and strong.Use a good nail hardner it doesnt matter what brand .Put nail hardner on your nails every other day. And keep hands moisture with this lotion especially after washing hands.Please wear gloves when washing dishes or dealing with cleaning.And do not change your polish so much every two weeks and if color of polish start to come off just retouch it over and use nail hardner.And use a good nail polish remover with strengthening  enriched with protein equate and cutex remover is good .You will see great results and your nails will be brick hard and healthy.</li>
            <li> I use it every night and my nails are slowly improving.</li>
            <li> For years I have suffered with super-dry, cracking cuticles.  I have tried various solutions including vitamin E oil...which helped a little.&lt;br /&gt;But this Vaseline product completely resolved the issue.  My cuticles now look normal...no longer sore...not cracking...fully healed!  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and for some reason they cut back on distributing to certain locations.  I was having a problem finding it, but when I checked on-line I was advised that it was available at Amazon and at a very comparable price!  Needless to say I was so happy to see that it would be very easy to purchase it from Amazon now!!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time, and if you use this faithfully&lt;br /&gt;it is very good for your nails, and it does make them much&lt;br /&gt;stronger!! It really is something to use for your hands and&lt;br /&gt;nails.</li>
            <li> The lotion keeps my hands extremely soft and moisturized, however, I am not really fond of the smell.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this stuff anymore, what gives?! The scent is simply amazing and makes hands sooooo soft.</li>
            <li> This is a good hand lotion. However, it used to be better.  I have been using Vaseline &amp;#34;Healthy Hand &amp; Nail&amp;#34; since the nineties, and I always absolutely loved it.  I recently ran out of my supply and had to buy more.  I noticed the packaging was different but I assumed the formula was still the same.  Alas, it is not.  The new formula is slightly more greasy and the scent is a bit different.  I am not a fan of the new scent, and the product smells more strongly in general.  I have a sensitive nose and tend to buy products based on scent, so this matters to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that this hand lotion gets absorbed by the skin faster than just about any other product I have tried, but not as fast as the old formula.  What a shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The change in formula might have taken place at any point in the past five years or so, it has taken me that long to get through my previous supply.  Even though I am unhappy about the change, I will continue to buy this product as it is still superior to other brands.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Hate the smell. It reminds me of self-tanning lotion. It does heal dry skin fast, though!</li>
            <li> I used this lotion in the past, and it really did help strengthen my nails and allow them to grow longer.  In the past year or so, I began having problems with my nails splitting and chipping, and they seemed much thinner.  I went into local stores to purchase this item, and I was dismayed to discover I could no longer find this product.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if the manufacture no longer made it or not, but when I looked on Amazon, I was relieved to find this product.  I like this product especially because it does not leave my hands feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the three-pack option, and each tube arrived with the cap taped shut to help prevent leaking from the tubes during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I sure hope this product is never discontinued!</li>
            <li> Lotion is very moisturizing and leaves a nice, subtle scent on hands. Nails and hands are nicely conditioned, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that they&#x27;re &amp;#34;10x stronger&amp;#34;. I have been looking for a non-greasy option to moisturize my hands and strengthen my nails, and this seems to be it. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Now, it advertises that your nails will be 10x stronger in 2 weeks...that&#x27;s just silly. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month, and while I would say that my nails are stronger, they&#x27;re obviously not 10x stronger. I&#x27;ve also been taking supplements and using cuticle oils (I&#x27;m a guitar player who uses nails for playing) so I can&#x27;t really say that it was this lotion alone that made my nails stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do really like the lotion! The smell is subtle but nice, and it rubs it much more quickly than other lotions. After applying, my hands will feel moisturized for hours, but the grease is gone within 3 minutes. That&#x27;s the primary reason I really love this lotion and why I&#x27;d highly recommend it to others.</li>
