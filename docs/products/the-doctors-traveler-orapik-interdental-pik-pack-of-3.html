            <li> Had a hard time find them they work great</li>
            <li> Great to have in toiletry bag when you travel.</li>
            <li> Always have one in my pocket or nearby when at home relaxing.</li>
            <li> I have looked for the travel pact for acouple years, everywhere I went, in the hygiene section of various stores, I finally decided to check in line and found it!! Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> very well as the first time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found these on Amazon since I can no longer find them in stores.  These are perfect to carry on your keychain  or in your purse.  Just the right size to get between teeth when even a toothpick can&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve stocked up!</li>
            <li> These are the best! I&#x27;ve had one for years, but couldn&#x27;t find them anymore. A friend found them for me on Amazon. I was so excited to order them. My dental hygienist always tells me how good my teeth are doing and to keep doing it. I think the traveler pick has attributed to my oral health care.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for about 15 years and used to get them at Walmart. They are the best that I have seen and used.</li>
            <li> i had purchased something similar for a drug store and apparently none of the stores carry these type of products anymore. I was so happy to be able to find them here and I have to say that they are better than the ones I had before. I love the little chain on it because I can hook it to my purse. Great product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great pic for all around use!  This limit on the amount of words required is stupid!  Just plain Stupid!  What else can be said about a toothpick?</li>
            <li> I bought enough to put one at home, in my purse  and in my car. This is a hygienic toothpick.</li>
            <li> Great product that I always keep with me.  Great for folks with dental bridges or  teeth that tend to retain food.  More effective than a standard wooden toothpick.</li>
            <li> Great Service.  Quickly sent hee.  Just what I wanted, and have been looking for.</li>
            <li> We lost our old one. Vital to dining out.&lt;br /&gt;I desperation I sought to find a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;And this was great. 2/pack X 3packs &#x3D; 6 picks!&lt;br /&gt;Ha, it&#x27;ll take me a week or two before I lose that many ;-(</li>
            <li> I lost my last tartar pick when we moved.  Found these on amazon and ordered!  Love the size!  Small and easy to maneuver.  I keep one in both bathrooms and one in my luggage for travel!  Perfect and affordable and really convenient!  Great purchase with no regrets!  It feels so good to have my teeth feel like I just had the dental hygienist clean my teeth!</li>
            <li> Love using the OraPik!</li>
            <li> Been using them for years. Keep one in my car and use it while I&#x27;m driving.</li>
            <li> Great traveling accessory</li>
            <li> Love these piks.  They are convenient to have in the car, backpack, purse, medicine cabinet.  Strong.  They do not bend out of shape.  Caps stay on securely.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I keep one in my car and one in my purse.</li>
            <li> I had one of these a while back and when the cap finally cracked, which is the part attached to the keyring, the pick kept falling into my purse and eventually I lost it.  I was really disapointed.  It hit me like a big DUH that one can find anything on Amazon.  Cheap, Prime shipping, what could be better?  I bought the 3 pack, and each pack has 2.  I should be good to go for a long time and have one at work, and one on each purse and some to spare.  I hate getting popcorn stuck in my teeth and have a couple of food traps in between molars, so with a little discretion, you can use these to take care of problem like that with this handy little device.</li>
            <li> Extremely portable along with multi-pack convenience for scraping plaque build up from teeth. Lost my old one I used for years but found the same still available online. I keep one in my medicine cabinet and another in my travel pack.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much. I love these picks and can not find them in any of the stores around me. The price was great and I now have extras to stash for when I lose one. The shipping was quick and a hassle free purchase all the way around. Thank you again. Erin Bearden, Allyn WA</li>
            <li> As described. On time.</li>
            <li> Just love these travel piks.......getting hard to find in drug stores. A+++++++++++</li>
            <li> These are great to scrape plaque between cleanings</li>
