            <li>and it still feel fresh and the cooling sensation is still there!!!</li>
            <li>Before it would break very easily.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I realized how good it was!  </li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>and she found something better for her type of  hair</li>
            <li>but once the cleaner touched my skullcap and settled in I felt the most refreshing/cooling feeling ever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t need to use as many pumps as suggested.</li>
            <li>Read more</li>
            <li>I love WEN.</li>
            <li>I love Lavender Wen and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that my scalp felt more oily and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Read more</li>
            <li>Better.</li>
            <li>... Read more</li>
            <li>So she recommended a bunch of different conditioners and treatments - none of which impressed me.</li>
            <li>Read more</li>
            <li>I had never used Lavender before and it is the best for my baby fine long hair.</li>
            <li>As other users have found, 3 to 4 pumps of this works just perfect.</li>
            <li>Plus you could easily get away with not washing your hair every day -</li>
            <li>It was easy to work all the cleansing conditioner in my hair</li>
            <li>hair is now so strong and shiny.</li>
            <li>and I found it a bit too strong.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this shampoo I thought it was amazing</li>
            <li>I use 3 pumps for my fine medium length hair.</li>
            <li>Smells great, makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>Wen has made a huge difference there.</li>
            <li>However, this is one important note that should be considered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this product so much I am going to get it as Christmas gifts for all my friends and family - guys and dolls!</li>
            <li>I have curly/ wavy hair and was so excited to use this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using WEN for years and it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>On the 3rd day, I notice my hair feels more more oily, so another Wen Cleansing is required.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, my hair was curly!</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair and have found this product to be very good.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally fine straight hair - which I braid after washing to put volume in; using a couple pumps on WEN as a leave-in-conditioner</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times but my hair feels amazing.</li>
            <li>my hair looks an styles very well, the volume and body is fantastic and frizz is smoothed.</li>
            <li>It smelt good, but really no different from a normal conditioner to me.</li>
            <li>I thought it was my imagination until I  went to my best friends house a few hours later</li>
            <li>If you have oily hair or hair that tends to become oily very fast....</li>
            <li>Been using Wen for several years now and love the product.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time ordering the lavender</li>
            <li>used for several years now ,really love the stuff</li>
            <li>I came to Amazon to check out the reviews and bought the 3oz bottles at first.</li>
            <li>I first tried WEN, there was no immediate change.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t as diluted as first bottles.</li>
            <li>I have used the Wen Cleansing Conditioner (Lavender) for 10 months and have found Wen does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first and second days after I use Wen (I wash every 3 days--any more than that is too drying)</li>
            <li>NEVER has my hair grown this long or this healthy before.</li>
            <li>It is also super soft and my girls look effortless.</li>
            <li>I figured out that the recommended use was WAAAY to much.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t change my hair at all.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d keep using it because of the price until I went back to my old shampoo to use up the bottle.</li>
            <li>( after years of being bleached I have stepped down to partial foiling) and I find the Wen Cleansing Conditioner works fantastically; I massage a decent amount into my hair and leave on about 10 minuets (good time to shave) then use somewhat cool water to raise.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but minus a star for incorrect ambiguous instructions!</li>
            <li>I also make sure my hair is very wet when i put the cleanser in.</li>
            <li>have medium long hair that is processed to a light beige blond</li>
            <li>and it is true that this product does not strip the dye out of your hair like traditional shampoos.</li>
            <li>I have more normal to dry hair but my scalp gets oily from shampoo stripping out the natural oils.</li>
            <li>Not  what I expected went back to my own shampoo.</li>
            <li>Not only giving me absolutely clean, soft hair, but saving me time and money!  </li>
            <li>I have very long wavy to curly hair and was originally using the recommended amount (24 pumps).</li>
            <li>Well worth the initial cost for this product.</li>
            <li>So the next time I washed, I put about a nickel&#x27;s worth of it on my hair after rinsing.</li>
            <li>and I live it in while finishing my shower or shaving my legs.</li>
            <li>I pretty much dye my hair monthly and my ends used to be dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>I notice a difference after the first try every time I get back on this</li>
            <li>This fragrance is specifically for fine and limp hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is also really really straight and wants to part right down the middle no matter what I do.</li>
            <li>Before WEN, it had been getting gradually more and more frizzy, to the point where I was convinced that I just had bad hair.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my hair was with wen.</li>
            <li>I also have wavy natural hair and this shampoo maintains my moisture, rather than drying it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Wen products for about 5 months now and have completely stopped using shampoo.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted naturally curly hair, but I could never achieve it.</li>
            <li>you wake up with hair just as clean and soft as when you laid down to sleep that night!  </li>
            <li>I do not use this product as a leave in conditioner because it adds to much weight to my hair making it look flat.</li>
            <li>I only use the Herbal Essence for the first wash and finish the second with the Wen product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>does not dry out your hair leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Once I started doing this my hair was turning out silky and light and not sticky and dull.</li>
            <li>skullcap had been feeling dry and Itchy due to me being pregnant</li>
            <li>After first wash my hair was OK, but after the second time it became really dry, very frizzy, and impossible to manage.</li>
            <li>I cut that down to 8 pumps for the first wash and 5-6 for the second wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fine and thin that I have to style it carefully to cover a couple really sparse spots.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, chin-length hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair that has a tendency to feel weighed down and heavy, with very little body.</li>

            <li> I have fine, thin, chin-length hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair that has a tendency to feel weighed down and heavy, with very little body.</li>
            <li> (fine hair just loves to develop big snarls), and now I only loose about 12 strands; before using WEN I would loose at least twice that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the product after the first few uses because my hair didn&#x27;t feel like it was clean.</li>
            <li> Also the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It also has a tendancy to just lie flat against my skull with no movement</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s expensive, but it does wonders for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> All the past hairspray and product I use was cleaned out completely from my hair!  </li>
            <li> if your hair is dry like mine it works well.</li>
            <li> my hair was really dry - which was leading to breakage (and even thinner hair).</li>
            <li> I never found one that didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, make it a greasy mess by the end of the day, or make it so soft that I couldn&#x27;t do anything with it.</li>
            <li> The only thing about this product is that is a little pricy.</li>
            <li> Left my hair a little greasy.</li>
            <li> I have to comb out my wet hair with my fingers</li>
            <li> I bought this several months ago, used it a few times, and decided I didnt like it.</li>
            <li> This product came in a speedy fashion and was everything I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Be careful using this product.  </li>
            <li> When I saw Chaz&#x27;s presentation on QVC, though, I became curious - especial...</li>
            <li> Everyone on the infomercial had either long, thick or ethnic hair - the opposite of me.</li>
            <li> I used as directed and it left my hair as greasy or greaser than it usually is.  </li>
            <li> Will never use any other product again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like straw with my other shampoo!</li>
            <li> $30 down the drain without a doubt!</li>
            <li> But after I used it a few times, I don&#x27;t recommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li> After showering and washing my hair with this product the 4th time I blow dried my hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I can&#x27;t recommend the product as directed, I stand firmly behind this product in my current routine!</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> when i  ran out of my usual shampoo, i tried the wen again, and this time did NOT follow the instructions (24 pumps?</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would pay that price to reorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is unbelievably fried and damaged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decreased the frequency with which I use Wen to once or twice a week and use an organic shampoo and conditioner the other days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been unimpressed with my hair dull and frizzy.</li>
            <li> WEN Lavender has allowed me to cleanse my hair only once a week now; and I do not get that tender scalp/hair feeling when your hair gets too dirty</li>
            <li> Splits ends are no more!</li>

            <li> As other users have found, 3 to 4 pumps of this works just perfect. I have naturally fine straight hair - which I braid after washing to put volume in; using a couple pumps on WEN as a leave-in-conditioner actually seems to make the curl hold longer.  WEN Lavender has allowed me to cleanse my hair only once a week now; and I do not get that tender scalp/hair feeling when your hair gets too dirty - I am amazed.  I will wet/rinse my hair if I have been working in the yard, then 2 pumps of this as a leave-in-conditioner works wonders. I have to comb out my wet hair with my fingers (fine hair just loves to develop big snarls), and now I only loose about 12 strands; before using WEN I would loose at least twice that.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for 3 months now and my hair has grown almost to my waist, about 5 inches. NEVER has my hair grown this long or this healthy before. Well worth the initial cost for this product.</li>
            <li> Smells great, makes my hair super soft. I wish it tamed flyaways and frizz. Didn&#x27;t for me. Also the scent doesn&#x27;t last long. I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d keep using it because of the price until I went back to my old shampoo to use up the bottle. Couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my hair was with wen. It&#x27;s like straw with my other shampoo!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been using it for about six months and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I dye my hair a lot and it is true that this product does not strip the dye out of your hair like traditional shampoos. I also have wavy natural hair and this shampoo maintains my moisture, rather than drying it out.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair and have found this product to be very good.  I have to use a smaller amount than the directions call for because it makes my hair too greasy otherwise.  It does condition well, so if your hair is dry like mine it works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen products for about 5 months now and have completely stopped using shampoo. I was skeptical about the product after the first few uses because my hair didn&#x27;t feel like it was clean. After trying different ways of using Wen I figured out that the recommended use was WAAAY to much. I have very long wavy to curly hair and was originally using the recommended amount (24 pumps). I cut that down to 8 pumps for the first wash and 5-6 for the second wash. I do not use this product as a leave in conditioner because it adds to much weight to my hair making it look flat.The only thing about this product is that is a little pricy. To help with the cost I use Herbal essence version of cleansing every 2 washes. I only use the Herbal Essence for the first wash and finish the second with the Wen product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is now so strong and shiny. Before it would break very easily. It is also super soft and my girls look effortless.</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever!  Use sparingly...it&#x27;s expensive, but it does wonders for my fine hair.  This fragrance is specifically for fine and limp hair.  If you invest in the Conair 1875 hair dryer...they work well together. My hair is not oily like it used to be and I don&#x27;t have hair in the drain.  Splits ends are no more!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!! It does everything for your hair that is advertised!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this product. Leaves my hair soft. Cannot honestly say it maintains the hair color but it&#x27;s possible mine fades with the sun</li>
            <li> Been using Wen for several years now and love the product.  This was my first time ordering the lavender and I found it a bit too strong.</li>
            <li> Not  what I expected went back to my own shampoo.</li>
            <li> Ok, this is the absolutely BEST! hair product I have ever used!!!  Not only giving me absolutely clean, soft hair, but saving me time and money!  The first time I used it I realized how good it was!  All the past hairspray and product I use was cleaned out completely from my hair!  No more buying two products and taking the time to shampoo, rinse, and then condition, rinse my hair!  Plus you could easily get away with not washing your hair every day - you wake up with hair just as clean and soft as when you laid down to sleep that night!  I love this product so much I am going to get it as Christmas gifts for all my friends and family - guys and dolls!</li>
            <li> I got this product about two weeks ago  from a friend that comes to the place I work at and she said she stopped using it because her hair is too thin and she found something better for her type of  hair therefore she gave three bottles.....&lt;br /&gt;my skullcap had been feeling dry and Itchy due to me being pregnant so I decided why not take a bath and try this cleansing conditioner I never use the amount they say to use because it&#x27;s just me but once the cleaner touched my skullcap and settled in I felt the most refreshing/cooling feeling ever. I have been out of the tub/shower for about 35 minutes and it still feel fresh and the cooling sensation is still there!!! I love it !!</li>
            <li> I bought the Wen Lavender conditioner from Sephora.  I have curly/ wavy hair and was so excited to use this product.  But after I used it a few times, I don&#x27;t recommend this for anyone. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY! This is one of the WORST hair products I have ever come across.  After first wash my hair was OK, but after the second time it became really dry, very frizzy, and impossible to manage. $30 down the drain without a doubt!</li>
            <li> used for several years now ,really love the stuff</li>
            <li> I bought this several months ago, used it a few times, and decided I didnt like it. when i  ran out of my usual shampoo, i tried the wen again, and this time did NOT follow the instructions (24 pumps? Are you kidding?) and got the results I was expecting.  Chaz himself says 3 to 4 pumps so I dont know why the instructions on the bottle say double digits. I use 3 pumps for my fine medium length hair. 3 pumps! Not 33. I also make sure my hair is very wet when i put the cleanser in. Emulsifying it with water is the key. Once I started doing this my hair was turning out silky and light and not sticky and dull. I pretty much dye my hair monthly and my ends used to be dry and brittle. Wen has made a huge difference there. I love this product, but minus a star for incorrect ambiguous instructions!</li>
            <li> I bought this when it was on sale so I didn&#x27;t pay the $36 price. Not sure if I would pay that price to reorder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I LOVE this product. I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times but my hair feels amazing. I have fine straight hair that has a tendency to feel weighed down and heavy, with very little body. I have more normal to dry hair but my scalp gets oily from shampoo stripping out the natural oils. My hair is also really really straight and wants to part right down the middle no matter what I do. It also has a tendancy to just lie flat against my skull with no movement whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to take this for a test drive and see if it worked and it did. I have an angled bob that falls just under my chin so my hair is short and I didn&#x27;t need to use as many pumps as suggested. (I only use 5 pumps each for the back and sides of my hair rather than 10). It was easy to work all the cleansing conditioner in my hair and I live it in while finishing my shower or shaving my legs. It&#x27;s e... Read more</li>
            <li> Great product. I love WEN. I had switched to another simular product because of the price but it did not compare to WEN.&lt;br /&gt;Also I had never used Lavender before and it is the best for my baby fine long hair. Will keep using.</li>
            <li> I used as directed and it left my hair as greasy or greaser than it usually is.  I did like the tingly feeling and the smell of it though.</li>
            <li> I love Lavender Wen and have been using it for years. This product came in a speedy fashion and was everything I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> LOVE Wen products! Will never use any other product again. The lavender smells soooo good!!!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this after seeing the infomercial. I came to Amazon to check out the reviews and bought the 3oz bottles at first. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money, and I definitely didn&#x27;t want to get enrolled in a monthly payment plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair. Before WEN, it had been getting gradually more and more frizzy, to the point where I was convinced that I just had bad hair. It was depressing, and I was desperate for something that would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried WEN, there was no immediate change. I decided to chalk it up to another product that failed to deliver. I also noticed that my scalp felt more oily and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw the infomercial again and realized I was not using it as a leave-in conditioner. So the next time I washed, I put about a nickel&#x27;s worth of it on my hair after rinsing. That&#x27;s when I noticed a difference. For the first time in my life, my hair was curly! I&#x27;ve always wanted naturally curly hair, but I could never achieve it. I can&#x27;t use a curli... Read more</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as diluted as first bottles. Better. Still did not have seal</li>
            <li> Left my hair a little greasy.</li>
            <li> I have used the Wen Cleansing Conditioner (Lavender) for 10 months and have found Wen does exactly what it claims. However, this is one important note that should be considered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium long hair that is processed to a light beige blond ( after years of being bleached I have stepped down to partial foiling) and I find the Wen Cleansing Conditioner works fantastically; I massage a decent amount into my hair and leave on about 10 minuets (good time to shave) then use somewhat cool water to raise. The texture immediately feels smoother, silky, and easier to run my fingers or a comb through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first and second days after I use Wen (I wash every 3 days--any more than that is too drying) my hair looks an styles very well, the volume and body is fantastic and frizz is smoothed. On the 3rd day, I notice my hair feels more more oily, so another Wen Cleansing is required. After 4-5 weeks I&#x27;ve decided to use a clarifying shampoo to wash my hair (something without sulfates) and then a... Read more</li>
            <li> does not dry out your hair leaves it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using WEN for years and it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this shampoo I thought it was amazing but by the 2nd - 4th time I wanted to cry.  If you have oily hair or hair that tends to become oily very fast.... DO NOT use this shampoo.  After showering and washing my hair with this product the 4th time I blow dried my hair and it was instantly oily.  I thought it was my imagination until I  went to my best friends house a few hours later and she said, I thought you were going to shower and wash your hair after we hung up? I told her I did, and she replied, hun it looks like you haven&#x27;t washed your hair in weeks.  Be careful using this product.  I am on week 2 of using Suave for oily hair and am just now starting to get a handle on the oil situation.</li>
            <li> I notice a difference after the first try every time I get back on this</li>
            <li> Makes hair manageable.</li>
            <li> the best for my hair, keeps it in very good condition, Amazon made it possible for me to buy it.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t change my hair at all. My hair is unbelievably fried and damaged. It smelt good, but really no different from a normal conditioner to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown my hair out from a pixie cut over the course of several years. I&#x27;d been unimpressed with my hair dull and frizzy. I purchased Wen and LOVED it immediately. I did find that the product created a build up over the course of three weeks and I had to invest in a clarifying shampoo. I&#x27;ve decreased the frequency with which I use Wen to once or twice a week and use an organic shampoo and conditioner the other days. My hair has maintained incredible luster. I simply cannot believe it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I can&#x27;t recommend the product as directed, I stand firmly behind this product in my current routine!</li>
            <li> I could not have been more skeptical about this product. I have fine, thin, chin-length hair. It&#x27;s so fine and thin that I have to style it carefully to cover a couple really sparse spots. I was never one to use conditioner b/c I never found one that didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, make it a greasy mess by the end of the day, or make it so soft that I couldn&#x27;t do anything with it. But then my stylist told me that I needed to start doing something b/c my hair was really dry - which was leading to breakage (and even thinner hair). So she recommended a bunch of different conditioners and treatments - none of which impressed me. Then flipping through the channels one day I happened to see Chaz on QVC. I&#x27;d seen the Wen infomercial before, but turned the channel after five minutes - I could see no reason to even consider the product. Everyone on the infomercial had either long, thick or ethnic hair - the opposite of me. When I saw Chaz&#x27;s presentation on QVC, though, I became curious - especial... Read more</li>
