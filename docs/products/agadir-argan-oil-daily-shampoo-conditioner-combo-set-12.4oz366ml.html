            <li>It smells really good, too.</li>

            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>I think this product is good for any type of hair.</li>
            <li>My hair smells so good</li>
            <li>The conditioner however doesn&#x27;t smell at good as shampoo but when using both together the smell of shampoo comes thur.</li>
            <li>I had used the Agadir argan oil before on my hair and loved the smell and the way it made my hair feel, and the shampoo and conditioner just add to it.  </li>
            <li>Good service.</li>
            <li>I purchased this set of Shampoo and conditioner because the reviews here and elsewhere were good</li>
            <li>good for the money...</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>but when I tried a sample of this product I loved it.</li>
            <li>I loved the way my hair felt.</li>
            <li>The both shampoo and conditioner are smell good.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good for that.</li>
            <li>I use this before I put in the oil, and it smells so good.</li>
            <li>my wife tried this shampoo from a friend and loved it.</li>
            <li>was too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good experience with length of time from order to receipt.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t take a lot and makes a wonderful, rich (both smell and feel) lather.      </li>
            <li>After finding it online I was very pleased to save the money and have a good product.</li>
            <li>Great set - smells awesome and is really nourishing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great on color treated hair, that&#x27;s for sure, as I have had</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing better than great hair care products.  </li>
            <li>The Shampoo seems good but like someone else mentioned the Conditioner is kind of runny.</li>
            <li>This combo smells SO GOOD that I wish this company made their own perfume smelling just like the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love these products very nice</li>

            <li>My hair has never looked better!</li>
            <li>Have always used Moroccan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner and have found this set to be BETTER and you cannot beat the price!</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo ever!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li>They moisturize and smooth frizz!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame that so many people said this product was fraudulent!  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>I am so in love with this product!</li>

            <li>Makes it real smooth and takes away the frizz.</li>
            <li>I was on the hunt for a sulfate free shampoo with argan oil and after reading the great reviews I decided on this product line.</li>
            <li>This is a great line and a fantastic price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>ALSO THEIR OIL AND KERATIN MASK ARE AMAZING</li>
            <li>I have heard about argan oil and its amazing forms</li>
            <li>This combo was amazing-</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is the absolute best I have found at any price.</li>
            <li>so Nice  </li>
            <li>so Nice  </li>
            <li>so Nice</li>
            <li>Shipped so fast and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t think it cleanses your hair as well as it should, just my opinion.</li>
            <li>The scent was nice, I&#x27;ll admit to that.</li>
            <li>Smelled nice but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>I liked this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I got to say this is the absolute best shampoo / conditioner I have ever used .</li>

            <li>Really nice smell, too.  </li>
            <li>I love it, so it&#x27;s all good.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this product after all the good things I&#x27;ve heard about it.</li>
            <li>First the shampoo is excellent smooth lather, creamy texture and doesn&#x27;t strip the hair, which is always a good thing when you have kinky curly hair, as I do.</li>
            <li>, I could STILL smell the Moroccan oil very strongly.</li>
            <li>Its a great product and worth the money especialy if you have mix hair or curly hair.</li>
            <li>I kind of wished it was more concentrated.</li>
            <li>I liked the WEN, but I LOVE this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is that this is the most amazing product I have bought for my hair.</li>
            <li>It smells incredible, and the smell actually stays on you for a couple more hours which I think is great.</li>
            <li>They leave my hair feeling soft and smelling wonderful!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I color my hair and it is safe to use and leaves it healthy, smooth, and smelling great.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>i love, love, love all of their products!  </li>
            <li>, I know Moroccan oil has a strong scent (which I like), but the scent of this combo is overpowering!</li>
            <li>I know some people love the smell of product lingering in their hair, and I do as well if it&#x27;s not overpowering, but this is a very VERY strong</li>
            <li>Smells awesome, and leaves my hair very clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>For the most part my hair is clean and well conditioned, the duo price and shipping charges were good.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased that it helped to de-tangle my hair when its wet, awesome.......</li>

            <li>I love Sulfate Free products and have seen an incredible improvement in the texture, and condition of my hair since starting with this product three months ago.</li>
            <li>Very happy with results verses other products.</li>
            <li>I have given this product out to friends who also think this is the best product to use when heading to the beach or trying to make due in the summer months.  </li>
            <li>Lovely scent and works well to clean and moisturize.  </li>
            <li>I have highlighted blonde hair, which may be a factor in why this shampoo/conditioner isn&#x27;t ideal for me.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting my hair to feel smooth and silky</li>
            <li>So easy to manage, no tangling.</li>
            <li>With this product it was extremely easy to get through the tangles.</li>
            <li>, the lack of one star is because of the really, really, really, really strong smell.  </li>
            <li>She strongly urged me to stop using it.  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair shiny, healthy and full of volume.</li>
            <li>My hair can look full and shiny without the frizzes, and my beautician has commented on my healthy hair.</li>
            <li>love this product, I carb keep my hair clean, volume and smooth for three days without washing it.</li>
            <li>I have used it in unison with the actual oil and my hair feels awesome, smells awesome and no more dandruff!</li>
            <li>stuff is great, better than any other shampoo or conditioner and better than any serums, oils, sprays, blah, blah, blah.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and didn&#x27;t have any issues with any sort of heaviness or greasy feel.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t make my hair perfect, but they do help considerably more than anything I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
            <li>Used it for the first time this morning, and I&#x27;m sure that I love it already.  </li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li>Smells wonder, little needed to wash &amp; condition, easy on hair and just wonderful over all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells clean, leaves my hair looking healthy and full.</li>
            <li>Smooth and shiny hair is always welcome especially in the spring and summer when you get the \\&quot;frizzies\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>and when I was telling my stylist that I wanted to switch to a sulfate free shampoo she suggested I try Agidar.</li>
            <li>so I decided to call the number listed and spoke with a manager and he didn&#x27;t know how to answer my question as to why is this product being advertised as sulfate free</li>
            <li>I will no longer use this product line because I&#x27;m looking for a sulfate free shampoo and this shampoo is not.</li>
            <li>Con: its kind of pricy in the drugstore, about $20 per bottle, but you can get here on amazon so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>It also smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Happy to get moisture back in my hair.</li>
            <li>Thes are terrific, smell great.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this combo set to anyone as it is not only a great product</li>
            <li>It has a distinct smell, but my fiancee and I have grown to love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>Save your money, do your reasearch..not sulfate free though it states it is..</li>
            <li>This is a great addition to my daily routine!</li>
            <li>It smells like cheap aftershave and makes my hair tanGlenn.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 2 months and it leaves my hair smelling good and soft</li>
            <li>It smells good, it makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more!!</li>
            <li>These products are much gentler on my hair, smell great, and leave my hair very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I will use it again and am willing to try more of the products.</li>
            <li>Well, first of all: love the price.</li>
            <li>This stuff keeps my hair soft and looking very healthy.  </li>
            <li>so I know what the original looks like.</li>
            <li>and I cannot believe how soft and delicious smelling my hair was for the next 3 days!!</li>
            <li>This has done a great job for taming the frizzies and smoothing my dry, aging hair.  </li>
            <li>(I have over 1/2 a bottle of the shampoo and about 1/4 of the conditioner left) and has no where near as wonderful a smell as the shampoo and oil.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have the clean feel after shampooing.</li>
            <li>and that is plenty to lather up my hair and get it clean.</li>
            <li>This product smells clean and fresh and feels fabulous.</li>
            <li>It does not give you that squeaky clean feeling that you love so much.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is not very moisturizing and the smell of both products aren&#x27;t great either.</li>
            <li>Is smells great , I love the way my hair feels and smells ,so I&#x27;m anxious to wash it each day .</li>
            <li>Finally a shampoo and conditioner that work plus smell good.</li>
            <li>Good price for this product, I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>I will buying them again very soon :)</li>
            <li>I will probably use this for the rest of my life as it does such good things for hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair nice and soft, but it does smell like men&#x27;s perfume for some reason.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t love it as much as I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a former WEN user and this product is every bit as good.</li>
            <li>Use both for the full effect.  </li>
            <li>Use these on me (fine hair) and my daughter (coarse hair) and love the softness they provide for both of us!</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and my hair is super soft and so shiny.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of these products and they are awesome for thin, straight hair too!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Conditioner is too mild, was expecting a richer/creamier substance</li>
            <li>As an African American woman, I found these products to be excellent food for my hair.  </li>
            <li>After I wash my hair its usually super tangled, so I have to sit and comb it out.</li>
            <li>my hair was luscious, smelled good, and dried much more quickly.</li>
            <li>The fragrance isn&#x27;t very strong and it doesn&#x27;t detangle at all, my hair was soft and that was it.</li>
            <li>First of all, this is not sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I normally use Wen, and love it -</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t use anything else, soft shinny hair, good price quick delivery would highly recommend these hair products.</li>
            <li>I cant explain the smell, but it definitely does smell nice and clean.</li>
            <li>so soft and full of healthy body.......</li>
            <li>Good for dry curly hair like my</li>
            <li>In addition, my boyfriend, who instead has dry skin and scalp, also loved using this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner work great together to help keep my thick curly hair from becoming too tangled.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>if you have fine, straight hair-</li>
            <li>I really like the Agadir Argan Oil Hair Treatment, and was hoping the shampoo and conditioner would be just as fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I use it every couple of days and my hair feels really silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>These products are AMAZING but at different degrees.</li>
            <li>Does not make my hair fall out and leaves it soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel so soft and healthy......</li>
            <li>Powerful smell.</li>
            <li>I just love all the product that I have used so far and will be a repeat costumer.</li>
            <li>I liked the shampoo but the conditioner is not as silky as Pantene or Loreal Total repair.</li>
            <li>I really cant say enough good things about Agadir.</li>
            <li>You will notice a distinct difference after using this shampoo, and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so soft now :)</li>
            <li>No matter what, it is worth the purchase (and smell).</li>
            <li>love this shampoo it makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>the shipping was fast thanks!!!</li>
            <li>I was recommended by my sister to purchase and she was right, the smell is refreshing and it makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>They make my hair extremely soft and shiny, but also clean and light.  </li>
            <li>I noticed results almost right away.</li>
            <li>It has left it soft, clean easy to menage and it also left my hair smelling good.</li>
            <li>Price is good, wish for a bit less now</li>
            <li>my mom is 87 with semi-dry,thick graying natural hair//me 59 dry,dyed and fried medium fine hair ......</li>
            <li>and when I woke up this morning my curls were so soft and light</li>
            <li>Also the price is so resonable it is almost funny.</li>
            <li>Just used it for the first time</li>
            <li>My hair seems about the same and for the price I might be better off just getting something from Target.</li>
            <li>This has helped so much!</li>
            <li>I may come back to purchase the duo again for the sake of using it longer to write a much better review.</li>
            <li>i did first with</li>
            <li>the big bottles &#x3D;)and</li>
            <li>Agadair Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner has not only tamed my hair but it smells fabulous too!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>it leave my hair soft , smooth and shiny .I</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>They both work very well!</li>
            <li>I use more than necessary.</li>
            <li>not expensive</li>
            <li>I am so glad to finally find something that works.</li>
            <li>These products do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
            <li>After the first use with the shampoo, conditioner, and oil combination, I saw a difference.</li>
            <li>The one and only brand is way better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Agadir products, especially the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I did use the hair masque 2 times a week for the first month or so and it helped to kick start the transformation.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser used it on me first</li>
            <li>I was buying it from my hair dresser for a price that was considerably higher.  </li>
            <li>I love all the Agadir products and use them regularly.</li>
            <li>They were not wrong.</li>
            <li>If it gave the same results, I&#x27;d be ok with it, but its a fraud.</li>
            <li>I like these pretty well.  </li>
            <li>great for thick hair</li>
            <li>I have been through everything in search of a product that would bring back my shiny, healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always used their finishing oil, this was the first time trying the Shampoo and Conditioner set</li>
            <li>Trying to get my hair to smooth out just means more and more heat, which is worse for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product for dry areas such as desert locations.</li>
            <li>Only used it a couple of times but my hair feels super smooth and bouncy  plus the smell of this</li>
            <li>My hair drinks this up and it gets absorbed quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product because of its many positive reviews, it was a total mistake.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of these products (too strong while hair is wet but perfect when hair is dry), and the shampoo is rich, sudsy, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Product is authentic and works super for those with medium to fine hair and thick.</li>
            <li>I just hope that Amazon is not selling fake products to loyal customers....that would not be good!  </li>
            <li>You will not need to put all those other product in your hair to make it look nice or to make your curls last, just wash dry and oil and your good to go.</li>
            <li>Light, does not weigh my fine hair down.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair super soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>My dry, color-treated hair never looked so healthy.</li>
            <li>Love the conditioning effect on my dry hair but not a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li>My hair is dry and with this combo looks smooth and shine,easy to comb and style my hair!</li>
            <li>the ingredient is becoming more common.</li>
            <li>Because I am all natural I try to be more conscious of what I use in my hair and so far no complaints!</li>
            <li>The conditioner was supposed to make combing through my hair super easy (so other reviews say), however, I was struggling to comb it!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, it made it feel clean, soft, and healthy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much for shine with my hair, as oils usually dull my hair, but definitely good for the condition.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair smelling great and feeling great, but the packaging was terrible.</li>
            <li>I orginaly bought the edge controll from Walmart and it works very well in my hair.</li>
            <li>so her hair is part curly and part straight and this product did wonders for her hair in just one shampoo.</li>
            <li>This has done really well for my very damaged hair, as I color it every 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>The .conditioner is very creamy</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li>This stuff reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li>so I went straight to Amazon looking for it.  </li>
            <li>I really really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>A real deal for shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I tried another product from Sally&#x27;s and did not like as much as the Agadir product.  </li>
            <li>Very concentrated.</li>
            <li>and it gets really frizzy.  </li>
            <li>My hair is straight but tends to frizz.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally very wavy hair, so I have always needed anti-frizzing products and whatnot.</li>
            <li>I really like about these products</li>
            <li>but the cost is just too much.</li>
            <li>so it really helps &amp;#34;tame the mane.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This most definitely is NOT real Agadir Argan shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>If you want the real deal DO NOT BUY this.</li>
            <li>Nope Argan Oil is the absolute REAL DEAL.</li>
            <li>That Argan oil it contains is the real deal - not an advertising gimmick.  </li>
            <li>really oily.</li>
            <li>reason I deducted a star is because it smells very . . .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for it much.</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves this shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li>I have long, straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li>and i bought into the suggestion that it was better than that other brand \\&quot;Moroccan</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner when used with the other Agadir hair products makes my hair feel and look so healthy.  </li>
            <li>I notice the conditioner in particular makes my hair much softer and detangles</li>
            <li>Hair felt dry, perfume smell too strong, would not recommend.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is very gentle and has made my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>This product is also very liquid, not thick at all.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine dry , split , and brittle .</li>
            <li>This product has made it so soft and pretty.  </li>
            <li>While they are really small, it was a nice gesture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Im new at using it, however, I really do see a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I can tell after less than a week it is already getting better .</li>
            <li>When I use this product I feel like it makes my curls more defined and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny, and frizz free finally!</li>
            <li>These products sell at my local grocer, Kroger for more than double the price here.  </li>
            <li>Left my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>plus I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m pretty sure that it subsides after a small amount of time.</li>
            <li>It does not detangle my  hair at all, and does not leave it particularly shiny.</li>
            <li>I used the same hair products for many years, but my color would wash out well before the next one.</li>
            <li>the real product because the bottles were different shape, when mine arrived they are real, they don&#x27;t look exactly like the pictured items .</li>
            <li>At first i didn&#x27;t realize the actual effects of it until I switched over to a different shampoo and conditioner and realized my hair does not feel as soft or smell or feel as clean without using!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to everyone.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Keeps the high humidity</li>
            <li>The price may seem a bit high, but you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
            <li>A must for colored or chemical treated hair and for naturally curly hair (ME!!).</li>
            <li>It completely changed my hair!!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have to use any other product to tame my otherwise very full, boisterous (for lack of a better term) mane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and when she washes her hair with it she keep touching them how fluffy they are.</li>
            <li>The smell lingers for a bit yet is not too powerful to mix with your current perfume.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely when your hair has actually dried and you&#x27;re out and about.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest this product for someone who has dry/damaged hair to normal hair.</li>
            <li>I am not 100% sure if my product is a fake because this is the first time buying it, but after reading other reviews I am pretty sure it is.  </li>
            <li>I have dry hair and my hair dyed and when I use this shampoo and conditioner, I can tell a big difference in dryness and static.  </li>
            <li>I received this about a week and a half ago, and I love it so far.  </li>
            <li>pair it up with some argan oil after the shower and your hair feels brand new</li>
            <li>, I went looking for something new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit of a shampoo fetishist, so I&#x27;m always trying new products</li>
            <li>This is my second order, but within 3 weeks I noticed a huge transformation in the thickness, sheen and overall health of my hair.  </li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;m African American with fine, fragile hair</li>
            <li>Three more tries - same result.</li>
            <li>They smell so good and leaves your hair so shiny and soft with no fly aways.</li>
            <li>My husband started using it and realized that my children (my son has very sensitive skin, but he has no problems with this product).  </li>
            <li>I live in Alaska and rarely wear a hat with my long hair , even at 30 below so that damages it a lot ,</li>
            <li>Ok, I dont know how long I&#x27;ve searched for a shampoo and conditioner that works for me, but its been a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I am of mix race Affrican American/white female with long natural curly hair, I have tried so many differect shampoos and conditioners all promising the same thing....</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this brand until it proves otherwise in the long run.</li>
            <li>I use Agadir Argan Oil Daily Shampoo + Conditioner.. for my hair always, but pay a much higher price in retail stores.</li>
            <li>Used together PLUS with the oil, wow for results!</li>
            <li>and it made my hair supple and soft!  </li>
            <li>Referred to my hair professional who now uses it on my hair!</li>
            <li>This is the second time I have order the shampoo/conditioner the first time I got with my oil</li>
            <li>i live in memphis and this was recommended to me by \\&quot;the sisters\\&quot; for naturally curly hair prone to dryness.  </li>
            <li>The only positive thing I can say is that it does makes your hair soft but at what price!</li>
            <li>My hair color at the roots last longer and my hair is more manageable without being weighed down.</li>
            <li>i have been such a salon line devotee for so many years that it was a pretty hard sell, but now i will use nothing else.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I purchased the oil , oil spray and the masque from other vendors...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been years since i&#x27;ve seen my moms natural wave in her hair...</li>
            <li>me my hair hasn&#x27;t shined and BOUNCED naturally in YEARS....</li>
            <li>making my hair soft and manageable, but it doesn&#x27;t do either.</li>
            <li>pro: This shampoo and conditioner smells so divine and leaves my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It has made my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>hair will be soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>After using this for over a year, my hair feels like it did in my twenties; soft and glossy.  </li>
            <li>I also use the Argon oil before I curl iron my hair and it helps it to feel soft and stay in place.  </li>
            <li>I continue to buy from Amazon because the price at local stores is WAY too much.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for several months now along with the hair oil and it has really improved the condition of my hair.  </li>
            <li>But I have a sensitive scalp and it(my scalp)</li>
            <li>I thought when i was purchasing that it said these had all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>My hair was so soft after.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and luxurious too.</li>
            <li>Yeah it&#x27;s pricey for Shampoo and Conditioner, but no worse than some big name brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order the whole line of products next payday !</li>
            <li>My 17 year old daughter loves it too .</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to scents, some of which give me headaches.</li>
            <li>The oil allows me to straighten my hair naturally.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s curlier than ever as well as soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>If you have thick hair or curly hair, I think it would be better suited for</li>
            <li>I highly recommend in the winter time with dry weather as it&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The bottle shape is different, the type on the label is blurry and the actual product inside the bottles is a different color than the original.</li>
            <li>I am still on the fence about this duo I have not really been using the shampoo or the conditioner long enough to give  a fair assessment of how good or bad it is.</li>
            <li>I recently tried the Wen product line and found that it was far too greasy for me and the results were about 25% of the high quality I got from Agadir&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li>The absence of certain chemicals is apparent and not missed.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thin naturally curly hair that I insist on wearing straight.  </li>
            <li>My hair is long and very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed to find both at a price lower than I normally pay for only the shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is natural and has been for over ten years, so I have just discovered the world of sulfate-free hair products and THIS Shampoo is EPIC!</li>
            <li>I used Head &amp; Shoulders before purchasing Agadir Argan Oil shampoo &amp; conditioner, and the first time I used the new brand of shampoo and conditioner, my hair felt smoother and less frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Products labeled for fine limp hair just didn&#x27;t provide enough moisture.  </li>
            <li>and it did nothing amazing for me other than causing me a serious case of dandruff which I&#x27;ve never had before and killing my natural curls completely.</li>
            <li>I live in Las Vegas and the heat definitely does not help with my hair.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for my hair but dry it out.  </li>
            <li>(Red is very sensitive)</li>
            <li>I do use just a little bit more conditioner but noting like if it was any other brand.</li>
            <li>No other shampoo, even medicated has helped.</li>
            <li>I have fine slightly wavy hair; those who have left rave reviews for these products seem to have coarse or curly hair.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t seem to loose so much hair during brushing.</li>
            <li>but there was a little bit of leakage in the packing that was coming from the conditioner; however the product is worth buying again.</li>
            <li>Also, it took much longer than expected to arrive-</li>
            <li>Could you believe that my local drug store (CVS) offers this combo for $40.00 ???</li>
            <li>The smell is wow, and it didn&#x27;t hurt my red color treated hair.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the shampoo but the combined products left my hair feeling heavy, not soft and conditioned as my regular products do.</li>
            <li>In fact, it makes my hair so soft and shiny that the red is intensified.</li>
            <li>I cannot wear products in my hair because the skin on my neck is so sensitive that I sometimes get red bumps that look like pimples that stick around for days.</li>
            <li>I bought this product at a local store and it was nearly twice the price.</li>
            <li>I took off one star because when I received the product although it was delivered on time the bottles were not closed all the way and some of the shampoo had leaked out.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair every day and a bottle of shampoo and conditioner lasts more than a half a year because you need so little of it.</li>
            <li>The conditioner isn&#x27;t one that leaves your hair limp nor does it feel greasy; it&#x27;s just the right amount of conditioning.</li>
            <li>The smell is different than what I&#x27;m used to from other shampoos, but am willing to put up with it if it means I can have healthier looking and feeling hair.</li>
            <li>I have used Moroccan oil in the past on my hair (oil only, not shampoo/conditioner), so I ordered this already being familiar with the oil and the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To be completely honest, I didn&#x27;t like it very much. :(</li>
            <li>Dry, frizzy hair and New Orleans are not a match made in heaven.</li>
            <li>Only a tiny bit of the shampoo creates lots of soft sudsy cleansing.  </li>
            <li>I have tried SOOOO many shampoos for that &amp;#34;soft, no fly aways&amp;#34; look and this is the only one that I found that does it.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair and wash it every day, and it stays soft with the two products.</li>
            <li>in the meantime, I&#x27;ll use what I have left of this Agadir Argan Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner :o</li>
            <li>I have long naturally blonde/grey hair (Elbow Length).  </li>
            <li>After using the first time, my fine, thin hair was a mess.  </li>
            <li>(I have a lot of it, making it super thick).</li>
            <li>These are pretty expensive in the grocery store or drugstore, so the price on Amazon is about right for what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was recently diagnosed with fibromyalgia, and though I&#x27;m not positive that this is what caused my hair to be dry, I do think it was a large part of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do have hard water for whatever that is worth.</li>

            <li> It smells really good, too.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for Dialy shower</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> I think this product is good for any type of hair.</li>
            <li> My hair smells so good</li>
            <li> The conditioner however doesn&#x27;t smell at good as shampoo but when using both together the smell of shampoo comes thur.</li>
            <li> I had used the Agadir argan oil before on my hair and loved the smell and the way it made my hair feel, and the shampoo and conditioner just add to it.  </li>
            <li> Good service.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set of Shampoo and conditioner because the reviews here and elsewhere were good</li>
            <li> good for the money...</li>
            <li> Loved it.</li>
            <li> but when I tried a sample of this product I loved it.</li>
            <li> I loved the way my hair felt.</li>
            <li> The both shampoo and conditioner are smell good.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good for that.</li>
            <li> I use this before I put in the oil, and it smells so good.</li>
            <li> my wife tried this shampoo from a friend and loved it.</li>
            <li> was too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Good experience with length of time from order to receipt.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t take a lot and makes a wonderful, rich (both smell and feel) lather.      </li>
            <li> After finding it online I was very pleased to save the money and have a good product.</li>
            <li> Great set - smells awesome and is really nourishing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great on color treated hair, that&#x27;s for sure, as I have had</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing better than great hair care products.  </li>
            <li> The Shampoo seems good but like someone else mentioned the Conditioner is kind of runny.</li>
            <li> This combo smells SO GOOD that I wish this company made their own perfume smelling just like the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love these products very nice</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product and will continue to buy on Amazon because they have the best price and quick shipping too!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to spray on a detangler any more!</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked better!</li>
            <li> Have always used Moroccan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner and have found this set to be BETTER and you cannot beat the price!</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo ever!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  </li>
            <li> They moisturize and smooth frizz!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame that so many people said this product was fraudulent!  </li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product!</li>
            <li> Love the product, the quality and the price!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products!  </li>
            <li> Makes it real smooth and takes away the frizz.</li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for a sulfate free shampoo with argan oil and after reading the great reviews I decided on this product line.</li>
            <li> This is a great line and a fantastic price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> ALSO THEIR OIL AND KERATIN MASK ARE AMAZING</li>
            <li> I have heard about argan oil and its amazing forms</li>
            <li> This combo was amazing-</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is the absolute best I have found at any price.</li>
            <li> so Nice  </li>
            <li> so Nice  </li>
            <li> so Nice</li>
            <li> Shipped so fast and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t think it cleanses your hair as well as it should, just my opinion.</li>
            <li> The scent was nice, I&#x27;ll admit to that.</li>
            <li> Smelled nice but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I liked this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I got to say this is the absolute best shampoo / conditioner I have ever used .</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo because i know i am doing something good for my hair when I wash with it.</li>
            <li> Really nice smell, too.  </li>
            <li> I love it, so it&#x27;s all good.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product after all the good things I&#x27;ve heard about it.</li>
            <li> First the shampoo is excellent smooth lather, creamy texture and doesn&#x27;t strip the hair, which is always a good thing when you have kinky curly hair, as I do.</li>
            <li> , I could STILL smell the Moroccan oil very strongly.</li>
            <li> Its a great product and worth the money especialy if you have mix hair or curly hair.</li>
            <li> I kind of wished it was more concentrated.</li>
            <li> I liked the WEN, but I LOVE this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is that this is the most amazing product I have bought for my hair.</li>
            <li> It smells incredible, and the smell actually stays on you for a couple more hours which I think is great.</li>
            <li> They leave my hair feeling soft and smelling wonderful!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I color my hair and it is safe to use and leaves it healthy, smooth, and smelling great.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li> i love, love, love all of their products!  </li>
            <li> , I know Moroccan oil has a strong scent (which I like), but the scent of this combo is overpowering!</li>
            <li> I know some people love the smell of product lingering in their hair, and I do as well if it&#x27;s not overpowering, but this is a very VERY strong</li>
            <li> Smells awesome, and leaves my hair very clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> For the most part my hair is clean and well conditioned, the duo price and shipping charges were good.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased that it helped to de-tangle my hair when its wet, awesome.......</li>
            <li> Non sulfate products are especially great for Red Heads.....</li>

            <li> Better yet, my hair loves it.</li>
            <li> Made my hair much softer and easier to manage after one use and it smells great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, I really like when you are able to order them as a combo group.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> It smells ok in th bottle,  but in your hair is where the magic is.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather up as much as most shampoos and conditioners,  but it works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It adds nice smell to my hair and make my hair feels smooth and</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes your hair feel and the smell.  </li>
            <li> I love my Argan products.  </li>
            <li> am so glad that I have found my Agadir.</li>
            <li> Love these products.</li>
            <li> I found out about this product by trying a product sample and have fallen in love.</li>
            <li> Once I get my hair trimmed, I&#x27;ll be able to see this product work on healthy hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite products of all time.</li>
            <li> Likely to by again from where I can get the best cost value.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is so much more affordable on line than in the salon.  </li>
            <li> and it smells great, highly recommend and will try Argan oil mask for hair protection.</li>
            <li> So i guess it is pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I think the shampoo is pretty good, but may be a bit drying.  </li>
            <li> These products are totally worth the money!!</li>
            <li> it also works great on longer hair as well as short, giving it a nice shine without making it greasy.</li>
            <li> Very very good, it has helped me in reducing hair loss and bringing back shine to my hair without over drying it</li>
            <li> It smells great and makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I used it for years and thought \\&quot;wow, what a great price!\\&quot;  I got jipped.</li>
            <li> I love Sulfate Free products and have seen an incredible improvement in the texture, and condition of my hair since starting with this product three months ago.</li>
            <li> Very happy with results verses other products.</li>
            <li> I have given this product out to friends who also think this is the best product to use when heading to the beach or trying to make due in the summer months.  </li>
            <li> Lovely scent and works well to clean and moisturize.  </li>
            <li> I have highlighted blonde hair, which may be a factor in why this shampoo/conditioner isn&#x27;t ideal for me.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting my hair to feel smooth and silky</li>
            <li> So easy to manage, no tangling.</li>
            <li> With this product it was extremely easy to get through the tangles.</li>
            <li> , the lack of one star is because of the really, really, really, really strong smell.  </li>
            <li> She strongly urged me to stop using it.  </li>
            <li> Makes your hair shiny, healthy and full of volume.</li>
            <li> My hair can look full and shiny without the frizzes, and my beautician has commented on my healthy hair.</li>
            <li> love this product, I carb keep my hair clean, volume and smooth for three days without washing it.</li>
            <li> I have used it in unison with the actual oil and my hair feels awesome, smells awesome and no more dandruff!</li>
            <li> stuff is great, better than any other shampoo or conditioner and better than any serums, oils, sprays, blah, blah, blah.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and didn&#x27;t have any issues with any sort of heaviness or greasy feel.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t make my hair perfect, but they do help considerably more than anything I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> Used it for the first time this morning, and I&#x27;m sure that I love it already.  </li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with fine hair.</li>
            <li> Smells wonder, little needed to wash &amp; condition, easy on hair and just wonderful over all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells clean, leaves my hair looking healthy and full.</li>
            <li> Smooth and shiny hair is always welcome especially in the spring and summer when you get the \\&quot;frizzies\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> and when I was telling my stylist that I wanted to switch to a sulfate free shampoo she suggested I try Agidar.</li>
            <li> so I decided to call the number listed and spoke with a manager and he didn&#x27;t know how to answer my question as to why is this product being advertised as sulfate free</li>
            <li> I will no longer use this product line because I&#x27;m looking for a sulfate free shampoo and this shampoo is not.</li>
            <li> Con: its kind of pricy in the drugstore, about $20 per bottle, but you can get here on amazon so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> It also smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Happy to get moisture back in my hair.</li>
            <li> Thes are terrific, smell great.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this combo set to anyone as it is not only a great product</li>
            <li> It has a distinct smell, but my fiancee and I have grown to love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Save your money, do your reasearch..not sulfate free though it states it is..</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to my daily routine!</li>
            <li> It smells like cheap aftershave and makes my hair tanGlenn.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 months and it leaves my hair smelling good and soft</li>
            <li> It smells good, it makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy more!!</li>
            <li> These products are much gentler on my hair, smell great, and leave my hair very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I will use it again and am willing to try more of the products.</li>
            <li> Well, first of all: love the price.</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps my hair soft and looking very healthy.  </li>
            <li> so I know what the original looks like.</li>
            <li> and I cannot believe how soft and delicious smelling my hair was for the next 3 days!!</li>
            <li> This has done a great job for taming the frizzies and smoothing my dry, aging hair.  </li>
            <li> (I have over 1/2 a bottle of the shampoo and about 1/4 of the conditioner left) and has no where near as wonderful a smell as the shampoo and oil.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the clean feel after shampooing.</li>
            <li> and that is plenty to lather up my hair and get it clean.</li>
            <li> This product smells clean and fresh and feels fabulous.</li>
            <li> It does not give you that squeaky clean feeling that you love so much.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is not very moisturizing and the smell of both products aren&#x27;t great either.</li>
            <li> Is smells great , I love the way my hair feels and smells ,so I&#x27;m anxious to wash it each day .</li>
            <li> Finally a shampoo and conditioner that work plus smell good.</li>
            <li> Good price for this product, I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I will buying them again very soon :)</li>
            <li> I will probably use this for the rest of my life as it does such good things for hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair nice and soft, but it does smell like men&#x27;s perfume for some reason.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t love it as much as I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a former WEN user and this product is every bit as good.</li>
            <li> Use both for the full effect.  </li>
            <li> Use these on me (fine hair) and my daughter (coarse hair) and love the softness they provide for both of us!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and my hair is super soft and so shiny.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of these products and they are awesome for thin, straight hair too!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Conditioner is too mild, was expecting a richer/creamier substance</li>
            <li> As an African American woman, I found these products to be excellent food for my hair.  </li>
            <li> After I wash my hair its usually super tangled, so I have to sit and comb it out.</li>
            <li> my hair was luscious, smelled good, and dried much more quickly.</li>
            <li> The fragrance isn&#x27;t very strong and it doesn&#x27;t detangle at all, my hair was soft and that was it.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is not sulfate free.</li>
            <li> I normally use Wen, and love it -</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t use anything else, soft shinny hair, good price quick delivery would highly recommend these hair products.</li>
            <li> I cant explain the smell, but it definitely does smell nice and clean.</li>
            <li> so soft and full of healthy body.......</li>
            <li> Good for dry curly hair like my</li>
            <li> In addition, my boyfriend, who instead has dry skin and scalp, also loved using this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner work great together to help keep my thick curly hair from becoming too tangled.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> if you have fine, straight hair-</li>
            <li> I really like the Agadir Argan Oil Hair Treatment, and was hoping the shampoo and conditioner would be just as fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I use it every couple of days and my hair feels really silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> These products are AMAZING but at different degrees.</li>
            <li> Does not make my hair fall out and leaves it soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so soft and healthy......</li>
            <li> Powerful smell.</li>
            <li> I just love all the product that I have used so far and will be a repeat costumer.</li>
            <li> I liked the shampoo but the conditioner is not as silky as Pantene or Loreal Total repair.</li>
            <li> I really cant say enough good things about Agadir.</li>
            <li> You will notice a distinct difference after using this shampoo, and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so soft now :)</li>
            <li> No matter what, it is worth the purchase (and smell).</li>
            <li> love this shampoo it makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I was recommended by my sister to purchase and she was right, the smell is refreshing and it makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> They make my hair extremely soft and shiny, but also clean and light.  </li>
            <li> I noticed results almost right away.</li>
            <li> It has left it soft, clean easy to menage and it also left my hair smelling good.</li>
            <li> Price is good, wish for a bit less now</li>
            <li> my mom is 87 with semi-dry,thick graying natural hair//me 59 dry,dyed and fried medium fine hair ......</li>
            <li> and when I woke up this morning my curls were so soft and light</li>
            <li> Also the price is so resonable it is almost funny.</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time</li>
            <li> My hair seems about the same and for the price I might be better off just getting something from Target.</li>
            <li> This has helped so much!</li>
            <li> I may come back to purchase the duo again for the sake of using it longer to write a much better review.</li>
            <li> i did first with</li>
            <li> the big bottles &#x3D;)and</li>
            <li> Agadair Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner has not only tamed my hair but it smells fabulous too!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> it leave my hair soft , smooth and shiny .I</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> They both work very well!</li>
            <li> I use more than necessary.</li>
            <li> not expensive</li>
            <li> I am so glad to finally find something that works.</li>
            <li> These products do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do.</li>
            <li> After the first use with the shampoo, conditioner, and oil combination, I saw a difference.</li>
            <li> The one and only brand is way better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Agadir products, especially the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I did use the hair masque 2 times a week for the first month or so and it helped to kick start the transformation.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser used it on me first</li>
            <li> I was buying it from my hair dresser for a price that was considerably higher.  </li>
            <li> I love all the Agadir products and use them regularly.</li>
            <li> They were not wrong.</li>
            <li> If it gave the same results, I&#x27;d be ok with it, but its a fraud.</li>
            <li> I like these pretty well.  </li>
            <li> great for thick hair</li>
            <li> I have been through everything in search of a product that would bring back my shiny, healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always used their finishing oil, this was the first time trying the Shampoo and Conditioner set</li>
            <li> Trying to get my hair to smooth out just means more and more heat, which is worse for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Great product for dry areas such as desert locations.</li>
            <li> Only used it a couple of times but my hair feels super smooth and bouncy  plus the smell of this</li>
            <li> My hair drinks this up and it gets absorbed quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product because of its many positive reviews, it was a total mistake.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of these products (too strong while hair is wet but perfect when hair is dry), and the shampoo is rich, sudsy, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Product is authentic and works super for those with medium to fine hair and thick.</li>
            <li> I just hope that Amazon is not selling fake products to loyal customers....that would not be good!  </li>
            <li> You will not need to put all those other product in your hair to make it look nice or to make your curls last, just wash dry and oil and your good to go.</li>
            <li> Light, does not weigh my fine hair down.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair super soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> My dry, color-treated hair never looked so healthy.</li>
            <li> Love the conditioning effect on my dry hair but not a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and with this combo looks smooth and shine,easy to comb and style my hair!</li>
            <li> the ingredient is becoming more common.</li>
            <li> Because I am all natural I try to be more conscious of what I use in my hair and so far no complaints!</li>
            <li> The conditioner was supposed to make combing through my hair super easy (so other reviews say), however, I was struggling to comb it!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, it made it feel clean, soft, and healthy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much for shine with my hair, as oils usually dull my hair, but definitely good for the condition.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair smelling great and feeling great, but the packaging was terrible.</li>
            <li> I orginaly bought the edge controll from Walmart and it works very well in my hair.</li>
            <li> so her hair is part curly and part straight and this product did wonders for her hair in just one shampoo.</li>
            <li> This has done really well for my very damaged hair, as I color it every 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> The .conditioner is very creamy</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li> This stuff reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> so I went straight to Amazon looking for it.  </li>
            <li> I really really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A real deal for shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I tried another product from Sally&#x27;s and did not like as much as the Agadir product.  </li>
            <li> Very concentrated.</li>
            <li> and it gets really frizzy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is straight but tends to frizz.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally very wavy hair, so I have always needed anti-frizzing products and whatnot.</li>
            <li> I really like about these products</li>
            <li> but the cost is just too much.</li>
            <li> so it really helps &amp;#34;tame the mane.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This most definitely is NOT real Agadir Argan shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> If you want the real deal DO NOT BUY this.</li>
            <li> Nope Argan Oil is the absolute REAL DEAL.</li>
            <li> That Argan oil it contains is the real deal - not an advertising gimmick.  </li>
            <li> really oily.</li>
            <li> reason I deducted a star is because it smells very . . .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for it much.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li> and i bought into the suggestion that it was better than that other brand \\&quot;Moroccan</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner when used with the other Agadir hair products makes my hair feel and look so healthy.  </li>
            <li> I notice the conditioner in particular makes my hair much softer and detangles</li>
            <li> Hair felt dry, perfume smell too strong, would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very gentle and has made my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This product is also very liquid, not thick at all.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine dry , split , and brittle .</li>
            <li> This product has made it so soft and pretty.  </li>
            <li> While they are really small, it was a nice gesture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im new at using it, however, I really do see a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I can tell after less than a week it is already getting better .</li>
            <li> When I use this product I feel like it makes my curls more defined and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny, and frizz free finally!</li>
            <li> These products sell at my local grocer, Kroger for more than double the price here.  </li>
            <li> Left my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> plus I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m pretty sure that it subsides after a small amount of time.</li>
            <li> It does not detangle my  hair at all, and does not leave it particularly shiny.</li>
            <li> I used the same hair products for many years, but my color would wash out well before the next one.</li>
            <li> the real product because the bottles were different shape, when mine arrived they are real, they don&#x27;t look exactly like the pictured items .</li>
            <li> At first i didn&#x27;t realize the actual effects of it until I switched over to a different shampoo and conditioner and realized my hair does not feel as soft or smell or feel as clean without using!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to everyone.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Keeps the high humidity</li>
            <li> The price may seem a bit high, but you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
            <li> A must for colored or chemical treated hair and for naturally curly hair (ME!!).</li>
            <li> It completely changed my hair!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have to use any other product to tame my otherwise very full, boisterous (for lack of a better term) mane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and when she washes her hair with it she keep touching them how fluffy they are.</li>
            <li> The smell lingers for a bit yet is not too powerful to mix with your current perfume.</li>
            <li> It smells lovely when your hair has actually dried and you&#x27;re out and about.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest this product for someone who has dry/damaged hair to normal hair.</li>
            <li> I am not 100% sure if my product is a fake because this is the first time buying it, but after reading other reviews I am pretty sure it is.  </li>
            <li> I have dry hair and my hair dyed and when I use this shampoo and conditioner, I can tell a big difference in dryness and static.  </li>
            <li> I received this about a week and a half ago, and I love it so far.  </li>
            <li> pair it up with some argan oil after the shower and your hair feels brand new</li>
            <li> , I went looking for something new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a shampoo fetishist, so I&#x27;m always trying new products</li>
            <li> This is my second order, but within 3 weeks I noticed a huge transformation in the thickness, sheen and overall health of my hair.  </li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;m African American with fine, fragile hair</li>
            <li> Three more tries - same result.</li>
            <li> They smell so good and leaves your hair so shiny and soft with no fly aways.</li>
            <li> My husband started using it and realized that my children (my son has very sensitive skin, but he has no problems with this product).  </li>
            <li> I live in Alaska and rarely wear a hat with my long hair , even at 30 below so that damages it a lot ,</li>
            <li> Ok, I dont know how long I&#x27;ve searched for a shampoo and conditioner that works for me, but its been a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I am of mix race Affrican American/white female with long natural curly hair, I have tried so many differect shampoos and conditioners all promising the same thing....</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this brand until it proves otherwise in the long run.</li>
            <li> I use Agadir Argan Oil Daily Shampoo + Conditioner.. for my hair always, but pay a much higher price in retail stores.</li>
            <li> Used together PLUS with the oil, wow for results!</li>
            <li> and it made my hair supple and soft!  </li>
            <li> Referred to my hair professional who now uses it on my hair!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have order the shampoo/conditioner the first time I got with my oil</li>
            <li> i live in memphis and this was recommended to me by \\&quot;the sisters\\&quot; for naturally curly hair prone to dryness.  </li>
            <li> The only positive thing I can say is that it does makes your hair soft but at what price!</li>
            <li> My hair color at the roots last longer and my hair is more manageable without being weighed down.</li>
            <li> i have been such a salon line devotee for so many years that it was a pretty hard sell, but now i will use nothing else.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I purchased the oil , oil spray and the masque from other vendors...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been years since i&#x27;ve seen my moms natural wave in her hair...</li>
            <li> me my hair hasn&#x27;t shined and BOUNCED naturally in YEARS....</li>
            <li> making my hair soft and manageable, but it doesn&#x27;t do either.</li>
            <li> pro: This shampoo and conditioner smells so divine and leaves my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> It has made my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> hair will be soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> After using this for over a year, my hair feels like it did in my twenties; soft and glossy.  </li>
            <li> I also use the Argon oil before I curl iron my hair and it helps it to feel soft and stay in place.  </li>
            <li> I continue to buy from Amazon because the price at local stores is WAY too much.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for several months now along with the hair oil and it has really improved the condition of my hair.  </li>
            <li> But I have a sensitive scalp and it(my scalp)</li>
            <li> I thought when i was purchasing that it said these had all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> My hair was so soft after.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and luxurious too.</li>
            <li> Yeah it&#x27;s pricey for Shampoo and Conditioner, but no worse than some big name brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order the whole line of products next payday !</li>
            <li> My 17 year old daughter loves it too .</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to scents, some of which give me headaches.</li>
            <li> The oil allows me to straighten my hair naturally.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s curlier than ever as well as soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair or curly hair, I think it would be better suited for</li>
            <li> I highly recommend in the winter time with dry weather as it&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The bottle shape is different, the type on the label is blurry and the actual product inside the bottles is a different color than the original.</li>
            <li> I am still on the fence about this duo I have not really been using the shampoo or the conditioner long enough to give  a fair assessment of how good or bad it is.</li>
            <li> I recently tried the Wen product line and found that it was far too greasy for me and the results were about 25% of the high quality I got from Agadir&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> The absence of certain chemicals is apparent and not missed.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, thin naturally curly hair that I insist on wearing straight.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed to find both at a price lower than I normally pay for only the shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and has been for over ten years, so I have just discovered the world of sulfate-free hair products and THIS Shampoo is EPIC!</li>
            <li> I used Head &amp; Shoulders before purchasing Agadir Argan Oil shampoo &amp; conditioner, and the first time I used the new brand of shampoo and conditioner, my hair felt smoother and less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Products labeled for fine limp hair just didn&#x27;t provide enough moisture.  </li>
            <li> and it did nothing amazing for me other than causing me a serious case of dandruff which I&#x27;ve never had before and killing my natural curls completely.</li>
            <li> I live in Las Vegas and the heat definitely does not help with my hair.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for my hair but dry it out.  </li>
            <li> (Red is very sensitive)</li>
            <li> I do use just a little bit more conditioner but noting like if it was any other brand.</li>
            <li> No other shampoo, even medicated has helped.</li>
            <li> I have fine slightly wavy hair; those who have left rave reviews for these products seem to have coarse or curly hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t seem to loose so much hair during brushing.</li>
            <li> but there was a little bit of leakage in the packing that was coming from the conditioner; however the product is worth buying again.</li>
            <li> Also, it took much longer than expected to arrive-</li>
            <li> Could you believe that my local drug store (CVS) offers this combo for $40.00 ???</li>
            <li> The smell is wow, and it didn&#x27;t hurt my red color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the shampoo but the combined products left my hair feeling heavy, not soft and conditioned as my regular products do.</li>
            <li> In fact, it makes my hair so soft and shiny that the red is intensified.</li>
            <li> I cannot wear products in my hair because the skin on my neck is so sensitive that I sometimes get red bumps that look like pimples that stick around for days.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a local store and it was nearly twice the price.</li>
            <li> I took off one star because when I received the product although it was delivered on time the bottles were not closed all the way and some of the shampoo had leaked out.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every day and a bottle of shampoo and conditioner lasts more than a half a year because you need so little of it.</li>
            <li> The conditioner isn&#x27;t one that leaves your hair limp nor does it feel greasy; it&#x27;s just the right amount of conditioning.</li>
            <li> The smell is different than what I&#x27;m used to from other shampoos, but am willing to put up with it if it means I can have healthier looking and feeling hair.</li>
            <li> I have used Moroccan oil in the past on my hair (oil only, not shampoo/conditioner), so I ordered this already being familiar with the oil and the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To be completely honest, I didn&#x27;t like it very much. :(</li>
            <li> Dry, frizzy hair and New Orleans are not a match made in heaven.</li>
            <li> Only a tiny bit of the shampoo creates lots of soft sudsy cleansing.  </li>
            <li> I have tried SOOOO many shampoos for that &amp;#34;soft, no fly aways&amp;#34; look and this is the only one that I found that does it.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and wash it every day, and it stays soft with the two products.</li>
            <li> in the meantime, I&#x27;ll use what I have left of this Agadir Argan Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner :o</li>
            <li> I have long naturally blonde/grey hair (Elbow Length).  </li>
            <li> After using the first time, my fine, thin hair was a mess.  </li>
            <li> (I have a lot of it, making it super thick).</li>
            <li> These are pretty expensive in the grocery store or drugstore, so the price on Amazon is about right for what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was recently diagnosed with fibromyalgia, and though I&#x27;m not positive that this is what caused my hair to be dry, I do think it was a large part of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do have hard water for whatever that is worth.</li>
            <li> Hot weather with short hard rain showers throughout any given day.  </li>
            <li> Usually when I try new shampoos my hair is soft and shiny after, but my hair was dry and frizzy after trying this product.</li>
            <li> I also added a few drops of 100% pure cold compressed argan oil to the shampoo and conditioner so that the effects are even better than just with the shampoo and conditioner alone.</li>
            <li> Now, I just shampoo, condition, and flat iron.</li>
            <li> I only use this when I feel my scalp is getting dry</li>
            <li> but instead the conditioner is super watery and thin and leaves my hair feeling meh.</li>
            <li> My hair goes a little past my shoulders, and I have to completely fill the palm of my hand with the conditioner to get any reasonable effect.  </li>
            <li> That being said, when used in conjuction with the shampoo and oil, my hair is soft &amp; shiny with little to no friz.    </li>
            <li> I used to work for LUSH Cosmetics and have been using their hair care line faithfully for years, but as the prices continue to rise and the quality has gotten a little lax</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged female with curly hair that&#x27;s gotten drier and coarser as I&#x27;ve aged.</li>
            <li> Now the conditioner is a little thin for my tasted, you have to use more then other brands of conditioners.</li>
            <li> As far as the conditioner, I have used the conditioner once because it contains alcohol and alcohol can be really harsh and leave your hair dry.</li>
            <li> I left it at 4 stars since I had to add extra argan oil to the product as there is a small amount in the product initially.</li>
            <li> It works well in making my transitioning hair shiny and manageable but i was extremely dissapointed to find unfriendly hair ingredients such as &#x27;Mineral Oil\\&quot; , \\&quot;alcohol\\&quot; and \\&quot;Dimethicone\\&quot; listed on the bottles.</li>
            <li> It smells like camel and the scent does not go away, even after several days of washing with other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I would try other products but would always end up going back to the hydrate line.</li>
            <li> my hair is very long an every time I use agadir it gets softer an silkier.</li>
            <li> I have very long curly hair.</li>
            <li> I let it air dry</li>
            <li> Salon owner recommend these product for dry scalp</li>
            <li> I have really dry hair</li>
            <li> well i will not be purchasing again as i much prefer natural and or organic products for my vulnerable Type 4 hair.</li>
            <li> I also use a dime size of the oil before I blow dry to protect the ends.  </li>
            <li> I color &amp; consequently have some issues with dry, processed hair &amp; this</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair, I would recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I tend towards oily scalp and dry ends.  </li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with dry, frizzy hair and have tried numerous different products.  </li>
            <li> It left a slight smoothness and shine to it, but that was about it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair that gets \\&quot;bushy\\&quot; and</li>
            <li> I put in a little of the Argan oil and left for work.</li>
            <li> and I only need a little bit&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller also included some tiny, little combs.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I opened the package and didn&#x27;t find the conditioner and free gift!!!  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is EXTREMELY thick and hard to get out of the bottle (I&#x27;ve added water to it once there was enough room to shake it in there), and the conditioner is really thin (like the cheap White Rain conditioner used to be!).</li>
            <li> Well it was a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> Though somewhat pricey, it lasts for a long time because you need only a small amount.  </li>
            <li> this is definitely not for you it will be way too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I  really do not recommend this product to anyone who has kinky/curly hair and is looking for a moisturizing hair product.</li>
            <li> and when I come in from outside, then a few shots of this to my head and the hair is manageable again.  </li>
            <li> However, it is a heavy shampoo and I alternate with others.</li>
            <li> It works and while it is moderately expensive (compared to what you can buy in the grocery store), it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I do have thick naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> For the record, I have extremely thick and frizzy long hair that is generally unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different expensive shampoos to try and tame my course thick unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally, I scrunch a pea sized amount of this in my hair in between shampoos to tame frizzes.  </li>
            <li> , they don&#x27;t weigh it down, they don&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> is that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair and did not put any other product in it.</li>
            <li> but I notice the other day the ingredient contained Sodium Lauryl Sarcosinate which is a form of Sulfate.</li>
            <li> I decided to try to shampoo and condition due to the way the oil made my hair feel.  </li>
            <li> I put other conditioners on my hair but they just &#x27;sit&#x27; on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews said it wasen&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands</li>
            <li> Check other products before buying this one.</li>
            <li> it made me regret not just spending the extra money on my usual Nexxus.</li>
            <li> I had to wash my hair with another product just to get the scent out, and even after washing it with the other product</li>
            <li> Color does not fade and product lasts a long time as very little is needed for&lt;br /&gt;excellent results.</li>
            <li> takes very little product, so this lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am not thrilled with this and will not be ordering it again.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your hair not weighed down.  </li>
            <li> Watered down conditioner</li>
            <li> This product does not weigh down my hair but it does tone down the frizz.  </li>
            <li> All the &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; products would moisturize, but would weight it down.  </li>
            <li> frizzes down while never weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> With thinner hair I think it might feel weighed down.</li>
            <li> $25 bucks down the drain...</li>
            <li> Using the shampoo/conditioner combo weighted my hair down and made it look greasy.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed that the scent of this shampoo is so strong</li>
            <li> I saw this product in CVS for $20.00 buck a bottle, I decided to come on Amazon to see if I can get it for less</li>
            <li> When I purchased my replacements I gave half of it to my daughter (who was sooooo</li>
            <li> and wasn&#x27;t working as it had previously.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo set is one I typically &amp;#34;keep&amp;#34; around.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt softer and even seems less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> It was half the price I pay at the salon</li>
            <li> So, this is half the cost.)</li>
            <li> but less then a dime she of the shampoo</li>
            <li> I knew half off on Amazon</li>
            <li> I use this at least 2 times a week to help with dry ends of hair and also with the addition of the argan oil</li>
            <li> If you use a little, it feels like you have used nothing at all.  </li>
            <li> Conditioner is a little runny</li>
            <li> It lingers, which is fine by me, but some may find that annoying if they don&#x27;t like the scent.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that is fine with enough waves to make me HATE humidity.    </li>
            <li> The clear packaging said Agadir, but it was the wrong product.</li>
            <li> He replied he&#x27;s not a chemist and the Chemist is not available to answer my question.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use them everyday (I like to switch things up)</li>
            <li> My hair was so dried out it felt like straw</li>
            <li> The products aren&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet in the summer, and depending on the weather it may be too heavy</li>
            <li> After continuing to try it for a few weeks, I went for a hair cut and</li>
            <li> I am trying you spray oil and will let you know my thoughts after using it a few times.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I already have oily hair (i have to wash it everyday)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for a few months and like it a lot.</li>
            <li> As previously stated the shampoo is extremely thick (I store the bottle upside down even though is is not designed to stand).</li>
            <li> The shampoo bottle leaked in the box so a small amount was missing from the bottle.</li>
            <li> I had difficulty combing it and after drying, I found my hair to be tangled, dull and heavy.  </li>
            <li> not sure what the problem was...</li>
            <li> A friend gave me a small amount of this to try about a year ago</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually do ratings because I&#x27;m lazy, but I have to start because of this product.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure though.</li>
            <li> purchased these before I ran out of my current bottles and when I took them out of the box I immediately realized they were fake.</li>
            <li> The shampoo seems very harsh but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> To clarify, I have not used any other product for the last two months, only this until now that I noticed the horrible results and gave up on it.</li>
            <li> When it gets bad I usually just go to the doctor and get steroids to clear it up.</li>
            <li> well water whicha makes my hair dry and brittle and difficult to comb after a shower.</li>
            <li> In fact, I don&#x27;t use ANY of the expensive stuff I used to apply every single day.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to maintain.</li>
            <li> Summer months are hard on your hair in the south.  </li>
            <li> Between the blow dryer,flat iron and coloring, it&#x27;s no wonder my hair had issues; frizzy, dull, brassy and with lots of breakage.  </li>
            <li> It was hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> Makes hair feel dull</li>
            <li> It made me itch really bad, but I can&#x27;t blame the product for me being sensitive.</li>
            <li> and I am in my late 60&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, color treated hair and was in desperate need of a product line that could help repair the damage I do to it every 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> If you dont have thick hair, I dont think this will be for you.</li>
            <li> It is not a good detangler, and when I use it, my hair is still dry-ish and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> I want my curls back :(</li>
            <li> I can even go at least 2-3 days before I have to shampoo again; that alone has improved my hair!  </li>
            <li> Such a disappointment!  </li>
            <li> Yes, yes, dumb me.</li>
            <li> I have very hard</li>
            <li> Made my hair dry bad quality oil.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> A little disappointing, but</li>
            <li> I have been so annoyed.</li>
            <li> so my hair didnt get worse.</li>
            <li> I hear people say that about shampoos and conditioners,  but I&#x27;ve never experienced it until now.</li>
            <li> but this made it worse.</li>
            <li> my hair dresser said that my new shampoo was leaving a terrible residue in my hair, which I never had before.  </li>
            <li> No more bad hair days.  </li>
            <li> I wrote the wrong stuff for the wrong thing, so I&#x27;ll repeat myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the expensive line.  </li>
            <li> Buy the expensive one.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, hoped they were wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, because of the price I can&#x27;t always afford it.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> read a review where the customer said these were fake products , they said the labeling was blurry ect.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this shampoo and conditioner combo set had that affect.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the 30 day return policy wont let me get a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very thin, you have to use ALOT of it.</li>
            <li> very very disappointing and poor product.</li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;calls &#x27;em as I sees &#x27;em,&amp;#34; and this one is disappointing.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t specifically a bad product, I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone buying it....</li>
            <li> However, the conditioner is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed by that.</li>
            <li> the worst product ...</li>
            <li> For starters, the smell is terrible, NOT &amp;#34;sweet and tropical&amp;#34;.  </li>

            <li> This shampoo and conditioner are the best for my hair. Makes it real smooth and takes away the frizz. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> my mom is 87 with semi-dry,thick graying natural hair//me 59 dry,dyed and fried medium fine hair ...... both of us are just elated with the IMMEDIATE superb results given by these two products ...it&#x27;s been years since i&#x27;ve seen my moms natural wave in her hair... so soft and full of healthy body....... me my hair hasn&#x27;t shined and BOUNCED naturally in YEARS.... i would not hesitate to give this duo 10 out of 10 ..... the fragrance is DEVINE !!!!!!!!!!![[ASIN:B0032Z21HK Agadir  Argan Oil Daily Moisturizing Conditioner, 12-Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Use these on me (fine hair) and my daughter (coarse hair) and love the softness they provide for both of us!</li>
            <li> the worst product ... i will not perches again</li>
            <li> I am of mix race Affrican American/white female with long natural curly hair, I have tried so many differect shampoos and conditioners all promising the same thing.... I orginaly bought the edge controll from Walmart and it works very well in my hair. I saw this product in CVS for $20.00 buck a bottle, I decided to come on Amazon to see if I can get it for less and I was so happy when I did. I washed my hair and did not put any other product in it. I let it air dry and when I woke up this morning my curls were so soft and light I put in a little of the Argan oil and left for work. I live/work/play in FL so I needed something that can stand up to the heat. I LOOOOOOOVE this product and from now on this is my shampo/conditioner. Its a great product and worth the money especialy if you have mix hair or curly hair. You will not need to put all those other product in your hair to make it look nice or to make your curls last, just wash dry and oil and your good to go. I have also used this in my daughters hair who in at the tailk end of transioning from a perm so her hair is part curly and part straight and this product did wonders for her hair in just one shampoo.</li>
            <li> Shampoo is great&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner is too mild, was expecting a richer/creamier substance</li>
            <li> A must for colored or chemical treated hair and for naturally curly hair (ME!!). Non sulfate products are especially great for Red Heads.....ME! Also the price is so resonable it is almost funny. I wash my hair every day and a bottle of shampoo and conditioner lasts more than a half a year because you need so little of it. When I purchased my replacements I gave half of it to my daughter (who was sooooo thrilled)She is blonde with curly hair too! Awesome product.</li>
            <li> love this product, I carb keep my hair clean, volume and smooth for three days without washing it. and it smells great, highly recommend and will try Argan oil mask for hair protection.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;I tried one time, two times, it didnt work. I thought it will take time and I may get good results after continuous use. I used it for 2.5 months. Now I am throwing the remaining. Simply don&#x27;t try this product.</li>
            <li> I just had the opportunity to try this product at my local salon. I had never even heard of it before and when I was telling my stylist that I wanted to switch to a sulfate free shampoo she suggested I try Agidar. She washed and conditioned my hair with this combo and I cannot believe how soft and delicious smelling my hair was for the next 3 days!! I will be buying this for my locks...</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time andblove it.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is sheer luxury&lt;br /&gt;Plus the conditioner stopped my hair from breaking.&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
            <li> I was on the hunt for a sulfate free shampoo with argan oil and after reading the great reviews I decided on this product line. I have been using this product for 2 months and it leaves my hair smelling good and soft but I notice the other day the ingredient contained Sodium Lauryl Sarcosinate which is a form of Sulfate. So I e-mailed Agadir International and got no response so I decided to call the number listed and spoke with a manager and he didn&#x27;t know how to answer my question as to why is this product being advertised as sulfate free and there is SLS in the product. He replied he&#x27;s not a chemist and the Chemist is not available to answer my question. He took my name and number and promise a chemist will call me back.    I will no longer use this product line because I&#x27;m looking for a sulfate free shampoo and this shampoo is not. As far as the conditioner, I have used the conditioner once because it contains alcohol and alcohol can be really harsh and leave your hair dry.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It makes my hair feel and smell great! Its also thicker and healthier now... I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this expecting both shampoo and conditioner to perform like the Agadir oil I use- making my hair soft and manageable, but it doesn&#x27;t do either. The shampoo is EXTREMELY thick and hard to get out of the bottle (I&#x27;ve added water to it once there was enough room to shake it in there), and the conditioner is really thin (like the cheap White Rain conditioner used to be!). Overall, I am not thrilled with this and will not be ordering it again.  Also, it took much longer than expected to arrive- not sure what the problem was...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Argan Oil itself twice before and decided to try the Shampoo and Conditioner. The Shampoo seems good but like someone else mentioned the Conditioner is kind of runny. I kind of wished it was more concentrated. My hair seems about the same and for the price I might be better off just getting something from Target. I&#x27;ll update if anything else changes.</li>
            <li> i live in memphis and this was recommended to me by \\&quot;the sisters\\&quot; for naturally curly hair prone to dryness.  i have been such a salon line devotee for so many years that it was a pretty hard sell, but now i will use nothing else.  well, i do use an awesome k&amp;eacute;rastase mask every so often to strengthen my hair, but this line is great and totally cheap for in between.  i love, love, love all of their products!  if you have fine, straight hair- this is definitely not for you it will be way too heavy.  curly girls only!</li>
            <li> This has done really well for my very damaged hair, as I color it every 4 weeks. I also added a few drops of 100% pure cold compressed argan oil to the shampoo and conditioner so that the effects are even better than just with the shampoo and conditioner alone. My hair is soft, shiny, and frizz free finally! I left it at 4 stars since I had to add extra argan oil to the product as there is a small amount in the product initially.</li>
            <li> Smooth and shiny hair is always welcome especially in the spring and summer when you get the \\&quot;frizzies\\&quot;.  I love, love these products.</li>
            <li> I have owned the originals before. The smell of the conditioner itself is so different!! I have been so annoyed. Luckily, I purchased the oil , oil spray and the masque from other vendors...so my hair didnt get worse. I only use the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation :&lt;br /&gt;Get all items separately so they can be returned.</li>
            <li> pro: This shampoo and conditioner smells so divine and leaves my hair shiny and soft. Con: its kind of pricy in the drugstore, about $20 per bottle, but you can get here on amazon so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> This stuff soothes eczema so well. My boo uses it on his head and it works like a dream! It also smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because of its many positive reviews, it was a total mistake. I&#x27;ve been using shampoo and conditioner 2 times a week and it did nothing amazing for me other than causing me a serious case of dandruff which I&#x27;ve never had before and killing my natural curls completely. To clarify, I have not used any other product for the last two months, only this until now that I noticed the horrible results and gave up on it. The only positive thing I can say is that it does makes your hair soft but at what price! Not my product. I want my curls back :(</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  Does not make my hair fall out and leaves it soft and healthy.  I use this in combination of the argan oil!  Will definately purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used and my husband agrees.  It leaves your hair incredibly silky, but not oily.  My curls have never looked better.  This is a great price, too.</li>
            <li> This has done a great job for taming the frizzies and smoothing my dry, aging hair.  Finally a shampoo and conditioner that work plus smell good.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair smelling great and feeling great, but the packaging was terrible. The shampoo bottle leaked in the box so a small amount was missing from the bottle. A little disappointing, but I needec shampoo so I kept it.</li>
            <li> It give the hair lots of moisture-- it had been recommended by my hairdresser.  BUT, I had to change after about 6 months as it did not keep my hair from frizzing, etc. and wasn&#x27;t working as it had previously.  So, now I am trying another product.  Some may not like the smell of the product-- plus I also bought the hairspray which I do not use as I never did not like it.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is not sulfate free. The shampoo is not very moisturizing and the smell of both products aren&#x27;t great either. I  really do not recommend this product to anyone who has kinky/curly hair and is looking for a moisturizing hair product.</li>
            <li> I started using the Agadir hair oil because my stylist was using it and I LOVED the way it made my hair fell and the smell is amazing!  I have very thick hair that is fine with enough waves to make me HATE humidity.    I decided to try to shampoo and condition due to the way the oil made my hair feel.  As previously stated the shampoo is extremely thick (I store the bottle upside down even though is is not designed to stand). But it doesn&#x27;t take a lot and makes a wonderful, rich (both smell and feel) lather.      I am not as impressed with the conditioner.  It is very thin, you have to use ALOT of it. (I have over 1/2 a bottle of the shampoo and about 1/4 of the conditioner left) and has no where near as wonderful a smell as the shampoo and oil.  That being said, when used in conjuction with the shampoo and oil, my hair is soft &amp; shiny with little to no friz.    I will use it again and am willing to try more of the products.</li>
            <li> Have been and continue to love Agadir. This shampoo set is one I typically &amp;#34;keep&amp;#34; around. Don&#x27;t use them everyday (I like to switch things up) but I always have a set to use or share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells clean, leaves my hair looking healthy and full.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this shampoo and conditioner combo. The shampoo seems very harsh but it gets the job done.The conditioner is great. Hair feels great and looks good.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I opened the package and didn&#x27;t find the conditioner and free gift!!!  Amazon did credit me, however what a bummer to not have the conditioner to use along with the shampoo,....</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this set of shampoo and conditioner. It has made my hair so soft and manageable. I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent and works well to clean and moisturize.  I only use this when I feel my scalp is getting dry and it seems to add extra moisture.  The conditioner isn&#x27;t one that leaves your hair limp nor does it feel greasy; it&#x27;s just the right amount of conditioning.</li>
            <li> Great product! My color don&#x27;t fade!</li>
            <li> Light, does not weigh my fine hair down.  Love it!  No sulfates.  Good price for this product, I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to everyone.  Makes your hair shiny, healthy and full of volume. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend ordered this shampoo and conditioner. It smells really good and when she washes her hair with it she keep touching them how fluffy they are. So i guess it is pretty good product.</li>
            <li> it is the best shampoo and conditioner ever ..&lt;br /&gt;and I will buying them again very soon :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;best wishes :&lt;br /&gt;zainab adnan</li>
            <li> I have very hard well water whicha makes my hair dry and brittle and difficult to comb after a shower. This has helped so much! I don&#x27;t have to spray on a detangler any more!</li>
            <li> I am still on the fence about this duo I have not really been using the shampoo or the conditioner long enough to give  a fair assessment of how good or bad it is. For the most part my hair is clean and well conditioned, the duo price and shipping charges were good. I do not have very much more to say. I may come back to purchase the duo again for the sake of using it longer to write a much better review.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble with dry, frizzy hair and have tried numerous different products.  I was using WEN prior to trying this one.  I liked the WEN, but I LOVE this shampoo and conditioner.  It leaves my hair super soft and manageable.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Not as great as promised</li>
            <li> That is the real magic of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to use any other product to tame my otherwise very full, boisterous (for lack of a better term) mane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also decreases the amount of drying time.  And I haven&#x27;t used my straightener once while using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your hair will be soft and manageable.  Nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, the lack of one star is because of the really, really, really, really strong smell.  Like I washed my hair two days later with another shampoo and could still smell this stuff.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair, I only use the conditioner</li>
            <li> Hair felt dry, perfume smell too strong, would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;calls &#x27;em as I sees &#x27;em,&amp;#34; and this one is disappointing.  I really like the Agadir Argan Oil Hair Treatment, and was hoping the shampoo and conditioner would be just as fabulous.  I think the shampoo is pretty good, but may be a bit drying.  The conditioner, however, is one of the poorer conditioners I have used.  It is not a good detangler, and when I use it, my hair is still dry-ish and unmanageable.  Trying to get my hair to smooth out just means more and more heat, which is worse for my hair.  This product is also very liquid, not thick at all.  You have to use a LOT to feel any difference when you apply it.  If you use a little, it feels like you have used nothing at all.  My hair goes a little past my shoulders, and I have to completely fill the palm of my hand with the conditioner to get any reasonable effect.  I still love the Argan oil hair treatment, but will be looking for another conditioner.</li>
            <li> friend of mine tell me about this products....and i just have to try it..i did first with the oil treatment totaly amaizing...and now the shampoo and conditioner is the best product i have for my curly frizzy hair!!i would buy this product again for sure but the big bottles &#x3D;)and the shipping was fast thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different expensive shampoos to try and tame my course thick unruly hair.  This shampoo and conditioner has finally done the trick!  My hair has never felt softer and even seems less frizzy.  I have very dry hair that gets \\&quot;bushy\\&quot; and \\&quot;big\\&quot; after washing, so I cannot wash my hair more than twice a week.  Agadair Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner has not only tamed my hair but it smells fabulous too!  Absolutely LOVE this product and will continue to buy on Amazon because they have the best price and quick shipping too! Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great product! I have thick-frizzy hair so it&#x27;s hard to maintain. I used Head &amp; Shoulders before purchasing Agadir Argan Oil shampoo &amp; conditioner, and the first time I used the new brand of shampoo and conditioner, my hair felt smoother and less frizzy.  I will continue to use this brand until it proves otherwise in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have curly permed hair and I am in my late 60&#x27;s.  A friend gave me a small amount of this to try about a year ago and I was amazed at what it did for my hair.  After using this for over a year, my hair feels like it did in my twenties; soft and glossy.  I will probably use this for the rest of my life as it does such good things for hair and scalp.  Though somewhat pricey, it lasts for a long time because you need only a small amount.  Only a tiny bit of the shampoo creates lots of soft sudsy cleansing.  The .conditioner is very creamy and it doesn&#x27;t take much.  Occasionally, I scrunch a pea sized amount of this in my hair in between shampoos to tame frizzes.  It smells really good, too.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and excellent price, not like retail</li>
            <li> I love this product. Smells great and works great on my hair. Would recommend to anybody. This stuff reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My hairdresser suggested it so I went straight to Amazon looking for it.  It&#x27;s sold in salons so you know it can get costly.  It smells good, it makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have dry hair and my hair dyed and when I use this shampoo and conditioner, I can tell a big difference in dryness and static.  I put other conditioners on my hair but they just &#x27;sit&#x27; on my hair.  My hair drinks this up and it gets absorbed quickly and completely.  I also use the Argon oil before I curl iron my hair and it helps it to feel soft and stay in place.  These are great products.</li>
            <li> I was glad that my products arrived in a timely fashion and the package was well insulated to prevent any damage from occuring. However, I&#x27;m wondering if my products are \\&quot;knock-offs\\&quot; because the smell is different from the Agadir shampoo and conditioner that I already have. Of course, there is no way of me knowing for sure so I don&#x27;t think I will purchase my Agadir products from this source again but try a different one.[[ASIN:B0046D754G Agadir Argan Oil Daily Shampoo + Conditioner \\&quot;Combo Set\\&quot; 12 oz]]</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used.  I continue to buy from Amazon because the price at local stores is WAY too much.  I buy the larger sized to fill these smaller ones.  My hair has never looked better!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful! I&#x27;m very happy with the product. It leaves my hair manageable, and conditioned.  I like the product because my hair is shiny and not greasy. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for Dialy shower cause it&#x27;s too oily</li>
            <li> I use Agadir Argan Oil Daily Shampoo + Conditioner.. for my hair always, but pay a much higher price in retail stores.I was amazed to find both at a price lower than I normally pay for only the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair nice and soft, but it does smell like men&#x27;s perfume for some reason.</li>
            <li> Love it. Happy to get moisture back in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have highlighted blonde hair, which may be a factor in why this shampoo/conditioner isn&#x27;t ideal for me.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting my hair to feel smooth and silky but instead the conditioner is super watery and thin and leaves my hair feeling meh. It isn&#x27;t specifically a bad product, I just wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone buying it....&lt;br /&gt;I love the Agadir hairspray so thought I would love this. Oh well.</li>
            <li> Good product but there was a little bit of leakage in the packing that was coming from the conditioner; however the product is worth buying again.</li>
            <li> Well, first of all: love the price. Could you believe that my local drug store (CVS) offers this combo for $40.00 ??? Are they out of their minds? Secondly, love the shampoo and conditioner. Wonderful moisturizer for hair, adds shine and flexibility. My hair feels silky after each use. So easy to manage, no tangling. Oh, and did I mention the smell? This combo smells SO GOOD that I wish this company made their own perfume smelling just like the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shampoo. My hair looks incredible after using this. I have very fine hair. I also highlight my hair. After using this my hair feels stronger and healthier. The smell is amazing and it lingers in a wonderful way. Love this shampoo and conditioner duo. I really really recommend this product. I noticed results almost right away.</li>
            <li> Love how my hair feels with this product.  Great scent too.</li>
            <li> Meh... it makes my hair look stringy...</li>
            <li> i reallly love this shampoo and conditioner .. it leave my hair soft , smooth and shiny .I will order it again .</li>
            <li> I normally use Wen, and love it - but I gave this a try and now I alternate between them. I have long hair and wash it every day, and it stays soft with the two products. Agadir smells great too!</li>
            <li> Very happy with results verses other products. Great product for dry areas such as desert locations. Salon owner recommend these product for dry scalp</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product after all the good things I&#x27;ve heard about it. As soon as i received the shampoo and conditioner I immediately tried it. Well it was a huge disappointment. My hair was so dried out it felt like straw and it was so tangled up i couldn&#x27;t get a comb or brush through it. I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is the absolute best I have found at any price. My dry, color-treated hair never looked so healthy.</li>
            <li> Great combo set for hair. My hair is soft and smooth.I like the smell of shampoo.I think this product is good for any type of hair.</li>
            <li> so Nice  so Nice  so Nice</li>
            <li> I ordered this product twice, and both times received a different brand. The clear packaging said Agadir, but it was the wrong product. I was looking forward to trying this product, but I returned it and bought a different brand.</li>
            <li> I love it.  My hair smells so good an lots easier to brush..my hair is very long an every time I use agadir it gets softer an silkier. I also use the hair treatment leave-in oil with it.  Don&#x27;t have the frizz sfter shampooing like I use to.  Other reviews said it wasen&#x27;t the real product because the bottles were different shape, when mine arrived they are real, they don&#x27;t look exactly like the pictured items . Don&#x27;t seem to loose so much hair during brushing. I&#x27;m 60 an have medical problems which was causing hair loss.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo/conditioner ever! Smells wonder, little needed to wash &amp; condition, easy on hair and just wonderful over all. One more word</li>
            <li> Only used it a couple of times but my hair feels super smooth and bouncy  plus the smell of this this stuff is  incredible .. pair it up with some argan oil after the shower and your hair feels brand new</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so soft and healthy...... plus the smell is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> I bought these products because I love the hair treatment.  My hair looked frizzier than ever after using this combo.</li>
            <li> Have always used Moroccan Oil Shampoo and Conditioner and have found this set to be BETTER and you cannot beat the price! Product is authentic and works super for those with medium to fine hair and thick. Used together PLUS with the oil, wow for results! The smell lingers for a bit yet is not too powerful to mix with your current perfume. Five starts and buy with confidence! :)</li>
            <li> Love the conditioning effect on my dry hair but not a fan of the smell. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I rate this product a 5 as well.  It leaves your hair not weighed down.  The smell is also the best smelling shampoo I&#x27;ve ever smelled.  The conditioner however doesn&#x27;t smell at good as shampoo but when using both together the smell of shampoo comes thur.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several months now along with the hair oil and it has really improved the condition of my hair.  I color my hair and it seems to improve the length of time between color treatments.</li>
            <li> Watered down conditioner</li>
            <li> I think this Argan Oil is a very good combination set of shampoo and conditioner. They both work very well!</li>
            <li> Love this combo. Shipped so fast and in perfect condition.  A real deal for shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I had used the Agadir argan oil before on my hair and loved the smell and the way it made my hair feel, and the shampoo and conditioner just add to it.  They make my hair extremely soft and shiny, but also clean and light.  I&#x27;m a fan now!</li>
            <li> As said in the title, I have curly hair. It&#x27;s great on color treated hair, that&#x27;s for sure, as I have had demi - permanent hair color applied every so often. It lasted me about six months, keep in mind I use more than necessary. It does not give you that squeaky clean feeling that you love so much. I honestly don&#x27;t think it cleanses your hair as well as it should, just my opinion. The conditioner was supposed to make combing through my hair super easy (so other reviews say), however, I was struggling to comb it! I even let the conditioner sit about five minutes to ensure a silky brush out. I was very disappointed by that. The scent was nice, I&#x27;ll admit to that. It left a slight smoothness and shine to it, but that was about it. To be completely honest, I didn&#x27;t like it very much. :(</li>
            <li> Very very good, it has helped me in reducing hair loss and bringing back shine to my hair without over drying it</li>
            <li> Good service. I love all Agadir products.</li>
            <li> My husband started using it and realized that my children (my son has very sensitive skin, but he has no problems with this product).  They are mixed babies and their hair likes the extra moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the product.</li>
            <li> So fresh out of the package i was so excited to use it and loved the smell of it more than anything! At first i didn&#x27;t realize the actual effects of it until I switched over to a different shampoo and conditioner and realized my hair does not feel as soft or smell or feel as clean without using! Because I am all natural I try to be more conscious of what I use in my hair and so far no complaints!</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo ever! I use all their products combined and my hair shines beautifully!  Plus, sll their products smell yummy!</li>
            <li> I tried another product from Sally&#x27;s and did not like as much as the Agadir product.  Works great on my hair since I have a kertin treatment.  No sulfates in this product</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and my hair is super soft and so shiny.  I have fine hair and didn&#x27;t have any issues with any sort of heaviness or greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I love how it leaves my hair and I love how it smells&lt;br /&gt;Its not expensive and I only need a little bit&lt;br /&gt;Just love it</li>
            <li> got for my sister and she loves it.</li>
            <li> My hair feels like silk. My hair smells terrific. Very concentrated. I use it every time I was my hair. No build up</li>
            <li> I love the smell of these products and they are awesome for thin, straight hair too!  The products aren&#x27;t too heavy. I wish I could get this scent in a perfume.</li>
            <li> Love these products very nice</li>
            <li> I have really dry hair and it gets really frizzy.  This product has made it so soft and pretty.  I am so glad to finally find something that works.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I wrote a review about the conditioner and I didn&#x27;t pay attention. I wrote the wrong stuff for the wrong thing, so I&#x27;ll repeat myself. It is AMAZING! The smell is wow, and it didn&#x27;t hurt my red color treated hair. (Red is very sensitive) So, it cleans great, smells amazing and conditions well. All in all, a great product! But I have a sensitive scalp and it(my scalp) didn&#x27;t love it as much as I did. It made me itch really bad, but I can&#x27;t blame the product for me being sensitive. I hope this helps :)</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels when applying to my hair.  The absence of certain chemicals is apparent and not missed.  It makes my hair softer and more manageable.  My hair is straight but tends to frizz.  This product does not weigh down my hair but it does tone down the frizz.  I have reordered this product.  I am quite happy.</li>
            <li> Low sudsing. Powerful smell. Doesn&#x27;t have the clean feel after shampooing.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  Not only does it handle the &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34; well in humid weather, but it smells wonderful.  My husband loves the smell and always compliments me when I wear this product.  Summer months are hard on your hair in the south.  Hot weather with short hard rain showers throughout any given day.  This causes my hair to stray all over the place.  I keep a bottle of this a work and when I come in from outside, then a few shots of this to my head and the hair is manageable again.  I have given this product out to friends who also think this is the best product to use when heading to the beach or trying to make due in the summer months.  I will continue to sue this product until they stop making it any more.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set of Shampoo and conditioner because the reviews here and elsewhere were good and i bought into the suggestion that it was better than that other brand \\&quot;Moroccan Oil\\&quot; at a cheaper price. It works well in making my transitioning hair shiny and manageable but i was extremely dissapointed to find unfriendly hair ingredients such as &#x27;Mineral Oil\\&quot; , \\&quot;alcohol\\&quot; and \\&quot;Dimethicone\\&quot; listed on the bottles. I thought when i was purchasing that it said these had all natural ingredients but i was obvioulsy mistaken. while it seems to work well i will not be purchasing again as i much prefer natural and or organic products for my vulnerable Type 4 hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Agadir Argan hair oil for over a year now. It completely changed my hair!! I have naturally very wavy hair, so I have always needed anti-frizzing products and whatnot. Using the shampoo, conditioner, and hair oil... that is life-altering!! My hair has never looked better!! It always smells so good, too!! These products do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to do. They don&#x27;t fade my hair color, they don&#x27;t weigh it down, they don&#x27;t dry it out. They moisturize and smooth frizz!! It&#x27;s amazing!! After the first use with the shampoo, conditioner, and oil combination, I saw a difference. I look forward to another month of regular use!! These products are totally worth the money!!</li>
            <li> This product is great color treated hair.  Color does not fade and product lasts a long time as very little is needed for&lt;br /&gt;excellent results.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing better than great hair care products.  As an African American woman, I found these products to be excellent food for my hair.  Wonderful products, I will definitely recommend these products to family and friends nationwide.  Argan Oil is excellent for shine, body and strengthening of the hair.  I was very pleased that it helped to de-tangle my hair when its wet, awesome.......and it smells like a dream!  Great work with this one!  &#x3D;o)  It&#x27;s a shame that so many people said this product was fraudulent!  If it is, it delivers on what it says it will do for my hair.  I have very thick hair and it made my hair supple and soft!  I just hope that Amazon is not selling fake products to loyal customers....that would not be good!  I will check into this myself and get back to you Amazon....in the meantime, I&#x27;ll use what I have left of this Agadir Argan Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner :o(</li>
            <li> works for washing my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> Smelled nice but that&#x27;s it. Dried out my hair and gave me a really itchy scalp. The one and only brand is way better.</li>
            <li> Great set - smells awesome and is really nourishing. I use it every couple of days and my hair feels really silky and smooth. I highly recommend in the winter time with dry weather as it&#x27;s very moisturizing. I haven&#x27;t used it yet in the summer, and depending on the weather it may be too heavy once there&#x27;s more humidity in the air. For the winter it has been great!</li>
            <li> This was a great bargain!  It was half the price I pay at the salon and it was the same great product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Agadir products, especially the shampoo.  This is my second order, but within 3 weeks I noticed a huge transformation in the thickness, sheen and overall health of my hair.  I have fine, thin naturally curly hair that I insist on wearing straight.  On top of that, I highlight my hair 3 times a year.  Between the blow dryer,flat iron and coloring, it&#x27;s no wonder my hair had issues; frizzy, dull, brassy and with lots of breakage.  I&#x27;ve tried all the expensive line.  All the &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; products would moisturize, but would weight it down.  Products labeled for fine limp hair just didn&#x27;t provide enough moisture.  Agadir products do both.  It&#x27;s hydrated and bouncy.  I can even go at least 2-3 days before I have to shampoo again; that alone has improved my hair!  I &amp;#34;enjoy&amp;#34; the days I wash my hair.  I love the smell of these products and I know that when I style my hair it&#x27;s going to have lots of body and a healthy sheen.  No more bad hair days.  I did use the hair masque 2 times a week for the first month or so and it helped to kick start the transformation.  I now use it every 3rd or 4th shampoo.  I also use a dime size of the oil before I blow dry to protect the ends.  These products sell at my local grocer, Kroger for more than double the price here.  This is a great line and a fantastic price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Thes are terrific, smell great. I will definitely be purchasing again. The condtioner rinses out well &amp; did I mention it smells great LOL</li>
            <li> Just right..arrived on time....good for the money...thank you</li>
            <li> I had read the great reviews of this shampoo/conditioner on Amazon and really wanted to try it.  This product was NOT what I was expecting.  For starters, the smell is terrible, NOT &amp;#34;sweet and tropical&amp;#34;.  It smells like camel and the scent does not go away, even after several days of washing with other shampoos.  After continuing to try it for a few weeks, I went for a hair cut and my hair dresser said that my new shampoo was leaving a terrible residue in my hair, which I never had before.  She strongly urged me to stop using it.  I am not 100% sure if my product is a fake because this is the first time buying it, but after reading other reviews I am pretty sure it is.  Be careful!</li>
            <li> Same product as I found @ Target only way cheaper...</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic! This shampoo is very gentle and has made my hair soft and shiny. I would recommend this combo set to anyone as it is not only a great product but the price is very good, too. (We see the shampoo at Target for $20 just for the shampoo. So, this is half the cost.)</li>
            <li> Great price! Excellent product,smell so good! My hair is dry and with this combo looks smooth and shine,easy to comb and style my hair! I&#x27;ll definitely buy more!!</li>
            <li> It has a distinct smell, but my fiancee and I have grown to love the smell of it. I bought it because my beard-coach suggested I get a shampoo or conditioner with argan oil in it. My hair, my beard, my moustache; they all agree that this stuff is great. I pass that aisle in the grocery store now.</li>
            <li> Great product for my hair.  I straighten my hair with the Keratin process and this shampoo &amp; conditioner work great with keeping my hair straight.  They make the process last longer in my hair.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used it on me first and I had to buy it.  It leaves my hair soft and manageable.  It smells great too,  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  Conditioner is a little runny</li>
            <li> Borrowed from my sister. Tried it. Used it. Loved it. Use it at home. Referred to my hair professional who now uses it on my hair!</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo/conditioner does wonders for my hair. When I run out or get close to running out I try to order it if I can afford it.bwhat I really like about these products is that a little bit goes a long way. I have thick hair and I do not have to use but less then a dime she of the shampoo and that is plenty to lather up my hair and get it clean. I do use just a little bit more conditioner but noting like if it was any other brand. My hair is also healthier since useing your products. My hair is shinier,less split ends,healthier, looks better, and feels softer with out residue build up. This is the second time I have order the shampoo/conditioner the first time I got with my oil and since then I am a believer and have told everyone I know about you products. I am trying you spray oil and will let you know my thoughts after using it a few times. I just love all the product that I have used so far and will be a repeat costumer.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo and wonderful smell</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner.  Great price.</li>
            <li> My hair is definitely a lot healthier  now. After damaging my hair from styling tools and over processing I tried everything and nothing helped. A friend recommended Agadir. It was hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> I bought both the shampoo and conditioner.  I love the smell of the shampoo but the combined products left my hair feeling heavy, not soft and conditioned as my regular products do.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve starting using this brand, I&#x27;ll never use anything else! It makes my hair feel like silk, and the smell is intoxicating and amazing!</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used.  I was buying it from my hair dresser for a price that was considerably higher.  I am so glad to have found your site.  This shampoo and conditioner when used with the other Agadir hair products makes my hair feel and look so healthy.  I love it and haven&#x27;t used anything else since I have started using it.</li>
            <li> Did see an improvement, my hair looks shiny</li>
            <li> Sulfate free!  Love this product.  I color &amp; consequently have some issues with dry, processed hair &amp; this is my go-to remedy.  Also, sulfates make my hair fall out so it&#x27;s a must that I avoid them.  I&#x27;ve used other brands but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever used</li>
            <li> Good for dry curly hair like my if you hair is oily you may not work for you..</li>
            <li> Received order as promise. It was package well. It was what I expected...will order again. I have used another product for a couple years but when I tried a sample of this product I loved it. I ordered this smaller bottles to try for longer period. I loved the way my hair felt. So since then I have ordered the larger bottles of the product.</li>
            <li> This product rocks. I&#x27;m a former WEN user and this product is every bit as good. I like WEN but the cost is just too much. These products product are a fraction of the cost and work great.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that this is the most amazing product I have bought for my hair. Shine. Shine. Shine!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good shampoo and conditioner.  I use this at least 2 times a week to help with dry ends of hair and also with the addition of the argan oil it has helped my hair to become fuller and softer.  I alternate with another shampoo set just to keep from getting any buildup of product in my hair.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I liked this shampoo. It smells great and makes my hair so soft. But I don know for some reason feeling head ache after using it.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and their product. This supplier&#x27;s delivery was swift and efficient. I&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li> This works wonders!! It smells incredible, and the smell actually stays on you for a couple more hours which I think is great. I&#x27;m also a guy, so hopefully thats still alright</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my hair feel and smell</li>
            <li> Found this product at my salon and fell in love. I do have thick naturally curly hair so it really helps &amp;#34;tame the mane.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Wife and I use, and love the smell and how it conditions.  However, it is a heavy shampoo and I alternate with others.</li>
            <li> I ordered the shampoo and conditioner.  Such a disappointment!  After using the first time, my fine, thin hair was a mess.  I had difficulty combing it and after drying, I found my hair to be tangled, dull and heavy.  Three more tries - same result. Check other products before buying this one.</li>
            <li> this product does not work as it says. very very disappointing and poor product. i will stay from this supplement.</li>
            <li> Made my hair dry bad quality oil. Buy the expensive one.</li>
            <li> I love all the Agadir products and use them regularly.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t works well for my hair</li>
            <li> I liked the shampoo but the conditioner is not as silky as Pantene or Loreal Total repair. The fragrance is amazing!</li>
            <li> great! I would recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist was actually the one who recommended this product to me.  I have thick, coarse, color treated hair and was in desperate need of a product line that could help repair the damage I do to it every 6 weeks.  I&#x27;ve tried everything...salon products and over the counter products and nothing has seemed to put a dent in fixing my problems.  The shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t make my hair perfect, but they do help considerably more than anything I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  I also purchased the Argon oil by the same company and that is the bomb!  The smell is different than what I&#x27;m used to from other shampoos, but am willing to put up with it if it means I can have healthier looking and feeling hair.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner both myself and my daughter use these products. We also use the oil and hairspray.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, hoped they were wrong. They were not wrong. I cannot believe Amazon allows this forgery. This most definitely is NOT real Agadir Argan shampoo and conditioner. I used it for years and thought \\&quot;wow, what a great price!\\&quot;  I got jipped. Yes, yes, dumb me. If you want the real deal DO NOT BUY this. If it gave the same results, I&#x27;d be ok with it, but its a fraud. They should not be allowed to do this and I can&#x27;t believe Agadir allows it. Frauds. I might be switching all together after this.</li>
            <li> The smell of this brand is awesome. I love all of their products !!! I will definitively buy it again.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS HAVE USED MANY SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONERS AND THIS IS GREAT.  ALSO THEIR OIL AND KERATIN MASK ARE AMAZING</li>
            <li> These products are great!! They leave my hair feeling soft and smelling wonderful!</li>
            <li> The both shampoo and conditioner are smell good. But the reason that I gave a four out of five is becuase the bottles seem to be opened before they were shipped. The shampoo leak out a bit from the opening of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I like these pretty well.  The scent is heavenly.  I notice the conditioner in particular makes my hair much softer and detangles well.  It doesn&#x27;t do much for shine with my hair, as oils usually dull my hair, but definitely good for the condition.  These are pretty expensive in the grocery store or drugstore, so the price on Amazon is about right for what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> I was recommended by my sister to purchase and she was right, the smell is refreshing and it makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I used to work for LUSH Cosmetics and have been using their hair care line faithfully for years, but as the prices continue to rise and the quality has gotten a little lax, I went looking for something new. My hair is colored every 3 weeks or so, and the Agadir set does not wash out my red. In fact, it makes my hair so soft and shiny that the red is intensified. This product smells clean and fresh and feels fabulous. My hair is softer than ever.</li>
            <li> This product is the best thing it happened to my hair. Unfortunately, because of the price I can&#x27;t always afford it.&lt;br /&gt;When I see a promotion lowering the prices, I am sure I&#x27;ll be ordering it.</li>
            <li> When you use this combo you can see a difference in your hair. It is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Before I tried this line I was a Pureology girl. I would try other products but would always end up going back to the hydrate line. My hair dresser suggested I give this a try and I am so glad I did!! This is by far the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. After a month of using this paired with their mask and oil treatment my hair is the healthiest it has ever been!</li>
            <li> Better yet, my hair loves it. Keeps the high humidity frizzes down while never weighing my hair down. My hair can look full and shiny without the frizzes, and my beautician has commented on my healthy hair.</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time this morning, and I&#x27;m sure that I love it already.  Left my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It is excellent for the hair. I have heard about argan oil and its amazing forms</li>
            <li> This works great. I do still need to use a deep conditioner and a sleek conditioner in addition to this conditioner but it helps.</li>
            <li> Made my hair much softer and easier to manage after one use and it smells great.  I wil purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I AM IN LOVE!!!! I finally gave into what I thought was a trend. Nope Argan Oil is the absolute REAL DEAL. I have used it in unison with the actual oil and my hair feels awesome, smells awesome and no more dandruff!</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it would be.  Went back to the blue moraccan oil .  Which I have used for several years.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I really like when you are able to order them as a combo group.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, leaves your hair smelling great</li>
            <li> I really cant say enough good things about Agadir. I love the way it smells. I color my hair and it is safe to use and leaves it healthy, smooth, and smelling great.</li>
            <li> I bought the \\&quot;Agadir\\&quot; Shampoo and Conditioner combo pack. These products are AMAZING but at different degrees.First the shampoo is excellent smooth lather, creamy texture and doesn&#x27;t strip the hair, which is always a good thing when you have kinky curly hair, as I do. My hair is natural and has been for over ten years, so I have just discovered the world of sulfate-free hair products and THIS Shampoo is EPIC! Now the conditioner is a little thin for my tasted, you have to use more then other brands of conditioners. The fragrance isn&#x27;t very strong and it doesn&#x27;t detangle at all, my hair was soft and that was it. My hair is 12 to 14 inches allover so having a product that detangles is a must! I had to use a leave-in condition afterwards so I could comb my hair out. So overall I would recommended these products BUT you have to use a detangling leave-in.</li>
            <li> It is very good oroduct</li>
            <li> Ok, I dont know how long I&#x27;ve searched for a shampoo and conditioner that works for me, but its been a very long time.  I don&#x27;t usually do ratings because I&#x27;m lazy, but I have to start because of this product.  First, I&#x27;m African American with fine, fragile hair (I have a lot of it, making it super thick). I live in Las Vegas and the heat definitely does not help with my hair. I used this stuff once and it was a beautiful thing. My hair was so soft after. If you dont have thick hair, I dont think this will be for you. It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, it made it feel clean, soft, and healthy. It just felt moisturized. With thinner hair I think it might feel weighed down. Im not sure though. I definitely did not smell a tropical anything. I don&#x27;t know why they say that. It smells ok in th bottle,  but in your hair is where the magic is. It smells lovely when your hair has actually dried and you&#x27;re out and about.  My manager literally played in my hair and he goes \\&quot;It Smells sooooo good! And its so healthy!\\&quot; he kept smelling it. I cant explain the smell, but it definitely does smell nice and clean. After I wash my hair its usually super tangled, so I have to sit and comb it out. With this product it was extremely easy to get through the tangles. It doesn&#x27;t lather up as much as most shampoos and conditioners,  but it works. I still cant believe that it made my hair softer. I hear people say that about shampoos and conditioners,  but I&#x27;ve never experienced it until now. Use both for the full effect.  Every one at work has asked me for the name of my shampoo and conditioner. I am so in love with this product!</li>
            <li> You will notice a distinct difference after using this shampoo, and conditioner.  Your hair will feel silky and look shiny.  That Argan oil it contains is the real deal - not an advertising gimmick.  It does have the qualities that are claimed for it.  The scent is delightful, too.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner are great.  They smell so good and leaves your hair so shiny and soft with no fly aways.</li>
            <li> Wife been using this forever</li>
            <li> Love the product, the quality and the price! This is my 3rd order for the combo set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It adds nice smell to my hair and make my hair feels smooth and silky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> For the smell alone, plus the body and shine. Me, I have thinning hair and it&#x27;s good for that. Commercial shampoos always seem to make my head itch, I don&#x27;t know which ingredient. Have to go back to my organic stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this before I put in the oil, and it smells so good. It makes my hair so soft and luxurious too. My daughters started using it, cause it works so well. The price may seem a bit high, but you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. If you have dry hair, I would recommend this set.</li>
            <li> Yeah it&#x27;s pricey for Shampoo and Conditioner, but no worse than some big name brands. I love Sulfate Free products and have seen an incredible improvement in the texture, and condition of my hair since starting with this product three months ago.</li>
            <li> I got to say this is the absolute best shampoo / conditioner I have ever used . Including salon products . Is smells great , I love the way my hair feels and smells ,so I&#x27;m anxious to wash it each day . I&#x27;m going to order the whole line of products next payday ! My next shampoo / conditioner order will be the larger combo ! My 17 year old daughter loves it too . My hair is fine dry , split , and brittle . It is frizzy too. I live in Alaska and rarely wear a hat with my long hair , even at 30 below so that damages it a lot , plus I&#x27;m getting older ( 43) I can tell after less than a week it is already getting better . My hair is so soft now :) One thing I was not expecting was my scalp is healing . I get rashes along the back of my head and neck . No other shampoo, even medicated has helped. When it gets bad I usually just go to the doctor and get steroids to clear it up. Now I won&#x27;t have too !&lt;br /&gt;I read a review where the customer said these were fake products , they said the labeling was blurry ect. Mine wasn&#x27;t and my order was fulfilled by Amazon . I&#x27;m wondering if they used another seller that was selling on Amazon ?</li>
            <li> I purchased these 2 products from CVS (not Amazon) so I know I was using the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; product.  It did absolutely nothing for my hair but dry it out.  I couldn&#x27;t even run a comb though it after I washed it. I returned them back to CVS.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and great deal. Everyone I know prefers this shampoo and this brand. The quality and price is unmatched.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed that the scent of this shampoo is so strong I couldn&#x27;t wash my hair a second time with it. I am sensitive to scents, some of which give me headaches. I cannot wear products in my hair because the skin on my neck is so sensitive that I sometimes get red bumps that look like pimples that stick around for days. Unfortunately this shampoo and conditioner combo set had that affect. Usually when I try new shampoos my hair is soft and shiny after, but my hair was dry and frizzy after trying this product. Different products work differently for each person that uses it so I&#x27;m not saying it won&#x27;t be great for someone else, but it my case it made me regret not just spending the extra money on my usual Nexxus. $25 bucks down the drain...</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner. I love the way it makes your hair feel and the smell.  Some people don&#x27;t like the smell, but I do.  And I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair everyday. It is the best!! TMB Roselle, IL</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t use anything else, soft shinny hair, good price quick delivery would highly recommend these hair products. great for thick hair</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo because i know i am doing something good for my hair when I wash with it. However, it makes my hair oily….like really oily. I already have oily hair (i have to wash it everyday) but this made it worse. I&#x27;d suggest this product for someone who has dry/damaged hair to normal hair.</li>
            <li> I have been through everything in search of a product that would bring back my shiny, healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was recently diagnosed with fibromyalgia, and though I&#x27;m not positive that this is what caused my hair to be dry, I do think it was a large part of the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great, better than any other shampoo or conditioner and better than any serums, oils, sprays, blah, blah, blah. In fact, I don&#x27;t use ANY of the expensive stuff I used to apply every single day. Now, I just shampoo, condition, and flat iron. Even with the heat, my hair is the same as it was before my diagnosis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller also included some tiny, little combs. While they are really small, it was a nice gesture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I deducted a star is because it smells very . . . well, manly. It has a cologne smell that I definitely dislike. However, I&#x27;m pretty sure that it subsides after a small amount of time. No matter what, it is worth the purchase (and smell).</li>
            <li> I love my Argan products.  I am 80 plus and have great hair.  I stick my head in &#x27;the fountain- of- youth&#x27; every 5 or 6 weeks.  My hair is long and very curly hair.  I take my Agadir products to my hair dresser who is very impressed how it works on my hair. The oil allows me to straighten my hair naturally.  Shampoo also  protects my color longer.&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I have found my Agadir.</li>
            <li> my wife tried this shampoo from a friend and loved it. Now this is all se uses for her hair. Thank you</li>
            <li> Dry, frizzy hair and New Orleans are not a match made in heaven. Love these products.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a local store and it was nearly twice the price. After finding it online I was very pleased to save the money and have a good product. Im new at using it, however, I really do see a difference in my hair. It appers healthier.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like.  Makes hair feel dull</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps my hair soft and looking very healthy.  I have tried SOOOO many shampoos for that &amp;#34;soft, no fly aways&amp;#34; look and this is the only one that I found that does it.  I do have hard water for whatever that is worth.</li>
            <li> Great products for my hair! My hair has stop breaking off . My hair has grown a lot!!!</li>
            <li> love this shampoo it makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Save your money, do your reasearch..not sulfate free though it states it is..</li>
            <li> I have always used their finishing oil, this was the first time trying the Shampoo and Conditioner set and I love it! I have been using Agadir Oil since 2006 and I never without it. This is a great addition to my daily routine!</li>
            <li> I have long naturally blonde/grey hair (Elbow Length).  I tend towards oily scalp and dry ends.  This is one of my favorite products!  It works and while it is moderately expensive (compared to what you can buy in the grocery store), it is worth every penny.  Leaves hairy silky and shiny.  I&#x27;m a bit of a shampoo fetishist, so I&#x27;m always trying new products but I come back to this one over and over.</li>
            <li> I tried this product last fall. For the record, I have extremely thick and frizzy long hair that is generally unmanageable. I also have to wash it every day. This combo was amazing- my hair was luscious, smelled good, and dried much more quickly. In addition, my boyfriend, who instead has dry skin and scalp, also loved using this shampoo and conditioner. I recently tried the Wen product line and found that it was far too greasy for me and the results were about 25% of the high quality I got from Agadir&#x27;s product. I found out about this product by trying a product sample and have fallen in love. I will be using nothing but this from now on. Please consider trying this one!</li>
            <li> I am always on the lookout for sulfate-free products because I have found it makes my color last, well, forever! I love the scent of these products (too strong while hair is wet but perfect when hair is dry), and the shampoo is rich, sudsy, and a little bit goes a long way. However, the conditioner is very disappointing. It does not detangle my  hair at all, and does not leave it particularly shiny. I have fine slightly wavy hair; those who have left rave reviews for these products seem to have coarse or curly hair. Maybe these products are just a poor fit for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I used the same hair products for many years, but my color would wash out well before the next one. These products are much gentler on my hair, smell great, and leave my hair very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product did wonders to my nappy hair. It has left it soft, clean easy to menage and it also left my hair smelling good.</li>
            <li> I received this about a week and a half ago, and I love it so far.  Smells awesome, and leaves my hair very clean and soft.  Really nice smell, too.  It lingers, which is fine by me, but some may find that annoying if they don&#x27;t like the scent.  I love it, so it&#x27;s all good.  Once I get my hair trimmed, I&#x27;ll be able to see this product work on healthy hair. Can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li> takes very little product, so this lasts a long time.  Works beautifully for shining hair.  It&#x27;s my favorite products of all time.</li>
            <li> Both the shampoo and conditioner are counterfeit. The bottle shape is different, the type on the label is blurry and the actual product inside the bottles is a different color than the original. I have always bought these at Walgreens/CVS so I know what the original looks like. I knew half off on Amazon was too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these before I ran out of my current bottles and when I took them out of the box I immediately realized they were fake. Unfortunately, the 30 day return policy wont let me get a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY UPSET!!!</li>
            <li> This product works wonders. I wash my hair once a week. This shampoo and conditioner feels great. It leaves your hair soft and manageable.  It doesn&#x27;t take away color and it works on sew-ins as well and it smells great. I would recommed to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have long, straight, fine hair. I have used Moroccan oil in the past on my hair (oil only, not shampoo/conditioner), so I ordered this already being familiar with the oil and the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone with fine hair. Stick with the oil only and skip the shampoo/conditioner combo. Using the shampoo/conditioner combo weighted my hair down and made it look greasy. If you have thick hair or curly hair, I think it would be better suited for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I know Moroccan oil has a strong scent (which I like), but the scent of this combo is overpowering! It gave me a migraine. I had to wash my hair with another product just to get the scent out, and even after washing it with the other product, I could STILL smell the Moroccan oil very strongly. I know some people love the smell of product lingering in their hair, and I do as well if it&#x27;s not overpowering, but this is a very VERY strong scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for my human hair wigs!</li>
            <li> It smells like cheap aftershave and makes my hair tanGlenn. I don&#x27;t care for it much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged female with curly hair that&#x27;s gotten drier and coarser as I&#x27;ve aged. Since using this stuff my hair has changed even from when I was in my prime. It&#x27;s curlier than ever as well as soft and shiny. I just ordered my second batch and will stick with it forever if it keeps working like this. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for a few months and like it a lot. I have very long curly hair. When I use this product I feel like it makes my curls more defined and less frizzy. I took off one star because when I received the product although it was delivered on time the bottles were not closed all the way and some of the shampoo had leaked out. Otherwise I would buy this product again maybe in the pump size next time.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li> Good experience with length of time from order to receipt. Price is good, wish for a bit less now the ingredient is becoming more common. Likely to by again from where I can get the best cost value.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner work great together to help keep my thick curly hair from becoming too tangled. I still add mousse for frizz but find that on days I want to give my hair a break from chemicals that my hair doesn&#x27;t get as frizzy as it use too.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this product. it also works great on longer hair as well as short, giving it a nice shine without making it greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is so much more affordable on line than in the salon.  My hair color at the roots last longer and my hair is more manageable without being weighed down.</li>
