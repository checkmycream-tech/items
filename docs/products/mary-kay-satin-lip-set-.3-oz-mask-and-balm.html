            <li>I&#x27;ve never found a better product for exfoliating and softening lips.</li>
            <li>My lips are noticeably softer,smoother-textured, and visually appealing after using the mask.</li>
            <li>I love Mary Kay Stain Lips.</li>
            <li>Thank you Mary Kay for making such wonderful products!</li>
            <li>Mary Kay is a great product &amp; really works..</li>
            <li>Love this stuff lip saver</li>
            <li>Love that there is no cancer causing petroleum in these products.</li>
            <li>This product is nothing more than Vaseline.</li>
            <li>absolutely love, love this product.</li>
            <li>Works better than a toothbrush for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I actually really love Mary Kay, my mom has sold it</li>
            <li>It works OK, but it is a bit of a hassle.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; seems to be nothing more than Vaseline and</li>
            <li>I love this set.</li>
            <li>I even asked her if she was sure it was for our lips.</li>
            <li>it makes your lips feel nice and smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>so just make sure when you put it on</li>
            <li>I recommend some sort of protective lip balm like Vaseline to use instead of using up all the Satin Lip balm through the day. :)</li>
            <li>Its just okay in my book.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried it before the first time it will feel...oddly nice.</li>
            <li>The product was fine.</li>
            <li>I think it should be used consistently to see improvement! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>An indispensable tool for women who wear a lot of lipstick in the winter.</li>
            <li>The lip balm is a great way to follow-up the mask because it provides moisture that seems to penetrate deep and prolongs the benefits of the mask.</li>
            <li>If you wear matte lipsticks, the mask removes those flakes from your lips and leaves a smooth surface.</li>
            <li>it goes on smooth and takes care of &amp;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the product overall.</li>
            <li>It works ok....not fantastic.</li>
            <li>I may purchase it again if my lips prove to stay cracked free this winter.</li>
            <li>Smooth feeling after using</li>
            <li>C.O. Bigelow 8 hour overnight lip balm is far superior to this.</li>
            <li>I do find it very useful in preventing chapped lips</li>
            <li>This is great for those dry, chapped winter lips.</li>
            <li>far as the mask goes, it does smooth your lips nicely</li>
            <li>cant say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t put too much or you will be able to taste it</li>
            <li>I use this only at night, and leaves my lips feeling good.</li>
            <li>Really works , love it.</li>
            <li>The mask works great for when my lips are dry!!</li>
            <li>great for rough lips, which I have!</li>
            <li>Came quickly, and product works as advertised.</li>
            <li>as a lip balm it works super</li>
            <li>it kind of taste like Vaseline but more bitter.</li>
            <li>No complaint love the product&amp;#34;&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It worked the first application!</li>
            <li>and I just love how it makes my lips soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li>Product as described and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>The balm initially has a mild burn to it, but effective.</li>
            <li>GREAT FOR THE HARSH MARYLAND WINTERS</li>
            <li>Worth the buy</li>
            <li>It helps make a fresh slate for the lip balm you put on after.</li>
            <li>i use them,they really make my lips feel and look fresh clean and radiant.</li>
            <li>Great for scaring husbands and small children alike.</li>
            <li>Keeps lips free of flaking skin that can lead to uneven lipstick application, and my lips are healthy and hydrated!</li>
            <li>The lip mask made my lips smooth, and the balm made them soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t take much!</li>
            <li>Absolutely satisfied and will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li>I thought this set was supposed to make your lips softer (hence the name &amp;#34;satin lips&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>First time using satin lips</li>
            <li>I love the availability outside of using a rep of Mary Kay.</li>
            <li>I went to my first Mary Kay makeup party after being invited by a friend.</li>
            <li>make your lips feel soft smooth.</li>
            <li>The buffer wasn&#x27;t as effective as i expected it to be.</li>
            <li>Finally, I ordered more, and I just love the results same as before.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t done a good job getting the dead skin off of my lips.</li>
            <li>I felt no huge difference since my lips are usually in good condition.</li>
            <li>I do feel like there could be more exfoliators in the lip scrub, but if you rub in on long enough, it does make your lips feel smooth.</li>
            <li>Amazon was so much easier.</li>
            <li>and this helps keep them hydrated and prevent them from drying out as much.</li>
            <li>Now that I can buy it much cheaper on Amazon</li>
            <li>; I made the mistake of putting too much on one day and i was walking around looking like i just finished eating a load of greasy fried foods.</li>
            <li>The exfoliant for your lips (who would have thunk it???) makes an automatic difference and should definitely be followed up by the lip balm which makes your lips feel amazingly smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very silky feeling.</li>
            <li>and it really hurts.</li>
            <li>I just know this Mary Kay stuff really works well.</li>
            <li>So just be careful men not to put too much on:)</li>
            <li>Maybe if you have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; lips and not super dry lips, it is great...</li>
            <li>It makes my lips look and feel so much more fuller and pillowy than I ever expected it to, with even my nonobservant boyfriend taking notice!</li>
            <li>After using this once a day for 2 days I was back to normal and my lips look and feel soft and healthy again.  </li>
            <li>have such a problem with chapped lips and chapstick temporarily makes it better, but I have to use it constantly throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It smooths away any loose skin on your lips and makes them feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>lips were smooth for days afterwards, and it really sucked when I had to go back to using my regular chapstick</li>
            <li>I always get redness on my lips from the skin getting dry and coming off (or even just from Exfoliating), but daily use of the Satin Lip set by Mary Kay keeps my lips in a healthy &amp; even nude color, as they should be.</li>
            <li>Brings them right back from the edge of cracking.</li>
            <li>; moisturizer really pentrates so much so that I am only using it in the morning and at night</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves lips soft</li>
            <li>I have gotten much better results with just plain old Chapstick.</li>
            <li>I love how this product exfoliates the dead skin off your lips!</li>
            <li>This is my first and last time.</li>
            <li>It does not last long, therefore invest in $1 Chapstick, it definitely works better.</li>
            <li>This is definitely NOT amazing or the best or any of the other words used in other reviews to describe it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried almost everything to try and clear up my chapped lips.</li>
            <li>I only do this 1 or 2 times a week, but it has made a real difference for my lips.  </li>
            <li>but I think it works better than chap stick or at least it does for me.</li>
            <li>the lip mask peels away dead skin and leaves your lips soft and the lip balm keeps them smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>The winter months really chaps my skin, especially my lips and hands.</li>
            <li>It makes your lips feel insanely soft, even using it without the scrub</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m especially grateful, because I really don&#x27;t like lipstick at all.</li>
            <li>The mask seems to work to help smooth out rough or dry lips.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna get my lips back to normal.</li>
            <li>The exfolliant is gentle, but removes the dry skip that would otherwise crack.  </li>
            <li>Really works my lips have never been softer and I alway have really dry lips.</li>
            <li>Especially in the colder seasons, they get pretty dry.</li>
            <li>The Mask works fast at removing dead skin cells and the Balm really does feel like satin as it deeply moisturizes.</li>
            <li>If you want soft lips, you definitely need to buy this!</li>
            <li>The reason I gave it a four instead of a five is because your lips only stay soft for about a day-</li>
            <li>If you suffer with some redness from dry lips, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately this gave me a cut on the top of my left lip followed by tiny little bumps that spread to both of my lips and a little around the mouth.</li>

            <li> The product was fine.</li>
            <li> I think it should be used consistently to see improvement! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> An indispensable tool for women who wear a lot of lipstick in the winter.</li>
            <li> The lip balm is a great way to follow-up the mask because it provides moisture that seems to penetrate deep and prolongs the benefits of the mask.</li>
            <li> If you wear matte lipsticks, the mask removes those flakes from your lips and leaves a smooth surface.</li>
            <li> it goes on smooth and takes care of &amp;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product overall.</li>
            <li> It works ok....not fantastic.</li>
            <li> I may purchase it again if my lips prove to stay cracked free this winter.</li>
            <li> Smooth feeling after using</li>
            <li> C.O. Bigelow 8 hour overnight lip balm is far superior to this.</li>
            <li> I do find it very useful in preventing chapped lips</li>
            <li> This is great for those dry, chapped winter lips.</li>
            <li> far as the mask goes, it does smooth your lips nicely</li>
            <li> cant say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t put too much or you will be able to taste it</li>
            <li> I use this only at night, and leaves my lips feeling good.</li>
            <li> Really works , love it.</li>
            <li> The mask works great for when my lips are dry!!</li>
            <li> great for rough lips, which I have!</li>
            <li> Came quickly, and product works as advertised.</li>
            <li> as a lip balm it works super</li>
            <li> it kind of taste like Vaseline but more bitter.</li>
            <li> No complaint love the product&amp;#34;&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It worked the first application!</li>
            <li> and I just love how it makes my lips soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> Product as described and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> The balm initially has a mild burn to it, but effective.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR THE HARSH MARYLAND WINTERS</li>
            <li> Worth the buy</li>
            <li> It helps make a fresh slate for the lip balm you put on after.</li>
            <li> i use them,they really make my lips feel and look fresh clean and radiant.</li>
            <li> Great for scaring husbands and small children alike.</li>
            <li> Keeps lips free of flaking skin that can lead to uneven lipstick application, and my lips are healthy and hydrated!</li>
            <li> The lip mask made my lips smooth, and the balm made them soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t take much!</li>
            <li> Absolutely satisfied and will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I thought this set was supposed to make your lips softer (hence the name &amp;#34;satin lips&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> First time using satin lips</li>
            <li> I love the availability outside of using a rep of Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> I went to my first Mary Kay makeup party after being invited by a friend.</li>
            <li> make your lips feel soft smooth.</li>
            <li> The buffer wasn&#x27;t as effective as i expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Finally, I ordered more, and I just love the results same as before.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t done a good job getting the dead skin off of my lips.</li>
            <li> I felt no huge difference since my lips are usually in good condition.</li>
            <li> I do feel like there could be more exfoliators in the lip scrub, but if you rub in on long enough, it does make your lips feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Amazon was so much easier.</li>
            <li> and this helps keep them hydrated and prevent them from drying out as much.</li>
            <li> Now that I can buy it much cheaper on Amazon</li>
            <li> ; I made the mistake of putting too much on one day and i was walking around looking like i just finished eating a load of greasy fried foods.</li>
            <li> The exfoliant for your lips (who would have thunk it???) makes an automatic difference and should definitely be followed up by the lip balm which makes your lips feel amazingly smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very silky feeling.</li>
            <li> and it really hurts.</li>
            <li> I just know this Mary Kay stuff really works well.</li>
            <li> So just be careful men not to put too much on:)</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; lips and not super dry lips, it is great...</li>
            <li> It makes my lips look and feel so much more fuller and pillowy than I ever expected it to, with even my nonobservant boyfriend taking notice!</li>
            <li> After using this once a day for 2 days I was back to normal and my lips look and feel soft and healthy again.  </li>
            <li> have such a problem with chapped lips and chapstick temporarily makes it better, but I have to use it constantly throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It smooths away any loose skin on your lips and makes them feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> lips were smooth for days afterwards, and it really sucked when I had to go back to using my regular chapstick</li>
            <li> I always get redness on my lips from the skin getting dry and coming off (or even just from Exfoliating), but daily use of the Satin Lip set by Mary Kay keeps my lips in a healthy &amp; even nude color, as they should be.</li>
            <li> Brings them right back from the edge of cracking.</li>
            <li> ; moisturizer really pentrates so much so that I am only using it in the morning and at night</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves lips soft</li>
            <li> I have gotten much better results with just plain old Chapstick.</li>
            <li> I love how this product exfoliates the dead skin off your lips!</li>
            <li> This is my first and last time.</li>
            <li> It does not last long, therefore invest in $1 Chapstick, it definitely works better.</li>
            <li> This is definitely NOT amazing or the best or any of the other words used in other reviews to describe it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried almost everything to try and clear up my chapped lips.</li>
            <li> I only do this 1 or 2 times a week, but it has made a real difference for my lips.  </li>
            <li> but I think it works better than chap stick or at least it does for me.</li>
            <li> the lip mask peels away dead skin and leaves your lips soft and the lip balm keeps them smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> The winter months really chaps my skin, especially my lips and hands.</li>
            <li> It makes your lips feel insanely soft, even using it without the scrub</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m especially grateful, because I really don&#x27;t like lipstick at all.</li>
            <li> The mask seems to work to help smooth out rough or dry lips.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna get my lips back to normal.</li>
            <li> The exfolliant is gentle, but removes the dry skip that would otherwise crack.  </li>
            <li> Really works my lips have never been softer and I alway have really dry lips.</li>
            <li> Especially in the colder seasons, they get pretty dry.</li>
            <li> The Mask works fast at removing dead skin cells and the Balm really does feel like satin as it deeply moisturizes.</li>
            <li> If you want soft lips, you definitely need to buy this!</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it a four instead of a five is because your lips only stay soft for about a day-</li>
            <li> If you suffer with some redness from dry lips, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately this gave me a cut on the top of my left lip followed by tiny little bumps that spread to both of my lips and a little around the mouth.</li>
            <li> The next day I woke up to a very swollen lip with small bumps...</li>
            <li> My lips totally dry out in the winter and the mask really helps remove dead skin.</li>
            <li> However, my lips are back to being dry after the balm is gone.</li>
            <li> I think a regular lip balm works as well, but the mask does help exfoliate the dry skin from the lips.</li>
            <li> This is my holy grail, the only thing that works with my very dry lips.</li>
            <li> the balm is long working.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this stuff for a long time.</li>
            <li> If you have lips that are peeling or just not soft, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product before, but ran out a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I tend to have horribly dry lips</li>
            <li> Living in an arid climate, I tend to have problems with my lips getting dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> The balm does wonders in the dry winter months</li>
            <li> it your lips are dry, cracked, peeling---try</li>
            <li> but if you need it to help with a dry lip problem, this product is just not what it is hyped up to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long but does help my extreme chapped lips!</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would last a little bit longer</li>
            <li> The exfoliating mask worked tolerably well, but the balm seemed to actually make my lips WORSE, though it is supposed to deeply condition lips over a span of several hours.</li>
            <li> It took a few applications of using this product for me to see a lasting result.</li>
            <li> Item as expected, timely arrival.</li>
            <li> It made my lips addicted, and after i stopped using it completely it took several weeks for my lips to heal.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t change to any other lip exfoliant product.</li>
            <li> The Lip Moisturizer looks and feels like plain old Petroleum Jelly, not real happy with it.</li>
            <li> i gave it four stars because the lip mask did not really smooth all my dry areas out</li>
            <li> I usually have painful cracked lips in winter, even though I use so many chap sticks.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping the Lip Mask would be Grainier/Rougher, but I guess it acts like a dissolvant since its supposed to left on the Lips for at least 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Not worth the investment.</li>
            <li> BUT it smells and tastes of sour milk.  </li>
            <li> It exfoliates well with little fuss and</li>
            <li> It actually  dried my lips out.</li>
            <li> I have the smoothest lips year round and find the lip balm keeps my lips moisturized all day after using the mask then applying the balm at the end of the night.  </li>
            <li> I do like the mask to remove dead skin as for the balm</li>
            <li> My lips can look pretty bad during the course of a day.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small tubes</li>
            <li> Took a few days but my addiction to Chapstick is gone now!</li>
            <li> When she had us try the Satin Lips mask, I was skeptical because of it&#x27;s gritty texture.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and was scared for a minute that it would never go back to normal.</li>
            <li> I came home from surgery and hospitalization and my lower lip was covered by a strip of hard, chapped skin.  </li>
            <li> I was so confused for a little bit, thinking they were just irritated and should go away at any time now</li>
            <li> I would buy again because it&#x27;s not that expensive like other Mary Kay products.</li>
            <li> Not good...</li>
            <li> THAT ARE BRUTAL ON YOUR LIPS , THEY ARE KEPT SOFT AND MOIST, PROTECTION AGAINEST THE WIND.</li>
            <li> well, lame.  </li>
            <li> The carmex actually made my lips in terrible shape.</li>
            <li> I have bad experiences with lip balms.</li>
            <li> it has now been two weeks and my bottom lip is bruised and skin is peeling off terribly</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Loved not having to go through a Mary Kay rep &amp; listening to a sales pitch!  Amazon was so much easier. Love the product!</li>
            <li> It does exfoliate my lips but it does not last.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  I&#x27;ve looked around for it.  It is the only thing that works well for my lips.</li>
            <li> Great service! The order was in a timely manner even though it was over Thanksgiving holidays, and it came with my two favorite Starbursts too! I would definitely order from Auntie&#x27;s closet again.</li>
            <li> Sampled this product at a Mary Kay product (I used Nivea brand chapstick before), and loved it!&lt;br /&gt;My lips were smooth for days afterwards, and it really sucked when I had to go back to using my regular chapstick (my lips didn&#x27;t feel chapped till 4 - 5 days after using MK).&lt;br /&gt;I have such a problem with chapped lips and chapstick temporarily makes it better, but I have to use it constantly throughout the day. The product makes your lips look healthier too.</li>
            <li> Ver good have used for years</li>
            <li> Love the lip balm. The most moisturising balm I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My Wife is happy with it.</li>
            <li> I got a gift set with several Mary Kay products and this is one of them.  Satin Lips works great!  I tend to have horribly dry lips and this helps keep them hydrated and prevent them from drying out as much.</li>
            <li> The lip mask made my lips smooth, and the balm made them soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to have found this product on Amazon.  I use the mask once every four nights and it my lips seem refreshed. I gave this a four because I wish that the balm had SPF in it.</li>
            <li> This is my holy grail, the only thing that works with my very dry lips.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff will buy again</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  It smooths away any loose skin on your lips and makes them feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Came quickly, and product works as advertised. An indispensable tool for women who wear a lot of lipstick in the winter. Keeps lips free of flaking skin that can lead to uneven lipstick application, and my lips are healthy and hydrated! Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
            <li> Did not exfoliate my peeling lips, second step just made my lips greasy. Just not working for me. May be okay for you.</li>
            <li> LOve love the MK satin lip set,as soon as these arrived i use them,they really make my lips feel and look fresh clean and radiant.Since the MK lady in my area has stop doing Mk,i am so happy that i can get all my MK products from amazon and the shipping is fast too.</li>
            <li> I love this product; I went to a Mary Kay Bronze Boot Camp in Tyler and I tried this and it was fabulous!! I will tell you, you will not recieve bottles like the ones in the picture. They&#x27;re small tubes but it doesn&#x27;t take much! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, specially for winter time when my lips always over dry.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping arrived on time and in perfect conditions.&lt;br /&gt;Product as seen on the picture.</li>
            <li> The product works exceptionally well for 3-8 hours. I do find it very useful in preventing chapped lips but if you want lasting softness without a constant hassle I&#x27;d find something else.</li>
            <li> Living in an arid climate, I tend to have problems with my lips getting dry and cracked. So I decided to try Mary Kay&#x27;s Satin Lips. The exfoliating mask worked tolerably well, but the balm seemed to actually make my lips WORSE, though it is supposed to deeply condition lips over a span of several hours. I have gotten much better results with just plain old Chapstick. Save your money and avoid this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a better product for exfoliating and softening lips. This is great for those dry, chapped winter lips.</li>
            <li> I only do this 1 or 2 times a week, but it has made a real difference for my lips.  I usually have painful cracked lips in winter, even though I use so many chap sticks.  The exfolliant is gentle, but removes the dry skip that would otherwise crack.  The &amp;#34;gel like&amp;#34; moisturizer really pentrates so much so that I am only using it in the morning and at night and I&#x27;m not using chap stick at all!</li>
            <li> The lip mask has a soft,silky texture and does not scratch or irritate. My lips are noticeably softer,smoother-textured, and visually appealing after using the mask. The lip balm is a great way to follow-up the mask because it provides moisture that seems to penetrate deep and prolongs the benefits of the mask.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I use from Mary Kay. Now that I can buy it much cheaper on Amazon I wouldn&#x27;t change to any other lip exfoliant product. The mask works wonders, I remove it with cotton balls and water. If you wear matte lipsticks, the mask removes those flakes from your lips and leaves a smooth surface. The balm does wonders in the dry winter months and I can apply my lip gloss over the balm with no problems. I recommend the MK Satin lip set to anybody looking to exfoliate their lips! P.S. It worked the first application!</li>
            <li> This lip set is the best thing that&#x27;s ever happened to my lips! Absolutely satisfied and will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I love Mary Kay Stain Lips. Maybe it is just me but I think it works better than chap stick or at least it does for me.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this item.  It exfoliates well with little fuss and the balm is long working.  Solved the flaking lip problem within a short time.</li>
            <li> I was hoping the Lip Mask would be Grainier/Rougher, but I guess it acts like a dissolvant since its supposed to left on the Lips for at least 2 minutes. The Lip Moisturizer looks and feels like plain old Petroleum Jelly, not real happy with it. Probably wont purchase again.</li>
            <li> a++  fastttttt shipping...  ty</li>
            <li> This lip set is amazing! The Mask works fast at removing dead skin cells and the Balm really does feel like satin as it deeply moisturizes. If that seems like a tag line to get you to buy it, it is because I never want Mary Kay to stop making this duo. It makes my lips look and feel so much more fuller and pillowy than I ever expected it to, with even my nonobservant boyfriend taking notice!</li>
            <li> It actually  dried my lips out. But then again  I&#x27;m always  licking my lips</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this set, so does my lips!!!</li>
            <li> I thought this set was supposed to make your lips softer (hence the name &amp;#34;satin lips&amp;#34;) but I guess my lips are just stubborn. I don&#x27;t get the mask. You put it on and leave for 2 minutes and then wash off. It hasn&#x27;t done a good job getting the dead skin off of my lips. The balm is nice though. I put it on at night and it actually makes my lips feel softer. However, my lips are back to being dry after the balm is gone. I would buy again because it&#x27;s not that expensive like other Mary Kay products.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I do feel like there could be more exfoliators in the lip scrub, but if you rub in on long enough, it does make your lips feel smooth. The balm is nice and moisturizing. I like using this product but have to wonder if I could&#x27;ve saved money by making a sugar lip scrub and follow up by using a dab of Vaseline on my lips...it might have the same effect.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost everything to try and clear up my chapped lips. Nothing I tried worked even though it was supposed to work miracles. I decided to try Mary Kay Satin Lips, and it has worked. I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 20s and I have been using Mary Kay products sense I was 14. I just love the value of their products! This set works great and I just love how it makes my lips soft and hydrated! I would buy this over an over again! Thank you Mary Kay for making such wonderful products!</li>
            <li> Had this before. Mary Kay is a great product &amp; really works.. Suppose to be delivered today.</li>
            <li> Took a few days but my addiction to Chapstick is gone now! I just use the balm once a day and my lips look great! Only need the mask occasionally now. Great product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff lip saver</li>
            <li> Love that there is no cancer causing petroleum in these products. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves lips soft</li>
            <li> seems low quality,doesnt get rid of chapped lips</li>
            <li> Another great product from Mary Kay, Lip set. My lips can look pretty bad during the course of a day. This lip balm is amazing it goes on smooth and takes care of &amp;#34;ashy lips&amp;#34; I made the mistake of putting too much on one day and i was walking around looking like i just finished eating a load of greasy fried foods. So just be careful men not to put too much on:)</li>
            <li> This product is nothing more than Vaseline. It does not last long, therefore invest in $1 Chapstick, it definitely works better. Not worth the investment.</li>
            <li> absolutely love, love this product. the lip mask peels away dead skin and leaves your lips soft and the lip balm keeps them smooth and soft. cant say enough good things about this product. it your lips are dry, cracked, peeling---try this-- you&#x27;ll love it !!</li>
            <li> Does the work&lt;br /&gt;Smells good also!</li>
            <li> The product was fine. It took a few applications of using this product for me to see a lasting result. I&#x27;m happy with the product overall.</li>
            <li> great for rough lips, which I have! Instant makeover!</li>
            <li> Great for scaring husbands and small children alike. My lips totally dry out in the winter and the mask really helps remove dead skin. Works better than a toothbrush for exfoliating. The satin lip balm feels like satin. I&#x27;ll be using this stuff for a long time.</li>
            <li> I actually really love Mary Kay, my mom has sold it and it&#x27;s always been wonderful. I especially love the Satin Hands and Satin Lips sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this gave me a cut on the top of my left lip followed by tiny little bumps that spread to both of my lips and a little around the mouth. I was so confused for a little bit, thinking they were just irritated and should go away at any time now but nope this lasted about two weeks. Very disappointed and was scared for a minute that it would never go back to normal. Not for me.</li>
            <li> No complaint love the product&amp;#34;&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I waited to review this product. The winter months really chaps my skin, especially my lips and hands. I purchased this product in hopes of keeping my lips from drying out. It works OK, but it is a bit of a hassle. I think a regular lip balm works as well, but the mask does help exfoliate the dry skin from the lips. It works ok....not fantastic. Worth the buy/try if you suffer from day, cracked, chapped lips as I do. I may purchase it again if my lips prove to stay cracked free this winter.</li>
            <li> Just received the products in the mail(literally) and i like it A Lot! i gave it four stars because the lip mask did not really smooth all my dry areas out but it did help! Definitely Recommend</li>
            <li> I have the smoothest lips year round and find the lip balm keeps my lips moisturized all day after using the mask then applying the balm at the end of the night.  Definitely would buy this again.</li>
            <li> First time using satin lips and I love it. This is a product I would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Really works my lips have never been softer and I alway have really dry lips.</li>
            <li> This product simply does not do anything to help.  The &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; seems to be nothing more than Vaseline and the lip mask does not provide you with even half decent exfoliating properties.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> My lips aren&#x27;t the best. Especially in the colder seasons, they get pretty dry. The exfoliant for your lips (who would have thunk it???) makes an automatic difference and should definitely be followed up by the lip balm which makes your lips feel amazingly smooth. If you haven&#x27;t tried it before the first time it will feel...oddly nice. It&#x27;s very silky feeling. After the balm you can apply either a lip gloss or lipstick and it looks amazing. Would definitely recommend and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I feel and see the difference after using this product. I think it should be used consistently to see improvement! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Product as described and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> I love this set. I love the availability outside of using a rep of Mary Kay.</li>
            <li> The mask works great for when my lips are dry!! Brings them right back from the edge of cracking.</li>
            <li> works good for chapped lips</li>
            <li> I love how this product exfoliates the dead skin off your lips! It&#x27;s great. It helps make a fresh slate for the lip balm you put on after. Mary Kay has great skincare products.</li>
            <li> I went to my first Mary Kay makeup party after being invited by a friend. The consultant had us sample and try these products that she said were guaranteed to make us want them all. When she had us try the Satin Lips mask, I was skeptical because of it&#x27;s gritty texture. I even asked her if she was sure it was for our lips. lol. After leaving it on for 2 minutes she had us wash it off and put on the balm. I felt no huge difference since my lips are usually in good condition. The next day I woke up to a very swollen lip with small bumps...it has now been two weeks and my bottom lip is bruised and skin is peeling off terribly and it really hurts. I will NEVER use any Mary Kay products again. This is my first and last time. So now I have to figure out how the hell I&#x27;m gonna get my lips back to normal.</li>
            <li> as a lip balm it works super well. it makes your lips feel nice and smooth and healthy. the reason I gave it a 4 out of five is the taste. it kind of taste like Vaseline but more bitter. so just make sure when you put it on don&#x27;t put too much or you will be able to taste it and it is a gross taste. but I would recommend this project.</li>
            <li> If you want soft lips, you definitely need to buy this! I loved it and I still use it often. The reason I gave it a four instead of a five is because your lips only stay soft for about a day- I was hoping it would last a little bit longer but hey, it still does what it needs to do. The gloss application it comes with for after you put the scrub on it so awesome! It makes your lips feel insanely soft, even using it without the scrub it&#x27;s great. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and it was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> works great! make your lips feel soft smooth.</li>
            <li> Lips did not feel like satin when completed.  Tried multiple times.  Gave as a gift as well, and they stated it didn&#x27;t work as well either.  Just using the lip gloss part of it, mask is not beneficial.</li>
            <li> If you have lips that are peeling or just not soft, this is the product for you. It works great! Item as expected, timely arrival. A+</li>
            <li> Great product.  I came home from surgery and hospitalization and my lower lip was covered by a strip of hard, chapped skin.  After using this once a day for 2 days I was back to normal and my lips look and feel soft and healthy again.  I had thought it would take longer to work.  I see another reviewer recommended a St. Ives scrub and cheaper lip balm - I didn&#x27;t try those, so I can&#x27;t say that they would have been as effective.  I just know this Mary Kay stuff really works well.</li>
            <li> I liked it. The buffer wasn&#x27;t as effective as i expected it to be. I like Mary Kay products a lot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product before, but ran out a long time ago. Finally, I ordered more, and I just love the results same as before. I always get redness on my lips from the skin getting dry and coming off (or even just from Exfoliating), but daily use of the Satin Lip set by Mary Kay keeps my lips in a healthy &amp; even nude color, as they should be. I&#x27;m especially grateful, because I really don&#x27;t like lipstick at all. If you suffer with some redness from dry lips, I highly recommend this product. I recommend some sort of protective lip balm like Vaseline to use instead of using up all the Satin Lip balm through the day. :)</li>
            <li> Gift item was liked by the person who I purchased this for.  Great item if you use mask and balm products.</li>
            <li> I read rave reviews of this on Makeupalley and thought I would give it a shot.  The mask seems to work to help smooth out rough or dry lips.  The balm is...well, lame.  It feels fairly waxy and just not the best balm by any stretch of the imagination.  It does not last all night either if you put it on before bed.  C.O. Bigelow 8 hour overnight lip balm is far superior to this. This is definitely NOT amazing or the best or any of the other words used in other reviews to describe it.  Maybe if you have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; lips and not super dry lips, it is great...but if you need it to help with a dry lip problem, this product is just not what it is hyped up to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the mask goes, it does smooth your lips nicely BUT it smells and tastes of sour milk.  Not good...</li>
            <li> definitely saved my lips this fall ! and of course its marry Kay so you know its quality I love the convince of ordering on line!</li>
            <li> Its just okay in my book. I do like the mask to remove dead skin as for the balm not so much.r</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR THE HARSH MARYLAND WINTERS THAT ARE BRUTAL ON YOUR LIPS , THEY ARE KEPT SOFT AND MOIST, PROTECTION AGAINEST THE WIND.</li>
            <li> I have bad experiences with lip balms. The carmex actually made my lips in terrible shape. It made my lips addicted, and after i stopped using it completely it took several weeks for my lips to heal. I use this only at night, and leaves my lips feeling good. One tube lasted me almost 9 months.</li>
            <li> Really works , love it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long but does help my extreme chapped lips!</li>
            <li> Nice product. Smooth feeling after using</li>
            <li> This combination if products is all you need to keep your lips in good shape</li>
            <li> used this before but i don&#x27;t have a mary kay lady-love to know i can get it here now! yea!</li>
            <li> Great lip balm and mask. The balm initially has a mild burn to it, but effective.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay met my expectations.</li>
