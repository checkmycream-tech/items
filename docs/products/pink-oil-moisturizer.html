            <li>Great product,</li>
            <li>It smells good, but it leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair with a greasy feel and it doesn&#x27;t blend that great.</li>
            <li>I use it all the time and it washes out real easy...</li>
            <li>The ease at which she gets through the hair is amazing.</li>

            <li>So glad I am able to still find it!</li>
            <li>This product is very good for me to use, I love the large bottle with easy access!</li>
            <li>(I put some on my palms and just touch the top of my head)</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s great for her natural hair as well!  </li>
            <li>The first use is kind of greasy</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other lotions and salves, this is by far the best and most economical product out there.</li>
            <li>A very good product to use when you want to moisturize and detangle and put a  sheen to  your hair without leaving it feeling wet , good for dry  brittle hair also.</li>
            <li>I did a comparison and found that this stuff works better than blue magic.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the hassle to return it.</li>
            <li>purchased the 32oz for $15 well worth it</li>
            <li>hmm never never put it near root, or ur hair wil be super super oily.</li>
            <li>This cream will not give you waves (brushing and du/tsu-ragging consistently does), but the moisture is like food for the hair.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I love the larger bottle with the pump.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I am caucasian and have very very fine dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Not mention, mom is working a lot less at making the hair look nice.</li>
            <li>This product has been a staple in the household and this was a bargain because stores don&#x27;t sell this large of a size.</li>
            <li>Pink lotion, applied to the ends of my hair and very lightly applied over my head</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The more I use pink lotion, the softer and stronger my hair becomes.</li>
            <li>so I know it&#x27;s not because I&#x27;m using too much.</li>
            <li>I been using this Luster&#x27;s Pink Oil Moisturizer Hair lotion  for many years.</li>
            <li>I love Luster&#x27;s Pink Oil Moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely LOVE Pink Oil moisturizer!</li>
            <li>keeps my hair looking shiny and healthy all day with no flyaway hair, prevents tangles, and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li>After that you just need to add a little each day and the greasiness will go away and it will just look healthy and moisturized like it</li>
            <li>I will use this forever...makes your hair so nice and thick with continue usage.love it.</li>
            <li>it helps with my dry hair but the smell is good and keep the hair lasting long</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t stay that way for super long.</li>
            <li>It really takes the frizz away and moisturizes and makes my (thick Italian)hair shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li>I typically use this product in the winter months, it keeps my hair nice and moist during dry months.</li>
            <li>i Been using Pink lotion on my hair since i was a little girl it amazing on my hair</li>
            <li>I am natural with 3c to 4b hair texture</li>
            <li>I went natural 5 years ago</li>
            <li>I always use this daily before bed (along with a soft CQP brush and a tsu-rag) in the first 2-3 weeks following a haircut.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for people with very dry, relaxed, or color treated hair.</li>
            <li>only bad thing I can say is that the shipping wasn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as stated and it was definitely a hit with my little ones....</li>

            <li> I add it when her hair is wet...</li>
            <li> but let me tell you nothing goes harder than the luster&#x27;s pink lotion</li>
            <li> My daughter is mixed and has curly and dry hair, its hard to keep it moisturized and manageable.</li>
            <li> It lasts forever because it only takes a small amount.</li>

            <li> Plus it is difficult to find this product in this large format.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it because there is much less discomfort during brushing and combing.</li>
            <li> I could never grow my hair past my shoulders, and now it reaches to the small of my back with no split ends!  </li>
            <li> i work it through all of her hair until its all covered, its a little shiny but her hair soaks it up some</li>
            <li> I used very little at a time</li>
            <li> So I have been in the wave game since 5th grade and now im 23; tried every product out there</li>
            <li> My daughter has very tough hair to comb.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence about this product. It smells good, but it leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair with a greasy feel and it doesn&#x27;t blend that great. I used very little at a time so I know it&#x27;s not because I&#x27;m using too much. after using it for about one week I did notice that her hair became less greasy, but I am not a big fan of it. I will finish the bottle because I paid for it, but probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am natural with 3c to 4b hair texture and I absolutely LOVE Pink Oil moisturizer! I apply daily and it keeps my hair moisturized and helps prevent frizz since it weighs my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing I can say is that the shipping wasn&#x27;t great. The bottle was shrink-wrapped for shipping, but, somehow there was still Pink Oil Moisturizer all over everything inside the shipping box.</li>
            <li> I am caucasian and have very very fine dry hair.

It also prevents breakage.  I could never grow my hair past my shoulders, and now it reaches to the small of my back with no split ends!

            <li> Iv been using this product for years on my daughter and it works every time. I add it when her hair is wet...comb it through and let it air dry.Its perfect, non greedy and smells great</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this here for this price. this is a goo deal it hard to find a the large size here where I live.</li>
            <li> I started back using this at night and after as a blow dry aid.  I did a comparison and found that this stuff works better than blue magic. Proably because its water based. So this would be the better alternitive for my hair..I wash deep condition and use a low heating blow dryer on my hair every three days and because of that, my hair is growing by leeps and bounds</li>
            <li> Great product. It adds plenty of moisture to your hair. It also gives a sheen that last all day. Would recommend it to people with nappy hair or anyone trying to add moisture to their hair.</li>
            <li> So I have been in the wave game since 5th grade and now im 23; tried every product out there but let me tell you nothing goes harder than the luster&#x27;s pink lotion... I use it all the time and it washes out real easy...definitely a must have for men wanting waves.</li>
            <li> I love this product - I used to be able to find it in Wal-Mart but now I can only find it online. This was a great price for the 32 oz as well. So glad I am able to still find it! It lasts forever because it only takes a small amount. It really takes the frizz away and moisturizes and makes my (thick Italian)hair shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li> Although the bottle was wrapped in plastic, I found that some of the hair lotion leaked into the bag. I didn&#x27;t think it was worth the hassle to return it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend who&#x27;s stationed in Afghanistan. He was very happy with it because 1. it&#x27;s a great product and 2. it&#x27;ll last him for his entire deployment.</li>
            <li> Was a gift and they liked it .</li>

After that you just need to add a little each day and the greasiness will go away and it will just look healthy and moisturized like it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the 32oz for $15 well worth it and the pump is very nice!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I been using this Luster&#x27;s Pink Oil Moisturizer Hair lotion  for many years.
