    <ol>
            <li>Great product, guys!</li>
            <li>Best non toxic deodorant I have ever used.  </li>

            <li>(hold it under warm running water) before applying.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff you do have to take time to run it under warm water for a min</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more of a 4-5 rubs on each side kind of applier.</li>
            <li>Now on to more important things: this deodorant is amazing!</li>
            <li>I gave it to my brother and he uses it on his feet, he says it&#x27;s okay.</li>

            <li>but well worth it!!</li>
            <li>Whatever you decide don&#x27;t give up… its worth it!!</li>

            <li>Great natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for an all vegan deodorant I could trust and after searching online I cam across SWEET!</li>
            <li>Keep your pits clean, use this product, and you should be ok.</li>
            <li>This deodorant does keep me odor free.</li>
            <li>I have found that holding the product to my underarm for about 30 seconds and then doing a few light swipes on each side is the best method for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it does take time to adjust to this deodorant, i.e. you have to warm up the deodorant prior to applying (I use a hair dryer or warm water).  </li>
            <li>By far, this product has given me amazing results.</li>
            <li>Buy Sweet</li>
            <li>My search for an effective, natural deodorant will continue.</li>
            <li>addition to SWEET working</li>
            <li>I had salt marks on my shirt from sweating so much-- but NO odor thanks to this amazing product.</li>
            <li>I hope this has been useful.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of chemical and aluminum free deodorant and just ended up stinky.</li>
            <li>After watching Dr. Oz do a segment on lemons (a lady going to exercise class used only fresh lemon juice for deodorant and had other people give her the smell test), I decided to try it and found it the best thing ever, so I just use fresh lemon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even an amazing addition to my new organic, natural lifestyle.</li>
            <li>- It really works!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s  worth it totally natural, and I have no odor I have tried so many natural deos</li>
            <li>In the hot &amp; humid weather, I have to reapply, a couple of times, throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>First you have to learn how to put it on.</li>
            <li>But otherwise this product is my first choice.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I really like it and would buy it again!</li>
            <li>This is such a good deodorant, I keep an extra on hand.  </li>
            <li>I live in a very hot climate).</li>
            <li>But I am willing to spend a little more time applying deodorant that is 100% vegan and keeps me from smelling!</li>
            <li>I have tried running under hot water but then too much product was applied for me.</li>
            <li>This is the first I&#x27;ve noticed this product on Amazon and have order from the manufacturer, bought at health fairs and also Whole Foods in Michigan</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried nearly every brand available at the store (I am a sucker for good smells and packaging).</li>
            <li>Definitely more for people who would rather have a non-chemical, natural alternative to major brands.</li>
            <li>Pretty good product, i like that it&#x27;s from a small business, cruelty free and very basic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I just bought this at Lassens for $9, so the $15 price on Amazon is very high.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, you have to wet it under warm/hot water for it to go on, but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>This really works well for people who want to avoid chemicals and fragrance and who don&#x27;t want body odor.</li>
            <li>(they don&#x27;t have it at my FL whole foods)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor, but on me, it works well, even when I&#x27;m nervous.    </li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>After learning about all the chemicals and risks with standard antiperspirant/deodorant, I began my search for an all natural safe alternative.</li>
            <li>I am willing to ignore that though as this one keeps me dry and odor free.</li>
            <li>Go about your business all day, even in a hot climate (where I live)  </li>
            <li>This is the first natural deodorant I have used without having to also use perfume and it lasted almost all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over 1 year and have learned that it will go on really easily without crumbling all over the floor, just by getting the deodorant itself wet each time you use it.</li>
            <li>The only set back is that it has to be warmed a bit before it is able to spread on.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>It keeps me drier than most other natural deodorants.</li>
            <li>Also, my underarm skin is real sensitive, and there are lots of mainstream brands I can&#x27;t use --</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about a natural product offering as much protection as regular deodorant, but this brand is far more effective.</li>
            <li>I like supporting sweet little businesses like this.</li>
            <li>FINALLY, a natural deodorant that works for me!  </li>
            <li>Usually, I get more on the floor than under my arms.</li>
            <li>and wow!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s more expensive than most other natural deodorants</li>
            <li>I like the ingredients that are used in making it - all natural and with none of the harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised that people say it is crumbling.</li>
            <li>It is a little crumbly, but just wet it like it says, and you really will smell sweet all day!</li>
            <li>Ok, when I received this I was full of a cold.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had any unusual crumbling problems, except at the end, which is the same story with regular deodorants.</li>
            <li>This is the only natural deoderant I have found that works!</li>
            <li>The other products I&#x27;ve tried only held my BO at bay for a short time (a few hours) before I&#x27;d smell my own BO.  </li>
            <li>Secondly this is NOT an antiperspirant so it does not stop the natural sweating process</li>
            <li>I did re-apply it once during the day (five hours after the first application) when I felt it started to wane a little, however, there was no b o at all.</li>
            <li>I found it very dry and hard to rub on my underarms unless I run it under hot water first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using natural deodorants for a long time now.</li>
            <li>I purchased it taking a little risk because I thought the price was a little steep but was willing to try something that did really work and was 100% vegan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d go into the restroom at work and give my pits a quick wash &amp; reapply (at least once).  </li>
            <li>I know that I shouldn&#x27;t be using the highly toxic conventional deodorant/antiperspirants.</li>

            <li> I know that I shouldn&#x27;t be using the highly toxic conventional deodorant/antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> Prior to using SWEET, I used Secret.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know that it keeps me dry, but I wasn&#x27;t necessarily looking for that.</li>
            <li> The only downside to it is it is a little more difficult to apply then regular deodorants we are all used too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect the same &#x27;slick&#x27; from a natural deodorant that I would expect from its chemical counterpart, but this is definitely no substitute.</li>
            <li> Definitely follow the directions and wet the deodorant/product</li>
            <li> I still keep a commercial antiperspirant around for when I really do NOT want to sweat - like a job interview or some dress up sleeveless affair.</li>
            <li> Finally, it&#x27;s just a little inconvenient to wet it each time with warm water.  </li>
            <li> Other natural deodorants I have used break down in about two hours.</li>
            <li> I especially like the fact that it has no propylene glycol or parabens - ingredients that are found in other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants, but which are harmful to our health.</li>
            <li> my armpits stayed dry and odor-free even though my shirt was soaked with sweat.</li>
            <li> Probably the only negative is that you have to really rub it on a few times to get it to soften.  </li>
            <li> It never crumbles as long as it&#x27;s wet when it is applied.</li>
            <li> You need a LOT less then when you use a commercial brand.</li>
            <li> No more yellow on my white shirts</li>
            <li> Yes it can be crumbly and some batches are a little different then others.</li>
            <li> If I run out and use a commercial brand, underarm odor returns within a few days.</li>
            <li> This product worked well the first day, but after that It failed.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to try other products from this one-person business though.  </li>
            <li> It kept me for another six hours before it started to break down.</li>
            <li> but I note that I sweat quite a bit less</li>
            <li> I sweat less under my arms</li>
            <li> (overtime I&#x27;ve noticed I sweat less and</li>
            <li> But then again, I&#x27;m not a sweaty mess, so maybe it does.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t stink (well, not until a few days sans shower have passed, but when does that happen?).</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s messy; it crumbles.  </li>
            <li> After an hour or so, it also gave off a very unpleasant, strong, musky smell.  </li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it&#x27;s made in small batches and not mass produced.</li>
            <li> No more sticky residue-&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> It feels like you&#x27;ve hardly put any on</li>
            <li> I mean nothing works like this .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, I am convinced that store bought chemical deodorant not only has aluminum and chemicals that are bad for you, but there is some sort of chemical that makes the symptoms worse (smelly, stinky, sweaty arm pits) so that you become dependent on them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I have noticed all of the &amp;#34;side effects&amp;#34; of using Secret deodorant are gone:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I was using Toms prior to this and hated the smell it gave me when put to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> I  don&#x27;t mind running water on it to get it to a usable state, but unfortunately I am allergic.</li>
            <li> but when I opened it, before putting it on, it had an unpleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping that it would keep me drier, but it doesn&#x27;t do a bad job.</li>
            <li> even Toms of Maine gave me a painful rash!</li>

            <li> I just bought this product and it has met and surpassed my expectations! This is the first natural deodorant I have used without having to also use perfume and it lasted almost all day. I did re-apply it once during the day (five hours after the first application) when I felt it started to wane a little, however, there was no b o at all. (I think I was just \\&quot;playing it safe\\&quot;. I live in a very hot climate). It kept me for another six hours before it started to break down. Other natural deodorants I have used break down in about two hours. I like the ingredients that are used in making it - all natural and with none of the harmful chemicals. I especially like the fact that it has no propylene glycol or parabens - ingredients that are found in other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants, but which are harmful to our health. I also like the fact that it&#x27;s made in small batches and not mass produced. This shows that care is taken in formulating it. Great product, guys! Keep it up!</li>
            <li> Ok, when I received this I was full of a cold.  I&#x27;ve put this deodorant to the test and just can&#x27;t believe how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have put this to the test and have sweated with this deodorant.  However there is NO smell.  I repeat, NO smell.  I can&#x27;t believe it and I am still puzzled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, you have to wet it under warm/hot water for it to go on, but that&#x27;s ok.  It dries within seconds.  Go about your business all day, even in a hot climate (where I live)  yes you will sweat but no you wont smell!  I was using Toms prior to this and hated the smell it gave me when put to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I hope this has been useful.  Buy Sweet - It really works!</li>
            <li> This is the only natural deoderant I have found that works! I also like that it doesn&#x27;t contain any lavender, hops, and or tree oil, which are estrogen promoters. Probably the only negative is that you have to really rub it on a few times to get it to soften.  I am willing to ignore that though as this one keeps me dry and odor free.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff you do have to take time to run it under warm water for a min it&#x27;s  worth it totally natural, and I have no odor I have tried so many natural deos nothing I mean nothing works like this . It is unreal!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using natural deodorants for a long time now. I&#x27;ve tried nearly every brand available at the store (I am a sucker for good smells and packaging). To be honest, Sweet Sweat doesn&#x27;t offer either. The packaging is fairly minimalist, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything. But neither do I!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know that it keeps me dry, but I wasn&#x27;t necessarily looking for that. But then again, I&#x27;m not a sweaty mess, so maybe it does. But I don&#x27;t stink (well, not until a few days sans shower have passed, but when does that happen?). Keep your pits clean, use this product, and you should be ok. My white shirts aren&#x27;t yellow, either.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any unusual crumbling problems, except at the end, which is the same story with regular deodorants. But it doesn&#x27;t make my underarms feel sticky or tacky or slimy, so that is a big plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;I do have to run it under water before I apply, but that is because I like a lot of deodorant on at a time. Not a lot-a lot, but I&#x27;m more of a 4-5 rubs on each side kind of applier. (Maybe I will work on that.)</li>
            <li> I was looking for an all vegan deodorant I could trust and after searching online I cam across SWEET! I purchased it taking a little risk because I thought the price was a little steep but was willing to try something that did really work and was 100% vegan. I received the product and have been using it for about 3 weeks now. I could not be happier with this deodorant. The only downside to it is it is a little more difficult to apply then regular deodorants we are all used too. But I am willing to spend a little more time applying deodorant that is 100% vegan and keeps me from smelling! I will definitely continue using this product and have been recommending it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> This product worked well the first day, but after that It failed. I&#x27;m in the Caribbean and it could not hold up. I gave it to my brother and he uses it on his feet, he says it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> This stuff crumbles, and goes all over the floor and my clothes. Because it doesn&#x27;t glide on, I had to rub it onto my armpits, which resulted in a rash. I don&#x27;t expect the same &#x27;slick&#x27; from a natural deodorant that I would expect from its chemical counterpart, but this is definitely no substitute. My search for an effective, natural deodorant will continue.</li>
            <li> FINALLY, a natural deodorant that works for me!  I&#x27;ve been trying to reduce my chemical load (household cleaners, laundry detergent, shampoo, conditioner, skincare, etc.) and the deodorant was the toughest one.  I&#x27;d actually given up and had mentioned it to a friend and she encouraged me to keep trying -- every body is different.  The other products I&#x27;ve tried only held my BO at bay for a short time (a few hours) before I&#x27;d smell my own BO.  I&#x27;d go into the restroom at work and give my pits a quick wash &amp; reapply (at least once).  By the time I got home, same thing.  NOT anymore!  I&#x27;m sooooo glad I found this -- I apply in the morning and I don&#x27;t smell myself, even when waking up the next day.  I haven&#x27;t tried working out yet, so we&#x27;ll see.  Definitely follow the directions and wet the deodorant/product (hold it under warm running water) before applying.</li>
            <li> I found it very dry and hard to rub on my underarms unless I run it under hot water first. I did not work all that great.</li>
            <li> I really love this deodorant. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 1 year and have learned that it will go on really easily without crumbling all over the floor, just by getting the deodorant itself wet each time you use it. I&#x27;m really surprised that people say it is crumbling. It never crumbles as long as it&#x27;s wet when it is applied. The instructions are even on the back of the deodorant!</li>
            <li> In the hot &amp; humid weather, I have to reapply, a couple of times, throughout the day.  Also, it&#x27;s messy; it crumbles.  Usually, I get more on the floor than under my arms.</li>
            <li> This really works well for people who want to avoid chemicals and fragrance and who don&#x27;t want body odor. I have tried both varieties. This is an adjustment from commercial brand anti-perspirant/deodorant. First you have to learn how to put it on. Yes it can be crumbly and some batches are a little different then others. I have found that holding the product to my underarm for about 30 seconds and then doing a few light swipes on each side is the best method for me. It feels like you&#x27;ve hardly put any on but it is enough. I have tried running under hot water but then too much product was applied for me. You need a LOT less then when you use a commercial brand. Secondly this is NOT an antiperspirant so it does not stop the natural sweating process but I note that I sweat quite a bit less and I never have that sticky &amp;#34;uhoh I forgot my deodorant today feeling&amp;#34;, and I never have underarm odor. If I run out and use a commercial brand, underarm odor returns within a few days. I still keep a commercial antiperspirant around for when I really do NOT want to sweat - like a job interview or some dress up sleeveless affair. But otherwise this product is my first choice. This is the first I&#x27;ve noticed this product on Amazon and have order from the manufacturer, bought at health fairs and also Whole Foods in Michigan (they don&#x27;t have it at my FL whole foods)</li>
            <li> After learning about all the chemicals and risks with standard antiperspirant/deodorant, I began my search for an all natural safe alternative. By far, this product has given me amazing results. I love how easily it glides on with the help of a bit of water. And no odor issues at all tho you may still sweat with this product. It&#x27;s even an amazing addition to my new organic, natural lifestyle. I highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s more expensive than most other natural deodorants but well worth it!!</li>
            <li> This deodorant does keep me odor free. I was hoping that it would keep me drier, but it doesn&#x27;t do a bad job. It keeps me drier than most other natural deodorants. I just love that it is chemical free.</li>
            <li> I just bought this at Lassens for $9, so the $15 price on Amazon is very high. Now on to more important things: this deodorant is amazing! I know that I shouldn&#x27;t be using the highly toxic conventional deodorant/antiperspirants. Also, my underarm skin is real sensitive, and there are lots of mainstream brands I can&#x27;t use -- even Toms of Maine gave me a painful rash! Anyway, I thought I would give this a try and wow! Yesterday I went on a three-hour horseback ride in 95 degree heat. I also walked up some steep hills. I had salt marks on my shirt from sweating so much-- but NO odor thanks to this amazing product. I had the same experience at the gym-- my armpits stayed dry and odor-free even though my shirt was soaked with sweat. I was skeptical about a natural product offering as much protection as regular deodorant, but this brand is far more effective. It is a little crumbly, but just wet it like it says, and you really will smell sweet all day!</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this product.  It seems like it was made with great love, care &amp; research.  Great natural ingredients.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me.  It flaked off on my underarm skin, leaving a residue, which I prefer not to have on me or my clothes.  After an hour or so, it also gave off a very unpleasant, strong, musky smell.  Finally, it&#x27;s just a little inconvenient to wet it each time with warm water.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to try other products from this one-person business though.  I like supporting sweet little businesses like this.</li>
            <li> This is such a good deodorant, I keep an extra on hand.  It doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor, but on me, it works well, even when I&#x27;m nervous.    I would like to add a P.S. on this.  After watching Dr. Oz do a segment on lemons (a lady going to exercise class used only fresh lemon juice for deodorant and had other people give her the smell test), I decided to try it and found it the best thing ever, so I just use fresh lemon.  Ck out the show:  http://www.doctoroz.com/episode/all-day-energy-diet-conquer-your-exhaustion-just-7-days?video_id&#x3D;3806281445001</li>
            <li> Pretty good product, i like that it&#x27;s from a small business, cruelty free and very basic ingredients. The only set back is that it has to be warmed a bit before it is able to spread on. Otherwise, I really like it and would buy it again! Definitely more for people who would rather have a non-chemical, natural alternative to major brands.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year now and it really works. I have tried many different types of chemical and aluminum free deodorant and just ended up stinky. Prior to using SWEET, I used Secret.  I always had a residual wax under my arm, my white shirts would get yellow under the arm pits, and I could never NOT wear deodorant (I would STINK).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to SWEET working, I have noticed all of the &amp;#34;side effects&amp;#34; of using Secret deodorant are gone:&lt;br /&gt;1. No more sticky residue-&lt;br /&gt;2. I sweat less under my arms (overtime I&#x27;ve noticed I sweat less and less)&lt;br /&gt;3. No more yellow on my white shirts&lt;br /&gt;4. I use to be a stinky person….now I, literally, can go without deodorant. (I try not to but if I forget to put it on, no big deal)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I am convinced that store bought chemical deodorant not only has aluminum and chemicals that are bad for you, but there is some sort of chemical that makes the symptoms worse (smelly, stinky, sweaty arm pits) so that you become dependent on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it does take time to adjust to this deodorant, i.e. you have to warm up the deodorant prior to applying (I use a hair dryer or warm water).  The cocoa butter seems to be easier to apply then the shea butter.  Whatever you decide don&#x27;t give up… its worth it!!</li>
            <li> I  don&#x27;t mind running water on it to get it to a usable state, but unfortunately I am allergic. Made the skin darker, itchy and blistered.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail and was hopeful about this deodorant but when I opened it, before putting it on, it had an unpleasant smell.  I could not imagine the smell improving by putting it on my skin.  I did not try it and am sending it back.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant. Best non toxic deodorant I have ever used.  Actually works without using fragrance.  Highly recommend</li>
