            <li>The face moisturizer is also just as fantastic.</li>

            <li>No greasy feel, absorbs quick, lightweight and I can even use it as a touch up OVER my makeup to smooth during the day.</li>
            <li>That just seems so much healthier than the chemicals that are in most eye serums.  </li>
            <li>we have wonderful products like this UltraSpa Skincare Pro Anti Aging Eye Complex.</li>
            <li>thank you so much :)</li>
            <li>I mean every brand claims to have the newest and best.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this UltraSpa Skincare Pro for anyone who wants a great Anti Aging product.</li>
            <li>Lucky for u</li>
            <li>This is a great eye serum for dark circles and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I love trying new anti aging products</li>
            <li>It absorbs quick and leaves my face feeling fresh and tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>eyes are very sensitive -- many products cause my eyes to tear or sting.  </li>
            <li>I love the color of it and it is very soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>It works that fast!!</li>
            <li>This is light and not irritating on the skin.</li>
            <li>I read somewhere, either in the original listing or in one of the many e-mails this seller sends you, that you should feel a difference instantly.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend not advertising Best Eye Cream for Dark Circles Under Eyes, I was looking for a renewing and firming cream with more natural ingredients and less preservatives and chemicals..</li>
            <li>What I love best about this product is that you need only very little, not even a full pump for both eyes total.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery</li>
            <li>So far so good, I have only used it for (1) week</li>
            <li>, The texture is very soft and smooth on my skin</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>and while today is the first time I have used the product, I can tell that I am going to not only love it, but will definitely be ordering more...</li>
            <li>After using,  this skin around the eye is left looking brighter and more youthful.</li>
            <li>This product does the same or more than super high priced eye serums.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 35 years old and luckily haven&#x27;t had too many problems with fine lines yet, just puffiness and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Another thing I absolutely love is while it takes a few minutes to completely absorb, I noticed that my puffiness was greatly reduced and my dark circles were fading about the time I felt that it was almost completely absorbed!</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving this product and will come back to review after 30 days of use.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice eye cream for dark circles, it seems to be lightening the area I have that concerns me but</li>
            <li>Most eye lotions and gels need time to work, as in weeks, but since I am being pressured into writing a review after only using it for a few days, my honest opinion is that I have no idea if it does what it claims it can do.</li>
            <li>Easy on, doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes (so many do!), and by using it daily I can keep those circles from getting dark!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have crows feet</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li>have not had much time to try it</li>
            <li>The serum is okay, moisturizing, but not very emollient.</li>
            <li>I like this product so much that I am going to order their Anti-Aging Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she really loves it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this eye cream!</li>
            <li>This stem cell rich eye cream is very soothing to the skin and has helped my skin look very refreshed and calmed down.</li>
            <li>This Pro Anti aging eye cream is for dark circles, puffiness, fine lines, crow’s feet and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>At first I could only use it once a day as I noticed some redness after using it twice.</li>
            <li>I have been using it consistently since then and this week a friend who I had not seen since starting this product commented that I looked well rested.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dark circles as often and when I do, they are soooo light, only I really notice it.</li>
            <li>which it did help with reducing my fine lines and firm my skin.</li>
            <li>Add the fact that it&#x27;s made from plant stem cells and a natural product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so busy and always in a hurry and worried about my looks.</li>
            <li>It hurts my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Ultra Spa Skincare Eye Complex is a lightly scented gel that is not heavy or oily.  </li>
            <li>Natural, effective and not too expensive-</li>
            <li>After using this product for not even a week, I&#x27;ve noticed a major difference in the skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li>have noticed a marked improvement in my dark circles and the fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She has been showing signs of heavy laugh lines and crows feet&lt;</li>
            <li>My skin around my eyes is super sensitive and this complex did not cause any burning or irritation.</li>
            <li>After using Ultra Spa eye complex, the finer lines under my eyes have been significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>One of the first signs of aging starts around our eyes in the form of little &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It is a high quality, effective under eye gel and it is much less expensive than others I&#x27;ve tried yet it works as well as they do.</li>

            <li> After using Ultra Spa eye complex, the finer lines under my eyes have been significantly reduced.</li>

            <li> It is a high quality, effective under eye gel and it is much less expensive than others I&#x27;ve tried yet it works as well as they do.</li>
            <li> It spreads easy and you need just a small amount... put a few dabs around my eyes and then spread the excess to the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> and I can feel my eyes a little tighter and really soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ingredients boast natural products, including cucumber, aloe, green tea and ecinacea.</li>
            <li> single.</li>
            <li> and really does help with dark circles at least for me.</li>
            <li> have only used it a few times.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes, firms, tightens, and after only a week I have less noticeable dark circles!</li>
            <li> After only a few days I can tell that the puffiness has diminished under my eyes and already the dark circles are a little lighter.  </li>
            <li> and a very little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for my dark circles</li>
            <li> so how it can be considered the &amp;#34;best eye cream for dark circles&amp;#34</li>
            <li> We start getting saggy skin and dark circles around our eyes too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> About 4 days after I started using the complex I started to notice that my crows feet weren&#x27;t as noticeable and my sagging under eye skin appeared smaller.</li>
            <li> The dark circles were also diminished.</li>
            <li> I have added this complex to may daily routine</li>
            <li> the cream reduces dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> I am 59 and have been plagued with puffy under eyes and dark circles.</li>

            <li> Ok so I&#x27;m always on the look-out for perfect eye serum.... I mean every brand claims to have the newest and best. Well... I think I found it! This product does the same or more than super high priced eye serums. In fact I like this better than a product I bought for almost $100.00 from my dermatologists office. It moisturizes, firms, tightens, and after only a week I have less noticeable dark circles! No greasy feel, absorbs quick, lightweight and I can even use it as a touch up OVER my makeup to smooth during the day. It&#x27;s ingredients boast natural products, including cucumber, aloe, green tea and ecinacea. There is also an ingredient called &amp;#34;eye bright extract&amp;#34; no idea what that is, but it sure works as promised! I was given this as a gift from a friend, and now use both Ultra Spa products in my daily regimine. The face moisturizer is also just as fantastic. I have brought both products along to my esthetician who agreed by its list of ingredients its a great product. Natural, effective and not too expensive- what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this UltraSpa Eye serum for about 3 days now and I can already tell a few differences.  This is a great eye serum for dark circles and wrinkles. After only a few days I can tell that the puffiness has diminished under my eyes and already the dark circles are a little lighter.  I don&#x27;t really have crows feet so I can&#x27;t tell if it helped with that, but I can tell it will help prevent them.  Since it&#x27;s made from plant stem cell cream I feel good about using it on my skin.  That just seems so much healthier than the chemicals that are in most eye serums.  The under eye gel feels soothing as soon as you apply it.  It goes on without any stickiness and absorbs well and you can feel it tightening the skin as soon as you apply it.  I love trying new anti aging products and I&#x27;m happy I got to review this item. It is a high quality, effective under eye gel and it is much less expensive than others I&#x27;ve tried yet it works as well as they do. Add the fact that it&#x27;s made from plant stem cells and a natural product and it&#x27;s even better than most!  #bestundereyecream</li>
            <li> I love how this eye cream soaks right into my skin.  It&#x27;s refreshing and I believe I&#x27;m seeing an improvement&lt;br /&gt;already!</li>
            <li> Eye Lines and circles are reduced! A fine product.</li>
            <li> After using Ultra Spa eye complex, the finer lines under my eyes have been significantly reduced. It&#x27;s amazing how much better I look around my eyes, the bags are fading away. It absorbs into my skin very quickly and isn&#x27;t sticky. *I received this product at a reduced cost in exchange for an honest unbiased review.*</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. It&#x27;s lightweight and non-greasy which is perfect for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Great product, along with face moisturizer. The company has great customer service</li>
            <li> I was offered this UltraSpa Skincare Pro for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered it. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two weeks now and I can feel my eyes a little tighter and really soft. I don&#x27;t have dark circles as often and when I do, they are soooo light, only I really notice it. I definitely recommend this UltraSpa Skincare Pro for anyone who wants a great Anti Aging product.</li>
            <li> This product delivers and so does the company. Fast shipping and really does help with dark circles at least for me.</li>
            <li> Just ok.  Doesn&#x27;t do anything for my dark circles so how it can be considered the &amp;#34;best eye cream for dark circles&amp;#34; is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;Does seem like a nice moisturizer and i&#x27;m using it all over my face.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery and while today is the first time I have used the product, I can tell that I am going to not only love it, but will definitely be ordering more...</li>
            <li> So far so good, I will update as I continue to see results.</li>
            <li> I like this product. This is light and not irritating on the skin. Its not greasy and I like the smell too. I have been using this for a week now and have not seen any significant changes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately we are all getting older, every. single. day! Lucky for u we have wonderful products like this UltraSpa Skincare Pro Anti Aging Eye Complex. One of the first signs of aging starts around our eyes in the form of little &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34;. We start getting saggy skin and dark circles around our eyes too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt good about putting the product around my eyes because it is paraben, dye, alcohol and filler free. My skin around my eyes is super sensitive and this complex did not cause any burning or irritation. About 4 days after I started using the complex I started to notice that my crows feet weren&#x27;t as noticeable and my sagging under eye skin appeared smaller. The dark circles were also diminished. I have added this complex to may daily routine and I look forward to seeing even further results from this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This eye gel did not help me personally with puffiness like it said it would disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> So far so good, I have only used it for (1) week and I really love it.  My under eye is softer.  thank you so much :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot if eye creams and serums, but now I&#x27;ve found a keeper. This serum absorbs so nicely and feels great. Most importantly, I can see a visible difference in the lines under and beside my eyes. ( I apply it twice daily). I wasn&#x27;t expecting much and I&#x27;m glad to say I was wrong. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any results as yet.  Too soon to comment on its effectiveness.  Will report after a month.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a reduced price for reviewing it.I have only been using the Anti Aging Eye Complex a few days but already notice subtle differences around my eyes. Feel sure that with continued use I will see even more improvement. I am looking forward to seeing the differences with the lessening of puffiness under my eyes and less pronounce dark circles. Would reorder at regular price.</li>
            <li> I just started using this eye cream but I can already see the difference in my eyes. I love it</li>
            <li> This Pro Anti aging eye cream is for dark circles, puffiness, fine lines, crow’s feet and wrinkles.  We purchased this eye complex in a promotion for testing and review.  After using,  this skin around the eye is left looking brighter and more youthful. It seems to have improved thickness of the skin and firmness. The cream helps to prevent future damage to the skin and diminishes signs of photo aging.  Because it contains plant stem cells, hyaluronic acids, Vitamin C and Echinacea the cream reduces dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice eye cream for dark circles, it seems to be lightening the area I have that concerns me but have only used it a few times.  I believe over time it will lighten more</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. I received it last week and am already being asked to leave a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had much time to try it but the little bit I did, I&#x27;m not impressed. The bottle says to use it only at night but by the next night, the gel gums up inside the bottle and you have to waste a whole bunch. My eyes don&#x27;t feel instant lift and refreshment. I read somewhere, either in the original listing or in one of the many e-mails this seller sends you, that you should feel a difference instantly. Well, I don&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in short, for the few days I&#x27;ve been using it, I&#x27;m not impressed and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. Most eye lotions and gels need time to work, as in weeks, but since I am being pressured into writing a review after only using it for a few days, my honest opinion is that I have no idea if it does what it claims it can do.</li>
            <li> The serum is okay, moisturizing, but not very emollient. I strongly recommend not advertising Best Eye Cream for Dark Circles Under Eyes, I was looking for a renewing and firming cream with more natural ingredients and less preservatives and chemicals..</li>
            <li> Awesome product, thank you!</li>
            <li> I love the UltraSpa Anit Aging Eye Cream! I&#x27;m 35 years old and luckily haven&#x27;t had too many problems with fine lines yet, just puffiness and dark circles under my eyes. What I love best about this product is that you need only very little, not even a full pump for both eyes total. Another thing I absolutely love is while it takes a few minutes to completely absorb, I noticed that my puffiness was greatly reduced and my dark circles were fading about the time I felt that it was almost completely absorbed! It works that fast!! That&#x27;s definitely what I need beings I&#x27;m so busy and always in a hurry and worried about my looks. After using this product for not even a week, I&#x27;ve noticed a major difference in the skin under my eyes. My dark circles and puffiness seem to be permanently diminishing and I have sort of a lifted look and feeling around my eye area! I definitely recommend this eye cream to anyone that wants excellent results without the pricetag! It works way better than the stuff I always buy from the department store! I received this product at a promotional rate in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Since using this product I have noticed a reduced difference in the fine lines at the corners of my eyes. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks now but I can see an improvement around my eyes. So far I&#x27;m loving this product and will come back to review after 30 days of use.</li>
            <li> I am 59 and have been plagued with puffy under eyes and dark circles. I started using this product as soon as I received it in mid April. At first I could only use it once a day as I noticed some redness after using it twice. After two weeks I decided to try it morning and night and had no irritation. I have been using it consistently since then and this week a friend who I had not seen since starting this product commented that I looked well rested.This was a welcomed change to being told I look tired all the time. 😃</li>
            <li> ONLY BEEN ABOUT A WEEK, SEEMS TO ALREADY HELPEDWITH THE PUFFINESS</li>
            <li> This eye cream goes on smoothly, has no scent (which is great for me!) and a very little goes a long way. I have used it at night as a repair cream and during the day under makeup.  It is a very versatile and effective product.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Nice eye cream</li>
            <li> Ultra Spa Skincare Eye Complex is a lightly scented gel that is not heavy or oily.  It spreads easy and you need just a small amount... put a few dabs around my eyes and then spread the excess to the rest of my face. It absorbs quick and leaves my face feeling fresh and tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyes are very sensitive -- many products cause my eyes to tear or sting.  I have been using Ultra Spa twice a day without any issues.  I am quite pleased with the results -- have noticed a marked improvement in my dark circles and the fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable. I like this product so much that I am going to order their Anti-Aging Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is well packaged and comes in a good quality pump bottle.  It&#x27;s made in the USA and has a &amp;#34;No Questions Asked&amp;#34; Money Back Guarantee.  I received this product at a discounted price in return for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it. It hurts my sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has been showing signs of heavy laugh lines and crows feet&lt;br /&gt;so I got this eye gel for her about a week ago and she really loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She hasn’t seen any major improvements yet but is very happy with the&lt;br /&gt;way it goes on and how her skin feels under the eyes.</li>
            <li> #bestundereyecream  I love the color of this eye cream and the way it feels on my skin, The texture is very soft and smooth on my skin and I loved how you can see the ingredients through the bottle which is really cool! It has stem cells which help with wrinkles and do refresh the skin it is used on. It is also a good anti aging face cream and eye cream which it did help with reducing my fine lines and firm my skin. I highly recommend this eye cream!</li>
            <li> Easy on, doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes (so many do!), and by using it daily I can keep those circles from getting dark!</li>
            <li> #bestundereyecream  This stem cell rich eye cream is very soothing to the skin and has helped my skin look very refreshed and calmed down. I love the color of it and it is very soft on the skin. I recommend to add this to your daily skincare routine!</li>
