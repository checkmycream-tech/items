            <li>The craftsmanship is awesome.</li>
            <li>Best sleep cap ever for longer hair!  </li>
            <li>This scarf is made beautifully.</li>
            <li>it works great...</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that it came in the mail so fast!</li>
            <li>Oh my gosh this wrap is amazing.</li>
            <li>but it is still a nice scarf.</li>
            <li>- it isn&#x27;t toxic and it washes out, but it is kind of a pain.</li>
            <li>it is very comfortable to sleep in as well</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Its like in better condition than when I put the scarf on...</li>
            <li>but more of a &amp;#34;do rag&amp;#34; that ties in the back.&lt;br /&gt;Fine</li>
            <li>I am glad to have something that doesn&#x27;t look like mammy would wear it.  </li>
            <li>Though I love the shape &amp; construction</li>
            <li>you are FAMILIAR with silk in its many forms, as I am, you will know for sure when you feel it a bit more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;But for the purpose it was created for, it is more than worthy.  </li>
            <li>It was comfortable to wear and did not come off in the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wrap ties keep it securely  in place all night.  </li>
            <li>This silk scarf definitely prevents my head from sweating and the texture is very nice.</li>
            <li>love this, it cover your whole head if you wear braids</li>
            <li>This scarf/head wrap is perfectly shaped for short or long hair.</li>
            <li>It literally has my hair looking amazing, really shiny and soft..</li>
            <li>Wished I had read all the reviews first.</li>
            <li>I did not check out Amazon first, awhile ago.</li>
            <li>Love the pouch where my LoNG locks go.</li>
            <li>Just get it, it really is silk and it really works</li>
            <li>As those of you who are checking the hair growth blogs and videos online, wearing a silk scarf or having a silk pillowcase for the evening is very helpful.</li>
            <li>But think of it as &amp;#34;raw silk&amp;#34; similar to silk shantung but with the feel of a light polyester blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Real silk softens the hair and doesn&#x27;t pull or tug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What motivated me to write this review is that after only about 6 weeks of normal daily use the top seam right where it lays on my forehead is ripping and it not has a hole.</li>
            <li>It is the first scarf to actually cover all my hair.</li>
            <li>hair was soft and there was NO breakage on the scarf and around the seams.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very shiny and pretty black  fabric,</li>
            <li>Thanks to a silly purchase of a new kind of relaxer (you can see my other reviews)</li>
            <li>The material is not as thick as I thought or as it may appear but everything else is accurate.</li>
            <li>Recommend brief soapy water soak, hand rinse, &amp; line dry prior to first use to prevent color transfer.  </li>

            <li> I have to pour a towel down (use an old one because that will get stained) to protect my bedding.</li>
            <li> The scarf I received is destructive and has ruined other personal possessions that I really liked.</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT what I expected.</li>
            <li> is that the black color left blue-black-purple marks on my white pillowcases.</li>
            <li> It is different from other silk scarves because it hangs down on your back</li>
            <li> In addition I did wash the scarf and put a towel over my pillow case and the scarf still left black dye on my towel.</li>
            <li> However I use dark-colored silk pillowcases so this is not really an issue.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a triangle or square shape head wrap.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It is made of nylon which is not good for natural hair.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have mentioned the cap stains pillowcases.</li>
            <li> Not pretty</li>
            <li> The black dye comes off on my pillow, my clothes.</li>
            <li> that I have less money as well as less hair, I had to find something inexpensive.</li>
            <li> but it has ruined  my pillows and a couple of  my nighttime shirts with black markings.</li>
            <li> If you tie it tight it should stay.</li>
            <li> the weight of my braids is too heavy.</li>
            <li> I even tried washing it a few times, but it just keeps running.</li>
            <li> Does not fit as shown.</li>
            <li> This was the worst purchase I have ordered from Amazon, the scarf did not have any warning saying that it needed to washed prior to using, so when I used it for the first time it bled on my pillow case and sheet, and after washing my pillow case and sheet the dye from the black scarf has not washed out?</li>
            <li> Before wearing always wash then rinse in cold water with a cup of white vinegar to stop the bleeding of color.</li>
            <li> and I mean everything.</li>
            <li> Not a good investment.</li>
            <li> Disappointed to say the least</li>
            <li> Useless!</li>
            <li> I thought that it deserve a 5, do to the length and covers all of my hair, to bad</li>
            <li> this staining had happened very badly even though I have washed the wrap up to 10 times in the washing machine.</li>
            <li> But be warned any oil cream or feel in the hair makes the dye stain linens terribly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a terrible problem &amp; made me lessen my rating on this wrap.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> love this, it cover your whole head if you wear braids it is very comfortable to sleep in as well</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have mentioned the cap stains pillowcases. However I use dark-colored silk pillowcases so this is not really an issue. What motivated me to write this review is that after only about 6 weeks of normal daily use the top seam right where it lays on my forehead is ripping and it not has a hole. Maybe I have a big head or the weight of my braids is too heavy. I dunno but as soon as I get these braids out I&#x27;m throwing this thing away. Not a good investment.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Love the pouch where my LoNG locks go.</li>
            <li> Same thing as the Stay On Satin thats sold in beauty supply stores. Definitely NOT what I expected. Disappointed to say the least</li>
            <li> The black dye comes off on my pillow, my clothes. Even after washing it the dye still is coming out. Maybe some of the people who gave it a 4 and 5 star received a different product. The scarf I received is destructive and has ruined other personal possessions that I really liked. Wished I had read all the reviews first. I would not recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> This silk scarf definitely prevents my head from sweating and the texture is very nice. It stays in place at night and does not come off. It is different from other silk scarves because it hangs down on your back but it is still a nice scarf.</li>
            <li> It bleeds on white things even after you wash it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay in place</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even get it to stay on my head.</li>
            <li> So I just got my scarf about 3 days ago, and omg it has made such a big difference&lt;br /&gt;!! It literally has my hair looking amazing, really shiny and soft.. Its like in better condition than when I put the scarf on... Just get it, it really is silk and it really works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: So Ive had this scarf for a yr and almost 4 months and it hasnt bled once... it works great...</li>
            <li> Thanks to a silly purchase of a new kind of relaxer (you can see my other reviews) I have lost a lot of hair. I need to do everything I can to get it back as quickly as possible. As those of you who are checking the hair growth blogs and videos online, wearing a silk scarf or having a silk pillowcase for the evening is very helpful. I had silk pillowcases but they got lost in a move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have less money as well as less hair, I had to find something inexpensive. This fits the bill. It looks just like the pictures. You should know that it is not open like a scarf that you would wear around the neck but more of a &amp;#34;do rag&amp;#34; that ties in the back.&lt;br /&gt;Fine by me. I am glad to have something that doesn&#x27;t look like mammy would wear it.  My husband doesn&#x27;t object and think it makes me look like women from Africa with their fanciful headwraps (especially the Muslim hijabs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The silk looks like polyester and for a moment I thought I had been swindled. But think of it as &amp;#34;raw silk&amp;#34; similar to silk shantung but with the feel of a light polyester blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are FAMILIAR with silk in its many forms, as I am, you will know for sure when you feel it a bit more.  Also, if there are any doubts, your morning hair will put them to rest. Real silk softens the hair and doesn&#x27;t pull or tug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was soft and there was NO breakage on the scarf and around the seams.  It was comfortable to wear and did not come off in the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is that the black color left blue-black-purple marks on my white pillowcases. I don&#x27;t mind this - it isn&#x27;t toxic and it washes out, but it is kind of a pain. Because I have to use various products in my hair to moisturize it at night, I don&#x27;t use especially fancy pillowcases to begin with, but I think people should know that this happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the purpose it was created for, it is more than worthy.  YOUR HAIR WILL THANK YOU.&lt;br/&gt;---Mark&#x27;s wife</li>
            <li> This was the worst purchase I have ordered from Amazon, the scarf did not have any warning saying that it needed to washed prior to using, so when I used it for the first time it bled on my pillow case and sheet, and after washing my pillow case and sheet the dye from the black scarf has not washed out? In addition I did wash the scarf and put a towel over my pillow case and the scarf still left black dye on my towel. I Recommend that you pull this item from your site !!!</li>
            <li> I thought that it deserve a 5, do to the length and covers all of my hair, to bad I did not check out Amazon first, awhile ago.</li>
            <li> This scarf/head wrap is perfectly shaped for short or long hair. It protects the edges of your hair &amp; doesn&#x27;t cause the tension on the nape that can lead to hair loss in that area. (Especially if you wear it with the tail facing forward. Not pretty but the end can be tucked for sleeping.) But be warned any oil cream or feel in the hair makes the dye stain linens terribly. Though I love the shape &amp; construction this staining had happened very badly even though I have washed the wrap up to 10 times in the washing machine. It&#x27;s a terrible problem &amp; made me lessen my rating on this wrap. It would have otherwise been a 5 star. I have to pour a towel down (use an old one because that will get stained) to protect my bedding. I have written the seller to see if there is a solution. Waiting for a response.</li>
            <li> I like the scarf but it has ruined  my pillows and a couple of  my nighttime shirts with black markings. Looking for another scarf currently.</li>
            <li> This scarf is made beautifully. The craftsmanship is awesome. I plan on ordering again.</li>
            <li> The dye gets all over my pillow and clothes. I don&#x27;t know why this is, but, it ruined some of my shirts. I even tried washing it a few times, but it just keeps running.</li>
            <li> This product is not a scarf but a doo rag type thing. The picture makes it look like a scarf but it isn&#x27;t. I am overseas so I had to make it work but I don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> *FYI* Before wearing always wash then rinse in cold water with a cup of white vinegar to stop the bleeding of color. Let sit then rinse again and that should help.</li>
            <li> Dye from the scarf stained pillowcases. I washed it thinking that would help But it didn&#x27;t. So I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.  Serves it purpose!</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made. Not 100% silk. It is made of nylon which is not good for natural hair.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh this wrap is amazing. It is the first scarf to actually cover all my hair. If you tie it tight it should stay. The material is not as thick as I thought or as it may appear but everything else is accurate. The best part is that it came in the mail so fast! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Does not fit as shown. Useless!</li>
            <li> This product stained everything and I mean everything. Even after a wash, this product still stains everything. This product is not silk. It is a lie!!!</li>
            <li> Best sleep cap ever for longer hair!  The wrap ties keep it securely  in place all night.  Product as described.  Recommend brief soapy water soak, hand rinse, &amp; line dry prior to first use to prevent color transfer.  Prompt  delivery.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t shaped quite the way I thought it would be, but I worked with it anyway. It is functional.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a triangle or square shape head wrap. It looks like a sewed bag  with  separate back ties. It&#x27;s made of silk and it&#x27;s very shiny and pretty black  fabric, but it&#x27;s not what I expected. It looks like a tied bag on the head. I gave it to charity.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on. Ever.</li>
