            <li>Yes, you may have to cut a string of glue off or unfold a petal and lay a book on top for an hour to flatten it out, but that is well worth it to me.  </li>

            <li>(These are a great deal, in addition to being very cute; I&#x27;ve spent up to $5 for one headband, and in this set you get six for very little more.)</li>

            <li>Great my little girl loves wearing head bands and bows</li>
            <li>I love them more than I expected.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re worth the $5 I paid.</li>
            <li>but it took some time to recieve the package, if you can wait its worth it</li>
            <li>The crystals in the center are very cute.</li>
            <li>They arrived in less than a week and in good condition.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Use these on a photo shoot and my LO looks so pretty in them.</li>
            <li>hot glue all over teo headbands.</li>
            <li>she has a big head :)</li>
            <li>These are so pretty</li>
            <li>I purchased many sets of these and especially for a newborn, these were my favorites.</li>
            <li>Another one had a lot of glue, and looked funny.  </li>
            <li>(be sure to check, could be a potential choking hazard if not!).  </li>
            <li>I glued it back on so it was a quick fit.</li>
            <li>Bows are very cute but look a bit odd when you put them on your child.</li>
            <li>Big for my 4 month old, but I love these!</li>
            <li>but are not made equal, some are seen hits and bright buttons are crooked</li>
            <li>Bought for a friend&#x27;s baby girl; she loves them and says they&#x27;re great since the flower isn&#x27;t too big like other brands.</li>
            <li>but I was able to fluff them up and pick of the hot glue strands.  </li>
            <li>The colours are very vibrant</li>
            <li>Very cute, and nice and small for a little kid&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>Would really recommend them.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this headband</li>
            <li>100 times better than expected.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Love the gem in the center.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars even though many of the center pieces fell out.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The picture makes the items look much nicer.</li>
            <li>I will buy more if you have any big for 12 months old</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love the flowers.</li>
            <li>One gem was off when I got them but easily fixed with some hot glue.</li>
            <li>Had to buy more for my cousin who&#x27;s due in June!</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and stay put on my daughter&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>Shipping was decent.</li>
            <li>These look so cute on my baby and even when the center piece falls out, it isn&#x27;t noticeable on her head and they can easily be fixed.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this company ☺</li>
            <li>most issues I could fix with little effort and  pair of scissors or some glue.</li>
            <li>so she can use as a prop for photos and it turns out they are very cute, they are a little bigger band</li>
            <li>Very pretty! came in 2 weeks even though it estimated I wouldn&#x27;t get them for over a month due to them being shipped from China.</li>
            <li>These are a little big for a newborn, but they can easily be stitched or clipped to fit, especially when doing photography (which is why I bought them).</li>
            <li>I will still use them but was not as satisfied as i was with other headband in a similar price range.</li>
            <li>The colors and flowers are as pictured and my infant and 6 year old can both wear them, which is a plus!</li>
            <li>did receive one flower in the pack with the middle gem falling off, but that was very easily fixed with hot glue.</li>
            <li>Only one of the rhinestones had fallen from a flower, but was easily fixed with hot glue.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m fine with it if I have to make little repairs here and there.</li>
            <li>yellow black and etc :)</li>
            <li>My only complaints is I wish the flower size was a little bigger and had more color options otherwise would&#x27;ve received 5 stars!</li>
            <li>Super cute but the middle piece was broken off of three of them.....</li>
            <li>I love the size of the flower but the elastic could have been a little bigger.</li>
            <li>She is now 9 months old.</li>
            <li>We use these for our 6 mo old and 8 and 9 year old girls.</li>
            <li>Whenever my 1 year old lets me put these on, they are on.</li>
            <li>And I was thrilled that the blue one is Tiffany blue (blue green).</li>
            <li>I love these headbands, my only complaint is that they stick up too far from the head (if that makes any sense...).</li>
            <li>but a little super glue will fix that.</li>
            <li>A bit bigger than my baby&#x27;s head, have to wait a little while to really fit her head.</li>
            <li>Good product but the shipping is sloppy,  the flowers are pretty and we&#x27;ll made but there all thrown into a small bag</li>
            <li>The bow didn&#x27;t lay flat on the babies head and stuck out far</li>
            <li>The flower is a little smaller, but they are worth the money you pay for them.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t anything a little hot glue couldn&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li>I love it, look nice and same like the pic.&lt;br /&gt;But 1 come dirty, and for 2 the diamond is broken.</li>
            <li>Hot glue all over pink flower which I spent time peeling off.</li>
            <li>but that is clearly stated in the listing and actually came sooner then expected.</li>

            <li> Fun colors and love the diamond on the flower.</li>
            <li> arrived in a short amount of time and are a great price</li>
            <li> Yes, you may have to cut a string of glue off or unfold a petal and lay a book on top for an hour to flatten it out, but that is well worth it to me.  </li>
            <li> I love those they r really soft on head with nice colors</li>
            <li> and I think they r good until two years old</li>
            <li> Nicely made, good quality, and sharp looking.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!!</li>
            <li> They are adorable, and very well made!</li>
            <li> They fit my two month old and I can see that I&#x27;ll be getting many more months out of them.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth money and got them in a week!</li>
            <li> Really pretty, bright, vibrant colors, true to picture.</li>
            <li> and I was so surprised at how cute they are!  </li>
            <li> Super cute item and fit very well .</li>

            <li> so pretty and cheap thankyou</li>
            <li> received these today and I must say that they are very pretty.</li>
            <li> (These are a great deal, in addition to being very cute; I&#x27;ve spent up to $5 for one headband, and in this set you get six for very little more.)</li>
            <li> Beautiful jus as expected only issue was one of the jems was off the flower a little super glue an its perfect</li>
            <li> Such cute headbands!</li>
            <li> and they are so cute and will make any outfit complete!</li>
            <li> though so for a little over a dollar a piece, these are great.  </li>
            <li> Great my little girl loves wearing head bands and bows</li>
            <li> I love them more than I expected.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re worth the $5 I paid.</li>
            <li> but it took some time to recieve the package, if you can wait its worth it</li>
            <li> The crystals in the center are very cute.</li>
            <li> They arrived in less than a week and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Use these on a photo shoot and my LO looks so pretty in them.</li>
            <li> hot glue all over teo headbands.</li>
            <li> she has a big head :)</li>
            <li> These are so pretty</li>
            <li> I purchased many sets of these and especially for a newborn, these were my favorites.</li>
            <li> Another one had a lot of glue, and looked funny.  </li>
            <li> (be sure to check, could be a potential choking hazard if not!).  </li>
            <li> I glued it back on so it was a quick fit.</li>
            <li> Bows are very cute but look a bit odd when you put them on your child.</li>
            <li> Big for my 4 month old, but I love these!</li>
            <li> but are not made equal, some are seen hits and bright buttons are crooked</li>
            <li> Bought for a friend&#x27;s baby girl; she loves them and says they&#x27;re great since the flower isn&#x27;t too big like other brands.</li>
            <li> but I was able to fluff them up and pick of the hot glue strands.  </li>
            <li> The colours are very vibrant</li>
            <li> Very cute, and nice and small for a little kid&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> Would really recommend them.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this headband</li>
            <li> 100 times better than expected.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love the gem in the center.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars even though many of the center pieces fell out.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The picture makes the items look much nicer.</li>
            <li> I will buy more if you have any big for 12 months old</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love the flowers.</li>
            <li> One gem was off when I got them but easily fixed with some hot glue.</li>
            <li> Had to buy more for my cousin who&#x27;s due in June!</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and stay put on my daughter&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> Shipping was decent.</li>
            <li> These look so cute on my baby and even when the center piece falls out, it isn&#x27;t noticeable on her head and they can easily be fixed.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this company ☺</li>
            <li> most issues I could fix with little effort and  pair of scissors or some glue.</li>
            <li> so she can use as a prop for photos and it turns out they are very cute, they are a little bigger band</li>
            <li> Very pretty! came in 2 weeks even though it estimated I wouldn&#x27;t get them for over a month due to them being shipped from China.</li>
            <li> These are a little big for a newborn, but they can easily be stitched or clipped to fit, especially when doing photography (which is why I bought them).</li>
            <li> I will still use them but was not as satisfied as i was with other headband in a similar price range.</li>
            <li> The colors and flowers are as pictured and my infant and 6 year old can both wear them, which is a plus!</li>
            <li> did receive one flower in the pack with the middle gem falling off, but that was very easily fixed with hot glue.</li>
            <li> Only one of the rhinestones had fallen from a flower, but was easily fixed with hot glue.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m fine with it if I have to make little repairs here and there.</li>
            <li> yellow black and etc :)</li>
            <li> My only complaints is I wish the flower size was a little bigger and had more color options otherwise would&#x27;ve received 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Super cute but the middle piece was broken off of three of them.....</li>
            <li> I love the size of the flower but the elastic could have been a little bigger.</li>
            <li> She is now 9 months old.</li>
            <li> We use these for our 6 mo old and 8 and 9 year old girls.</li>
            <li> Whenever my 1 year old lets me put these on, they are on.</li>
            <li> And I was thrilled that the blue one is Tiffany blue (blue green).</li>
            <li> I love these headbands, my only complaint is that they stick up too far from the head (if that makes any sense...).</li>
            <li> but a little super glue will fix that.</li>
            <li> A bit bigger than my baby&#x27;s head, have to wait a little while to really fit her head.</li>
            <li> Good product but the shipping is sloppy,  the flowers are pretty and we&#x27;ll made but there all thrown into a small bag</li>
            <li> The bow didn&#x27;t lay flat on the babies head and stuck out far</li>
            <li> The flower is a little smaller, but they are worth the money you pay for them.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t anything a little hot glue couldn&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li> I love it, look nice and same like the pic.&lt;br /&gt;But 1 come dirty, and for 2 the diamond is broken.</li>
            <li> Hot glue all over pink flower which I spent time peeling off.</li>
            <li> but that is clearly stated in the listing and actually came sooner then expected.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with a few and the company reached out to me in no time and fixed the situation.</li>
            <li> the center jewel fell off two of them after two weeks and only being worn twice.</li>
            <li> Not all of the center rhinestones we actually centered on each flower.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the stones have fallen out of most of the headbands now, and half of them are coming apart.  </li>
            <li> They run small and the little embellishments in the centers keep falling out since they are just attached with hot glue.</li>
            <li> They look like not new</li>
            <li> They are a little big for her now, but I like the size they aren&#x27;t the size of her head</li>
            <li> But they were crazy cheap....</li>
            <li> Be careful pulling on the petals-</li>
            <li> The center piece did fall off before my daughter wore it</li>
            <li> The product delivered is not as expected.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid they would be cheaply made and take a long time to arrive because thats what has happened to me in the past with other brands.</li>
            <li> The orange ribbon and flower did not match each other.</li>
            <li> There were definitely flaws in a few where the petals just don&#x27;t lay right or stick out awkwardly, but</li>
            <li> The cheaply ones just looked tacky and bad.</li>
            <li> However, when I received my package, one of the flowers had a missing center.</li>
            <li> One of the flowers came without a headband, and another one was missing the center rhinestone.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I received these the stones were at the bottom of the package,  not glued down on 4 of them.</li>
            <li> They arrived a little smashed</li>
            <li> Shipping takes a little while</li>
            <li> My little girl loves them.</li>
            <li> My little girl lover them.</li>
            <li> One of the bands already had a missing jewel when I received it in the mail.  </li>
            <li> and I the crystals were all firmly attached to mine</li>
            <li> Super glue will fix but still annoying receiving them like that..</li>
            <li> It leaves a small mark on my babies head were the flower is attached.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so disappointing because they are beautiful headbands, the quality is just terrible.</li>
            <li> Not worth its price poor craftsmanship</li>
            <li> I got the headbands and the middle parts were broken out of them, not happy with the quality of the headbands!</li>
            <li> not thrilled and wouldnt recommend.</li>
            <li> The colors are the correct ones but the material is low quality :(</li>
            <li> Not ideal for newborns</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with these headbands.  </li>
            <li> so it looks weird in photos.</li>
            <li> Horrible they came in the mail</li>
    </ol>

            <li> These are a little big for a newborn, but they can easily be stitched or clipped to fit, especially when doing photography (which is why I bought them). They are adorable, and very well made!</li>
            <li> LOVE these! Be careful pulling on the petals- a family pulled on one to adjust and broke it. I&#x27;ll figure out how to fix it lol</li>
            <li> Not as cute on as you would think!</li>
            <li> Bought for my baby, and they&#x27;re perfect! Had to buy more for my cousin who&#x27;s due in June! Thanks!</li>

            <li> Bought for a friend&#x27;s baby girl; she loves them and says they&#x27;re great since the flower isn&#x27;t too big like other brands.</li>
            <li> Look adorable on my Great Grandaughter.Well made</li>
            <li> Love it. A bit bigger than my baby&#x27;s head, have to wait a little while to really fit her head.</li>

            <li> Very cute, I get a ton of compliments on them. I had a problem with a few and the company reached out to me in no time and fixed the situation. Highly recommend this company ☺</li>
            <li> Cute but rather lage for my baby.</li>
            <li> Ordered before my daughter was born. She is now 9 months old.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received these the stones were at the bottom of the package,  not glued down on 4 of them.</li>
            <li> Horrible they came in the mail one of them was broke then I went to put one the headbands on my daughter head and the diamond fell off</li>
            <li> These headbands are perfect! The size of the flower and colors are very bright. Would really recommend them.</li>
            <li> Super cute but the middle piece was broken off of three of them..... Super glue will fix but still annoying receiving them like that..</li>
            <li> Use these on a photo shoot and my LO looks so pretty in them.</li>
            <li> I Bought these for my niece, she looks so cute in them, everyone ask where I got them from...This is also great gift for new mothers having girls!!!!!</li>
            <li> These are very cute in person. The flower is a little smaller, but they are worth the money you pay for them. The center piece did fall off before my daughter wore it but a little super glue will fix that. Ordering two sets together are a good idea because they come all in one package.</li>
            <li> I got these for my cousin so she can use as a prop for photos and it turns out they are very cute, they are a little bigger band then I thought but still very cute</li>
            <li> I love those they r really soft on head with nice colors I really recommend this headband and I think they r good until two years old</li>
            <li> I got the headbands and the middle parts were broken out of them, not happy with the quality of the headbands!</li>
            <li> Very nice! I love it, look nice and same like the pic.&lt;br /&gt;But 1 come dirty, and for 2 the diamond is broken.</li>
            <li> I love these headbands. They are so cute! I was afraid they would be cheaply made and take a long time to arrive because thats what has happened to me in the past with other brands. But these really are a great deal. They arrived in less than a week and in good condition. My baby is 9 months old and they fit her great. I think the elastic band is big enough for her to wear for a while too.</li>
            <li> These are so amazing! 100 times better than expected. The detail in the petals and how they were all put together is absolutely amazing. My daughter is 7 weeks and has a smaller head but these actually fit perfectly. Perfect for everyday wear or to dress up in. I can&#x27;t explain how much I love these. I&#x27;m ordering more for my niece.</li>
            <li> Middle came out but material and band are as expdcted. I will still use them but was not as satisfied as i was with other headband in a similar price range.</li>
            <li> Nice quality and fit well. What&#x27;s more to say. :)</li>
            <li> Adorable for the price!  I only paid 5 and some change though so for a little over a dollar a piece, these are great.  They arrived a little smashed but I was able to fluff them up and pick of the hot glue strands.  I didn&#x27;t ecpect them to be perfect so I&#x27;m fine with it if I have to make little repairs here and there.</li>
            <li> I love these headbands, my only complaint is that they stick up too far from the head (if that makes any sense...). I love the colors and they look great otherwise! They fit my two month old and I can see that I&#x27;ll be getting many more months out of them.</li>
            <li> I really like, they so beutifull and a good price. I loved my baby look so pretty with it on.. a lot of people told me where a get it for!!</li>
            <li> Love how they look on my daughter. Fun colors and love the diamond on the flower. Perfect way to dress up a look(outfit)</li>
            <li> I only received 4 headband out of 5 total.  The 5 the one only had a flower with no headband.  3 out of 5 flowers the rhinestones fell off the flowers</li>
            <li> hot glue all over teo headbands. the center jewel fell off two of them after two weeks and only being worn twice. not thrilled and wouldnt recommend.</li>
            <li> They are adorable and even better in person! What a great deal</li>
            <li> I love them! Looks just like the picture and fits great. I really like the round piece of material under the flower that keeps the stitching or glue from pressing into the baby&#x27;s head.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive one flower in the pack with the middle gem falling off, but that was very easily fixed with hot glue. I would love to buy more in a variety of colors! We use these for our 6 mo old and 8 and 9 year old girls. They have a great fit!</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with these headbands.  The colors are great but the quality is just ok.  They run small and the little embellishments in the centers keep falling out since they are just attached with hot glue.</li>
            <li> Really pretty, bright, vibrant colors, true to picture. Only one of the rhinestones had fallen from a flower, but was easily fixed with hot glue. Delivery took about 15 days, which was way before EDD</li>
            <li> These are super cute but when I received mine,  4 out of 6 headbands had lost their crystals. I ended up just gluing them back on, no biggie.</li>
            <li> Super cute item and fit very well .</li>
            <li> They are a little big for her now, but I like the size they aren&#x27;t the size of her head</li>
            <li> Love their products never disappointed</li>
            <li> Gorgeous! Completely worthy of 5 stars! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> received alot faster than stated on the site, very pleased with the bows</li>
            <li> Such cute headbands! Not all of the center rhinestones we actually centered on each flower. It gave it more of an A-symmetrical look, so I was okay with it. The Sea foam c</li>
            <li> Item was so cute, materials used was nice and neat.</li>
            <li> Beautiful...my daughter is 11 month and they fit her fine...she has a big head :)</li>
            <li> These headbands are absolutely gorgeous. I love them more than I expected. The colors were beautiful as well and the quality of work is more than expected</li>
            <li> Was just as described and look great.  Shipping takes a little while but that is clearly stated in the listing and actually came sooner then expected.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely beautiful, what a great deal!</li>
            <li> I love them so cute and the colors are nice and bright.</li>
            <li> LOVE these! Get lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> Big for my 4 month old, but I love these!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the flowers except 2 of them lost their &#x27;bling&#x27; immediately. That concerns me considering it&#x27;s labeled as a baby headband so it could be a choking hazard. They are super cute though! I ended up using a more stable glue to ensure they middles didn&#x27;t fall out-but never found the 2 pieces that fell out almost as soon as we got them (never even wore those!)</li>
            <li> These heabands are beautiful!! Very pleased.</li>
            <li> They look like not new and I found hair on two of them. One thing more, the Chiffon of one of them is out of its place!</li>
            <li> I love these! They are super cute. I love the size of the flower but the elastic could have been a little bigger. It leaves a small mark on my babies head were the flower is attached. Quality seems to be really good. Overall I am happy win this purchase.</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE! The colors are vibrant and stay put on my daughter&#x27;s head. Perfect size flower and the diamond center is adorable. Pulls together any outfit.</li>
            <li> Super cute and great price.</li>
            <li> Great material, size, I didn&#x27;t put 5 just because one of them had one of the petals bent over and I&#x27;m kinda picky because you can see it..</li>
            <li> All fell apart within two times of my daughter wearing them.</li>
            <li> Beautiful bows! They look just like the pictures shown!</li>
            <li> Very nice, great price too!</li>
            <li> This came must faster than it said it would and they are so cute and will make any outfit complete!</li>
            <li> Very cute, and nice and small for a little kid&#x27;s head. Now, if we could just get her to keep them on! (These are a great deal, in addition to being very cute; I&#x27;ve spent up to $5 for one headband, and in this set you get six for very little more.)</li>
            <li> Love these headbands! great purchase. perfect colors. Size fits perfectly for my 3 -month-old with room to grow.</li>
            <li> Perfect bows for my baby girl! I absolutely LOVE these!</li>
            <li> Too large from my newborn&#x27;s head but good quality.</li>
            <li> There very pretty bows</li>
            <li> I love the colors of these hairbands, so bright and cheery.  My little girl loves them.</li>
            <li> Not worth its price poor craftsmanship</li>
            <li> Very pretty! came in 2 weeks even though it estimated I wouldn&#x27;t get them for over a month due to them being shipped from China. Exactly what I wanted!!</li>
            <li> These are so pretty and I love them. I always get compliments for my daughter when I put them on her. Seem to be of good quality too!</li>
            <li> Super cute and affordable.Shipping was decent. I would recommend and repurchase.</li>
            <li> My only complaints is I wish the flower size was a little bigger and had more color options otherwise would&#x27;ve received 5 stars! love the way they came to life when I pulled them out the plastic! Definitely worth money and got them in a week! They&#x27;re beautiful!!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re absolutely adorable.  However, when I received my package, one of the flowers had a missing center. Other than that, I love the flowers.</li>
            <li> I ordered these February 22nd and they arrived from China on April 1st. Order them way before you need them. They&#x27;re worth the $5 I paid. Some bows had some glue residue on the front. The bow didn&#x27;t lay flat on the babies head and stuck out far so it looks weird in photos.</li>
            <li> Cute great summer colors</li>
            <li> So cute I love them! Love the gem in the center. Will be perfect for daily use or in pictures.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars even though many of the center pieces fell out. These look so cute on my baby and even when the center piece falls out, it isn&#x27;t noticeable on her head and they can easily be fixed. I purchased many sets of these and especially for a newborn, these were my favorites.</li>
            <li> Beautiful jus as expected only issue was one of the jems was off the flower a little super glue an its perfect</li>
            <li> cute headband but are not made equal, some are seen hits and bright buttons are crooked</li>
            <li> These are the most beautiful headbands ever.  I love them and highly recommend them!  I took a chance and just ordered online and I was so surprised at how cute they are!  I put them on my baby girl all the time and she always gets compliments!  Super cute and a great price!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These are very cute headbands! The colors and flowers are as pictured and my infant and 6 year old can both wear them, which is a plus! I haven&#x27;t had an issue with the rhinestones falling off, but I could see how that might happen.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a great deal. Unfortunately, the stones have fallen out of most of the headbands now, and half of them are coming apart.  It&#x27;s so disappointing because they are beautiful headbands, the quality is just terrible.</li>
            <li> One of the flowers came without a headband, and another one was missing the center rhinestone.  Another one had a lot of glue, and looked funny.  But they were crazy cheap....so I guess you can&#x27;t expect perfection.  I emailed and I&#x27;m hoping to be sent replacements.</li>
            <li> Good product but the shipping is sloppy,  the flowers are pretty and we&#x27;ll made but there all thrown into a small bag so the come put all jumbled up other than that they are very pretty and fit my 7 month old perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great quality and super fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Bows are very cute but look a bit odd when you put them on your child.</li>
            <li> Very cute, love the wide, soft headband, very comfortable for my baby, the flower is very nice, a good size and I the crystals were all firmly attached to mine (be sure to check, could be a potential choking hazard if not!).  Great headbands, great price.  And I was thrilled that the blue one is Tiffany blue (blue green).</li>
            <li> Lovet lovet so pretty and cheap thankyou I will buy more if you have any big for 12 months old</li>
            <li> These headbands are adorable, and I love them on my baby; My baby looks cute now when she wears them.</li>
            <li> I love these headbands there better then I thought . They looks so beautiful on my daughter I will definitely by more .</li>
            <li> Headbands are adorable. One gem was off when I got them but easily fixed with some hot glue. They fit my 8 month old perfectly.</li>
            <li> The headbands are so nice. Colors are just perfect. Like i wanted. The crystals in the center are very cute.</li>
            <li> So cute on the centers of 3 of them fell off but it wasn&#x27;t anything a little hot glue couldn&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li> Great my little girl loves wearing head bands and bows so these are wonderful arrived in a short amount of time and are a great price</li>
            <li> The product delivered is not as expected.  The colors are the correct ones but the material is low quality :(</li>
            <li> Love these. Nicely made, good quality, and sharp looking. Yes, you may have to cut a string of glue off or unfold a petal and lay a book on top for an hour to flatten it out, but that is well worth it to me.  I needed headbands for my daughters but didn&#x27;t want to pay $10 per band because they are always getting lost and ruined. The cheaply ones just looked tacky and bad. This seller fulfilled my wishes perfectly! Best of both worlds!</li>
            <li> The orange ribbon and flower did not match each other. The picture makes the items look much nicer. Hot glue all over pink flower which I spent time peeling off.</li>
            <li> These bows are beautiful! Whenever my 1 year old lets me put these on, they are on. The colors are just as displayed. And they are just adorable! I get compliments on them all the time.</li>
            <li> These headbands, for the price are great. There were definitely flaws in a few where the petals just don&#x27;t lay right or stick out awkwardly, but most issues I could fix with little effort and  pair of scissors or some glue. Super cute though and fit my 8 month old wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Took FOREVER to get here, but they are extremely cute.</li>
            <li> Very cute . Good quality</li>
            <li> Love these! Use them every day for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend! Just got ours in the mail and i love them!</li>
            <li> Headbands are super cute and nice quality but it took some time to recieve the package, if you can wait its worth it</li>
            <li> Beautiful bows!  My granddaughter loves them.</li>
            <li> I think if you iron them they&#x27;d be ok some of the rhinestones were glued on Lopsided</li>
            <li> I get compliments on these all the time. They&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> received these today and I must say that they are very pretty. I won&#x27;t know how they look as they are a present for my niece&#x27;s daughter overseas. The colours are very vibrant and I sure they will look good when worn.</li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments on theses bows. Looks adorable on baby girl</li>
            <li> I wish they came in more colors :) yellow black and etc :) their adorable I love them!</li>
            <li> great product so pretty and great texture</li>
            <li> Beautiful. My little girl lover them.</li>
            <li> Great product or the price</li>
