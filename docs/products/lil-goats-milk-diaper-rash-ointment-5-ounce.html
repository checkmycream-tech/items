            <li>Does a great job of protecting babies skin but easier to remove than original destine.  </li>
            <li>By far the best diaper rash cream out there.</li>
            <li>This stuff is by far the best diaper rash ointment we&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>thanks for a great dealüëçüëçüëç</li>
            <li>Works like magic.</li>
            <li>I love this diaper cream.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything else we tried.</li>
            <li>Love this diaper rash cream.</li>
            <li>After going through this jar and realizing how many diaper changes we have ahead of us, I went with the butt paste instead.</li>
            <li>(Someone said if you love your baby need to get it...</li>
            <li>Some are ok, and some don&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite diaper ointment.</li>
            <li>And this is our favorite zinc ointment to use for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know for SURE</li>
            <li>but now I&#x27;m glad I kept it for myself.</li>
            <li>Way better than desitin.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love it, my son loves it, grandma loves it.</li>
            <li>Great product, i have been using it since my almost 4 year old</li>
            <li>It clears up any rash so fast and it also smells so good.</li>
            <li>Easy to wipe away unlike destin, does not leave a residue.</li>
            <li>Does have a strong fragrance though.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell, so be prepared.</li>
            <li>Best diaper rash cream, hands down.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think to bring it in my hospital bag because they told me to pack light.</li>
            <li>just wish that it was still available in 10 oz coin trainer like it was 4 and 5 years ago.</li>
            <li>Use, enjoy, see a difference.</li>
            <li>Her skin has been free from irritation and rash since.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and the fact that it prevents the diaper rash or cures it really</li>
            <li>Something about the added goat milk really does help it to work better than anything else.  </li>
            <li>mild, so can be used on anyone, from babies to the elderly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still 34 weeks pregnant</li>
            <li>still, it lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li>but since I read such amazing reviews I figured my friend could give it a try.</li>
            <li>so well it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li>I was asking what the most natural deodorant was.</li>
            <li>As far as I know, it&#x27;s a great alternative to traditional deodorant!</li>
            <li>So if you liked the latter you won&#x27;t regret buying this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sortof a fresh scent -- not medicinal, not floral, but, well, like a fresh diaper cream should smell, if it has to smell,</li>
            <li>This is the only alternative to original Desitin that I&#x27;ve been able to find that also has 40% zinc oxide -- and it DOESN&#x27;T STINK.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and it&#x27;s easy to apply even being thick.  </li>
            <li>If my daughter has a diaper rash, it clears it right up within a day.  </li>
            <li>As soon as we got home I started using this ointment and it cleared it right up.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on our son and doesn&#x27;t have that distinct desitin odor</li>
            <li>The zinc in this one is highly concentrated (40%) just like in Desitin Original ointment.</li>
            <li>These were the only 2 brands I could find that had zinc in such a great amount in them.</li>
            <li>It was the only thing that worked for my first, so I was happy to finally find it in stock again.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle, I use it on both my boy and girl.</li>
            <li>Even on those rare occasions where her bottom is really sore.  </li>
            <li>this heals most any skin irritation in a very short while.</li>
            <li>but it seems A&amp;D (Blue) is working better..</li>
            <li>Love it just wish we could find larger tubs of it.  </li>
            <li>It works really well, cleared it up in just a couple of days!</li>
            <li>Hands down my favorite diaper cream!  </li>
            <li>Really good stuff, but no better than the cheaper brand.</li>
            <li>does contain petroleum products, so it&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s the best cream I&#x27;ve found for my babies with VERY sensitive bottoms.  </li>
            <li>also used Eucerin Aquphor healing ointment and that works very well..</li>
            <li>Goat milk and zinc are both very healing for all skin types.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a jar at the changing table, one in the diaper bag, one in the car, and one in the suitcase ready to go.</li>
            <li>This really seems to help sooth as well as heal faster.</li>
            <li>The other great thing is these tubs last forever, I think we didn&#x27;t finish our first tub until it was on our second kid.</li>
            <li>A small amount goes a long way, the smell is pleasant and mild and so far no rashes!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind it, but if you&#x27;re sensitive, be aware.</li>
            <li>I think it rubs in decently.</li>
            <li>She applied one more coat before they left our house and by the time they had their next changing the bumps were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is nice and thick, does not smell much, really helps to heal any irritation.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and covers a sore bottom nicely.</li>
            <li>I used this ointment 7 years ago with my first baby and finally was able to track it down again here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>She used this and told me to use it right after shower, especially at night, then after a while, you can use it about twice a week, depending on your needs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, we&#x27;re hooked and can&#x27;t live without this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I have used this For the last few of my babes and this is amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>My baby&#x27;s bottom was very sensitive to moisture and this ointment reduced the redness dramatically.</li>
            <li>Little goats milk diaper rash ointment, good for lots of other things too, treats all forms of skin problems.</li>
            <li>The cons is that now is half of the size and double the peice after the new presentation came out, other tha that great product, a must have.</li>
            <li>Used this for the past 7/9 years, really love it.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used a variety of ointments with our first child and then with our second.  </li>
            <li>At first, one of the teens and i needed to use it weekly but now use it only monthly.</li>
            <li>( it&#x27;s full of zinc oxide ), and even for scratches and rough spots on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, my kids&#x27; bottoms will turn bright red and break out in a rash if they sit un-diaper-creamed in poop for a minute.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>Did you know zinc ointment can be used as deodorant once a week (or less) and keep you odor free?  </li>
            <li>I thought it&#x27;s a natural cream as it says goat&#x27;s milk ..</li>
            <li>, now I have a one year old that used since day one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe my kiddos have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I have a low threshold for the fishy smell of that other widely available zinc butt cream that contains 40% zinc.  </li>
            <li>The other one first needed to use it ever 4-5 days but now uses it every 7-10 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Initially it was said that this cream has goat milk and natural ingredients...</li>
            <li>My sons both had terrible diaper rashes, and out of all the brands out on the market, this is by far the best.  </li>

            <li> Did you know zinc ointment can be used as deodorant once a week (or less) and keep you odor free?  </li>
            <li> I thought it&#x27;s a natural cream as it says goat&#x27;s milk ..</li>
            <li> , now I have a one year old that used since day one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe my kiddos have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I have a low threshold for the fishy smell of that other widely available zinc butt cream that contains 40% zinc.  </li>
            <li> The other one first needed to use it ever 4-5 days but now uses it every 7-10 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Initially it was said that this cream has goat milk and natural ingredients...</li>
            <li> My sons both had terrible diaper rashes, and out of all the brands out on the market, this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> When she removed her daughters diaper I saw a very pink rash, my friend applied the Li&#x27;l Goats upon bedtime and the next morning the redness was completely gone.</li>
            <li> None seemed to clear it up a little.</li>

            <li> Just shower, pat feet mostly dry but not quite dry to make application easier.</li>
            <li> We are very sad that the cream isn&#x27;t available in 10 oz containers and hope that the company and Amazon bring the 10 oz back!</li>
            <li> Be careful ordering during summer months.  </li>
            <li> My babies seem to hate Desitin (always scream &amp;quot;owie&amp;quot; when I try to apply it), but this stuff is so soothing and thick and great.  </li>
            <li> This past outage saw us use three different creams that did little to help for a week until we finally got a resupply - cleared up the rash almost overnight.  </li>
            <li> Spilled it all over my hands and carpet, so be careful!  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, it has the highest concentration of zinc oxide that I have seen which allows for maximum results.</li>
            <li> When we run out of this cream, we are forced to troll different pharmacies looking for anything that works half as well.  </li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s not worth messing around with butt creams that are 17%, or 15%, or anything less than 40% zinc.  </li>
            <li> Granddaughter has never had a bad rash, the one she did have this cleared up right away, we have used it at night since then, when we knew she would be exposed to a wet diaper longer than she is during the day.</li>
            <li> She was shocked at how quickly this product cleared up her daughters diaper rash.</li>
            <li> Always have a jar at my house, recommend it to all friends with little kids.</li>
            <li> Too bad it costs twice as much for half the product now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100 degrees outside here, so needless to say when I got it, it was liquid.  </li>
            <li> (at least I THINK it does...</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s thick and covers a sore bottom nicely. If my daughter has a diaper rash, it clears it right up within a day.  Even on those rare occasions where her bottom is really sore.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> thanks for a great dealüëçüëçüëç</li>
            <li> I used this ointment 7 years ago with my first baby and finally was able to track it down again here on Amazon.  It&#x27;s very thick and impermeable to wetness.  It was the only thing that worked for my first, so I was happy to finally find it in stock again.  So I ordered it.  Be careful ordering during summer months.  It&#x27;s not supposed to be stored at temps over 77 degrees.  It&#x27;s 100 degrees outside here, so needless to say when I got it, it was liquid.  Spilled it all over my hands and carpet, so be careful!  The smell is pleasant and it&#x27;s easy to apply even being thick.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works like magic. See rashes clear in just few applications</li>
            <li> The best stuff I have ever used on my kids for diaper rash.</li>
            <li> When I came home from the hospital my babys bum was red and irritated from the Vaseline the nurses gave us. I didn&#x27;t think to bring it in my hospital bag because they told me to pack light. As soon as we got home I started using this ointment and it cleared it right up. Works great, wish i would have brought it with me!</li>
            <li> By far the best diaper rash cream out there.</li>
            <li> I love this diaper cream. It clears up any rash so fast and it also smells so good. Its the best one I have used</li>
            <li> BEST PRODUCT OUT THERE FOR DIAPER RASH!! My son had a terrible diaper rash and i tried destin, aquaphor,  burts bees  baby ointment, and A&amp;D. None seemed to clear it up a little. Once i started using this product i saw a difference in one day! Easy to wipe away unlike destin, does not leave a residue. Am buying another tub for when this one runs out. Will continue to use this til my lil guy is out of diapers. Worth the price!  BUY THIS IF YOU WANT YOUR BABYS DIAPER RASH GONE!!!!!</li>
            <li> this heals most any skin irritation in a very short while. have been using for over 10 years and it is my go to ointment. mild, so can be used on anyone, from babies to the elderly, even used it on a cat once. used to be in 8 ounce jars..wish they would bring that back! still, it lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, texture..I thought it&#x27;s a natural cream as it says goat&#x27;s milk ..&lt;br /&gt;Beware.. Contains urea.&lt;br /&gt;Urea is not recommended in baby products</li>
            <li> My sons both had terrible diaper rashes, and out of all the brands out on the market, this is by far the best.  It is the only zinc oxide that does the trick and in such a short period of time.  A must buy for parents whose babies get terrible diaper rashes.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Works better than anything else we tried.</li>
            <li> Love this diaper rash cream. Love the smell and the fact that it prevents the diaper rash or cures it really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We just wish that it was still available in 10 oz coin trainer like it was 4 and 5 years ago. We are very sad that the cream isn&#x27;t available in 10 oz containers and hope that the company and Amazon bring the 10 oz back!</li>
            <li> I have used this For the last few of my babes and this is amazing stuff. Does have a strong fragrance though. Works in between just one change. Use generously. Happy mommying :)</li>
            <li> My granddaughter had a severe rash that she came home from the hospital with and this is the only thing that worked,  we tried a bunch of prescriptions and three days of this was all she needed.. I would swear by this, I just bought 5 jars and will never run out.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff, but no better than the cheaper brand. After going through this jar and realizing how many diaper changes we have ahead of us, I went with the butt paste instead.</li>
            <li> Great product, i have been using it since my almost 4 year old was three months, now I have a one year old that used since day one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great to heal the rush and perfect to protect.  The cons is that now is half of the size and double the peice after the new presentation came out, other tha that great product, a must have.</li>
            <li> This is what my mom loved to use on me and my siblings and it works great!</li>
            <li> Used this for the past 7/9 years, really love it. It&#x27;s our back-up suncreen. I think it rubs in decently.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best diaper cream ever!! As other reviewers have stated, it has the highest concentration of zinc oxide that I have seen which allows for maximum results. I have ordered boatloads of this and given a lot away as well.</li>
            <li> If diaper rash is your problem, this is your answer. I don&#x27;t know how or why it works but it does. The other great thing is these tubs last forever, I think we didn&#x27;t finish our first tub until it was on our second kid.</li>
            <li> Initially it was said that this cream has goat milk and natural ingredients... and I was very impressed with the reviews on amazon and elsewhere... but it seems A&amp;D (Blue) is working better.. Not to discount Goat&#x27;s Milk.. It works is nice.. just not the best in the market is what I felt.. The Rash goes off but not overnight.. and then comes back in about the same time.. it could well be a baby&#x27;s skin type also...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used Eucerin Aquphor healing ointment and that works very well.. although its not a diaper rash cream.. alternating Aquaphor &amp; A&amp;D and when I run out of A&amp;D i use Goat&#x27;s milk....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall good product.. good scent...  but definately not the best as advertised..... (Someone said if you love your baby need to get it... Umm sorry !!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00BV5L21O Li&#x27;l Goat&#x27;s Milk Diaper Rash Ointment, 5 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> This stuff is by far the best diaper rash ointment we&#x27;ve found.  We&#x27;ve used a variety of ointments with our first child and then with our second.  When we run out of this cream, we are forced to troll different pharmacies looking for anything that works half as well.  This past outage saw us use three different creams that did little to help for a week until we finally got a resupply - cleared up the rash almost overnight.  The only downside of this product is availability.  We scour the internet for it regularly buying up any that we find that are affordable (prices can be upwards of $40).</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of expensive diaper rash ointment. Some are ok, and some don&#x27;t work at all. This is my favorite diaper ointment. Very gentle, I use it on both my boy and girl. I also bought this as gifts to my friends.</li>
            <li> Tried everything and this is what worked for us. Too bad it costs twice as much for half the product now. Works so well it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li> Love it just wish we could find larger tubs of it.  Very gentle on our son and doesn&#x27;t have that distinct desitin odor</li>
            <li> This ointment is excellent for skin disturbances of any kind.  It is not just for diaper changes.  I&#x27;ve used it for years for heat rash, as a sunblock on my nose ( it&#x27;s full of zinc oxide ), and even for scratches and rough spots on the skin.  Something about the added goat milk really does help it to work better than anything else.  It has a pleasing scent, too, nothing fruity or flowery.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way, the smell is pleasant and mild and so far no rashes! I use it on baby&#x27;s bottom 1 diaper change a day.</li>
            <li> Bought this for deodorant, as advised by a well informed person. I was asking what the most natural deodorant was. She used this and told me to use it right after shower, especially at night, then after a while, you can use it about twice a week, depending on your needs. As far as I know, it&#x27;s a great alternative to traditional deodorant! It works for me! (at least I THINK it does...lol)</li>
            <li> Little goats milk diaper rash ointment, good for lots of other things too, treats all forms of skin problems. Goat milk and zinc are both very healing for all skin types. Use, enjoy, see a difference. 3 family members use it for different reasons.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, everything else gave our daughter a rash. This didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Did you know zinc ointment can be used as deodorant once a week (or less) and keep you odor free?  Well, it can! And this is our favorite zinc ointment to use for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once a week (or as needed, for me, it&#x27;s now once a month), after a shower, pat dry then apply a 1/2 pea size to 1 pea size blob of Li&#x27;l Goat to each armpit. Rub in well. In the morning, wipe or wash away any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two teen daughters and I haven&#x27;t found that it reduce sweating but it&#x27;s 100% effective at eliminating odor. At first, one of the teens and i needed to use it weekly but now use it only monthly. The other one first needed to use it ever 4-5 days but now uses it every 7-10 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can also be used on feet to eliminate odor. Just shower, pat feet mostly dry but not quite dry to make application easier. Apply zinc, rub in, put on socks.</li>
            <li> Yep, this stuff works. My second DS was getting terrible diaper rash and even the strongest desitin wasn&#x27;t working, so after some searching i decided to try this. It works really well, cleared it up in just a couple of days! It does have a strong smell, so be prepared. I don&#x27;t mind it, but if you&#x27;re sensitive, be aware.</li>
            <li> The zinc in this one is highly concentrated (40%) just like in Desitin Original ointment. So if you liked the latter you won&#x27;t regret buying this one. These were the only 2 brands I could find that had zinc in such a great amount in them. My baby&#x27;s bottom was very sensitive to moisture and this ointment reduced the redness dramatically.</li>
            <li> Maybe my kiddos have sensitive skin.  Maybe their bottoms are inclined toward diaper rash.  Maybe I have a low threshold for the fishy smell of that other widely available zinc butt cream that contains 40% zinc.  I know for SURE that it&#x27;s not worth messing around with butt creams that are 17%, or 15%, or anything less than 40% zinc.  I defy any Mom to experience a diaper rash that&#x27;s red in the morning, and open sores by afternoon, and not start taking every precaution to never have THAT happen again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pre-emptive butt cream is the answer in my house, and this by far smells the best and works the best.  I&#x27;d give it ten stars for formulation and efficacy, but one star for jacking up the price per ounce by eliminating the 10 oz jar (it&#x27;s not like this stuff goes bad after sitting around for a month!) and now offering only a 5 oz jar.  Canus, that&#x27;s what Proctor and Gamble does to its customers.  I was hoping you&#x27;d be different.  Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, we&#x27;re hooked and can&#x27;t live without this stuff.  There&#x27;s a jar at the changing table, one in the diaper bag, one in the car, and one in the suitcase ready to go.</li>
            <li> Best rash ointment period.  Gets rid of rashes sometimes.especially within hours.  Definitely keeps their bums protected.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading reviews from a blogger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend came into town with her 9mo daughter and she was using another brand that was not working. I&#x27;m still 34 weeks pregnant so I hadn&#x27;t opened this product yet but since I read such amazing reviews I figured my friend could give it a try. When she removed her daughters diaper I saw a very pink rash, my friend applied the Li&#x27;l Goats upon bedtime and the next morning the redness was completely gone. The rash bumps were still there but you could definitely see a difference. She applied one more coat before they left our house and by the time they had their next changing the bumps were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I have not used this product yet for my baby, my friends word is just as good as mine. She was shocked at how quickly this product cleared up her daughters diaper rash. I should have sent the rest of the jar home with her but now I&#x27;m glad I kept it for myself.</li>
            <li> One of the best diaper creams for my diaper rash probe twins.</li>
            <li> Very nice, very nice smell. I would eat it..,..and 40% zinc.</li>
            <li> Diaper rash is GONE in one use.</li>
            <li> This is our regular go-to diaper cream.  Way better than desitin.  Does a great job of protecting babies skin but easier to remove than original destine.  Still the same 40% zinc oxide though.</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite diaper cream!  This is the only alternative to original Desitin that I&#x27;ve been able to find that also has 40% zinc oxide -- and it DOESN&#x27;T STINK.  It does have a scent, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  It&#x27;s sortof a fresh scent -- not medicinal, not floral, but, well, like a fresh diaper cream should smell, if it has to smell, that is.&lt;br /&gt;This does contain petroleum products, so it&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s the best cream I&#x27;ve found for my babies with VERY sensitive bottoms.  Seriously, my kids&#x27; bottoms will turn bright red and break out in a rash if they sit un-diaper-creamed in poop for a minute.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve probably been through 40+ tubs of this stuff between my two children.</li>
            <li> My daughter gets bad diaper rash and we&#x27;ve tried everything. This really seems to help sooth as well as heal faster.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  My babies seem to hate Desitin (always scream &amp;quot;owie&amp;quot; when I try to apply it), but this stuff is so soothing and thick and great.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love it, my son loves it, grandma loves it. Best oitment I&#x27;ve ever tried on my son. Doesn&#x27;t burn, no issues. Just perfect!</li>
            <li> Granddaughter has never had a bad rash, the one she did have this cleared up right away, we have used it at night since then, when we knew she would be exposed to a wet diaper longer than she is during the day. Her skin has been free from irritation and rash since. It&#x27;s also good for skin irritations, rashes on children and adults.</li>
            <li> Best diaper rash cream, hands down.</li>
            <li> This is a best diaper rush cream we ever tried. It is nice and thick, does not smell much, really helps to heal any irritation. Always have a jar at my house, recommend it to all friends with little kids.</li>
            <li> Best product for a rash of any age</li>
