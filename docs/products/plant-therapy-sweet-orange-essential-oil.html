            <li>I also mix this with water and spray the air conditioning filter to help give my home a nice scent once in a while.</li>
            <li>I found it to be quit nice.  </li>

            <li>I have taken to making my own detergent, glass cleaner, and floor cleaner for my laminate flooring.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;It has a wonderful smell and is not irritating to your skin as some oils are for me.</li>
            <li>Yet to use; however, I know it come in handy.</li>

            <li>Smells great and appears to be pure..</li>
            <li>Great, pure orange EO.</li>
            <li>who doesn&#x27;t love the smell of orange?</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I took a chance trying out this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Plus, the company emphasizes the importance of using oils safely.</li>
            <li>One of the most relaxing oils I know.</li>
            <li>delivers fast, I also ordered Bergamot oil and Jojoba oil and am happy with all three.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is an okay product</li>
            <li>:) I used this scent to make homemade bath salts for teachers, co workers and friends as christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>This Orange Oil Essential Oil smells wonderful -</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>This smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>I guess I would not get any more of it.  </li>
            <li>Love the quality.</li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;ve only had a chance to try it once, it appears to be great!</li>
            <li>The kids love to add Ice and being to school.</li>
            <li>I love Plant Therapy Oils...</li>
            <li>Love the fruity smell of oranges.</li>
            <li>This is a great oil and is very concentrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My friends commented on the lovely citrus smell the oil brought to my apartment.</li>
            <li>A NICE LIGHT SCENT FOR THE HOME</li>
            <li>Love these oils from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li>Lovely product.  </li>
            <li>Not saying that everyone will have this sort of reaction, but I sure did.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite orange oil.  </li>
            <li>not at all overwhelming, smells great, and very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>I need much more of this.</li>
            <li>My mom&#x27;s cats love to scratch her furniture.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a sticker on top of the bottle marking the smell, that helps with organizing.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>We are very happy with this product and would definitely buy it again.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my mistake mostly</li>
            <li>, I think I was expecting some citrus magic (isn&#x27;t that a air freshener?) or something</li>
            <li>but I was hoping it would be more in the realm of my favorite one (see below)</li>
            <li>I love the smell of citrus, so I bought this and the lemon version.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>And using the oil it smells nice and clean.</li>
            <li>but it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>I like that they mark the kid friendly oils as well!</li>
            <li>Great product and Plant Therapy does a great job of keeping their prices down, thank you!</li>
            <li>Great product, don&#x27;t pay more for oils, these are equal or better.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is designed to only dispense a drop or two at a time, which is perfect, because you could quickly over do this.  </li>
            <li>Love it&#x27;s rich fragrance.</li>
            <li>Way too strong for my body.</li>
            <li>I use a drop or two in any product that I want to smell more like oranges, from soap to hand lotions, its fragrance remains true.</li>
            <li>This works perfectly to tone down the vinegar in my homemade cleaning supplies.</li>
            <li>Eh, this product smells fine, just like orange, but it doesn&#x27;t do it for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read somewhere that citrus oils are powerful antioxidants and therefore should be used at night as sunlight can interfere and create even more harmful, skin-damaging stuff (may want to google that).  </li>
            <li>Smells fantastic, but not overpowering</li>
            <li>My son loves the smell and we enjoy putting it on each others noses or neck.</li>
            <li>IF YOU ENJOY THE SMELL OF  ORANGES IN THE AIR -USED</li>
            <li>This is a great product and a really terrific price!!!</li>
            <li>a few drops and it is delicious.</li>
            <li>you for making this product available for me&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li>I make homemade diaper cream and deodorant, and lavender is the primary scent (it has antibacterial and antimicrobial properties).</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>it gets off all the old tape, ink smudges, etc and smells good in the process.</li>
            <li>Good quality essential oil to use in many homeopathic, cleaning solution</li>
            <li>Wow, does my house smell good after my wife bought this oil.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a sweet orange set but isn&#x27;t bitter either, just very bright and fruity.</li>
            <li>This is a light, clean orange smell.  </li>
            <li>I doubled the drops and still wasn&#x27;t getting the rich orangey smell I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Clean and not to overpowering.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and especially appreciate the nice packaging of this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent more and received products that weren&#x27;t as good as this.</li>
            <li>Shipping was right on time as well!  </li>
            <li>Loved this orange essential oil.</li>
            <li>This is a very calming scent;Not overwhelming, or too citrus-y.</li>
            <li>It smells almost too sweet.</li>
            <li>It smells sweet and gender neutral.</li>
            <li>the orange is a very uplifting, refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>I bought two other oils as well and am happy with all three.</li>
            <li>Very aromatic, and works great for potpourri, or even massage oil when mixed with jojoba oil as a carrier.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon</li>
            <li>Super product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will order more in the future!</li>
            <li>packaging was great, and the little glass bottle was unharmed in transit.  </li>
            <li>what a fantastic fix to a problem that has been very aggravating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to make my own soap, and this was one of the essential oils I purchased for a soap scent.</li>
            <li>I bought this oil to make my own facial serum.</li>
            <li>Equal parts vinegar, rubbing alcohol, and water, with a few drops each Dawn dish washing liquid, and this orange oil, make an efficient cleaner, that leaves things super clean, disinfected, and smelling wonderful.  </li>
            <li>The orange scent is absolutely beautiful yet not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>This is such a nice fragrance to help wake up your mind and sooth stress.</li>
            <li>I recently bought a few of this brand to try them out, as the price was good and they got good reviews.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it never stinks when I poop.</li>
            <li>Gives the house a fresh orange smell.</li>
            <li>I put a few drops on a cotton ball and placed close to the AC and the room smelled very nice.</li>
            <li>i would recommend it highly to anyone who wants to make their bathing experience more relaxing.</li>
            <li>It was delivered right away.  </li>
            <li>Makes me want one right now in fact.  </li>
            <li>A very nice product, I&#x27;ve used this for aromatherapy in the past.  </li>
            <li>I am a massage therapist, and love to theme the scents in my room to the season (as much as possible), So this is one that I used for summer!  </li>
            <li>all is exactly as the seller described it.</li>
            <li>I have used it so far for my homemade liquid dishwashing soap recipe and it smells fabulous.</li>
            <li>It also combines well with lemon essential oil to make a citrus blend :)</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it definitely perks you up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but I&#x27;ll look for a stronger smelling brand next time.</li>
            <li>I love this essential oil.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite essential oils.</li>
            <li>I add it to my hot lemon &amp; honey water in the morning.</li>
            <li>Thus fits the bill, shipping was fast, cost was right on.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a bright citrus scent akin to the lemon essential oil I purchased at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Makes a good &amp;#34;no scratch&amp;#34; furniture formula mixed with equal parts of Eucalyptus oil.  </li>
            <li>purpose cleaner - 1 cup vinegar, 1 cup water and several drops of orange essential oil mixed in a spray bottle makes a very good household cleaner.</li>
            <li>100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.</li>
            <li>The scent is not particularly strong, but it&#x27;s very pleasant, exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li>Smells like a real orange.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li>I really like it with clove in soaps or diffused....</li>
            <li>Very concentrated and flavorful.</li>
            <li>This product came packaged very well</li>
            <li>Very good.100% recomend</li>
            <li>Also, the quantity received is very generous for the price.  </li>
            <li>In any case, I enjoy dabbing it behind my ears because I smell like fresh oranges, one of the most heavenly smells on the planet.</li>
            <li>I really like this brand</li>
            <li>Bought the oil to make a salt scrub in a 10 oz glass jar... had to use the whole bottle to make it smell..</li>
            <li>and I like it just as much.</li>
            <li>I really liked this essential oil, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It was probably stretched with some cheap carrier oil.</li>
            <li>The scent was more robust than the previous brand I was using.</li>
            <li>Not very strong so you use more for a noticeable scent when using an ultrasonic diffuser.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still loyal to my regular brand, Edens Garden, but I&#x27;d throw this in as an &#x27;add on item&#x27; any time.</li>
            <li>Each week spray around areas such as baseboards and floor corners where spiders enjoy appearing on their soft webs.  </li>
            <li>I like everything else I&#x27;ve gotten from Plant Therapy, but I think I might look elsewhere when it&#x27;s time to replace this particular bottle.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality product and I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li>Beware of it causing high blood pressure and a racing heartbeat.</li>
            <li>This essential oil is exactly as advertised!  </li>
            <li>This essential oil smells just like you have peeled a fresh orange.  </li>
            <li>I put a few drops on a cotton ball and leave it on top of my cat&#x27;s covered litter box.  </li>
            <li>While it smells nice, it is not very strong and doesn&#x27;t last more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll Be right back......</li>
            <li>but you have to be right next to it to catch a hint of the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I like orange or sweet orange added to it to give it a slightly different and more complex scent.</li>
            <li>It truly brings a smell of comfort and just instantly makes you feel comfortable enough to just close your eyes and fall asleep.</li>
            <li>so if you only need 2-3 drops for something watch carefully cause you might get more like 10 drops when you tip the bottle.</li>
            <li>Either that or it is very old.</li>
            <li>I wish there was more in that small bottle.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would make me dream of Florida or the Caribbean, but unfortunately, it is not a magical oil. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Nice, very delicate fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have asthma, and a lot of store bought cleaners eat me alive.  </li>
            <li>and it is clearly marked that it is orange.  </li>
            <li>It smells so natural, unlike the Body and Bath Work&#x27;s too-much-and-too-fake-smell.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was because I initially sniffed it straight from the bottle, so I put some on a sachet that would go in with my newest batch of homemade laundry detergent.  </li>
            <li>My only qualm is that it drips really fast</li>
            <li>I would absolutely order this or another essential oil product from this vendor again.</li>
            <li>Felt like I need at least two more bottles to make it smell \\&quot;orangy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I use this and other essential oils from Plant Therapy to lightly flavor my sodastream carbonated water.</li>
            <li>The scent is subtle on my freshly dried clothes but smells very nice.</li>
            <li>no regrets!</li>
            <li>I tried it with 5 or 6 drops in a home fragrance diffuser but could barely smell it.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time of even smelling orange essential oil, so I don&#x27;t have a way of comparing it with any other.</li>
            <li>My mom collects plants, and putting the oil in a small bowl with water drowned many tiny flies from the plant pots.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that a few drops really take care of the vinegar smell.</li>
            <li>I combined several drops of this Orange Essential Oil and several drops of the Lavendar Essential Oil from the same company in a spray bottle with water and started misting the area around a piece of furniture on which one of my older cats had started urinating on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not worth the hassle of sending it back, so I&#x27;ll see if I can find someone who wants it locally.</li>
            <li>I could feel a dizziness a little later but didn&#x27;t think too much of it.</li>

            <li> I found it to be quit nice.  </li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m glad that I took a chance trying out this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Plus, the company emphasizes the importance of using oils safely.</li>
            <li> One of the most relaxing oils I know.</li>
            <li> delivers fast, I also ordered Bergamot oil and Jojoba oil and am happy with all three.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is an okay product</li>
            <li> :) I used this scent to make homemade bath salts for teachers, co workers and friends as christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> This Orange Oil Essential Oil smells wonderful -</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li> This smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> I guess I would not get any more of it.  </li>
            <li> Love the quality.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;ve only had a chance to try it once, it appears to be great!</li>
            <li> The kids love to add Ice and being to school.</li>
            <li> I love Plant Therapy Oils...</li>
            <li> Love the fruity smell of oranges.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil and is very concentrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My friends commented on the lovely citrus smell the oil brought to my apartment.</li>
            <li> A NICE LIGHT SCENT FOR THE HOME</li>
            <li> Love these oils from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> Lovely product.  </li>
            <li> Not saying that everyone will have this sort of reaction, but I sure did.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite orange oil.  </li>
            <li> not at all overwhelming, smells great, and very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> I need much more of this.</li>
            <li> My mom&#x27;s cats love to scratch her furniture.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a sticker on top of the bottle marking the smell, that helps with organizing.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> We are very happy with this product and would definitely buy it again.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my mistake mostly</li>
            <li> , I think I was expecting some citrus magic (isn&#x27;t that a air freshener?) or something</li>
            <li> but I was hoping it would be more in the realm of my favorite one (see below)</li>
            <li> I love the smell of citrus, so I bought this and the lemon version.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> And using the oil it smells nice and clean.</li>
            <li> but it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> I like that they mark the kid friendly oils as well!</li>
            <li> Great product and Plant Therapy does a great job of keeping their prices down, thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product, don&#x27;t pay more for oils, these are equal or better.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is designed to only dispense a drop or two at a time, which is perfect, because you could quickly over do this.  </li>
            <li> Love it&#x27;s rich fragrance.</li>
            <li> Way too strong for my body.</li>
            <li> I use a drop or two in any product that I want to smell more like oranges, from soap to hand lotions, its fragrance remains true.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly to tone down the vinegar in my homemade cleaning supplies.</li>
            <li> Eh, this product smells fine, just like orange, but it doesn&#x27;t do it for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read somewhere that citrus oils are powerful antioxidants and therefore should be used at night as sunlight can interfere and create even more harmful, skin-damaging stuff (may want to google that).  </li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, but not overpowering</li>
            <li> My son loves the smell and we enjoy putting it on each others noses or neck.</li>
            <li> IF YOU ENJOY THE SMELL OF  ORANGES IN THE AIR -USED</li>
            <li> This is a great product and a really terrific price!!!</li>
            <li> a few drops and it is delicious.</li>
            <li> you for making this product available for me&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li> I make homemade diaper cream and deodorant, and lavender is the primary scent (it has antibacterial and antimicrobial properties).</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> it gets off all the old tape, ink smudges, etc and smells good in the process.</li>
            <li> Good quality essential oil to use in many homeopathic, cleaning solution</li>
            <li> Wow, does my house smell good after my wife bought this oil.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a sweet orange set but isn&#x27;t bitter either, just very bright and fruity.</li>
            <li> This is a light, clean orange smell.  </li>
            <li> I doubled the drops and still wasn&#x27;t getting the rich orangey smell I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Clean and not to overpowering.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and especially appreciate the nice packaging of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent more and received products that weren&#x27;t as good as this.</li>
            <li> Shipping was right on time as well!  </li>
            <li> Loved this orange essential oil.</li>
            <li> This is a very calming scent;Not overwhelming, or too citrus-y.</li>
            <li> It smells almost too sweet.</li>
            <li> It smells sweet and gender neutral.</li>
            <li> the orange is a very uplifting, refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> I bought two other oils as well and am happy with all three.</li>
            <li> Very aromatic, and works great for potpourri, or even massage oil when mixed with jojoba oil as a carrier.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon</li>
            <li> Super product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will order more in the future!</li>
            <li> packaging was great, and the little glass bottle was unharmed in transit.  </li>
            <li> what a fantastic fix to a problem that has been very aggravating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to make my own soap, and this was one of the essential oils I purchased for a soap scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to make my own facial serum.</li>
            <li> Equal parts vinegar, rubbing alcohol, and water, with a few drops each Dawn dish washing liquid, and this orange oil, make an efficient cleaner, that leaves things super clean, disinfected, and smelling wonderful.  </li>
            <li> The orange scent is absolutely beautiful yet not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> This is such a nice fragrance to help wake up your mind and sooth stress.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a few of this brand to try them out, as the price was good and they got good reviews.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it never stinks when I poop.</li>
            <li> Gives the house a fresh orange smell.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on a cotton ball and placed close to the AC and the room smelled very nice.</li>
            <li> i would recommend it highly to anyone who wants to make their bathing experience more relaxing.</li>
            <li> It was delivered right away.  </li>
            <li> Makes me want one right now in fact.  </li>
            <li> A very nice product, I&#x27;ve used this for aromatherapy in the past.  </li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist, and love to theme the scents in my room to the season (as much as possible), So this is one that I used for summer!  </li>
            <li> all is exactly as the seller described it.</li>
            <li> I have used it so far for my homemade liquid dishwashing soap recipe and it smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> It also combines well with lemon essential oil to make a citrus blend :)</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it definitely perks you up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I&#x27;ll look for a stronger smelling brand next time.</li>
            <li> I love this essential oil.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite essential oils.</li>
            <li> I add it to my hot lemon &amp; honey water in the morning.</li>
            <li> Thus fits the bill, shipping was fast, cost was right on.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a bright citrus scent akin to the lemon essential oil I purchased at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Makes a good &amp;#34;no scratch&amp;#34; furniture formula mixed with equal parts of Eucalyptus oil.  </li>
            <li> purpose cleaner - 1 cup vinegar, 1 cup water and several drops of orange essential oil mixed in a spray bottle makes a very good household cleaner.</li>
            <li> 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.</li>
            <li> The scent is not particularly strong, but it&#x27;s very pleasant, exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> Smells like a real orange.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> I really like it with clove in soaps or diffused....</li>
            <li> Very concentrated and flavorful.</li>
            <li> This product came packaged very well</li>
            <li> Very good.100% recomend</li>
            <li> Also, the quantity received is very generous for the price.  </li>
            <li> In any case, I enjoy dabbing it behind my ears because I smell like fresh oranges, one of the most heavenly smells on the planet.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand</li>
            <li> Bought the oil to make a salt scrub in a 10 oz glass jar... had to use the whole bottle to make it smell..</li>
            <li> and I like it just as much.</li>
            <li> I really liked this essential oil, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It was probably stretched with some cheap carrier oil.</li>
            <li> The scent was more robust than the previous brand I was using.</li>
            <li> Not very strong so you use more for a noticeable scent when using an ultrasonic diffuser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still loyal to my regular brand, Edens Garden, but I&#x27;d throw this in as an &#x27;add on item&#x27; any time.</li>
            <li> Each week spray around areas such as baseboards and floor corners where spiders enjoy appearing on their soft webs.  </li>
            <li> I like everything else I&#x27;ve gotten from Plant Therapy, but I think I might look elsewhere when it&#x27;s time to replace this particular bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product and I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Beware of it causing high blood pressure and a racing heartbeat.</li>
            <li> This essential oil is exactly as advertised!  </li>
            <li> This essential oil smells just like you have peeled a fresh orange.  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops on a cotton ball and leave it on top of my cat&#x27;s covered litter box.  </li>
            <li> While it smells nice, it is not very strong and doesn&#x27;t last more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll Be right back......</li>
            <li> but you have to be right next to it to catch a hint of the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I like orange or sweet orange added to it to give it a slightly different and more complex scent.</li>
            <li> It truly brings a smell of comfort and just instantly makes you feel comfortable enough to just close your eyes and fall asleep.</li>
            <li> so if you only need 2-3 drops for something watch carefully cause you might get more like 10 drops when you tip the bottle.</li>
            <li> Either that or it is very old.</li>
            <li> I wish there was more in that small bottle.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would make me dream of Florida or the Caribbean, but unfortunately, it is not a magical oil. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Nice, very delicate fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have asthma, and a lot of store bought cleaners eat me alive.  </li>
            <li> and it is clearly marked that it is orange.  </li>
            <li> It smells so natural, unlike the Body and Bath Work&#x27;s too-much-and-too-fake-smell.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was because I initially sniffed it straight from the bottle, so I put some on a sachet that would go in with my newest batch of homemade laundry detergent.  </li>
            <li> My only qualm is that it drips really fast</li>
            <li> I would absolutely order this or another essential oil product from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Felt like I need at least two more bottles to make it smell \\&quot;orangy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I use this and other essential oils from Plant Therapy to lightly flavor my sodastream carbonated water.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle on my freshly dried clothes but smells very nice.</li>
            <li> no regrets!</li>
            <li> I tried it with 5 or 6 drops in a home fragrance diffuser but could barely smell it.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time of even smelling orange essential oil, so I don&#x27;t have a way of comparing it with any other.</li>
            <li> My mom collects plants, and putting the oil in a small bowl with water drowned many tiny flies from the plant pots.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that a few drops really take care of the vinegar smell.</li>
            <li> I combined several drops of this Orange Essential Oil and several drops of the Lavendar Essential Oil from the same company in a spray bottle with water and started misting the area around a piece of furniture on which one of my older cats had started urinating on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not worth the hassle of sending it back, so I&#x27;ll see if I can find someone who wants it locally.</li>
            <li> I could feel a dizziness a little later but didn&#x27;t think too much of it.</li>
            <li> I have to add a lot more of it to my burner to fill a room, and its difficult to get the proper scent when blending it with other oils.</li>
            <li> I use this in the toilet</li>
            <li> Just 3 drops in the toilet before pooping and it never smells like poop.</li>
            <li> Not as long lasting as my other brand,</li>
            <li> After a single email, they refunded the cost of this oil, and two others in my oil.  </li>
            <li> Much nicer than commercial air fresheners but does not give me that weird headache/light headed feeling a lot of essential oils</li>
            <li> , I bought a few others that the smells was barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> less functional, orange makes a big difference!</li>
            <li> Ms. K.&#x27;s Angels) really enjoy the scent, however, increasing the amount of oil per use will be too expensive (on my out-of-pocket-budget) to use everyday.</li>
            <li> I still have it, but have not used it like I expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying someone else might not really like it allot</li>
            <li> I expected this essence to fill a room when sprinkled on a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected.</li>
            <li> only complaint was that a little leaked in the process but not enough for it to be a problem.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work to ride house of dust mites, other mites if you have pets</li>
            <li> Smells extremely well.</li>
            <li> , it was hard to figure out how the lid worked and open it.</li>
            <li> This oil has hardly any fragrance, definitely not 100% orange oil.</li>
            <li> I just put a few drops on my wet bag.</li>
            <li> The drop dispenser mechanism works to allow one drop at a time to be dispensed, despite what I saw in a few other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not happy I can barely smell anything</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in a shaving oil blend I was making for my boyfriend to add a little fragrance</li>
            <li> I use this in my yoga classes, I pour a little on a towel and then wave the towel over students in savasana.  </li>
            <li> Would dab a little on my wrists and neck for an energizing boost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why other reviews say that it is not strong smelling.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less expensive than other essential oils I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li> When seeking this oil, the product was difficult to find and what was available in stores, quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> I use a few drops on my wool dryer balls.</li>
            <li> A few drop in food change the taste</li>
            <li> Put it on a few spots on my face in the morning.</li>
            <li> Very thin and low quality compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> I ordered a few different oils from this company, and this one seems very weak by comparison.</li>
            <li> I tried this in 2 different spray bottles and both times they failed to work after a week or so.</li>
            <li> You add about three drops to a pint of water along with a small drop of dishwashing liquid.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell however the amount was terrible</li>
            <li> My heart raced and beat so hard in my chest</li>
            <li> ,one complaint</li>
            <li> My husband and son always complained when I cleaned with vinegar because they didn&#x27;t care for it</li>
            <li> It arrived with the safety seal broken and 10-20% of the oil missing.  </li>
            <li> Planed on using it in the house for a subtle fragrence and maybe also the therapeutic solutions people suggest.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a pick my up if I was getting tired during the day.</li>
            <li> I have used up to 5 drops in my Mister (w/ distilled water) in my small classroom; somewhat disappointed that the scent not detectable after 05-08 min.</li>
            <li> Poor quality!</li>
            <li> I will not reorder, I gave an extra star because it&#x27;s not all terrible for scenting up my cleaning products.</li>
            <li> The orange had gone rancid either from the heat or is just really bad quality.</li>
            <li> Was in need of something to disguise/distract me from a client&#x27;s bad body odor</li>
            <li> so I was disappointed with it for that reason.</li>
            <li> But to my nose, it smells like rotten orange peel. :(  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells great! I would definitely recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> Happy with product and delivery!</li>
            <li> Great smell. I wish there was more in that small bottle. Very good.</li>
            <li> Good product with fair price!</li>
            <li> I decided to make my own soap, and this was one of the essential oils I purchased for a soap scent. It smells great and is even nice to add to foods and drinks for a delightful orange taste.</li>
            <li> great buy! no regrets!</li>
            <li> i used the oil. it smells good and it was a good price. i will order it again. im a massage therapist and i use it in my practice.</li>
            <li> love this product - it smells great and it works for what i purchased it for (homemade cleaning supplies - makes vinegar smell better.)  only complaint was that a little leaked in the process but not enough for it to be a problem.  would definately buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all purpose cleaner - 1 cup vinegar, 1 cup water and several drops of orange essential oil mixed in a spray bottle makes a very good household cleaner.</li>
            <li> who doesn&#x27;t love the smell of orange?</li>
            <li> Smells like a real orange. But I wish it would last a lil bit longer. I&#x27;m using it in my cleaning regimen.</li>
            <li> This was very nice oil..,one complaint, it was hard to figure out how the lid worked and open it. I broke it trying to open it.</li>
            <li> This essential oil has a wonderful aroma and is great for use in sugar scrubs with a bit of lemongrass and lavender. Plant Therapy was a good deal for the price and I&#x27;m glad that I took a chance trying out this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Terrific. I really like Plant Therapy oils because they are of excellent quality, at a great price point, and are not marketed aggressively. Plus, the company emphasizes the importance of using oils safely. This orange oil is great. Thanks, Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> great eo for the price!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to fragrance cleaning supplies and dryer balls. This orange smells wonderful.  It came packaged well.  We will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> We are using this to add flavor and smell. So far so good</li>
            <li> Good product... great value!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was Prime eligible, it smells like orange alright!  I&#x27;m still loyal to my regular brand, Edens Garden, but I&#x27;d throw this in as an &#x27;add on item&#x27; any time.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! It is great for stopping a zit in it&#x27;s tracks before it gets out of control! Great product and Plant Therapy does a great job of keeping their prices down, thank you!</li>
            <li> This has a wonderful aroma and is a winner in my books. I used this in my shampoos to add extra fragrance.</li>
            <li> to be honest  it was quiute ok at the beginning, but after 2 month it wind out(((( and there is no orange smell at all((((</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love it&#x27;s rich fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very thin and low quality compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> I tried this in 2 different spray bottles and both times they failed to work after a week or so. Can&#x27;t figure it out. So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> This essential oil is exactly as advertised!  I purchased it to add to a bottle of boiled mineral oil for use as a wooden utensil conditioner/preservative.  It&#x27;s likely the orange oil drops will find their way into some aroma therapy as well.  This is a high quality product and I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and a lime oil for homemade detergent scents. I also mix this with water and spray the air conditioning filter to help give my home a nice scent once in a while. My mom collects plants, and putting the oil in a small bowl with water drowned many tiny flies from the plant pots.</li>
            <li> One of the most relaxing oils I know. Mixed with lavender and you&#x27;re in for a great night of sleep.</li>
            <li> Very aromatic, and works great for potpourri, or even massage oil when mixed with jojoba oil as a carrier.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon delivers fast, I also ordered Bergamot oil and Jojoba oil and am happy with all three.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is an okay product but it did not cut the grease like I had hoped in my homemade dish soup so I was disappointed with it for that reason.</li>
            <li> I use this on my plastic desk cover.  it gets off all the old tape, ink smudges, etc and smells good in the process.</li>
            <li> We mix a couple drops of this with a container of water and pour it where our dog relieves himself in the yard. It not only helps deodorize the yard, but Orange Oil helps detract against insects so it helps with mosquitos as well.</li>
            <li> Super product :) I used this scent to make homemade bath salts for teachers, co workers and friends as christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to make my own facial serum. It works perfect for my skin, and I love the smell and feel.</li>
            <li> When seeking this oil, the product was difficult to find and what was available in stores, quite expensive.  This works so well in creating a spider preventer in our house.  You add about three drops to a pint of water along with a small drop of dishwashing liquid.  Pour into a spray bottle.  Each week spray around areas such as baseboards and floor corners where spiders enjoy appearing on their soft webs.  This has helped greatly in our house.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why other reviews say that it is not strong smelling.  I found it to be quit nice.  I put a few drops on a cotton ball and placed close to the AC and the room smelled very nice. I have not tried it in a warmer yet.</li>
            <li> I love how amazing this smells... It was given to me though, I didn&#x27;t buy it. But I would when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist, and love to theme the scents in my room to the season (as much as possible), So this is one that I used for summer!  My clients loved it! Wonderful orange scent!</li>
            <li> MAKE MY OWN CLEANING PRODUCTS.  USE THIS FOR THE SCENT.  GIVES THE HOUSE A WONDERFUL CLEAN SMELL !!!  WORKS JUST GREAT.!!!!!</li>
            <li> This Orange Oil Essential Oil smells wonderful - all is exactly as the seller described it. Packaging was good and the bottle itself is high-quality. I love it! I bought two other oils as well and am happy with all three.</li>
            <li> I have used up to 5 drops in my Mister (w/ distilled water) in my small classroom; somewhat disappointed that the scent not detectable after 05-08 min. My special-needs students (a.k.a. Ms. K.&#x27;s Angels) really enjoy the scent, however, increasing the amount of oil per use will be too expensive (on my out-of-pocket-budget) to use everyday.</li>
            <li> Loved this orange essential oil. It smells so amazing! I use this in some heat packs I make. People love it!</li>
            <li> I mix this in water along with lemon essential oil and use it to spray my plants and under furniture, so my cat won&#x27;t play in or around them.  So far, so good!</li>
            <li> I have asthma, and a lot of store bought cleaners eat me alive.  I have taken to making my own detergent, glass cleaner, and floor cleaner for my laminate flooring.  Equal parts vinegar, rubbing alcohol, and water, with a few drops each Dawn dish washing liquid, and this orange oil, make an efficient cleaner, that leaves things super clean, disinfected, and smelling wonderful.  It is also great if you want to make your own gel room deoderizers.</li>
            <li> Great smell, one drop is plenty for me. I use it in my CPAP machine to give me a nice smell to go to sleep with. I was hoping it would make me dream of Florida or the Caribbean, but unfortunately, it is not a magical oil. :)</li>
            <li> I received this oil and the lid had already been opened.  The orange had gone rancid either from the heat or is just really bad quality.</li>
            <li> I like getting directions and uses with my oils, but none here. I got them before from another company, will go back to that company.</li>
            <li> I loved using this product! The scent was more robust than the previous brand I was using.</li>
            <li> Purchased your products before. Smells great and appears to be pure..</li>
            <li> This is a very calming scent;Not overwhelming, or too citrus-y. I DO NOT recommend adding to your humidifier water. Find somewhere else to disperse it. It is a nice scent for the home.</li>
            <li> It was delivered right away.  I absolutely love the way it smells.  I have used it so far for my homemade liquid dishwashing soap recipe and it smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> I gave this product five stars because I simply love it!  The orange scent is absolutely beautiful yet not overwhelming.  I like the container it came in and it is clearly marked that it is orange.  Shipping was right on time as well!  I will definitely buy from here again and also will recommend.</li>
            <li> bought this oil as a gift, as orange peel when used as a massage oil on lower abdomen is suppose to improve peristalsis of the intestines.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a fair price!  I am very happy with my purchase! I&#x27;m sure I will order more in the future!</li>
            <li> I use orange oil to freshen bedding and carpets..mixed with water, enzyme mixture.....It seems to work to ride house of dust mites, other mites if you have pets</li>
            <li> This is such an uplifting oil.  It arrived with the safety seal broken and 10-20% of the oil missing.  After a single email, they refunded the cost of this oil, and two others in my oil.  Plant Therapy has excellent customer service, and the quality of the oils is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> Not very strong so you use more for a noticeable scent when using an ultrasonic diffuser.</li>
            <li> I use a drop or two in any product that I want to smell more like oranges, from soap to hand lotions, its fragrance remains true.</li>
            <li> This smells fantastic! I really like it with clove in soaps or diffused.... I also use it with vinegar and water to clean and it makes the house smell so nice! My husband and son always complained when I cleaned with vinegar because they didn&#x27;t care for it and now they don&#x27;t complain.  I was surprised that a few drops really take care of the vinegar smell. Its a good deal too. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this brand again!</li>
            <li> I still have it, but have not used it like I expected.  It has a nice fragrance.  I guess I would not get any more of it.  That is just my opinion for my situation.  I&#x27;m not saying someone else might not really like it allot</li>
            <li> Smells extremely well. It drips out one drop at a time like it should.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance .  Clean and not to overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is such a nice fragrance to help wake up your mind and sooth stress. It makes the house smell good as well.</li>
            <li> Great price. Love the quality.</li>
            <li> I used this in my homemade lip balm along with a clove oil and everyone loved the flavor! Good price and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Good quality essential oil to use in many homeopathic, cleaning solution, whatever use you may desire.</li>
            <li> Citrus oils are so uplifting and invigorating.  This smells sooooooo good!  I also got grapefruit and lemon oil and like to combine all three and mix with my lotion.  I&#x27;ve read somewhere that citrus oils are powerful antioxidants and therefore should be used at night as sunlight can interfere and create even more harmful, skin-damaging stuff (may want to google that).  So I don&#x27;t use these on my face during the day.  But all in all, I&#x27;m loving the citrus oils.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and especially appreciate the nice packaging of this product. Would definitely buy again. Thank You</li>
            <li> I ordered a few different oils from this company, and this one seems very weak by comparison. I have to add a lot more of it to my burner to fill a room, and its difficult to get the proper scent when blending it with other oils. I like everything else I&#x27;ve gotten from Plant Therapy, but I think I might look elsewhere when it&#x27;s time to replace this particular bottle.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops on my wool dryer balls. The scent is subtle on my freshly dried clothes but smells very nice.</li>
            <li> This essential oil smells just like you have peeled a fresh orange.  I am using it in a brown sugar foot scrub that I make for gifts.  It also combines well with lemon essential oil to make a citrus blend :)&lt;br /&gt;-Lisakay</li>
            <li> I love it, it smells great. It smells so natural, unlike the Body and Bath Work&#x27;s too-much-and-too-fake-smell. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> yep, it smells like an orange when you peel one.  Makes me want one right now in fact.  I&#x27;ll Be right back......</li>
            <li> Wow, does my house smell good after my wife bought this oil. She made some DIY cleaning solutions and air fresheners and with this stuff and boy is it the bees knee&#x27;s AND the cat&#x27;s pajamas!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside of this orange oil is that the bottle doesn&#x27;t open itself. You do have to twist it to open. They should work on that. Otherwise, this oil rocks.</li>
            <li> this is a reorder for me this oil has a lot of purposes  I use for a lot of different things</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;ve only had a chance to try it once, it appears to be great!</li>
            <li> Very concentrated and flavorful. Excellent way to flavor my water! The kids love to add Ice and being to school.</li>
            <li> I love Plant Therapy Oils...good quality &amp; price!</li>
            <li> Really great product. Love the fruity smell of oranges.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, but not overpowering</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a pick my up if I was getting tired during the day. I love the smell and it definitely perks you up. My son loves the smell and we enjoy putting it on each others noses or neck. He is so amazed that it smells so good. Love this!</li>
            <li> This oil smell great and is a great price for an essential oil. Works great for covering cloth diaper odor. I just put a few drops on my wet bag.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and works great in my cleansing oil (face).</li>
            <li> A few drop in food change the taste</li>
            <li> This is my first time of even smelling orange essential oil, so I don&#x27;t have a way of comparing it with any other.That is why I only give it 4 stars.But I can say it smells great.The packaging was really good also.I was happy with it.</li>
            <li> Just as pictured! Awesome deal!</li>
            <li> This oil has hardly any fragrance, definitely not 100% orange oil. It was probably stretched with some cheap carrier oil. Either that or it is very old. Poor quality!</li>
            <li> I tried this as both a perfume and a deodorant substitute. Well, uh... if you put this on you will smell like oranges for days. If you put this on and sweat, you will smell like not-so-fresh-oranges for days. I read &amp;#34;Dirklus&amp;#34; and my body scent kept creeping into my mind&#x27;s eye and stinking up the story.</li>
            <li> I have been using essential oils for years for a variety of purposes.  I recently bought a few of this brand to try them out, as the price was good and they got good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was great, and the little glass bottle was unharmed in transit.  The drop dispenser mechanism works to allow one drop at a time to be dispensed, despite what I saw in a few other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issue is with the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell it&#x27;s orange.  But to my nose, it smells like rotten orange peel. :(  I was expecting a bright citrus scent akin to the lemon essential oil I purchased at the same time.  I thought maybe it was because I initially sniffed it straight from the bottle, so I put some on a sachet that would go in with my newest batch of homemade laundry detergent.  No dice.  It still smells rancid to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not worth the hassle of sending it back, so I&#x27;ll see if I can find someone who wants it locally.</li>
            <li> It truly brings a smell of comfort and just instantly makes you feel comfortable enough to just close your eyes and fall asleep.</li>
            <li> Great product, don&#x27;t pay more for oils, these are equal or better.  I&#x27;ve spent more and received products that weren&#x27;t as good as this.</li>
            <li> I mix this oil with another citrus oil in my diffuser and it works great.  This product came packaged very well and you could tell--with care!  Thank you Plant Therapy (and Amazon!).</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use as a home fragrance.  While it smells nice, it is not very strong and doesn&#x27;t last more than a few minutes.  I tried it with 5 or 6 drops in a home fragrance diffuser but could barely smell it.  I doubled the drops and still wasn&#x27;t getting the rich orangey smell I was looking for. I left the house and came back 30 minutes later and couldn&#x27;t smell it at all.  Maybe it isn&#x27;t meant for this application.  It&#x27;s okay, but I&#x27;ll look for a stronger smelling brand next time.</li>
            <li> I combined several drops of this Orange Essential Oil and several drops of the Lavendar Essential Oil from the same company in a spray bottle with water and started misting the area around a piece of furniture on which one of my older cats had started urinating on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been doing this for about a week and there have been no further occurences of this behavior, what a fantastic fix to a problem that has been very aggravating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t guarantee that it would work for all cats but it has been a great fix with mine for sure.</li>
            <li> Have not used this oil yet but it smells pretty good. Planed on using it in the house for a subtle fragrence and maybe also the therapeutic solutions people suggest.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil and is very concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;It has a wonderful smell and is not irritating to your skin as some oils are for me. I will order this again.</li>
            <li> I will not reorder, I gave an extra star because it&#x27;s not all terrible for scenting up my cleaning products.</li>
            <li> I use this in the toilet so it never stinks when I poop. 3 drops and it prevents smells! Unlike spray cans that make it smell like poop and flowers! Just 3 drops in the toilet before pooping and it never smells like poop.</li>
            <li> Great price for the item and fast delivery, smells wonderful, thank you for the excellent product, I will be buying more of these oils!</li>
            <li> I read about using essential oil and baking powder as a carpet powder. The powder is great for use in between carpet cleanings. My friends commented on the lovely citrus smell the oil brought to my apartment. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Perfect, I mix with Ginger root for relaxed lung sensation.</li>
            <li> Yet to use; however, I know it come in handy. May use this product for massage or add to my bath.</li>
            <li> I love this essential oil. One of my favorites. My only qualm is that it drips really fast so if you only need 2-3 drops for something watch carefully cause you might get more like 10 drops when you tip the bottle.</li>
            <li> Great, pure orange EO. Perfect for when you need a little happy boost!</li>
            <li> As the title says, the oil is perfect. I use it to refresh my apartment, use it with my cleaning products, just what i needed.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is great, not cheep feeling or anything like...Very good.100% recomend</li>
            <li> love it works great as well</li>
            <li> smells wonderful, use it for my epsom salt baths!  i would recommend it highly to anyone who wants to make their bathing experience more relaxing.</li>
            <li> A NICE LIGHT SCENT FOR THE HOME IF YOU ENJOY THE SMELL OF  ORANGES IN THE AIR -USED AS AROMATHERAPY FOR PATIENTS OR IN THE HOME.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in a shaving oil blend I was making for my boyfriend to add a little fragrance and it worked perfectly well. It isn&#x27;t a sweet orange set but isn&#x27;t bitter either, just very bright and fruity.</li>
            <li> The scent is not particularly strong, but it&#x27;s very pleasant, exactly as expected.  Also, the quantity received is very generous for the price.  I would absolutely order this or another essential oil product from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> great product, quick delivery</li>
            <li> This is a great product and a really terrific price!!!</li>
            <li> Love these oils from Plant Therapy.</li>
            <li> delicious with patchouli oil</li>
            <li> Lovely product.  I used it to make vanilla and orange scented glycerine soap.  I smells just like those ice cream bars with orange coating.  Yum yum!</li>
            <li> Great oil and smells fresh and wonderful! I like that they mark the kid friendly oils as well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I tried to see if it would work as well as doTerra to repel my cats. Nope.</li>
            <li> Where&#x27;s the warning for this kind of oil? Beware of it causing high blood pressure and a racing heartbeat. Wish I could&#x27;ve used it. Purchased it to fade sunspots. Way too strong for my body. Put it on a few spots on my face in the morning. I could feel a dizziness a little later but didn&#x27;t think too much of it. Applied again that night and obviously overdid it. Should&#x27;ve only put it on that one time because I literally thought I was going to have a heart attack that night. My heart raced and beat so hard in my chest, I didn&#x27;t find any relief until about 12 hours later. Not saying that everyone will have this sort of reaction, but I sure did. They should have a skull and crossbones on the label for people like me.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite orange oil.  It smells almost too sweet.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this oil, i was pleasantly suprised by the light and floral scent. not at all overwhelming, smells great, and very relaxing. I always order from plant therapy they have great quality oils. looove ittt</li>
            <li> Not happy I can barely smell anything</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It tastes like that orange drink you get from Dairy Queen. It&#x27;s also very good in my homemade toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I use this and other essential oils from Plant Therapy to lightly flavor my sodastream carbonated water. a few drops and it is delicious.</li>
            <li> Nice, very delicate fragrance. Loved it.</li>
            <li> Good smell. A great price and prompt shipping too.</li>
            <li> Not as long lasting as my other brand, but this is the only orange oil I have tried.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Amazon is the problem, ripping off customers by claiming you joined Prime when you did not. Taking your money without your permission and then holding it to collect the interest from (millions of us I am sure) and then saying sorry.........but they got the interest on my money, not me.</li>
            <li> This product is for oral use only. I bought it thinking that I could add it to my mouthwash, but that was an incorrect assumption. In any case, I enjoy dabbing it behind my ears because I smell like fresh oranges, one of the most heavenly smells on the planet.</li>
            <li> smells great&lt;br /&gt;make my stuff smell great with it&lt;br /&gt;thank you for making this product available for me&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> I need much more of this. It smells sweet and gender neutral. Good for pairing with manly scents &#x27;for him&#x27; or with cleaners.</li>
            <li> I expected this essence to fill a room when sprinkled on a cotton ball. It works for maybe an hour or two but you have to be right next to it to catch a hint of the fragrance. I&#x27;ll use it till it&#x27;s gone but I won&#x27; buy it again. I&#x27;m going to put some in a  reed diffuser and see if it is more effective. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Makes a good &amp;#34;no scratch&amp;#34; furniture formula mixed with equal parts of Eucalyptus oil.  My mom&#x27;s cats love to scratch her furniture.  Makes your house smell great too.</li>
            <li> smells amazing! I really like this brand, I bought a few others that the smells was barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Very happy with thisâ€”use it to make homemade lotions and deodorants. Noticed that when I ran out, my homemade deodorants were less functional, orange makes a big difference!</li>
            <li> I use this in my yoga classes, I pour a little on a towel and then wave the towel over students in savasana.  This is a light, clean orange smell.  The bottle is designed to only dispense a drop or two at a time, which is perfect, because you could quickly over do this.  There&#x27;s a sticker on top of the bottle marking the smell, that helps with organizing.</li>
            <li> I love how it smells! I can almost taste taste orange. I use it in the bath room to freshen up the smell in there. lol I have three boys :) And using the oil it smells nice and clean.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly to tone down the vinegar in my homemade cleaning supplies. Gives the house a fresh orange smell. Love it.</li>
            <li> We are very happy with this product and would definitely buy it again.  The smell is very nice and is perfect for creating a wonderful aroma in our home.  Thanks for a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Eh, this product smells fine, just like orange, but it doesn&#x27;t do it for me.  It&#x27;s my mistake mostly, I think I was expecting some citrus magic (isn&#x27;t that a air freshener?) or something but it&#x27;s just orange.  Hey, if you want to use it to ADD it into something..go for it, that&#x27;s probably what I&#x27;ll do - dish detergent, laundry detergent etc.  but I was hoping it would be more in the realm of my favorite one (see below) but it&#x27;s just Orange - that&#x27;s probably why they call it that - yup....this is my issue not Plant Therapy&#x27;s problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE this stuff:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VSXU30/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tranquil Synergy Essential Oil Blend. 10 ml. 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade. (Blend of: Bergamot, Patchouli, Blood Orange, Ylang Ylang and Grapefruit)</li>
            <li> I put a few drops on a cotton ball and leave it on top of my cat&#x27;s covered litter box.  Much nicer than commercial air fresheners but does not give me that weird headache/light headed feeling a lot of essential oils do.  Very pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Bought the oil to make a salt scrub in a 10 oz glass jar... had to use the whole bottle to make it smell.. Felt like I need at least two more bottles to make it smell \\&quot;orangy\\&quot;. the reason I gave it two stars is because it arrived in two days which I was happy about. Will go with another brand.</li>
            <li> I make homemade diaper cream and deodorant, and lavender is the primary scent (it has antibacterial and antimicrobial properties). I like orange or sweet orange added to it to give it a slightly different and more complex scent. Thus fits the bill, shipping was fast, cost was right on.</li>
            <li> love it!  smells sooo good.  Would dab a little on my wrists and neck for an energizing boost.</li>
            <li> A very nice product, I&#x27;ve used this for aromatherapy in the past.  Was in need of something to disguise/distract me from a client&#x27;s bad body odor and this does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected. This is one of my favorite essential oils. I add it to my hot lemon &amp; honey water in the morning. So good!</li>
            <li> inexpensive and great smell.</li>
            <li> I love the smell however the amount was terrible</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it therapeutically- the orange is a very uplifting, refreshing scent. I mix with another oil, such as almond or grapeseed.</li>
            <li> I really liked this essential oil, especially for the price. I use it for my scented lotions and it smelled wonderful</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and met my expectations. It works well in a diffuser and as an additive to lotion. It&#x27;s much less expensive than other essential oils I&#x27;ve bought and I like it just as much.</li>
            <li> I decided to try an oil warmer to add some nice fragrance to my home. I love the smell of citrus, so I bought this and the lemon version. Both are SO delicious!</li>
