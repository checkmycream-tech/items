            <li>The product is great way to finish up the make up.</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>use both liquid AND powder foundation, depending on weather or my mood and this powder works just great over both.&lt;br</li>
            <li>great power will buy again.</li>
            <li>I was so happy I wrote a raving review...</li>
            <li>/&gt;This powder has been great for controlling shine on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li>While the packaging is great quality, it leaves things to be desired.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, but I don&#x27;t know if I will buy this product again, or trade it for a compact.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>and i did not want to look like i&#x27;d been caked in powder, but the reviews were so great</li>
            <li>I love this product!!</li>
            <li>This powder is amazing~!</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>This stuff smells and feels amazing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is nice, too!</li>
            <li>I use the Peach Sake Toner and the BB cream as well, which are also favorites, and this powder is every bit as effective and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Smells so good.</li>
            <li>Over all good product.</li>
            <li>Smells good</li>
            <li>It really good for oil skin, it can control oil</li>
            <li>The finish is fairly matte, I don&#x27;t know that it would be compatible with a dewy or glowy look</li>
            <li>It is economically priced, does what it is supposed to (mattes skin, sets make-up and absorbs excess sebum), SMELLS wonderful (ripe peach), makes the skin feel silky and beautiful, is housed in lovely packaging, etc.</li>
            <li>The product smells very nice and is very fine.</li>
            <li>Love love love this!!!</li>
            <li>the product itself is very lovely.</li>
            <li>powder is also very refreshing.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is also very cute.</li>
            <li>Great product, love the smell.</li>
            <li>MY SKIN LOOKS GREAT AND HEALTHY</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast, great seller!</li>

            <li>LOVE Skinfood!</li>

            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Silky, even, lovely looking skin!</li>
            <li>so glad i found this!</li>
            <li>Love this powder!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Very nice face powder, finely milled and a light peachy scent!!</li>
            <li>I like it, it smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>But the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is so amazing.</li>
            <li>The product itself is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find anything that would keep my face not oily, and this is a cheap, and great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Amazing finishing powder.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>what kind of products that she uses.</li>
            <li>smells amazing, is very lightweight, sets everything wonderfully, and it keeps my oily skin matte!</li>
            <li>Again, I loved the ingredients and wanted to love this product moreso.</li>
            <li>I do not know how these women are able to blend this on ones face with a brush or the puff (tried both) and to block shine if it doesn&#x27;t stay for a good length of time</li>
            <li>and since I have to order it, it would be nice to know</li>
            <li>Aside from the awesome peachy smell, it really goes well on my face.</li>
            <li>The puff blends it into my face nicely.</li>
            <li>smells nice</li>
            <li>and i wish i could use it, but it does lighten your face and is better suited for fair skinned women.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prob use my own powder brush as the applicator leaves powder dots on my face.</li>
            <li>This is a nice finishing powder.  </li>
            <li>So very light weight and smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>mostly chemicals and not quite nice ones</li>
            <li>The powder puff is great for getting right in that area.</li>
            <li>I rated this okay because it will make a good talc free body powder.</li>
            <li>i wasn&#x27;t expecting to like it so much, but it doesn&#x27;t just keep my makeup perfect, it also controls my oil/shine and keeps my face looking matte and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>and it smells good too, but doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, just a nice and light peachy smell.</li>
            <li>It is translucent with a mild pleasant smell and never looks cakey, etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t settle in fine lines!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t settle in fine lines!</li>
            <li>I recommend this to those who have very light, oily skin.</li>
            <li>This is a very light powder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very light</li>
            <li>The powder is very light, and I use it to stay matte in the afternoon.</li>
            <li>It is very lightly scented and doesn&#x27;t clash with any of my perfumes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>Nothing else seems to work that well for me since I do have oily skin, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. :]</li>
            <li>This product smells great and makes my skin feel super smooth and, truly, silky.</li>
            <li>It also has a very nice light sweet fragrant smell.</li>
            <li>very smooth, last all day, smells sooo good!!</li>
            <li>Nice light coverage.</li>
            <li>Love the silky feel.</li>
            <li>but I prefer the Innisfree No Sebum version more.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make you look like wearing a lot of make up or powder which I am in love about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li>I truly love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Ok, this stuff is fabulous, and smells like heaven!</li>
            <li>Love this so much more than BM Mineral veil.</li>
            <li>so darn lovely</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m in love : -)</li>
            <li>, make sure not to load either the poof or your brush</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re done. :)</li>
            <li>Love everything else in the Peach Sake line though.</li>
            <li>I really am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I Love the way it goes on.</li>
            <li>Not only a great finish powder, but it smells really good.</li>
            <li>I love it and will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it with a brush (tap and blend on top of foundation).</li>
            <li>There are such wonderful reviews.</li>
            <li>for my review of this product; It&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li>It has not caused a breakout and it smells lovely.</li>
            <li>Sets makeup perfectly and leaves a completely matte, smooth finish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m just glad I found this product</li>
            <li>Nothing overwhelming</li>
            <li>It has been said that it is a healthy powder</li>
            <li>By the end of the night I look more like I&#x27;m glowing, not oily.</li>
            <li>It looks healthy and my makeup is still in place</li>
            <li>so I am okay with it :)</li>
            <li>my skin&#x27;s doing a lot better.</li>
            <li>Love the peachy smell.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and i really love the peach smell, so i decided to try it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells, and better</li>
            <li>I have oily adolescent skin, and this stuff mostly does the job.</li>
            <li>and I have bought many since then.</li>
            <li>I love this product from the packaging to the formula.</li>
            <li>The powder puff it comes with is ok</li>
            <li>but I prefer to apply it with a kabuki for better blending.</li>
            <li>This is fabulous stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i purchase this.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but it is very nice for absorbing oil and keeping it gone.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent and a nice very soft powder puff to go with it.</li>
            <li>The added bonus is that my skin FEELS super soft, and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>The powder smells delicious, but the kind of makes a mess during use.</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job of keeping my foundation on as well.</li>
            <li>Great smelling fine powder that really makes your complexion matte.</li>
            <li>IT IS SMOOTH AND EASILY COMES WITH MY FACE OR MAKE UP!</li>
            <li>I really like this product, has a nice scent to it, and applies nicely on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 49 years old and it works great on my skin.</li>
            <li>I still LOVE the scent and how smooth the finish is</li>
            <li>I love the light peachy scent.</li>
            <li>have a very oily T zone and this helps keep it matte for a good 4-6 hours.</li>
            <li>This powder really is silky and feels good on my skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a very fine white powder, which is really easy and pleasant to apply (I use a powder brush though, not the puff), smells lovely, doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze and doesn&#x27;t make me feel like my skin is not breathing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a bit white even for my fair skin, but if you use a brush to blend the powder out after applying with the puff (making sure you get your neck as well!)</li>
            <li>Smells good, my face feels super silky and doesn&#x27;t make me oily right away.</li>
            <li>No creases after a full day at work!</li>
            <li>lots product burn my skin easy .this</li>
            <li>I was not super impressed with this powder on my face.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li>powder is translucent and really fine</li>
            <li>The scent is very light and smells as you would expect like a fresh peach.</li>
            <li>This product makes the skin smooth and fine powder.  </li>
            <li>do feel like if you are any darker in skin color than a light beige, this product may not blend well with your makeup, unless it is your intention to appear fairer skinned.</li>
            <li>Even after I cake my face with concealer, this powder makes my skin feel smooth and light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky smooth and light.</li>
            <li>This powder is extremely light an airy.</li>
            <li>It has the same great smell that the rest of the Peach Sake line has.</li>
            <li>Just a light pat around the face</li>
            <li>Amazing powder.&lt;br /&gt;It really smells like peach</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need much but goes on nicely and helps cover the flaws in your skin.</li>
            <li>The light peachy fragrance is a plus.</li>
            <li>I like the smooth feel without the heaviness.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t fit it, don&#x27;t buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product is alcohol and mineral oil free.</li>
            <li>It is not fragrance free.</li>
            <li>this powered feels SO SO nice and really helps my makeup stay &amp;#34;put.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I have light, oily skin</li>
            <li>A light dusting of this powder helps keep the oil off of my T-Zone for for around six hours and doesn&#x27;t make my face look ghostly.</li>
            <li>The powder leaves my face feeling smooth, but it also leaves my face looking a lot whiter.</li>
            <li>I definitely going to recommend this great product.</li>
            <li>Makes my face looks so smooth and matte &amp;#</li>
            <li>I am an Asian and love fair skin.</li>
            <li>It goes on well and makes my skin soft and smells good.</li>
            <li>Best part is that it does not look cakey or give me that sickly pale look that some finishing powders do.</li>
            <li>It also arrived quickly and comes in a super cute package!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I apply after putting makeup and it smells good leaving my skin feeling soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>really recommend this for those who have oily/sensitive skin because it also have soothing/calming effect on my skin! :)</li>
            <li>Very fine powder, so it comes out fast.</li>
            <li>Love this product makes your face soft all day with a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>I have also found that it works great as a dry shampoo</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin, so it was nice to find something that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to order and receive this face powder</li>
            <li>But I do like how soft it makes my skin and how nice it smells.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that I liked it.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li>and I LOVED THIS PRODUCT (this is my second review).</li>
            <li>I do need to blot and touch up about 6 hours after application, but some days I can go a full 8 hours.</li>
            <li>Very fresh and keeps my makeup looking fresh for hours.</li>
            <li>Instead of slapping heavy beige powders on your face, where you end up looking like you have on too much make-up, this dusting powder is the BEST finish over foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I never retouch my makeup (too much trouble) and no one can expect makeup to stay on perfectly the whole day if you&#x27;ve been out swimming, hiking, or playing sports</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a mild, peachy smell and isn&#x27;t bothersome.</li>
            <li>this product is really just so great, i definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>I have fair skin so this powder looks fine on me and brightens my face, but it may look odd on darker skin.</li>
            <li>It does not make my face look ashy or gray/white, but has a nice velvety finish that is pretty natural.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I even use it on its own for just very sheer coverage and a matte finish if I don&#x27;t want the full face of makeup.</li>
            <li>Definitely does what it says and more!</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin fresh even in this humid and very hot weather.</li>
            <li>this product makes your skin dry, keep in mind that it is a Korean product, and should be used with beauty routine similar to theirs to ensure best results.</li>
            <li>It leaves a very light scent of peach and makes my skin feel incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a Korean brand, obviously geared towards very fair skinned Asian women or girls who come close to that skin tone.</li>
            <li>It is very good, the only thing I dislike is its white color, does not add color to the face and makes me look paler.</li>
            <li>Light, gentle powder that didn&#x27;t make my skin break out.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t wear foundation and just use a tinted moisturizer, this would be a great finishing product for you as well, because there&#x27;s nothing heavy about it at all.  </li>
            <li>Smell is heavenly and it makes my face feel very silky smooth.</li>
            <li>The powder blends really well, so it doesn&#x27;t look cakey or too light on medium to darker tan skin tones.</li>
            <li>Gotta say the result isn&#x27;t as good as expected</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin look soft.</li>
            <li>It helps my makeup stay fresh and keeps my skin from getting too shiny</li>
            <li>The powder is white but translucent and blends well, giving a nice matte finish.</li>
            <li>The actual product is really nice.</li>
            <li>Works great with several different liquid foundations and has a sweet smell &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>make up stays on and looks good way longer than with the other finish powders I used, and I don&#x27;t need to touch up my make up when I use that powder.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mainly for people with light skin I guess</li>
            <li>Now that I use BB cream, I don&#x27;t actually need powder or pacts but during the summer or hot days, these come in handy.</li>
            <li>The pictures dont show but this is a fine white micro finishing powder, you actually get a good amount too.</li>
            <li>The powder is very fine, and also very white.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good and has a slight scent to it</li>
            <li>As well the white hue left isn&#x27;t attractive.</li>
            <li>It does a great job controlling the shine from especially on my nose and the middle of my forehead.</li>
            <li>loved the peach sake smell so much that I&#x27;ve purchased a bunch of the other peach sake products in the line.  </li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel very soft and smooth and this powder can hold its own against any similar high end products.  </li>
            <li>but this little powder does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>It was exactly my wife was expecting.</li>
            <li>It was lighter than expected and kind of goes on white-ish.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s all pretty packaging for this teeny tiny almost handful of powder, just wish there was more product for the cost.</li>
            <li>Silky feel when first applied.</li>
            <li>but it did not, at first it does make my skin a bit whiter</li>
            <li>I wanted something to set my makeup and keep it from melting off my face in hot summer days.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying a Skinfood product.</li>
            <li>it has a nice puff, but the box isn&#x27;t as wide as others.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a no for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product is well priced and achieves exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li>applied properly (lightly dusted all over and NOT using the provided puff), the finish is natural and does not look chalky.</li>
            <li>It works really well for that!  </li>
            <li>Most are much smaller.</li>
            <li>This was the first Skinfood product I ever bought</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft without makeup and even with it gives it a velvety smooth touch.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft to the touch and oil free all day.</li>
            <li>i was kind of wary at first because I&#x27;m kind of tan</li>
            <li>If I forget to use the powder, my face does get much oilier earlier and more often throughout the day, so it appears to do its job</li>
            <li>I think this powder is high quality and worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have to say another positive.</li>
            <li>Makes skin super soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I also have super sensitive acne-prone skin and this product didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause any blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It certainly does the trick.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and go to college 5 days a week to be more specific, so</li>
            <li>Compared to other high end translucent powders, great for the price and doesn&#x27;t leave a white sheen on my face in photographs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fine that it goes everywhere when I just open the container.</li>
            <li>Pretty decent product.</li>
            <li>The finishing powder smells amazing and helps to keep me matte a little longer.  </li>
            <li>the powder makes my skin feel very silky and dries out the oil.</li>
            <li>it really smells like real peaches.</li>
            <li>it is very laminating as well.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
            <li>#34;whiten out&amp;#34; the skin, but it depends on how much one puts on</li>
            <li>If you have any &amp;#34;imperfections&amp;#34; like bumps on your skin, it will show if you use too much...</li>
            <li>I really like this finishing powder.</li>
            <li>so I still use it very sparingly to set my makeup.</li>
            <li>Leaves face looking smooth and matte the entire day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Become really tan</li>
            <li>It has the texture/staying ability as such and will leave skin smooth.</li>
            <li>then it isn&#x27;t really performing that purpose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this twice!&lt;br /&gt;-packaging isn&#x27;t bulky and doesn&#x27;t take up much room in travel makeup cases&lt;</li>
            <li>and it only takes a light dusting to do the trick.  </li>
            <li>This powder stays on ALL DAY and really controls the shine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my skin matte and very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need much each time you apply it</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and this powder really helps to control it.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need alot, which is why I really like the fact it doesn&#x27;t dispense a ton at a time.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;-it smells light and sweet and doesn&#x27;t annoy me at all&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s not chalky like some finishing powders and doesn&#x27;t weigh you down</li>
            <li>Really keeps oil under control better than any other finishing powder that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>i real love power if goes on white real match skin tone and stay on to.i am not big make up person only wear make</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll find myself having to touch-ups, but with this powder, it keeps my makeup stay set longer than most other powders I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Vibrant smell&amp; fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but Oh My Gosh these Products are amazing, Now this is a finishing powder and is used to set your make up and shrink your pores so it is white but goes on translucent, this is not a colored loose powder.</li>
            <li>Liked it, but very messy.</li>
            <li>I have super oily and sensitive skin and no other product has worked as well for me as this does.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>As long as you clean your brushes before each use (as well as the puff if you use it), there is NO need to be concerned with clogged pores and acne while suing this</li>
            <li>The first time I took off the lid to get to the powder, I thought everything inside would go flying because of how tightly the lid fit.</li>
            <li>As it is, I have to leave a little bit of powder on top of the sifter and store the powder puff elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I know everyone&#x27;s skin is different but it is worth to try.</li>
            <li>So the pros (that made me not dislike this product): When I first got it, I applied it to bare skin</li>
            <li>The manufactured date shows it was made recently and is fresh.  </li>
            <li>it just doesn&#x27;t seem to have staying ability and also the white doesn&#x27;t seem to mesh in and doesn&#x27;t look right to me.</li>
            <li>, if you simply turn the container with the puff over its openings, which I pat all over my face (looks funny because it&#x27;s like I have symmetrical white freckles) before gently blending it in, allowing me to literally see how much powder I put on my face, and how evenly (I hope that made sense haha).</li>
            <li>Previous reviews have mentioned the fragrance was faint and pleasant, like natural peach which is very accurate.</li>
            <li>New to this line.  </li>
            <li>and I live in Hawaii.</li>
            <li>I have relatively oily skin, and this powder not only sets my makeup but makes my skin feel extremely smooth and satin-like without appearing chalky.</li>
            <li>I strongly prefer it over my previous finishing powder (Physicians Formula brand) because of the softness and scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels very soft on my face, and it gets rid of shine.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>so I have to use a bit more moisturizer than usual</li>
            <li>After a few months of use, I have found that, while this product leaves a great smell and soft skin, it doesn&#x27;t control shine quite as well as other products I have used (Urban Decay&#x27;s De-slick, for example).  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not so sure how it would look on skin that isn&#x27;t very pale.</li>
            <li>The container is really cute but small, which is OK because you only need a little powder.  </li>
            <li>Helped clear up my clogged pores and skin problems.</li>
            <li>Initially I just wanted something that can control my really oily skin in the summer.</li>
            <li>I like that it is natural ingredients without talc, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have staying power.</li>
            <li>This powder makes my skin feel so soft and helps minimize oil shine during the day.</li>
            <li>Also, I can&#x27;t tell how much I have left</li>
            <li>and I am all about putting natural ingredients on my skin.</li>
            <li>But you have to use ever so much and blend it in to not look too white.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a translucent powder that would help with oil control and provide a natural looking finish to my face.</li>
            <li>It does have a peach scent, but the powder has not irritated my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m in my early 30s</li>
            <li>Also I have had this product for awhile now and as far as I can tell there</li>
            <li>This is completely skin care.</li>
            <li>( I only note this because I do see a few asks about it. :) )</li>
            <li>It is really lightweight and as a result doesn&#x27;t make your make-up look caked-on but don&#x27;t get me wrong, it finishes nicely.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light peach scent (I don&#x27;t find it to be at all overpowering), and even though it IS stark white, as long as you don&#x27;t concentrate a large quantity in one area, it blends in as colorless.</li>
            <li>Smells lovely and only a little bit of product keeps me oil-free almost all day!</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and I love the neutral flesh color.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin silky soft and has majorly helped control my oil production for over 8 hours.</li>
            <li>Make sure to open it over your sink to avoid a lot of mess when you open it.</li>
            <li>very soft and silky a little pricey for the amount, but for me it&#x27;s worth it...</li>
            <li>I have dry, oily, rather sensitive skin, and have not had any issues with this product -- on the contrary, I only have positive things to say about it!</li>
            <li>It does absorb excess oil without clogging my pores but it really makes my skin feel dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>I have a combination face, and in the summer it gets really oily (and in the winter oily in some areas, dry in others), and I tried this product as soon as I received it during my lunch break.</li>
            <li>But definitely makes skin baby soft and look natural.</li>
            <li>and I am a super pale person.</li>
            <li>It is blendable and the powder is loose, so application relies on gentle brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You really only need a little amount to get a smooth, matte finish, can&#x27;t emphasize this enough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty average in the shine-control department.</li>
            <li>Does not leave a white cast on the skin, almost completely translucent.</li>
            <li>I use this over my Skin79 pink BB cream, and it keeps my makeup in place the whole day, even through the heat, and I also have oily skin.</li>
            <li>I do have oily skin and it does calm down the oily-ness factor on my face which is a big plus too!</li>
            <li>Other than that, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I use a brush instead of the puff to apply it due to preference; Puffs smush makeup onto my face and they don&#x27;t really blend it.</li>
            <li>Blotting is usually just enough, though, and I normally do not need to touch up with more powder later in the day if I remember to dust on this powder in the morning after applying my make-up.</li>
            <li>an hour after I do my make up, but I look dewy (and a little shiny on my nose) after a whole day with this</li>
            <li>have yellow/olive skin, light but not super pale, and this is translucent enough to not show.</li>
            <li>Then, there is a sifter lid, which prevents the powder from making a huge mess, but it also makes it difficult to put the right amount of product on the puff.</li>

            <li> I was so happy I wrote a raving review...</li>
            <li> /&gt;This powder has been great for controlling shine on my nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> While the packaging is great quality, it leaves things to be desired.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, but I don&#x27;t know if I will buy this product again, or trade it for a compact.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Great price.</li>
            <li> and i did not want to look like i&#x27;d been caked in powder, but the reviews were so great</li>
            <li> I love this product!!</li>
            <li> This powder is amazing~!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells and feels amazing!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is nice, too!</li>

            <li> Over all good product.</li>
            <li> Smells good</li>
            <li> It really good for oil skin, it can control oil</li>
            <li> The finish is fairly matte, I don&#x27;t know that it would be compatible with a dewy or glowy look</li>
            <li> It is economically priced, does what it is supposed to (mattes skin, sets make-up and absorbs excess sebum), SMELLS wonderful (ripe peach), makes the skin feel silky and beautiful, is housed in lovely packaging, etc.</li>
            <li> The product smells very nice and is very fine.</li>
            <li> Love love love this!!!</li>

            <li> so I can make sure I have it in advance of running out!</li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Silky, even, lovely looking skin!</li>
            <li> so glad i found this!</li>
            <li> Love this powder!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Very nice face powder, finely milled and a light peachy scent!!</li>
            <li> I like it, it smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> But the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is so amazing.</li>
            <li> The product itself is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find anything that would keep my face not oily, and this is a cheap, and great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Amazing finishing powder.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> what kind of products that she uses.</li>
            <li> smells amazing, is very lightweight, sets everything wonderfully, and it keeps my oily skin matte!</li>
            <li> Again, I loved the ingredients and wanted to love this product moreso.</li>
            <li> I do not know how these women are able to blend this on ones face with a brush or the puff (tried both) and to block shine if it doesn&#x27;t stay for a good length of time</li>
            <li> and since I have to order it, it would be nice to know</li>
            <li> Aside from the awesome peachy smell, it really goes well on my face.</li>
            <li> The puff blends it into my face nicely.</li>
            <li> smells nice</li>
            <li> and i wish i could use it, but it does lighten your face and is better suited for fair skinned women.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prob use my own powder brush as the applicator leaves powder dots on my face.</li>
            <li> This is a nice finishing powder.  </li>
            <li> So very light weight and smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> mostly chemicals and not quite nice ones</li>
            <li> The powder puff is great for getting right in that area.</li>
            <li> I rated this okay because it will make a good talc free body powder.</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t expecting to like it so much, but it doesn&#x27;t just keep my makeup perfect, it also controls my oil/shine and keeps my face looking matte and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> and it smells good too, but doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, just a nice and light peachy smell.</li>
            <li> It is translucent with a mild pleasant smell and never looks cakey, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t settle in fine lines!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t settle in fine lines!</li>
            <li> I recommend this to those who have very light, oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very light powder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very light</li>
            <li> The powder is very light, and I use it to stay matte in the afternoon.</li>
            <li> It is very lightly scented and doesn&#x27;t clash with any of my perfumes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li> Nothing else seems to work that well for me since I do have oily skin, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. :]</li>
            <li> This product smells great and makes my skin feel super smooth and, truly, silky.</li>
            <li> It also has a very nice light sweet fragrant smell.</li>
            <li> very smooth, last all day, smells sooo good!!</li>
            <li> Nice light coverage.</li>
            <li> Love the silky feel.</li>
            <li> but I prefer the Innisfree No Sebum version more.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make you look like wearing a lot of make up or powder which I am in love about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li> I truly love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Ok, this stuff is fabulous, and smells like heaven!</li>
            <li> Love this so much more than BM Mineral veil.</li>
            <li> so darn lovely</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m in love : -)</li>
            <li> , make sure not to load either the poof or your brush</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re done. :)</li>
            <li> Love everything else in the Peach Sake line though.</li>
            <li> I really am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I Love the way it goes on.</li>
            <li> Not only a great finish powder, but it smells really good.</li>
            <li> I love it and will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it with a brush (tap and blend on top of foundation).</li>
            <li> There are such wonderful reviews.</li>
            <li> for my review of this product; It&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li> It has not caused a breakout and it smells lovely.</li>
            <li> Sets makeup perfectly and leaves a completely matte, smooth finish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m just glad I found this product</li>
            <li> Nothing overwhelming</li>
            <li> It has been said that it is a healthy powder</li>
            <li> By the end of the night I look more like I&#x27;m glowing, not oily.</li>
            <li> It looks healthy and my makeup is still in place</li>
            <li> so I am okay with it :)</li>
            <li> my skin&#x27;s doing a lot better.</li>
            <li> Love the peachy smell.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and i really love the peach smell, so i decided to try it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells, and better</li>
            <li> I have oily adolescent skin, and this stuff mostly does the job.</li>
            <li> and I have bought many since then.</li>
            <li> I love this product from the packaging to the formula.</li>
            <li> The powder puff it comes with is ok</li>
            <li> but I prefer to apply it with a kabuki for better blending.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i purchase this.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> but it is very nice for absorbing oil and keeping it gone.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent and a nice very soft powder puff to go with it.</li>
            <li> The added bonus is that my skin FEELS super soft, and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> The powder smells delicious, but the kind of makes a mess during use.</li>
            <li> It does a pretty good job of keeping my foundation on as well.</li>
            <li> Great smelling fine powder that really makes your complexion matte.</li>
            <li> IT IS SMOOTH AND EASILY COMES WITH MY FACE OR MAKE UP!</li>
            <li> I really like this product, has a nice scent to it, and applies nicely on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 years old and it works great on my skin.</li>
            <li> I still LOVE the scent and how smooth the finish is</li>
            <li> I love the light peachy scent.</li>
            <li> have a very oily T zone and this helps keep it matte for a good 4-6 hours.</li>
            <li> This powder really is silky and feels good on my skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a very fine white powder, which is really easy and pleasant to apply (I use a powder brush though, not the puff), smells lovely, doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze and doesn&#x27;t make me feel like my skin is not breathing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit white even for my fair skin, but if you use a brush to blend the powder out after applying with the puff (making sure you get your neck as well!)</li>
            <li> Smells good, my face feels super silky and doesn&#x27;t make me oily right away.</li>
            <li> No creases after a full day at work!</li>
            <li> lots product burn my skin easy .this</li>
            <li> I was not super impressed with this powder on my face.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m fine.</li>
            <li> powder is translucent and really fine</li>
            <li> The scent is very light and smells as you would expect like a fresh peach.</li>
            <li> This product makes the skin smooth and fine powder.  </li>
            <li> do feel like if you are any darker in skin color than a light beige, this product may not blend well with your makeup, unless it is your intention to appear fairer skinned.</li>
            <li> Even after I cake my face with concealer, this powder makes my skin feel smooth and light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silky smooth and light.</li>
            <li> This powder is extremely light an airy.</li>
            <li> It has the same great smell that the rest of the Peach Sake line has.</li>
            <li> Just a light pat around the face</li>
            <li> Amazing powder.&lt;br /&gt;It really smells like peach</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need much but goes on nicely and helps cover the flaws in your skin.</li>
            <li> The light peachy fragrance is a plus.</li>
            <li> I like the smooth feel without the heaviness.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t fit it, don&#x27;t buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product is alcohol and mineral oil free.</li>
            <li> It is not fragrance free.</li>
            <li> this powered feels SO SO nice and really helps my makeup stay &amp;#34;put.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I have light, oily skin</li>
            <li> A light dusting of this powder helps keep the oil off of my T-Zone for for around six hours and doesn&#x27;t make my face look ghostly.</li>
            <li> The powder leaves my face feeling smooth, but it also leaves my face looking a lot whiter.</li>
            <li> I definitely going to recommend this great product.</li>
            <li> Makes my face looks so smooth and matte &amp;#</li>
            <li> I am an Asian and love fair skin.</li>
            <li> It goes on well and makes my skin soft and smells good.</li>
            <li> Best part is that it does not look cakey or give me that sickly pale look that some finishing powders do.</li>
            <li> It also arrived quickly and comes in a super cute package!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I apply after putting makeup and it smells good leaving my skin feeling soft and pretty.</li>
            <li> really recommend this for those who have oily/sensitive skin because it also have soothing/calming effect on my skin! :)</li>
            <li> Very fine powder, so it comes out fast.</li>
            <li> Love this product makes your face soft all day with a lovely scent.</li>
            <li> I have also found that it works great as a dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin, so it was nice to find something that doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to order and receive this face powder</li>
            <li> But I do like how soft it makes my skin and how nice it smells.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that I liked it.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> and I LOVED THIS PRODUCT (this is my second review).</li>
            <li> I do need to blot and touch up about 6 hours after application, but some days I can go a full 8 hours.</li>
            <li> Very fresh and keeps my makeup looking fresh for hours.</li>
            <li> Instead of slapping heavy beige powders on your face, where you end up looking like you have on too much make-up, this dusting powder is the BEST finish over foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I never retouch my makeup (too much trouble) and no one can expect makeup to stay on perfectly the whole day if you&#x27;ve been out swimming, hiking, or playing sports</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a mild, peachy smell and isn&#x27;t bothersome.</li>
            <li> this product is really just so great, i definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have fair skin so this powder looks fine on me and brightens my face, but it may look odd on darker skin.</li>
            <li> It does not make my face look ashy or gray/white, but has a nice velvety finish that is pretty natural.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I even use it on its own for just very sheer coverage and a matte finish if I don&#x27;t want the full face of makeup.</li>
            <li> Definitely does what it says and more!</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin fresh even in this humid and very hot weather.</li>
            <li> this product makes your skin dry, keep in mind that it is a Korean product, and should be used with beauty routine similar to theirs to ensure best results.</li>
            <li> It leaves a very light scent of peach and makes my skin feel incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Korean brand, obviously geared towards very fair skinned Asian women or girls who come close to that skin tone.</li>
            <li> It is very good, the only thing I dislike is its white color, does not add color to the face and makes me look paler.</li>
            <li> Light, gentle powder that didn&#x27;t make my skin break out.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t wear foundation and just use a tinted moisturizer, this would be a great finishing product for you as well, because there&#x27;s nothing heavy about it at all.  </li>
            <li> Smell is heavenly and it makes my face feel very silky smooth.</li>
            <li> The powder blends really well, so it doesn&#x27;t look cakey or too light on medium to darker tan skin tones.</li>
            <li> Gotta say the result isn&#x27;t as good as expected</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin look soft.</li>
            <li> It helps my makeup stay fresh and keeps my skin from getting too shiny</li>
            <li> The powder is white but translucent and blends well, giving a nice matte finish.</li>
            <li> The actual product is really nice.</li>
            <li> Works great with several different liquid foundations and has a sweet smell &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> make up stays on and looks good way longer than with the other finish powders I used, and I don&#x27;t need to touch up my make up when I use that powder.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mainly for people with light skin I guess</li>
            <li> Now that I use BB cream, I don&#x27;t actually need powder or pacts but during the summer or hot days, these come in handy.</li>
            <li> The pictures dont show but this is a fine white micro finishing powder, you actually get a good amount too.</li>
            <li> The powder is very fine, and also very white.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and has a slight scent to it</li>
            <li> As well the white hue left isn&#x27;t attractive.</li>
            <li> It does a great job controlling the shine from especially on my nose and the middle of my forehead.</li>
            <li> loved the peach sake smell so much that I&#x27;ve purchased a bunch of the other peach sake products in the line.  </li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel very soft and smooth and this powder can hold its own against any similar high end products.  </li>
            <li> but this little powder does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> It was exactly my wife was expecting.</li>
            <li> It was lighter than expected and kind of goes on white-ish.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s all pretty packaging for this teeny tiny almost handful of powder, just wish there was more product for the cost.</li>
            <li> Silky feel when first applied.</li>
            <li> but it did not, at first it does make my skin a bit whiter</li>
            <li> I wanted something to set my makeup and keep it from melting off my face in hot summer days.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying a Skinfood product.</li>
            <li> it has a nice puff, but the box isn&#x27;t as wide as others.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a no for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product is well priced and achieves exactly what it advertises.</li>
            <li> applied properly (lightly dusted all over and NOT using the provided puff), the finish is natural and does not look chalky.</li>
            <li> It works really well for that!  </li>
            <li> Most are much smaller.</li>
            <li> This was the first Skinfood product I ever bought</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft without makeup and even with it gives it a velvety smooth touch.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft to the touch and oil free all day.</li>
            <li> i was kind of wary at first because I&#x27;m kind of tan</li>
            <li> If I forget to use the powder, my face does get much oilier earlier and more often throughout the day, so it appears to do its job</li>
            <li> I think this powder is high quality and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have to say another positive.</li>
            <li> Makes skin super soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I also have super sensitive acne-prone skin and this product didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause any blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It certainly does the trick.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and go to college 5 days a week to be more specific, so</li>
            <li> Compared to other high end translucent powders, great for the price and doesn&#x27;t leave a white sheen on my face in photographs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fine that it goes everywhere when I just open the container.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent product.</li>
            <li> The finishing powder smells amazing and helps to keep me matte a little longer.  </li>
            <li> the powder makes my skin feel very silky and dries out the oil.</li>
            <li> it really smells like real peaches.</li>
            <li> it is very laminating as well.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
            <li> #34;whiten out&amp;#34; the skin, but it depends on how much one puts on</li>
            <li> If you have any &amp;#34;imperfections&amp;#34; like bumps on your skin, it will show if you use too much...</li>
            <li> I really like this finishing powder.</li>
            <li> so I still use it very sparingly to set my makeup.</li>
            <li> Leaves face looking smooth and matte the entire day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Become really tan</li>
            <li> It has the texture/staying ability as such and will leave skin smooth.</li>
            <li> then it isn&#x27;t really performing that purpose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this twice!&lt;br /&gt;-packaging isn&#x27;t bulky and doesn&#x27;t take up much room in travel makeup cases&lt;</li>
            <li> and it only takes a light dusting to do the trick.  </li>
            <li> This powder stays on ALL DAY and really controls the shine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves my skin matte and very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need much each time you apply it</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this powder really helps to control it.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need alot, which is why I really like the fact it doesn&#x27;t dispense a ton at a time.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;-it smells light and sweet and doesn&#x27;t annoy me at all&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s not chalky like some finishing powders and doesn&#x27;t weigh you down</li>
            <li> Really keeps oil under control better than any other finishing powder that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> i real love power if goes on white real match skin tone and stay on to.i am not big make up person only wear make</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll find myself having to touch-ups, but with this powder, it keeps my makeup stay set longer than most other powders I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Vibrant smell&amp; fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but Oh My Gosh these Products are amazing, Now this is a finishing powder and is used to set your make up and shrink your pores so it is white but goes on translucent, this is not a colored loose powder.</li>
            <li> Liked it, but very messy.</li>
            <li> I have super oily and sensitive skin and no other product has worked as well for me as this does.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> As long as you clean your brushes before each use (as well as the puff if you use it), there is NO need to be concerned with clogged pores and acne while suing this</li>
            <li> The first time I took off the lid to get to the powder, I thought everything inside would go flying because of how tightly the lid fit.</li>
            <li> As it is, I have to leave a little bit of powder on top of the sifter and store the powder puff elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I know everyone&#x27;s skin is different but it is worth to try.</li>
            <li> So the pros (that made me not dislike this product): When I first got it, I applied it to bare skin</li>
            <li> The manufactured date shows it was made recently and is fresh.  </li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t seem to have staying ability and also the white doesn&#x27;t seem to mesh in and doesn&#x27;t look right to me.</li>
            <li> , if you simply turn the container with the puff over its openings, which I pat all over my face (looks funny because it&#x27;s like I have symmetrical white freckles) before gently blending it in, allowing me to literally see how much powder I put on my face, and how evenly (I hope that made sense haha).</li>
            <li> Previous reviews have mentioned the fragrance was faint and pleasant, like natural peach which is very accurate.</li>
            <li> New to this line.  </li>
            <li> and I live in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> I have relatively oily skin, and this powder not only sets my makeup but makes my skin feel extremely smooth and satin-like without appearing chalky.</li>
            <li> I strongly prefer it over my previous finishing powder (Physicians Formula brand) because of the softness and scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels very soft on my face, and it gets rid of shine.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> so I have to use a bit more moisturizer than usual</li>
            <li> After a few months of use, I have found that, while this product leaves a great smell and soft skin, it doesn&#x27;t control shine quite as well as other products I have used (Urban Decay&#x27;s De-slick, for example).  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not so sure how it would look on skin that isn&#x27;t very pale.</li>
            <li> The container is really cute but small, which is OK because you only need a little powder.  </li>
            <li> Helped clear up my clogged pores and skin problems.</li>
            <li> Initially I just wanted something that can control my really oily skin in the summer.</li>
            <li> I like that it is natural ingredients without talc, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have staying power.</li>
            <li> This powder makes my skin feel so soft and helps minimize oil shine during the day.</li>
            <li> Also, I can&#x27;t tell how much I have left</li>
            <li> and I am all about putting natural ingredients on my skin.</li>
            <li> But you have to use ever so much and blend it in to not look too white.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a translucent powder that would help with oil control and provide a natural looking finish to my face.</li>
            <li> It does have a peach scent, but the powder has not irritated my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m in my early 30s</li>
            <li> Also I have had this product for awhile now and as far as I can tell there</li>
            <li> This is completely skin care.</li>
            <li> ( I only note this because I do see a few asks about it. :) )</li>
            <li> It is really lightweight and as a result doesn&#x27;t make your make-up look caked-on but don&#x27;t get me wrong, it finishes nicely.  </li>
            <li> It has a very light peach scent (I don&#x27;t find it to be at all overpowering), and even though it IS stark white, as long as you don&#x27;t concentrate a large quantity in one area, it blends in as colorless.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely and only a little bit of product keeps me oil-free almost all day!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and I love the neutral flesh color.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin silky soft and has majorly helped control my oil production for over 8 hours.</li>
            <li> Make sure to open it over your sink to avoid a lot of mess when you open it.</li>
            <li> very soft and silky a little pricey for the amount, but for me it&#x27;s worth it...</li>
            <li> I have dry, oily, rather sensitive skin, and have not had any issues with this product -- on the contrary, I only have positive things to say about it!</li>
            <li> It does absorb excess oil without clogging my pores but it really makes my skin feel dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I have a combination face, and in the summer it gets really oily (and in the winter oily in some areas, dry in others), and I tried this product as soon as I received it during my lunch break.</li>
            <li> But definitely makes skin baby soft and look natural.</li>
            <li> and I am a super pale person.</li>
            <li> It is blendable and the powder is loose, so application relies on gentle brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You really only need a little amount to get a smooth, matte finish, can&#x27;t emphasize this enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty average in the shine-control department.</li>
            <li> Does not leave a white cast on the skin, almost completely translucent.</li>
            <li> I use this over my Skin79 pink BB cream, and it keeps my makeup in place the whole day, even through the heat, and I also have oily skin.</li>
            <li> I do have oily skin and it does calm down the oily-ness factor on my face which is a big plus too!</li>
            <li> Other than that, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use a brush instead of the puff to apply it due to preference; Puffs smush makeup onto my face and they don&#x27;t really blend it.</li>
            <li> Blotting is usually just enough, though, and I normally do not need to touch up with more powder later in the day if I remember to dust on this powder in the morning after applying my make-up.</li>
            <li> an hour after I do my make up, but I look dewy (and a little shiny on my nose) after a whole day with this</li>
            <li> have yellow/olive skin, light but not super pale, and this is translucent enough to not show.</li>
            <li> Then, there is a sifter lid, which prevents the powder from making a huge mess, but it also makes it difficult to put the right amount of product on the puff.</li>
            <li> I use some other oil control products (Skinfood Peach Sake Pore Serum and The FACE Shop Natural Sun Eco Sebum Control Moisture Sun SPF40 PA+++), but this finishing powder seems to be the key to locking it all in place.</li>
            <li> The cushion that comes with it was completely covered in powder and the part that covers the powder, was cracked open, making my package a mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small for a body powder though and not something I really use.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it enough to see any long term effects, but does the job.</li>
            <li> Not oily, pores closed up, and powder is barely needed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not heavy and you only need a little bit</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the feeling it leaves behind (skin is sooooo smoooth for a little while).</li>
            <li> and I think the container is going to last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> It might work well for someone who has less sensitive skin?</li>
            <li> The powder makes my face look cakey and dull, regardless of how much I blend.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still doesn&#x27;t seem to settle on the face as does my other non-talc powder or other natural powders.</li>
            <li> I use this before I go out when I know it&#x27;s going to be a long night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really tricky shaking it out without it getting anywhere as the holes are very small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried powders from NARS and other high-end brands, but Skin-food is the ultimate winner.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have stated, it looks white and powdery, not for olive toned complexions.  </li>
            <li> I also feel like it doesn&#x27;t have the same staying power as other finishing powders.</li>
            <li> but like any powder it highlights the lines on the face on dry season</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, oily in the T-zone and dry on the cheeks, but throughout the day, the surface of my cheeks tend to get oily while my chin gets</li>
            <li> but I have to say it does dry out my skin</li>
            <li> and I have brown skin, and this powder kinda show a really thin sheet of white if you put on too much of it.</li>
            <li> When you first get it it seems very small but trust me a lot goes a very long way!!!</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m being nitpicky since I use this every single day.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried since I have sensitive skin that I would get painful bumps or breakouts, but this is so light that I don&#x27;t even feel it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say whether it would blend into a darker skin tone, as my skin IS pretty close to stark white, but I think if it were applied with a brush and blended, it would keep it&#x27;s colorless effect on other skin tones.</li>
            <li> It is loose powder</li>
            <li> I ended up moving them to a sturdier loose compact case, because I intended to travel with it.</li>
            <li> The package contains a lot of product, and because you only need a small amount, it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> It is a white powder and unless used very carefully it can make you seem as if you are a ghost!</li>
            <li> I use it for everything, my face, my body, even in my hair as a dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> It is made of rice and very dry.</li>
            <li> I only use a little foundation and concealer here and there and eye make-up.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t emit those dry patches you get from other powders.</li>
            <li> She is extremely careful</li>
            <li> but once it sinks in, it becomes transparent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now in 100+ degree weather, through outside activities.</li>
            <li> With the box closed, I smack it a few times to release a helping of powder and swirl my kabuki brush in it and then go over my entire face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin, as in, most of my face is disgustingly oily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just plain white with no pigment at all.</li>
            <li> powder has several little holes over the opening, so only a small amount of product comes out at a time.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I know if you have seen my other reviews on this product, I rant and Rave</li>
            <li> It does help to prevent oiliness and shine, but won’t totally illuminate it if you have excessively oily skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be checking out other Skinfood items.</li>
            <li> I have not tried any other products at this time, and I may give this product line another</li>
            <li> I wish there was a place to store the puff with the powder without getting the powder all over the puff, as I only use a very small amount of powder at a time, but perhaps my distaste of the packaging is a result of my inexperience with using loose powders.</li>
            <li> A very little goes a long way with this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;I also dab this over the salmon dark circle concealer to set it.</li>
            <li> I have a dark complexion and don&#x27;t like to wear a lot of make-up.</li>
            <li> They have never let me down.</li>
            <li> My skin felt softer after applying the powder and my pores were slightly less visible.</li>
            <li> I get less breakouts and produce less oil.</li>
            <li> Some people complain that it&#x27;s too pale, but they could have looked up other swatches on Google for it.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this to people who have dry skin or skin that is not very fair.</li>
            <li> but it is a little over drying.</li>
            <li> Even with this powder and using the other products in the Peach Sake line, I still usually have to blot my T-zone once a day around lunch-time.</li>
            <li> I usually use BB cream in my daily makeup routine, which can leave the face feeling sticky and...makeup-y if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Also I just press a little bit on my cheeks, nose, and forehead (T-zone) because that&#x27;s where it gets oily during the day but after using Skin Food pore clearing system (toner, emulsion, serum)</li>
            <li> a little lift-</li>
            <li> and it provides just a little coverage to set in your foundation.  </li>
            <li> It is a little messy though</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about very dark skin, but this powder goes on so well</li>
            <li> and I use this all over my face after a series of things, including moisturizing heavily with essence</li>
            <li> I like the feel and smell of this product, but it is a bit messy.</li>
            <li> even though I haven&#x27;t broken the seal on the powder, it was already white, like there was some sort of leak that I couldn&#x27;t find.</li>
            <li> My face still get oily in few hours</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale and I found this to be even too pale for me.</li>
            <li> The scent is not strong at all</li>
            <li> The product came broken with loose powder.</li>
            <li> This is quite difficult to judge, but overall I probably should not like it as I can&#x27;t use this</li>
            <li> Once a small amount is blended into my face, the whiteness goes away.</li>
            <li> I do however, have very pale skin</li>
            <li> I usually only have to apply it once in the afternoon, and it keeps me matte for the rest of the day even in warmer temperatures and in crowded, muggy offices.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not thrilled with the puff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve repurchased this at least once.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it does at least O_o&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more shiny skin by noon!</li>
            <li> The powder over make-up doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb well and leaves a whiteness that is not attractive to the face.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to finishing powder and the skin food brand</li>
            <li> The description describes this powder as &amp;#34;handy and pretty to carry&amp;#34; but I would never toss this in my purse or carry it around with me because the lid slowly slides off the base, and I&#x27;d hate to have a powder explosion in my purse.</li>
            <li> If the lid twisted on or somehow secured down onto the base, I&#x27;d want to take it with me everywhere.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time removing the lid.</li>
            <li> To those complaining about parabens: Shut the hell up and get out of here with that crap.</li>
            <li> Take your wannabe hippie crap to your nearest Trader Joe&#x27;s, because nobody here cares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t clog my pores and it hasn&#x27;t given me any grief.</li>
            <li> I hate using brushes for finishing powder</li>
            <li> but I was just very disappointed by the amount of product you get</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells so good. Nice light coverage. Skinfood always delivers.</li>
            <li> Great smelling fine powder that really makes your complexion matte. I use this before I go out when I know it&#x27;s going to be a long night. The powder smells delicious, but the kind of makes a mess during use. It&#x27;s so fine that it goes everywhere when I just open the container. Very fresh and keeps my makeup looking fresh for hours. Haven&#x27;t used it enough to see any long term effects, but does the job. Compared to other high end translucent powders, great for the price and doesn&#x27;t leave a white sheen on my face in photographs.</li>
            <li> Smells great works great.</li>
            <li> I was not super impressed with this powder on my face. It irritated my skin. It might work well for someone who has less sensitive skin? What I did end up using it for was oily hair. yup! I overdid it with the argan oil one morning and patted some around the area above my ears and scalp. It worked great!</li>
            <li> Light, gentle powder that didn&#x27;t make my skin break out. Love the silky feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good and has a slight scent to it but I prefer the Innisfree No Sebum version more.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that smells great, does a good job of setting make up and controlling shine.  edit: 3/26/2015  After a few months of use, I have found that, while this product leaves a great smell and soft skin, it doesn&#x27;t control shine quite as well as other products I have used (Urban Decay&#x27;s De-slick, for example).  It&#x27;s pretty average in the shine-control department.</li>
            <li> This powder is amazing~! I recommend this to those who have very light, oily skin. It keeps my face matte all day. The product smells very nice and is very fine. I do not recommend this to people who have dry skin or skin that is not very fair. It is a white powder and unless used very carefully it can make you seem as if you are a ghost! Thank you for the product!</li>
            <li> Smells great and is an excellent setting powder to use over BB cream.  It is a little messy though</li>
            <li> It was exactly my wife was expecting. She loves all the Skinfood products. She is extremely careful what kind of products that she uses. I know she would recommend to anyone else that plans on purchasing.</li>
            <li> the product itself is very lovely. the powder makes my skin feel very silky and dries out the oil. it is very white, however; and it will lighten your complexion quite a bit.  I would have given it 5 stars but it is a little over drying. it smells so so wonderful, though. it really smells like real peaches. it is very laminating as well. I feel like it would be great as a sort of oil blotter.</li>
            <li> I am an Asian and love fair skin. The product is great way to finish up the make up. It doesn&#x27;t make you look like wearing a lot of make up or powder which I am in love about it. I know everyone&#x27;s skin is different but it is worth to try. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I think this definitely smells like Peach Sake and not just like peaches.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit white even for my fair skin, but if you use a brush to blend the powder out after applying with the puff (making sure you get your neck as well!), then you should be just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel like if you are any darker in skin color than a light beige, this product may not blend well with your makeup, unless it is your intention to appear fairer skinned. ( I only note this because I do see a few asks about it. :) )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin and I use this all over my face after a series of things, including moisturizing heavily with essence added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this product makes your skin dry, keep in mind that it is a Korean product, and should be used with beauty routine similar to theirs to ensure best results.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! Will buy again</li>
            <li> Smells great. Even after I cake my face with concealer, this powder makes my skin feel smooth and light.</li>
            <li> So very light weight and smells amazing.  Instead of slapping heavy beige powders on your face, where you end up looking like you have on too much make-up, this dusting powder is the BEST finish over foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I use both liquid AND powder foundation, depending on weather or my mood and this powder works just great over both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The powder has several little holes over the opening, so only a small amount of product comes out at a time.  With the box closed, I smack it a few times to release a helping of powder and swirl my kabuki brush in it and then go over my entire face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This powder is also very refreshing.  Sets your make-up perfectly.  I&#x27;ll definitely order this again.&lt;br /&gt;Even if you don&#x27;t wear foundation and just use a tinted moisturizer, this would be a great finishing product for you as well, because there&#x27;s nothing heavy about it at all.  It&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li> Vibrant smell&amp; fast shipping. The product came broken with loose powder. Over all good product.</li>
            <li> I truly love this stuff.  When you first get it it seems very small but trust me a lot goes a very long way!!! You only need to use a tiny bit unless you want a very very white face so it makes it last even longer that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. The best part is, it smells so wonderful.</li>
            <li> LIKE IT! IT IS SMOOTH AND EASILY COMES WITH MY FACE OR MAKE UP! BEST THING EVER!!! i INTRODUCE IT</li>
            <li> i real love power if goes on white real match skin tone and stay on to.i am not big make up person only wear make need cover redness in my face lots product burn my skin easy .this great power will buy again. and do not do any burn or break me out to.</li>
            <li> It feels very soft on my face, and it gets rid of shine. It was lighter than expected and kind of goes on white-ish. You really don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s the job done with setting my make up and smells very pleasant. I definitely would repurchase in the future.</li>
            <li> Ok, this stuff is fabulous, and smells like heaven! I use it for everything, my face, my body, even in my hair as a dry shampoo! It&#x27;s silky smooth and light. I would&#x27;ve given 5 stars but I was just very disappointed by the amount of product you get, it&#x27;s all pretty packaging for this teeny tiny almost handful of powder, just wish there was more product for the cost. Otherwise, the product it&#x27;s self is supreme.</li>
            <li> smells amazing, is very lightweight, sets everything wonderfully, and it keeps my oily skin matte!</li>
            <li> This product makes the skin smooth and fine powder.  Smells good but like any powder it highlights the lines on the face on dry season</li>
            <li> Great product!! Makes skin super soft and silky. Recommend to control shine.</li>
            <li> Smells so good I want to eat it! It does absorb excess oil without clogging my pores but it really makes my skin feel dry and flaky. Silky feel when first applied.</li>
            <li> When it came, the powder was all over the box, I guess it leaked somehow on the way here. Gotta say the result isn&#x27;t as good as expected</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin look soft. It helps my makeup stay fresh and keeps my skin from getting too shiny</li>
            <li> I really like this product, has a nice scent to it, and applies nicely on my skin. I was a little worried since I have sensitive skin that I would get painful bumps or breakouts, but this is so light that I don&#x27;t even feel it! I do have oily skin and it does calm down the oily-ness factor on my face which is a big plus too! I only apply it once a day since I don&#x27;t carry it around with me... I&#x27;d say it lasts about 6-8+ hours depending on what I do or the weather... It does though &amp;#34;whiten out&amp;#34; the skin, but it depends on how much one puts on and I just put on one layer and it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this for those who have oily/sensitive skin because it also have soothing/calming effect on my skin! :)</li>
            <li> I have super oily and sensitive skin and no other product has worked as well for me as this does. While it doesn&#x27;t last ALL day, it does get me through the majority of it. I&#x27;ve found that I only need to blot my face with paper towels or those oil blotting papers once or twice later in the afternoon and I&#x27;m fine. It does a pretty good job of keeping my foundation on as well.</li>
            <li> This is the last step of my Korean routine. Leaves my skin silky soft and has majorly helped control my oil production for over 8 hours. No more shiny skin by noon! Love this so much more than BM Mineral veil. And the price makes me never want to go back to American brands ever again! My husband even commented on the softness of my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also dab this over the salmon dark circle concealer to set it. No creases after a full day at work!</li>
            <li> Liked it, but very messy.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin matte all day</li>
            <li> Very fine powder, so it comes out fast. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> You really only need a little amount to get a smooth, matte finish, can&#x27;t emphasize this enough. Initially I just wanted something that can control my really oily skin in the summer. And this does the trick x 100000. WINNER OF OIL CONTROL. The added bonus is that my skin FEELS super soft, and it smells wonderful. If you have any &amp;#34;imperfections&amp;#34; like bumps on your skin, it will show if you use too much... so, don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Love this product makes your face soft all day with a lovely scent. so darn lovely i&#x27;m in love : -)</li>
            <li> I know if you have seen my other reviews on this product, I rant and Rave but Oh My Gosh these Products are amazing, Now this is a finishing powder and is used to set your make up and shrink your pores so it is white but goes on translucent, this is not a colored loose powder. I have read some reviews and I think that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re trying to get out of this product.. DID I SAY IT&#x27;S FOR SETTING YOUR MAKEUP.... I&#x27;m 49 years old and it works great on my skin. very soft and silky a little pricey for the amount, but for me it&#x27;s worth it... Oh and did I mention the smell just awesome....</li>
            <li> This powder is extremely light an airy. The package is sealed, but because of the consistency of the powder, some powder does escape and can be seen UNDER the seal at the time the product was packaged. Make sure to open it over your sink to avoid a lot of mess when you open it. I have found it easiest to use a kabuki style brush to remove any excess from the poof before patting the poof on my face, then buffing my skin with the kabuki brush. A very little goes a long way with this product, make sure not to load either the poof or your brush or it does get all over the place. It has the same great smell that the rest of the Peach Sake line has. The powder is white but translucent and blends well, giving a nice matte finish. It does help to prevent oiliness and shine, but won’t totally illuminate it if you have excessively oily skin. Even with this powder and using the other products in the Peach Sake line, I still usually have to blot my T-zone once a day around lunch-time. Blotting is usually just enough, though, and I normally do not need to touch up with more powder later in the day if I remember to dust on this powder in the morning after applying my make-up. If I forget to use the powder, my face does get much oilier earlier and more often throughout the day, so it appears to do its job well when I do use it. The package contains a lot of product, and because you only need a small amount, it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I really like this finishing powder. I have combination skin and tend to get oily around the T-Zone midday. I&#x27;ll find myself having to touch-ups, but with this powder, it keeps my makeup stay set longer than most other powders I&#x27;ve tried. It also has a very nice light sweet fragrant smell. The packaging is also very cute. No messes. Just a light pat around the face and you&#x27;re done. :)</li>
            <li> This powder is AWESOME!  It is really lightweight and as a result doesn&#x27;t make your make-up look caked-on but don&#x27;t get me wrong, it finishes nicely.  It leaves a very light scent of peach and makes my skin feel incredibly soft.  If you don&#x27;t know, now you know - Get on it.</li>
            <li> Great product, love the smell.</li>
            <li> Amazing powder.&lt;br /&gt;It really smells like peach sake.&lt;br /&gt;The powder is translucent and really fine so it did cake on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have a very oily T zone and this helps keep it matte for a good 4-6 hours. It&#x27;s a great summer face powder :D</li>
            <li> so I know that in Korea it&#x27;s in to have very fair skin. I&#x27;m pale and I found this to be even too pale for me. It&#x27;s just plain white with no pigment at all. I still LOVE the scent and how smooth the finish is so I still use it very sparingly to set my makeup. If you have darker skin you&#x27;ll probably want to stay away from this one. Love everything else in the Peach Sake line though.</li>
            <li> Smell is heavenly and it makes my face feel very silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I really am pleased with this product.  It is loose powder so you don&#x27;t need much but goes on nicely and helps cover the flaws in your skin.</li>
            <li> My package arrived exploded. The cushion that comes with it was completely covered in powder and the part that covers the powder, was cracked open, making my package a mess. But I do like how soft it makes my skin and how nice it smells.</li>
            <li> This is a very light powder. I Love the way it goes on. I will order powder again. I do recommend product.</li>
            <li> What food? mostly chemicals and not quite nice ones&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silica, Talk, Boron Nitride, Dimethicone, Peach Fruit Extract, Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake), Silk Powder, Enanita Cholorantha Bark Extract, Oleanilic Acid, Alcohol, Polymethylhydrosiloxane, Butylene Glycol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that I liked it.  The scent is not strong at all and I thought the powder will make my make white but it did not, at first it does make my skin a bit whiter but once it sinks in, it becomes transparent.  I just stared using during the winter months so I did not have to retouch but I think I need to during the summer months.</li>
            <li> It goes on well and makes my skin soft and smells good. It&#x27;s also very light</li>
            <li> Very nice face powder, finely milled and a light peachy scent!! A little goes a long way, and I love the neutral flesh color.</li>
            <li> Leaves face looking smooth and matte the entire day. The light peachy fragrance is a plus.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I apply after putting makeup and it smells good leaving my skin feeling soft and pretty.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Definitely does what it says and more! It doesn&#x27;t emit those dry patches you get from other powders. It gets rid of the oil from your face throughout the day. I only use it once and I never feel any oil on my face throughout my classes. I live in Florida and go to college 5 days a week to be more specific, so yeah this product helps especially in tropical places. Keep in mind though that with the weather here I have&lt;br /&gt;Become really tan and I have brown skin, and this powder kinda show a really thin sheet of white if you put on too much of it. It&#x27;s mainly for people with light skin I guess but it works with me too. Which is why I gave it 4 stars only. Other than that, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not only a great finish powder, but it smells really good. I love it and will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> The best finishing powder ever</li>
            <li> I like the feel and smell of this product, but it is a bit messy.</li>
            <li> Smells good, my face feels super silky and doesn&#x27;t make me oily right away. It takes all the shine out.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent product. I wanted something to set my makeup and keep it from melting off my face in hot summer days. It certainly does the trick. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now in 100+ degree weather, through outside activities. I never retouch my makeup (too much trouble) and no one can expect makeup to stay on perfectly the whole day if you&#x27;ve been out swimming, hiking, or playing sports but this little powder does a pretty good job. I usually use BB cream in my daily makeup routine, which can leave the face feeling sticky and...makeup-y if you know what I mean. I have relatively oily skin, and this powder not only sets my makeup but makes my skin feel extremely smooth and satin-like without appearing chalky. It does not make my face look ashy or gray/white, but has a nice velvety finish that is pretty natural. (my skin is about an nc30) Overall, a good product. I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying a Skinfood product. I love the light peachy scent. The powder is very light, and I use it to stay matte in the afternoon. I usually only have to apply it once in the afternoon, and it keeps me matte for the rest of the day even in warmer temperatures and in crowded, muggy offices. It doesn&#x27;t look cakey on my skin and doesn&#x27;t flake off. The powder is very fine, and also very white. I have fair skin so this powder looks fine on me and brightens my face, but it may look odd on darker skin. I think this powder is high quality and worth the price. I strongly prefer it over my previous finishing powder (Physicians Formula brand) because of the softness and scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I dislike is the shape of the container. The description describes this powder as &amp;#34;handy and pretty to carry&amp;#34; but I would never toss this in my purse or carry it around with me because the lid slowly slides off the base, and I&#x27;d hate to have a powder explosion in my purse. If the lid twisted on or somehow secured down onto the base, I&#x27;d want to take it with me everywhere.</li>
            <li> This is quite difficult to judge, but overall I probably should not like it as I can&#x27;t use this and I am a super pale person. The powder is white. So the pros (that made me not dislike this product): When I first got it, I applied it to bare skin and I felt my skin and I LOVED THIS PRODUCT (this is my second review). I wanted to buy everything in this line as this makes your skin feel like baby&#x27;s skin. It also smells yummy. I was so happy I wrote a raving review...then I tried the product over make-up. it has a nice puff, but the box isn&#x27;t as wide as others. So on to the cons. The powder over make-up doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb well and leaves a whiteness that is not attractive to the face. I like that it is natural ingredients without talc, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have staying power. It is made of rice and very dry. A blow dryer would take this off one&#x27;s face I believe. I&#x27;ve tried it with a brush (tap and blend on top of foundation). it&#x27;s still doesn&#x27;t seem to settle on the face as does my other non-talc powder or other natural powders. I wanted to love this moreso! Love the smell and the feeling it leaves behind (skin is sooooo smoooth for a little while). it just doesn&#x27;t seem to have staying ability and also the white doesn&#x27;t seem to mesh in and doesn&#x27;t look right to me. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a no for me. I rated this okay because it will make a good talc free body powder. It has the texture/staying ability as such and will leave skin smooth. It&#x27;s small for a body powder though and not something I really use. What can I do though? Again, I loved the ingredients and wanted to love this product moreso. There are such wonderful reviews. I do not know how these women are able to blend this on ones face with a brush or the puff (tried both) and to block shine if it doesn&#x27;t stay for a good length of time then it isn&#x27;t really performing that purpose. As well the white hue left isn&#x27;t attractive. I will used this under my eyes perhaps or chest and body. I have to say another positive. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t settle in fine lines! It just doesn&#x27;t seem to settle at all. Sigh.tive. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t settle in fine lines! It just doesn&#x27;t seem to settle at all. Sigh.</li>
            <li> I like the smooth feel without the heaviness. Keeps my skin fresh even in this humid and very hot weather.</li>
            <li> To those complaining about parabens: Shut the hell up and get out of here with that crap. Paraben research is still being conducted and nothing is solid fact as of yet. Parabens also only have an effect on you if there is a history of cancer in your family and even THAT information is STILL being studied before being rendered as fact. Take your wannabe hippie crap to your nearest Trader Joe&#x27;s, because nobody here cares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my review of this product; It&#x27;s lovely. Some people complain that it&#x27;s too pale, but they could have looked up other swatches on Google for it. It&#x27;s a Korean brand, obviously geared towards very fair skinned Asian women or girls who come close to that skin tone. If you don&#x27;t fit it, don&#x27;t buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This powder has been great for controlling shine on my nose and cheeks. It has not caused a breakout and it smells lovely. I use a brush instead of the puff to apply it due to preference; Puffs smush makeup onto my face and they don&#x27;t really blend it. This powder can be used to set your makeup or alone.</li>
            <li> This powder makes my skin feel so soft and helps minimize oil shine during the day. Best part is that it does not look cakey or give me that sickly pale look that some finishing powders do. Plus it smells like delicious peaches!</li>
            <li> The bomb dot com! I love this! Works great with several different liquid foundations and has a sweet smell &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> New to this line.  LOVE Skinfood!</li>
            <li> I LOKE TO USE THIS AT NIGHT B4 BED AND WAKING UP IN THE MORNING MY SKIN LOOKS GREAT AND HEALTHY I AM ON MY SECOND ORDER OF THIS AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE</li>
            <li> Perfect for oily complexions. It stays on all day without need for re-application, unless you have severe oil problems, I suppose. Does not leave a white cast on the skin, almost completely translucent. It didn&#x27;t clog my pores and it hasn&#x27;t given me any grief. The fragrance is a mild, peachy smell and isn&#x27;t bothersome. It goes away after ten minutes. Sets makeup perfectly and leaves a completely matte, smooth finish. Helped clear up my clogged pores and skin problems. Five stars, I will definitely be re-purchasing this.</li>
            <li> This powder controls excess brightness caused by facial oiliness. It is very good, the only thing I dislike is its white color, does not add color to the face and makes me look paler.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells and feels amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this twice!&lt;br /&gt;-packaging isn&#x27;t bulky and doesn&#x27;t take up much room in travel makeup cases&lt;br /&gt;-it smells light and sweet and doesn&#x27;t annoy me at all&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s not chalky like some finishing powders and doesn&#x27;t weigh you down&lt;br /&gt;-definitely works on my skin regardless of my base/foundation/any makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish they&#x27;d repackage it--the puff isn&#x27;t very good. I hate using brushes for finishing powder but I&#x27;m not thrilled with the puff. Also, I can&#x27;t tell how much I have left and since I have to order it, it would be nice to know so I can make sure I have it in advance of running out! It&#x27;s really tricky shaking it out without it getting anywhere as the holes are very small. But I&#x27;m being nitpicky since I use this every single day. It&#x27;s a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> LOVE! I use the Peach Sake Toner and the BB cream as well, which are also favorites, and this powder is every bit as effective and beautiful. It has a very light peach scent (I don&#x27;t find it to be at all overpowering), and even though it IS stark white, as long as you don&#x27;t concentrate a large quantity in one area, it blends in as colorless. It creates a flawless, porcelain doll type of look- but I&#x27;m not so sure how it would look on skin that isn&#x27;t very pale. It&#x27;s hard to say whether it would blend into a darker skin tone, as my skin IS pretty close to stark white, but I think if it were applied with a brush and blended, it would keep it&#x27;s colorless effect on other skin tones.</li>
            <li> From here on out, I&#x27;m skipping the high-end \\&quot;photo finish\\&quot; white powders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried powders from NARS and other high-end brands, but Skin-food is the ultimate winner. It is economically priced, does what it is supposed to (mattes skin, sets make-up and absorbs excess sebum), SMELLS wonderful (ripe peach), makes the skin feel silky and beautiful, is housed in lovely packaging, etc. I could go on and on. Bottom line: I&#x27;m just glad I found this product and I&#x27;ll be checking out other Skinfood items.</li>
            <li> NOTE: I have combination skin, oily in the T-zone and dry on the cheeks, but throughout the day, the surface of my cheeks tend to get oily while my chin gets flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is well priced and achieves exactly what it advertises. Excess oils and sebum production is controlled and helps maintain a matte finish for 6+ hours. Comparable to Shiseido Mattifying Compact (Translucent) and MAC Finishing Pressed Powder.&lt;br /&gt;When applied properly (lightly dusted all over and NOT using the provided puff), the finish is natural and does not look chalky. It is blendable and the powder is loose, so application relies on gentle brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While using this product, I did not experience any severe break outs or adverse reactions. As long as you clean your brushes before each use (as well as the puff if you use it), there is NO need to be concerned with clogged pores and acne while suing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is alcohol and mineral oil free. It is not fragrance free. Previous reviews have mentioned the fragrance was faint and pleasant, like natural peach which is very accurate. Nothing overwhelming (I like it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prompt shipping. Would recommend and would repurchase!</li>
            <li> The actual product is really nice. I use it to set my under eye concealer. The powder puff is great for getting right in that area. While the packaging is great quality, it leaves things to be desired. The first time I took off the lid to get to the powder, I thought everything inside would go flying because of how tightly the lid fit. I had a difficult time removing the lid. Then, there is a sifter lid, which prevents the powder from making a huge mess, but it also makes it difficult to put the right amount of product on the puff. As it is, I have to leave a little bit of powder on top of the sifter and store the powder puff elsewhere. I wish there was a place to store the puff with the powder without getting the powder all over the puff, as I only use a very small amount of powder at a time, but perhaps my distaste of the packaging is a result of my inexperience with using loose powders.</li>
            <li> this powered feels SO SO nice and really helps my makeup stay &amp;#34;put.&amp;#34;  A generous amount for the money and it only takes a light dusting to do the trick.  It has been said that it is a healthy powder and I am all about putting natural ingredients on my skin.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have stated, it looks white and powdery, not for olive toned complexions.  I also feel like it doesn&#x27;t have the same staying power as other finishing powders.</li>
            <li> Aside from the awesome peachy smell, it really goes well on my face. If I just puff it on, of course I&#x27;d look like a white ghost. But you have to use ever so much and blend it in to not look too white. Once a small amount is blended into my face, the whiteness goes away. The puff blends it into my face nicely. It does a great job controlling the shine from especially on my nose and the middle of my forehead.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely and only a little bit of product keeps me oil-free almost all day! By the end of the night I look more like I&#x27;m glowing, not oily. It looks healthy and my makeup is still in place so I am okay with it :)</li>
            <li> smells nice and i wish i could use it, but it does lighten your face and is better suited for fair skinned women.</li>
            <li> I use this for setting my make up. I was using too faced primed and poreless powder prior to this. This powder is finer and helps keep my makeup (esp. eye area) from migrating. I&#x27;ve repurchased this at least once. And I&#x27;m definitely not a repurchaser unless a product wowed me.</li>
            <li> I have light, oily skin and I bought this finishing powder to set the SkinFood salmon concealer cream.  It works really well for that!  It also arrived quickly and comes in a super cute package!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this finishing powder with a powder brush (not the included sponge) as a last step in my daily makeup routine.  The finishing powder smells amazing and helps to keep me matte a little longer.  I also have super sensitive acne-prone skin and this product didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause any blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the peach sake smell so much that I&#x27;ve purchased a bunch of the other peach sake products in the line.  The manufactured date shows it was made recently and is fresh.  A little goes a long way and I think the container is going to last a very long time.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this in conjunction with the skin food peach sake pore compact, and couldn&#x27;t be happier! This product smells great and makes my skin feel super smooth and, truly, silky. It is a translucent powder, so it appears white on initial application. The powder puff it comes with might not be up to par for some, but I like it because the powder comes out in a pattern of dots on the puff, if you simply turn the container with the puff over its openings, which I pat all over my face (looks funny because it&#x27;s like I have symmetrical white freckles) before gently blending it in, allowing me to literally see how much powder I put on my face, and how evenly (I hope that made sense haha). I have dry, oily, rather sensitive skin, and have not had any issues with this product -- on the contrary, I only have positive things to say about it! Silky, even, lovely looking skin!</li>
            <li> I have a dark complexion and don&#x27;t like to wear a lot of make-up. I only use a little foundation and concealer here and there and eye make-up. I was looking for a translucent powder that would help with oil control and provide a natural looking finish to my face. A light dusting of this powder helps keep the oil off of my T-Zone for for around six hours and doesn&#x27;t make my face look ghostly. My skin felt softer after applying the powder and my pores were slightly less visible. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, but I don&#x27;t know if I will buy this product again, or trade it for a compact.</li>
            <li> The powder leaves my face feeling smooth, but it also leaves my face looking a lot whiter.</li>
            <li> Perfect setting powder for summer time!</li>
            <li> It really good for oil skin, it can control oil</li>
            <li> I like it, it smells amazing.  Its basically a finishing powder.  I&#x27;d prob use my own powder brush as the applicator leaves powder dots on my face. I like it... i could probably get something similar but cheaper though. But the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> Now that I use BB cream, I don&#x27;t actually need powder or pacts but during the summer or hot days, these come in handy. Also I just press a little bit on my cheeks, nose, and forehead (T-zone) because that&#x27;s where it gets oily during the day but after using Skin Food pore clearing system (toner, emulsion, serum) my skin&#x27;s doing a lot better. Not oily, pores closed up, and powder is barely needed. But definitely makes skin baby soft and look natural.</li>
            <li> Nicest smell, keeps the oil away from my skin, I use it before my make up and it&#x27;s great, it helps a lot</li>
            <li> Love the peachy smell. Great price.</li>
            <li> Love love love this!!!</li>
            <li> The pictures dont show but this is a fine white micro finishing powder, you actually get a good amount too. Most are much smaller. It has a pleasant scent and a nice very soft powder puff to go with it. I am addicted to finishing powder and the skin food brand so glad i found this!</li>
            <li> Love this powder!  This is my second purchase from Skin Food.  I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate it.  It is very lightly scented and doesn&#x27;t clash with any of my perfumes.  The powder is white but when applied it doesn&#x27;t go on white it just seems to give my skin a little lift- I do however, have very pale skin so I don&#x27;t know how it would look with darker tones.  The container is really cute but small, which is OK because you only need a little powder.  This makes my skin feel very soft and smooth and this powder can hold its own against any similar high end products.  I will be purchasing this finishing powder again.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin, as in, most of my face is disgustingly oily.  This powder stays on ALL DAY and really controls the shine.  On weekends I wear it alone and during the week I put it over BB cream.  It keeps my eyeshadow from creasing as well.  It does have a peach scent, but the powder has not irritated my sensitive skin.  I have had fewer breakouts since using this powder, but maybe that is because I no longer have to touch up my makeup in the middle of the day.</li>
            <li> The only powder I can put on and it just makes my skin look flawless. I recommend it with all honesty.</li>
            <li> This is the best finish powder I have ever used!  n____n&lt;br /&gt;It is a very fine white powder, which is really easy and pleasant to apply (I use a powder brush though, not the puff), smells lovely, doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze and doesn&#x27;t make me feel like my skin is not breathing.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin matte and very soft.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t give a ghost-like white face... I don&#x27;t think it does at least O_o&lt;br /&gt;My make up stays on and looks good way longer than with the other finish powders I used, and I don&#x27;t need to touch up my make up when I use that powder.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need much each time you apply it, so I reckon one box will last quite long.&lt;br /&gt;So, to sum up: MUST HAVE!!</li>
            <li> The powder makes my face look cakey and dull, regardless of how much I blend. The container fell apart on me almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I love it but I have to say it does dry out my skin so I have to use a bit more moisturizer than usual</li>
            <li> This product is so amazing. i was kind of wary at first because I&#x27;m kind of tan and i did not want to look like i&#x27;d been caked in powder, but the reviews were so great and i really love the peach smell, so i decided to try it. this powder smells so great, and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin look washed out! i wasn&#x27;t expecting to like it so much, but it doesn&#x27;t just keep my makeup perfect, it also controls my oil/shine and keeps my face looking matte and silky smooth. it&#x27;s not heavy and you only need a little bit so it lasts for a while. this product is really just so great, i definitely recommend it! unless you don&#x27;t like peaches.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! very smooth, last all day, smells sooo good!! I definitely going to recommend this great product.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast, great seller! The product itself is AMAZING. I have a combination face, and in the summer it gets really oily (and in the winter oily in some areas, dry in others), and I tried this product as soon as I received it during my lunch break. 8 hours later, my face is still silky, and not oily at all! It also smells GREAT! I&#x27;ve been trying to find anything that would keep my face not oily, and this is a cheap, and great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside (maybe it was just mine) was even though I haven&#x27;t broken the seal on the powder, it was already white, like there was some sort of leak that I couldn&#x27;t find. I ended up moving them to a sturdier loose compact case, because I intended to travel with it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand. They have never let me down. I love the way it smells, and better how well it works. Now that I&#x27;m in my early 30s I have oily skin and this powder really helps to control it. You don&#x27;t need alot, which is why I really like the fact it doesn&#x27;t dispense a ton at a time.</li>
            <li> I have oily adolescent skin, and this stuff mostly does the job. My face usually gets pretty shiny an hour after I do my make up, but I look dewy (and a little shiny on my nose) after a whole day with this powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice, too! It&#x27;s very light. I also have very sensitive skin, so it was nice to find something that doesn&#x27;t make me break out. The powder blends really well, so it doesn&#x27;t look cakey or too light on medium to darker tan skin tones. I don&#x27;t know about very dark skin, but this powder goes on so well, I don&#x27;t think it would show.</li>
            <li> Amazing finishing powder. Really keeps oil under control better than any other finishing powder that I&#x27;ve used. I do need to blot and touch up about 6 hours after application, but some days I can go a full 8 hours. I use a BB cushion, and set it with Urban Decay powder, then the Skinfood Peach Sake powder. I use some other oil control products (Skinfood Peach Sake Pore Serum and The FACE Shop Natural Sun Eco Sebum Control Moisture Sun SPF40 PA+++), but this finishing powder seems to be the key to locking it all in place. I use a big powder brush to apply it, not the included puff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yellow/olive skin, light but not super pale, and this is translucent enough to not show. The finish is fairly matte, I don&#x27;t know that it would be compatible with a dewy or glowy look</li>
            <li> Nope, I was not expecting this. It took forever to get here and I live in Hawaii. This is shipped from Japan. Not to mention, the finish powder is not silky or peach. Misleading!! I have not tried any other products at this time, and I may give this product line another try.&lt;br /&gt;My product was talc powder and was snow white.</li>
            <li> I use this over my Skin79 pink BB cream, and it keeps my makeup in place the whole day, even through the heat, and I also have oily skin. Nothing else seems to work that well for me since I do have oily skin, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with it. :]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it smells good too, but doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, just a nice and light peachy smell.</li>
            <li> Great! This was the first Skinfood product I ever bought and I have bought many since then. It goes on wonderful as a face powder--I use it by itself over moisturizer, or over bb cream, or foundation, etc. It is translucent with a mild pleasant smell and never looks cakey, etc. I have also found that it works great as a dry shampoo--I pat it in the roots of my hair before sleeping to combat oiliness and in the morning my hair is perfect! Also I have had this product for awhile now and as far as I can tell there is still plenty left. I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I love this product from the packaging to the formula. This powder is white so it is for someone with very fair skin. The scent is very light and smells as you would expect like a fresh peach. The powder puff it comes with is ok but I prefer to apply it with a kabuki for better blending. I would compare this powder to something similar to an hd powder in color and consistency but I don&#x27;t believe it promises the effects of an hd powder but it is very nice for absorbing oil and keeping it gone. I recommend using this product with the rest of the skinfood peach sake line.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous stuff! I get less breakouts and produce less oil. If you are wondering if this product acts like make up, it doesn&#x27;t. This is completely skin care. Love it!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to order and receive this face powder but once I learned of the ingredients list, I immediately sent back. Please beware, this powder DOES CONTAIN PARABENS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the list: Silica, Talk, Boron Nitride, Dimethicone, Peach Fruit Extract, Rice Ferment Filtrate (Sake), Silk Powder, Enanita Cholorantha Bark Extract,  Oleanilic Acid, Alcohol, Polymethylhydrosiloxane, Butylene Glycol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Fragrance.</li>
            <li> This powder really is silky and feels good on my skin.  I have already recommended it to some friends and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> omg!! I&#x27;m inlove  with this powder. Makes my face looks so smooth and matte &amp;#60;3 I&#x27;m glad i purchase this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It smells wonderful and is a perfect finish or highlight for my face. It makes my skin soft without makeup and even with it gives it a velvety smooth touch. I love this product. Its permanently going onto my wishlist.</li>
            <li> Too white.  My face still get oily in few hours</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft to the touch and oil free all day. I have recommended it to friends.</li>
            <li> This is a nice finishing powder.  Very light, pleasant scent and it provides just a little coverage to set in your foundation.  Sometimes I even use it on its own for just very sheer coverage and a matte finish if I don&#x27;t want the full face of makeup.</li>
            <li> For some reason it irritated my face and made it itchy!! Otherwise I believe it to be a good product, just not for me!!</li>
