            <li>THE BEST LIPSTICK type thing i have EVER used.</li>
            <li>Finish is a wonderful matte that does not feel tacky.</li>
            <li>I knew it was going to work great.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t really great</li>
            <li>Shipping was prompt and seller emailed a note thanking me for the purchase which was a very nice touch.</li>
            <li>While this is an amazing product (it smells like frosting!)</li>
            <li>I love the matte feel and it goes on very bright in one coat.</li>

            <li>I love everything about it!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t order more colors because they are always out of stock!</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s a really nice purple.</li>
            <li>but this lasts better than most I have tried!</li>
            <li>The color first going on is amazing and looks great.</li>
            <li>I love the color and it dries to an amazing texture on your lips.</li>

            <li>Applicator makes it easy to get a nice, polished edge without liner.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the color.</li>
            <li>I love this color and it stays on all day.</li>
            <li>I receive so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Overall it is an awesome product</li>
            <li>The color (pansy) is vivid and amazing!</li>
            <li>vanilla, the best common kind.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful color and actual product from lime crime.</li>
            <li>so help me, GIVE ME A TICKET FOR A FREE ITEM THAT LOOKS LIKE ITS DEPICTION</li>
            <li>i know i sound like i work for them</li>
            <li>i know i sound like i work for them</li>
            <li>Color is very rich and, although takes a couple of applications to get it even, very opaque and striking.</li>
            <li>I love this lip color, the color comes out exactly as the pictures shows.  </li>
            <li>my skin is almost as light as the wipe, whether it looks good or not, color comes up on me the shade it actually is.</li>
            <li>color is striking, glorious, glamorous, &amp; rich, &amp; the pigment really holds.</li>
            <li>I do not regret the purchase, as it&#x27;s such a gorgeous color.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of like this beigey-orange brown uck that, as far as i can tell, nobody would wear.</li>
            <li>vanilla, the best common kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the color, very bold.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>make sure you hydrate you lips well before application, as its very matte.</li>
            <li>this is not my eyes, nor is it the incredibly pasty pale color of my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i also dont get how they figure this, but even colors that might make most people of most complexions look like they just woke up, accidentally, how you say, soaked in insecticide in the middle of the morgue, LOOK, instead, RESPLENDENT when those colors are made, in this form, by this company.</li>

            <li>and I would definitely buy more!</li>
            <li>Pansy full on applied is beautiful but it has a hot pink undertone that I actually can&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li>It is beautiful and long lasting</li>
            <li>i only wish they made more colors &amp; boy</li>
            <li>i only wish they made more colors &amp; boy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a long lover of Mac, I have Mac Heroine which I love, but as soon s I got this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real purple that I&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
            <li>okayâ€” you can read my absolutely glowing review below.</li>
            <li>it IS absolutely glowing, &amp; i stand by it, but it is all for the earliest generation of liquid lip gunk.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like this color...</li>
            <li>I like lipsticks that really stand out and catch everyone&#x27;s eye</li>
            <li>I love the color and the fact that is very matte, but i think is expensive for the size of the product and it came out very easily in the middle of the lip...</li>
            <li>the color of cupid is the same, pretty much, on my hand, on my mouth, on my makeup wipe.</li>
            <li>Love it will get more, the only thing I dislike is the fact that at times it may feel a little dry.</li>
            <li>at no other time, created by no other outfit, have i been able to even approach a pink, for example, that did not make me look like i had liver damage.</li>
            <li>at no other time, created by no other outfit, have i been able to even approach a pink, for example, that did not make me look like i had liver damage.</li>
            <li>I used a clear liner with this and had it on all day.</li>
            <li>stuff--the lime crime liquid lip color--is BY FAR</li>
            <li>It is true to color and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>&amp; i mean most of it, &amp; not just &amp;#34;ring around the lipline&amp;#34; either.</li>
            <li>I hope the formula will be fixed to get rid the hot pink undertones.</li>
            <li>it turns hot pink.</li>
            <li>, I do not like how it fades into a hot pink.</li>
            <li>i am not connected in any way to the company, &amp; i dont like to throw out superlatives that are way too high &amp;, in truth, are mostly just silly.</li>
            <li>very pigmented and long lasting!!</li>
            <li>NOT PINK.</li>
            <li>, then i bought the red one [ebay too], then i bought this one direct from their website.</li>
            <li>, then i bought the red one [ebay too], then i bought this one direct from their website.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still transferable and stains the skin a hot pink if you accidentally go outside the lips.</li>
            <li>However, I find it transfers and wears away much faster than some of their other colors.</li>

            <li> colors work, is what i&#x27;m saying, &amp; not only do they work but, to use a stupid but accurate clich&amp;eacute;: you look like yr working them &amp; not like theyre working you.</li>

            <li> well, a lot of it sucks.</li>
            <li> It flakes away as the day progresses and it is hard to wear during the working day because it looks unpresentable if I don&#x27;t continue to reapply!</li>

            <li> I absolutely love the color. However, I find it transfers and wears away much faster than some of their other colors. I needed almost three coats to be fully opaque. I do not regret the purchase, as it&#x27;s such a gorgeous color. But I hope they fix the formula.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long lover of Mac, I have Mac Heroine which I love, but as soon s I got this I tried it. It&#x27;s a real purple that I&#x27;ve always wanted. Will post pic. Follow me on Instagram for reviews and stuff. @shaunieofyork</li>
            <li> Pansy full on applied is beautiful but it has a hot pink undertone that I actually can&#x27;t stand. So as it fades because pansy fades way faster then cashmere.. it turns hot pink. Meh</li>
            <li> okayâ€” you can read my absolutely glowing review below. it IS absolutely glowing, &amp; i stand by it, but it is all for the earliest generation of liquid lip gunk. the newer stuff..... the newer stuff..... well, a lot of it sucks. i have appended a wipe off from cupid, which is wending its everlovin way back to amazon as soon as i reach amazon. CUPIDâ€”cupid!â€”IS NOT PINK. it&#x27;s NOWHERE NEAR PINK. it&#x27;s kind of like this beigey-orange brown uck that, as far as i can tell, nobody would wear. this is not my eyes, nor is it the incredibly pasty pale color of my skin. my skin is almost as light as the wipe, whether it looks good or not, color comes up on me the shade it actually is. i could put foundation on my lips, wouldnt make any difference in the color. the color of cupid is the same, pretty much, on my hand, on my mouth, on my makeup wipe. SUCKY. SUCKY BEYOND REASON.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what the forkity fork cooks, limecrime? the last three lip gunky things i bought from you were not true color as displayed here or on yr website. that would be the mauvy 80s rock lipstick [name i do not remember, apologies], the abovenoted horrid abomination [cupid], &amp; even riot. the mauve i can still use &amp; i can still use riot, but i&#x27;m drawing the line at cupid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all i can think of is limecrime changed suppliers, knows this stuff is bad, &amp; is relying on repeat buyers. no more. REFUND ME &amp;, so help me, GIVE ME A TICKET FOR A FREE ITEM THAT LOOKS LIKE ITS DEPICTION or i am CALLING IT QUITS WITH LIMECRIME. i am a good customer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--OLD REVIEW--&lt;br /&gt;this stuff--the lime crime liquid lip color--is BY FAR THE BEST LIPSTICK type thing i have EVER used. i am not connected in any way to the company, &amp; i dont like to throw out superlatives that are way too high &amp;, in truth, are mostly just silly. THIS STUFF IS PHENOMENAL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;every color is striking, glorious, glamorous, &amp; rich, &amp; the pigment really holds. you could drink a milkshake, if that be yr personal thing, &amp; you&#x27;d still have lip color on at the end. &amp; i mean most of it, &amp; not just &amp;#34;ring around the lipline&amp;#34; either. as an aside &amp; if you are wondering: this stuff tastes like a milkshake too. vanilla, the best common kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i also dont get how they figure this, but even colors that might make most people of most complexions look like they just woke up, accidentally, how you say, soaked in insecticide in the middle of the morgue, LOOK, instead, RESPLENDENT when those colors are made, in this form, by this company. i think there&#x27;s something about its absolute matte-ness that fights what might be conflicting undertones or unpleasant overnotes in one&#x27;s skin, &amp; just demolishes them, more or less. my only caveat is that i am naturally &amp; e&#x27;erlastingly EXTREMELY pale --we&#x27;re talking chalk, here-- but that usually LIMITS the colors i can use. at no other time, created by no other outfit, have i been able to even approach a pink, for example, that did not make me look like i had liver damage. something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in other, nicer, less clinical terms:&lt;br /&gt;these colors work, is what i&#x27;m saying, &amp; not only do they work but, to use a stupid but accurate clich&amp;eacute;: you look like yr working them &amp; not like theyre working you. even a color this outrageous is a wonderment when made by this company. dont ask me how. i know i sound like i work for them [if they hired gothy comedy writers] but nope, this is a REAL &amp; TRUE review. i found the pink velvetine on ebay &amp; decided to try to see if a pink didnt turn my skin l&#x27;eau des morts banane [it DID NOT!], then i bought the red one [ebay too], then i bought this one direct from their website. i only wish they made more colors &amp; boy, will i cry, when i can no longer get the ones they do make. i hope it never happens.most of it, &amp; not just &amp;#34;ring around the lipline&amp;#34; either. as an aside &amp; if you are wondering: this stuff tastes like a milkshake too. vanilla, the best common kind.  i also dont get how they figure this, but even colors that might make most people of most complexions look like they just woke up, accidentally, how you say, soaked in insecticide in the middle of the morgue, LOOK, instead, RESPLENDENT when those colors are made, in this form, by this company. i think there&#x27;s something about its absolute matte-ness that fights what might be conflicting undertones or unpleasant overnotes in one&#x27;s skin, &amp; just demolishes them, more or less. my only caveat is that i am naturally &amp; e&#x27;erlastingly EXTREMELY pale --we&#x27;re talking chalk, here-- but that usually LIMITS the colors i can use. at no other time, created by no other outfit, have i been able to even approach a pink, for example, that did not make me look like i had liver damage. something like that.  in other, nicer, less clinical terms: these colors work, is what i&#x27;m saying, &amp; not only do they work but, to use a stupid but accurate clichÃ©: you look like yr working them &amp; not like theyre working you. even a color this outrageous is a wonderment when made by this company. dont ask me how. i know i sound like i work for them [if they hired gothy comedy writers] but nope, this is a REAL &amp; TRUE review. i found the pink velvetine on ebay &amp; decided to try to see if a pink didnt turn my skin l&#x27;eau des morts banane [it DID NOT!], then i bought the red one [ebay too], then i bought this one direct from their website. i only wish they made more colors &amp; boy, will i cry, when i can no longer get the ones they do make. i hope it never happens.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and actual product from lime crime. Love it</li>
            <li> I love everything about it!  It is true to color and long lasting.  I&#x27;m sad I can&#x27;t order more colors because they are always out of stock!</li>
            <li> Love it will get more, the only thing I dislike is the fact that at times it may feel a little dry. You might need chap stick.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful and long lasting</li>
            <li> Love the color, very bold.&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you hydrate you lips well before application, as its very matte.</li>
            <li> Obsessed. Finish is a wonderful matte that does not feel tacky. Color is very rich and, although takes a couple of applications to get it even, very opaque and striking. Applicator makes it easy to get a nice, polished edge without liner. Would definitely recommend. Shipping was prompt and seller emailed a note thanking me for the purchase which was a very nice touch.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a long lasting lipstick/lip stain for a long time. The second I applied this I knew it was going to work great. I love the matte feel and it goes on very bright in one coat. There is no lip stain that lasts all day but this lasts better than most I have tried! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I will be ordering this in EVERY  COLOUR I can find!!!</li>
            <li> While this is an amazing product (it smells like frosting!), I do not like how it fades into a hot pink. The color first going on is amazing and looks great. But it&#x27;s still transferable and stains the skin a hot pink if you accidentally go outside the lips. I hope the formula will be fixed to get rid the hot pink undertones.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try these for years and just finally snagged one. I love the color and it dries to an amazing texture on your lips. Definitely velvety. The only thing I see that could be improved is the doe foot applicator. It wasn&#x27;t really great and I used a lip brush to apply the outline. I used a clear liner with this and had it on all day. It did not bleed but faded some after eating and drinking which is to be expected. Overall it is an awesome product and I would definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> I really like this color...but I don&#x27;t like that it goes on really wet and if you aren&#x27;t careful if till smear if you rub your li[ps together too soon</li>
            <li> great color pay off , love the color lots of compliments..</li>
            <li> Perfection!!! I only need one coat. The color (pansy) is vivid and amazing! Only downside is that my lips feel dry. It takes a minute to fully dry but once it did it stayed. I ate, drank and kissed my husband with no transfer. I can&#x27;t wait to try their other colors.</li>
            <li> I love the color and the fact that is very matte, but i think is expensive for the size of the product and it came out very easily in the middle of the lip... And you have to retouch a lot on that part</li>
            <li> It flakes away as the day progresses and it is hard to wear during the working day because it looks unpresentable if I don&#x27;t continue to reapply!</li>
            <li> very pigmented and long lasting!!</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is that it stains my lips pretty bad. Otherwise it&#x27;s a really nice purple. I like lipsticks that really stand out and catch everyone&#x27;s eye and this definitely does that.</li>
