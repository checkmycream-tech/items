            <li>Mine seems to be authentic</li>
            <li>You need to carry a HUGE-STICK-OF-WOOD,, Be An OLYMPIC-SPRINTER,, Or Just LOVE to be TORN-APART By The-Ladies</li>
            <li>&amp; The Bottle-Design is nothing short of Awesome!!</li>
            <li>and they love it...</li>
            <li>He love it</li>
            <li>but I love it  </li>
            <li>This is okay</li>

            <li>My wife and kids love the smell</li>
            <li>Nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>but, I like the original curve better.  </li>
            <li>Too strong didnt like the smell.</li>
            <li>This is a bit strong, so use sparingly.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is very fresh.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>I had read good reviews and bought this at a local store.</li>
            <li>Smells good &amp;  was bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>and since i love the smell of this i really dont mind.  </li>
            <li>like I&#x27;ve experienced previously.</li>
            <li>If you want every single chick you come across to say &amp;#34; you smell so good &amp;#34; then this is the cologne for you</li>
            <li>hahahaha!!</li>
            <li>The can it comes in is a nice touch although the angled bottle is a bit different.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what to say in a review of a cologne, other than that it smells good.</li>
            <li>This was a christmas gift for my husband and he uses it daily and has barely made a dent, not to mention its great oz to $ ratio.  </li>
            <li>But the spray was not coming out evenly, the first spray comes out nice but next presses doesn&#x27;t seem to have pressure.</li>
            <li>my wife loves it what else do you need to know a little before bed time and your good to go</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>

            <li>day I went to a birthday party for a coworker and again was wearing my new cologne.</li>
            <li>Pretty much same response.</li>
            <li>mean, lol, holy cow...</li>
            <li>It has a clean scent that last a long time.</li>
            <li>He has introduced this fragrance to our 6 and 7 year old nephews</li>
            <li>Turned around and she was walking backwards with a big smile on her face while the guy next to her looked at her with a smirk.</li>
            <li>I will be back for future purchases, and i highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Seriously,, This is better than Colognes I&#x27;ve spent over 100-Buck&#x27;s on!!</li>

            <li> It was overly harsh but the bottle is a cool shape.not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> (Sits at an angle, But still flat on the bottom),, Just have to see it!)</li>
            <li> This cologne is slightly different from the other Curve colognes.</li>

            <li> I go through cologn like water,  purchased this at least a year and a half ago,  and still got it :-/</li>
            <li> I could not tell a difference between this product and the same product sold at expensive retain stores.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want a cologne that was overly masculine as they smell pretty horrible, but I also didn&#x27;t want something that could be confused with perfume.</li>
            <li> and she started slow dancing against me while saying &amp;</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t Go Wrong!!</li>

I didn&#x27;t want a cologne that was overly masculine as they smell pretty horrible, but I also didn&#x27;t want something that could be confused with perfume.

            <li> Lots of compliments, smells great.</li>
            <li> Great scent..great value</li>
            <li> I had read good reviews and bought this at a local store. I put some on and went out shopping. Was walking down an isle and noticed a woman walking with a guy down the isle going to pass me. She looked good. After we passed I heard a woman&#x27;s voice say &amp;#34;You smell delightful!!&amp;#34;. Turned around and she was walking backwards with a big smile on her face while the guy next to her looked at her with a smirk. Thought &amp;#34;Wow, that won&#x27;t happen again.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next day I went to a birthday party for a coworker and again was wearing my new cologne. Came out back where the beer and BBQ was and said my hello&#x27;s. Came up to her and she said &amp;#34;Come here&amp;#34;. Went over and was immediately grabbed by my polo shirt and pulled into her while she said &amp;#34;You smell,, goooood...&amp;#34;. There was a sparkle in her eyes. Lol..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wore it for my girlfriend. Pretty much same response. She pulled me in close while her green eyes sparkled and she started slow dancing against me while saying &amp;#34;You smell really good&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, lol, holy cow...</li>
            <li> This was a fathers day gift for my boyfriend. The fragrance in amazing. He loves it and so do I! remember ladies: when you buy him cologne make sure you like  it too!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say in a review of a cologne, other than that it smells good. Despite the bottle&#x27;s wacky design, it stands upright in the cabinet, and yeah...</li>
            <li> I go through cologn like water,  purchased this at least a year and a half ago,  and still got it :-/</li>
            <li> My wife and kids love the smell and I too like it a lot.  The fragrance is very fresh.  But the spray was not coming out evenly, the first spray comes out nice but next presses doesn&#x27;t seem to have pressure.</li>
            <li> SMELLS GREAT FOR A GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li> This cologne is slightly different from the other Curve colognes. It has a clean scent that last a long time.</li>
            <li> Was a father&#x27;s day gift ordered a few days before father&#x27;s day n it got here on time. He loves it.. Smells good &amp;  was bigger than I thought it would be. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Great packaging and bottle design.  Great value for the price.  Boyfriend loves it so I had to buy another one.</li>
            <li> I call this one \\&quot;Curve Gangster Lean\\&quot; because of the bottle.  I like it, though.  Nice fragrance.  Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> great stuff, and fast ass shipping!!</li>
            <li> my wife loves it what else do you need to know a little before bed time and your good to go</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell. The fragrance had to grow on me, haven&#x27;t been requested by strangers of the scent like I&#x27;ve experienced previously. For the price, great purchase. I wear to work and around the house.</li>
            <li> Gave to son for Christmas &amp; he loves it. Great price for the size of this cologne.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. Office type.</li>
            <li> Great buy! Fast shipping</li>
            <li> This was a christmas gift for my husband and he uses it daily and has barely made a dent, not to mention its great oz to $ ratio.  Its not over powering at all when he leaves the room he used it in i can still smell him a little but not long and since i love the smell of this i really dont mind.  I think he smells very sexy in this cologne</li>
            <li> I could not tell a difference between this product and the same product sold at expensive retain stores. Great deal and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells great,a little fruit vibe to it.</li>
            <li> I like this perfume. it is not overpowering but yet smells very nicely. This can be your everyday perfume and you don&#x27;t need to worry about over applying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. I did not like the smell that much.</li>
            <li> Smells great. My boyfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance and good price! I really like it! I am happy to find this great smell perfume.  I received it earlier than the estimated time.</li>
