            <li>After this product (one light coat), 2 light color coats &amp; a nail hardener top coat, my manicure lasts a good, long time!!!!  </li>
            <li>She was so right!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth the money and comes in a HUGE bottle.</li>

            <li>Gives an excellent base for nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Alive Gooey Sticky Base Coat was so far superior to them, I knew I &#x27;d continue to use it forever!!  </li>
            <li>with ths size of this bottle i am set for a pretty long time, however if i do run out I&#x27;m coming back for this again.</li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t work any better than the cheap 99 cent Wet and Wild base coat.  </li>

            <li> Much prefer these sticky base coats than the traditional kind.  </li>
            <li> Long story short, I did not.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I wash my hands all day long</li>
            <li> Just regular wear and tear, not really washing dishes so that doesn&#x27;t explain the chipping.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember the other products because Nails</li>
            <li> and I have a lot less chips and worn tips.</li>
            <li> Polish stays on twice as long at least.  </li>
            <li> so it made a little difference</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I find that the polish will start to chip after a few days.</li>
            <li> Several years ago, I realized that my nails, thin &amp; fairly fragile, needed an &amp;#34;adhesive base coat&amp;#34; to do well.  </li>

            <li> but I was unable to find it in any store.</li>
            <li> so its difficult to keep my polish from chipping</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t get it. It doesn&#x27;t seem &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34; or sticky to me, and I cannot say that it helps my polish last any longer than when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I love this.... when getting my nails done I don&#x27;t even have to sit under the dryer</li>
            <li> I purchased the Nail Alive Gooey base coat through Amazon.com. I love this product but I was unable to find it in any store. I am extremely happy with my purchase.</li>

            <li> It makes your polish adhere to your nail bed which therefor makes your mani/pedi last longer!  This product is a must have.....</li>
            <li> Several years ago, I realized that my nails, thin &amp; fairly fragile, needed an &amp;#34;adhesive base coat&amp;#34; to do well.  I did an Internet search at the time and 3 products came up.  I ordered one bottle of each.  I don&#x27;t remember the other products because Nails Alive Gooey Sticky Base Coat was so far superior to them, I knew I &#x27;d continue to use it forever!!  This product makes a HUGE difference on how long your manicure lasts...  I carry it with me when I get mani-pedis.  This week I was out of town &amp; took it &amp; the girl said, &amp;#34;don&#x27;t worry, that is what we use&amp;#34;...  It is especially helpful on fingernails as our hands do so many tasks, are in and out of water etc.  After this product (one light coat), 2 light color coats &amp; a nail hardener top coat, my manicure lasts a good, long time!!!!  I cannot recommend it more highly!</li>
            <li> Bought this when my friend was raving about it. She was so right!  I got my nails done at the salon, came home, and put a coat of this on.  5 days later, my nails are still perfect.  No chipping! I don&#x27;t know what is in it but it works.  Just bought another one for a friend at work.  I know she is going to love it too!</li>
            <li> Works well. I apply a coat of gooey base coat then one coat of polish, let it dry then another coat of gooey basecoat then another coat of polish.  I work in healthcare and I wash my hands all day long so its difficult to keep my polish from chipping but when I apply in this order I get several day of wear before it chips</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  It works like glue in keeping your nail polish on longer!  I used it almost a week ago and my nail color is still on......not chips @ all.  I would highly recommend this product.....it&#x27;s well worth the money and comes in a HUGE bottle.</li>
            <li> A co-worker recommended this to me, swearing I would get Shellac-like wear out of it. Long story short, I did not.</li>
            <li> Best base coat I&#x27;ve been able to find.  Polish stays on twice as long at least.  I use it before I apply each coat of polish and I have a lot less chips and worn tips.</li>
            <li> I find that the polish will start to chip after a few days. My dominate hand will chip the most. Just regular wear and tear, not really washing dishes so that doesn&#x27;t explain the chipping. Don&#x27;t know if the brand of the polish plays a factor in the quickness of the chipping.</li>
            <li> Great basecoat product helps protect your nails and helps your nail polish color stay on longer.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes my manicures last much longer! Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This worked well for me with glitter polish!!  I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> the polish lasted four days and with out it it only lasted two so it made a little difference I liked it</li>
            <li> The base coat was just what I was looking for.  I have used this the nail salons and it will definetly extend the life of your nail color once applied.</li>
            <li> Great base coat.  Really holds polish on.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after I had a manicure and she used this as the base. My nail polish stuck so well and lasted two weeks! It smooths on nail polish so well too you&#x27;re not left with brush strokes</li>
            <li> i have tried two base coats (name brand) prior to this and this works awesome. it dries very quick and it doesn&#x27;t require you to put more than one quick coat. with ths size of this bottle i am set for a pretty long time, however if i do run out I&#x27;m coming back for this again. i would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
