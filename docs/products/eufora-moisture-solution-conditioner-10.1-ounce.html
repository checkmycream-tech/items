            <li>It is perfect for my fine hair.</li>

            <li>To sum this up, it&#x27;s great, makes my hair feel good, and is great for your hair. :)</li>
            <li>Made my hair feel like straw, and it did not smell good at all.</li>
            <li>Love this product, great scent, moisturizing, adds shine.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner!  </li>
            <li>I love the product!</li>
            <li>I get a lot of comments on my hair smelling nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the Eufora line and this conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave your hair oily feeling after a shower even after adding products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Eufora products for maybe 10 years or more now?  </li>
            <li>I love all of the products I have used.</li>
            <li>Love the price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>These products are so much better for your hair.</li>
            <li>so I was really glad that I could find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>My hair is now so brittle, i&#x27;ve never had more split ends in my life.</li>
            <li>The ends feel healthy, holds a softer curl, not frizzy.  </li>
            <li>A winning combination.</li>
            <li>I love Eufora.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was more affordable.</li>
            <li>I can use it with other shampoos but using it with the Eufora Moisture Cleanse Shampoo is the best combination for me.</li>
            <li>Illuminate Shine Mist - to finish off a look with a light gloss&lt;br /&gt; 8.</li>
            <li>Smooth &#x27;N</li>
            <li>I have oily but damaged hair and this is great when mixed with a lighter conditioner.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this product to be super-hydrating and wonderful, but it&#x27;s not exactly what I need.  </li>
            <li>Urgent Repair - on occasion as special treatment&lt;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any special diet or whatever.</li>
            <li>I know that it won&#x27;t damage my hair but am I getting the full benefit by being shipped an expired product?</li>
            <li>I use to take them and use like Treseme products and it wouldn&#x27;t really grow any more than 1/2 inch a month.</li>
            <li>It feels like it has life again and is full and bouncy when I style</li>
            <li>Happy to have a product recommended by my stylist for half the price.</li>
            <li>It feels beyond soft, is super shiny, and great for color treated, constantly being styled with heat hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It reminds me of just a light natural scent you might get if you walked by a flower stand.  </li>
            <li>With Eufora shampoo and conditioner I noticed a difference the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the whole line for several years and have found nothing better.</li>
            <li>This leaves my long, layered and color treated hair smooth and fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li>Pure Polish</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product from the salon (which was fine), and this amazon purchase was a total scam.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and yes, it is the real product!</li>
            <li>Not overwhelming or sweet or musky but just light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>yeah, I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>It works really well with the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In fact one of the reasons I got so hooked on trying this stuff was because my hair dresser uses them along with many other products</li>
            <li>It was in the old packaging (brown bottle) and I question the shelf-life of Eufora products since the first ingredient is aloe vera and not water.</li>
            <li>it was probably pretty old.</li>
            <li>It gives your hair a healthy shine and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m down to the last, maybe 3 more shampoos!</li>
            <li>I also develop a lot of breakage pretty easily if I&#x27;m not careful.  </li>
            <li>I live in the desert and this keeps my hair curly &amp; not frizzy.</li>
            <li>Fixation Styling Wax - Tame the baby hairs around the face, the little fly aways with this</li>
            <li>PLEASE get this exact product back!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling really soft but not \\&quot;heavy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give it a couple of months and all that remains is completely damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I love these products however, I believe that the distributor of this particular item sent me outdated product.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair which can be prone to being frizzy or dry, and these products really help.  </li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older my hair has thinned and feels flat.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have super dry hair or if you have finer hair that would be weighed down with a richer conditioner, this might work well for you.  </li>
            <li>Obviously there s only do much that can expected until that is resolved.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth the extravagant price.</li>

            <li> a chin length bob, which now 3 months later is almost down to my collar bone!</li>
            <li> which is kind of annoying since I have to take out the pump and empty it out another way.</li>
            <li> Beautifying serum - to tame frizz and dead ends daily</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weight it down and it gives me the control I need with no flyaway s.</li>
            <li> Beautifying serum is a little lighter.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have color-treated, curly, dry hair.  I also develop a lot of breakage pretty easily if I&#x27;m not careful.  I really wanted this product to be super-hydrating and wonderful, but it&#x27;s not exactly what I need.  My hair is still fairly dry and flyaway with it, and I&#x27;m using a few drops of straight argan oil with my styling product also.  If you don&#x27;t have super dry hair or if you have finer hair that would be weighed down with a richer conditioner, this might work well for you.  For me, I will use up what I have and then try either a Davines or a Phyto product.</li>
            <li> I love these products however, I believe that the distributor of this particular item sent me outdated product. It was in the old packaging (brown bottle) and I question the shelf-life of Eufora products since the first ingredient is aloe vera and not water. I know that it won&#x27;t damage my hair but am I getting the full benefit by being shipped an expired product?</li>
            <li> My hair as been very dry due to a medical issue.  Obviously there s only do much that can expected until that is resolved. With that being said,I&#x27;ve tried multiple,multiple products and this has been the best</li>
            <li> I love the Eufora line and this conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave your hair oily feeling after a shower even after adding products. Great for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Eufora products for maybe 10 years or more now?  I love all of the products I have used. I have naturally curly hair which can be prone to being frizzy or dry, and these products really help.  Some I use regularly and others on occasion.  The scent on this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact one of the reasons I got so hooked on trying this stuff was because my hair dresser uses them along with many other products and I was always going around smelling how good she smelled and wondering what perfum she was wearing.  However this is the type of scent that doesn&#x27;t interfere with regular perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It reminds me of just a light natural scent you might get if you walked by a flower stand.  Not overwhelming or sweet or musky but just light and fresh.  I get a lot of comments on my hair smelling nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use these products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1. Moisture solution conditioner - regular conditioner&lt;br /&gt; 2. Moisture cleanse shampoo - regular shampoo&lt;br /&gt; 3. Hydration leave in conditioner - leave-in conditioner&lt;br /&gt; 4. Urgent Repair - on occasion as special treatment&lt;br /&gt; 5. Beautifying serum - to tame frizz and dead ends daily&lt;br /&gt; 6. Sculpture Styling Glaze - when I need some hold on occasion&lt;br /&gt; 7. Illuminate Shine Mist - to finish off a look with a light gloss&lt;br /&gt; 8. Fortifi Strength Spray - daily to enhance strength of hair&lt;br /&gt; 9. Pure Polish Finishing Drops - Works the same as the beautifying serum, except I was say for situations when you have especially course, curly or dry hair.  Beautifying serum is a little lighter.&lt;br /&gt;10. Curl &#x27;N Defining Solution - when I need some hold on occasion&lt;br /&gt;11. Curl Revitalizer and Spray - when I don&#x27;t have time to wash my hair and just want to plump up and freshen the scent of my curls&lt;br /&gt;12. Smooth &#x27;N Straightening Balm - on the occasions when I want to straighten my hair&lt;br /&gt;13. Fixation Styling Wax - Tame the baby hairs around the face, the little fly aways with this</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and this keeps my hair curly &amp; not frizzy. Leaves you with plenty of moisture</li>
            <li> After trying several other conditioners I always come back to this one. It is perfect for my fine hair. It doesn&#x27;t weight it down and it gives me the control I need with no flyaway s. I can use it with other shampoos but using it with the Eufora Moisture Cleanse Shampoo is the best combination for me. Love the price on Amazon. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Love this product, great scent, moisturizing, adds shine. Happy to have a product recommended by my stylist for half the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these products for seven years and have no plans to switch. I have oily but damaged hair and this is great when mixed with a lighter conditioner.</li>
            <li> I use this along with the hydrating shampoo. The both of them together make my hair feel like heaven lol. It feels beyond soft, is super shiny, and great for color treated, constantly being styled with heat hair. Let alone, my hair has actually been growing a little faster since using Eufora products. I use to have a chin length bob, which now 3 months later is almost down to my collar bone! I don&#x27;t have any special diet or whatever. I take a mutivitamin and biotin. I use to take them and use like Treseme products and it wouldn&#x27;t really grow any more than 1/2 inch a month. Now it must be growing atleast 3/4-1 inch a month since switching to Eufora. These products are so much better for your hair. They don&#x27;t have any bad sulfates in them, and are conpletely organic, with 80% pharmacuidical grade aloe vera is all the shampoos and conditioners. To sum this up, it&#x27;s great, makes my hair feel good, and is great for your hair. :)</li>
            <li> Great product. It gives your hair a healthy shine and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it look greasy. I have been using it awhile now and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> yeah, I really like this conditioner. It leaves my hair feeling really soft but not \\&quot;heavy\\&quot;. However, I wish the bottle came clean and the pump was broken as well. When it came in, the bottle had this weird sticky residue and I had to wipe some of it off, plus the pump came in broken which is kind of annoying since I have to take out the pump and empty it out another way.</li>
            <li> Great quality, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth the extravagant price. It&#x27;s cheaper online than buying retail though.</li>
            <li> Thank god amazon prime started carrying Eufora! I&#x27;ve used the products for years and have never been disappointed. This product works well with the urgent repair shampoo. Highly recommended and yes, it is the real product!</li>
            <li> My teen-age son uses this daily. He has dry and oily hair. It helps to minimize his split ends. Recently the local salon quit carrying it so I was really glad that I could find it on Amazon. Yeah! I am so glad that he can keep using it as it works the best for him.</li>
            <li> this product is a game changer!...it is pricy though.  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product from the salon (which was fine), and this amazon purchase was a total scam. I wanted to give it a couple of months and all that remains is completely damaged hair. I do not straighten nor blow dry my hair on a daily basis, not even weekly. My hair is now so brittle, i&#x27;ve never had more split ends in my life. :-( I have an appointment on Tuesday to cut a few inches off.</li>
            <li> PLEASE get this exact product back! Great for color treated hair. I&#x27;m down to the last, maybe 3 more shampoos! I&#x27;ve used the whole line for several years and have found nothing better.</li>
            <li> This leaves my long, layered and color treated hair smooth and fresh smelling.  The ends feel healthy, holds a softer curl, not frizzy.  I couple it with Eufora Moisture Cleanse shampoo.  A winning combination.</li>
            <li> This is by far the WORST conditioner I have ever used. Made my hair feel like straw, and it did not smell good at all. I have a feeling it was probably pretty old. I will never use any of their products again. I even gave this to my mother in law, because she has different hair and taste than I do.... it gave her a rash. Worst experience with conditioner ever.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It works really well with the shampoo.  Hope to find a bigger bottle next time.</li>
            <li> I have never had a bad hair day with this product.  I love Eufora.  Aloe vera based instead of water.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!  It&#x27;s very thick so you only need to use a tiny bit.  Yet, you can rinse it all out.</li>
            <li> I love the product! As I&#x27;ve gotten older my hair has thinned and feels flat.  With Eufora shampoo and conditioner I noticed a difference the first time I used it. It feels like it has life again and is full and bouncy when I style it.&lt;br /&gt;My only dislike is the price. I wish it was more affordable.</li>
