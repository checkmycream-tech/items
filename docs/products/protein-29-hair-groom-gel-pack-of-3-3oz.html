            <li>and Clean.as you get more for your money</li>
            <li>I would give this 5 stars if the price was lower or more content for the money.</li>
            <li>but the tubes I received were more of a liquid.</li>
            <li>have been using this product for more than 15 years I will stick with it</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite and he had been using something he didn&#x27;t care for since Walgreens stopped carrying this in the store.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it were more available.</li>
            <li>Compact container that is easy to carry in my gym bag.  </li>
            <li>The gel is easy to apply and holds hair in place without an oily look.  </li>
            <li>Easy to order and takes a couple of days.</li>
            <li>same great product from 100 years ago and unavailable in any drugstore</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they have fixed this problem.</li>
            <li>Hair looks natural and holds it place fine.</li>
            <li>My husband has used Protein 29 for our whole married life (and probably before--33 yrs!).  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Great buy on hair grooming product that I have bought and used for at least five years years.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>My first choice for hair grooming.</li>
            <li>Most recent order is perfect--exactly as it should be.</li>
            <li>It works, but it&#x27;s more of a liquid than a gel - maybe it had been on the shelf too long?</li>
            <li>I find that it doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy or real shiny and stuck together.</li>
            <li>and I knew if it was sold anywhere, there was a real possibility that it was on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now approaching seventy and still have a full head of hair.</li>
            <li>I have found none better to keep your hair in place without that plastered down look.</li>
            <li>Thankfully Amazon carries for a decent price.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a case of a great product that never had the marketing behind it or it would have been a much wider used and easier to locate.</li>
            <li>I normally like their gel product.  </li>
            <li>This product is normally a gel</li>
            <li>The price has remained fairly stable, and since I&#x27;m a little gun shy, I&#x27;m ordering more to be certain that I don&#x27;t run out again.</li>
            <li>Jill ~ Atlantic City, New Jersey area</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;s been since I started using Protein 29, but I was dismayed when no drug store carried it (or ANY other men&#x27;s hair gels or tonics) any more.</li>
            <li>No hype, no smell and leaves natural look.</li>
            <li>His comments are that it invigorates the scalp and makes hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>Price for this product, which last for a long time, is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Revised comments: Previous order was watery substance--not much like a gel.</li>
            <li>The watery substance does not go as far or last as long.  </li>
            <li>Oh, it really does hold what little hair I have left.</li>

            <li> Oh, it really does hold what little hair I have left.</li>
            <li> Always appreciated Protein 29 - don&#x27;t want the &amp;#34;dry fly-away&#x27;s&amp;#34; but definitely not the mousse-type guy with my hair stuck rigidly in one arrangement no matter how hard the wind blows.</li>
            <li> Reasonable hair groom gel that is hard to find elsewhere</li>
            <li> ( what little I got left ) in place.</li>
            <li> Use it after working out at a fitness center.  </li>
            <li> Works well but doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; the hair in place as some other gels.</li>
            <li> Try it and you will not use any other brand.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I started having trouble finding it in local drugstores, so to the internet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Protein 29 for 20 years, so, obviously, it&#x27;s satisfactory, just hard to find in Des Moines, Iowa.</li>
            <li> This leads me to wonder if it has been watered down.</li>
            <li> I previously had to order my husband&#x27;s Protein 29 Hair Gel through a Barber 20 minutes away ...</li>
            <li> Use to use a little dab will do you, but never again</li>
            <li> Was a little watery coming out of the tube.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just not available in stores.</li>
            <li> Quality as expected!!!!</li>
            <li> Not the usual consistency.</li>
            <li> I just find it is hard to get in my area.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores in my area</li>
            <li> My hair feels thick, health, and comb-able.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to find in stores, I have recently tried Groom</li>
            <li> Really frustrating until I realized you can get anything, anything on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Maybe this was just a bad batch.</li>

            <li> Here is a hair cream that rally works.  I&#x27;ve been using it successfully for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Protein 29 for 20 years, so, obviously, it&#x27;s satisfactory, just hard to find in Des Moines, Iowa.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Great product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff...I&#x27;ve been using this unpretentious, effective product for 15 years.  No hype, no smell and leaves natural look. I always worry that someday, it will be out of production.</li>
            <li> Best hair gel on the market but hardest get to locate. Stephens Company no longer mfg the product and CVS no longer carries it. This is definitely a case of a great product that never had the marketing behind it or it would have been a much wider used and easier to locate.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Use it after working out at a fitness center.  Compact container that is easy to carry in my gym bag.  The gel is easy to apply and holds hair in place without an oily look.  Price for this product, which last for a long time, is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I normally like their gel product.  This time it seemed they took the liquid and put it in a tube.  Maybe this was just a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I like the gel. It is not greasy and works great in keeping my hair  ( what little I got left ) in place. I have used it for over thirty years. I just find it is hard to get in my area.</li>
            <li> My husband has used Protein 29 for our whole married life (and probably before--33 yrs!).  A few years ago, I started having trouble finding it in local drugstores, so to the internet I went.  Thankfully Amazon carries for a decent price.</li>
            <li> I have used this for decades. Adds body to hair and is not greasy. Very difficult to find in stores, I have recently tried Groom and Clean.as you get more for your money but it lacks the control of Protein 29. I would give this 5 stars if the price was lower or more content for the money.</li>
            <li> This is a real good cream for hair! I find that it doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy or real shiny and stuck together. Hair looks natural and holds it place fine. If you buy it I believe you will like it.</li>
            <li> This product is normally a gel but the tubes I received were more of a liquid. I&#x27;ve used this before and never received a product which would run out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I previously had to order my husband&#x27;s Protein 29 Hair Gel through a Barber 20 minutes away ... it is really nice to be able to order myself when needed.  Jill ~ Atlantic City, New Jersey area</li>
            <li> I was asked to find for a friend and I knew if it was sold anywhere, there was a real possibility that it was on Amazon. His comments are that it invigorates the scalp and makes hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> Great.  My dad lobes this stuff.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years!</li>
            <li> One star only because it is required. I have used this for years. It is a gel but the last two orders have been liquid in a tube. I will never buy this again!!!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years.  Works well but doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; the hair in place as some other gels.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years and it continues to please me.  Would recommend it to anyone who uses hair tonic.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have been using it for over 30 years. Hard to find in the stores in my area so I&#x27;m very pleased that it is an Amazon item. It works well with my type of fine hair and smells pretty good too!</li>
            <li> Great experience ! Quality as expected!!!!</li>
            <li> It works, but it&#x27;s more of a liquid than a gel - maybe it had been on the shelf too long?</li>

            <li> Works for me. Have been using it for years. Plan to continue. Easy to order and takes a couple of days. Ed Cummins Jr</li>
            <li> It treats my hair the way I want it. I just wish it were more available.</li>
            <li> Only hiar cream I have ever used</li>
            <li> Great buy on hair grooming product that I have bought and used for at least five years years.</li>
            <li> I have used this hair gel for years.  I have found none better to keep your hair in place without that plastered down look.</li>
            <li> have been using this product for more than 15 years I will stick with it</li>
            <li> Great hair product.  Cheaper then buying in local drug store.</li>
            <li> Good price and quick delivery</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> My husband has used this for years and it&#x27;s just not available in stores.</li>
            <li> Package arrived intact. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Reasonable hair groom gel that is hard to find elsewhere</li>
            <li> Always appreciated Protein 29 - don&#x27;t want the &amp;#34;dry fly-away&#x27;s&amp;#34; but definitely not the mousse-type guy with my hair stuck rigidly in one arrangement no matter how hard the wind blows. My hair feels thick, health, and comb-able. Suddenly, couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere - gels were the only items left on the men&#x27;s hair care counters I checked. Really frustrating until I realized you can get anything, anything on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Try it and you will not use any other brand. Use to use a little dab will do you, but never again</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite and he had been using something he didn&#x27;t care for since Walgreens stopped carrying this in the store.  So happy to have found it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Protein 29 since I was a teenager. I&#x27;m now approaching seventy and still have a full head of hair. Don&#x27;t know if the Protein 29 is the reason but I&#x27;m not going to stop using it. I&#x27;ve been buying it from Amazon as I can no longer find it locally. Great product.</li>
            <li> Holds well. Not greasy. My first choice for hair grooming.</li>
            <li> same great product from 100 years ago and unavailable in any drugstore</li>
            <li> Was a little watery coming out of the tube. Not the usual consistency. If you buy this in the store, it comes out as a semi-solid gel. This leads me to wonder if it has been watered down. The watery substance does not go as far or last as long.  Revised comments: Previous order was watery substance--not much like a gel. Most recent order is perfect--exactly as it should be. I&#x27;m glad they have fixed this problem.</li>
