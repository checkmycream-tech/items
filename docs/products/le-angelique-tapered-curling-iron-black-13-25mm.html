            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It gets hot fast and creates the most beautiful waves.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>Beautiful curls that last all day.</li>
            <li>My hair fine and is shoulder length, just so you know.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and I love the tapered design.  </li>
            <li>This iron definitely was a great buy.</li>
            <li>but the end result is fun curly hair!  </li>
            <li>Great iron to create those beachy loose waves!</li>
            <li>but it was pretty easy to pick up how to use it.</li>
            <li>It is great quality and gets very hot, but the iron is thinner than I expected and makes my curls a bit tighter than I wanted.  </li>
            <li>other than that, great quality curling iron</li>
            <li>and it came quickly</li>
            <li>It was delivered quickly as well.</li>
            <li>Super Duper curls/waves.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and gets very hot.</li>
            <li>Cute little spiral curls and the back looked great!</li>
            <li>It gets hot really fast and makes cute curls.</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to create waves of different sizes with one tool.</li>
            <li>If you use larger chunks of hair, it still looks nice</li>
            <li>shipped super fast!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient to use and the curl holds pretty well.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I am a cosmetologist and this wand gets so much use!</li>
            <li>Works so well, surprised it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>It is like a baseball barrel instead of a flat top.  </li>
            <li>the heat setting heats up pretty in a short time, which is good, instead of taking FOREVER before you can actual do your hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to curl all my hair since the curls cover any straight hair that I miss.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>It comes with a real glove to protect your hands from burns.</li>
            <li>The curl looks like a unique spiral that stays in all day and into the next day!</li>
            <li>/&gt;But when I saw this curling iron on sale for $40.00 when it&#x27;s normally $200.00, my shopaholic kicked in and I had to buy it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly love the way my curls come out , I think I bought a barrel too small for my super long hair (its at my nipples adam and eve style) but I am giving it 5 stars for the quality and the heat, it heats fast and curls well.</li>
            <li>It took a little getting used to because it&#x27;s not like most curling irons, but it only took me about 40 minutes to do my whole head...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;m pretty low maintenance and never do anything with my hair.</li>
            <li>The curls next day are a little loose but still nice !</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used much of it yet, but only tried it.</li>
            <li>And so far, it does the job.</li>
            <li>I bought this exact Le Angelique curling iron but in pink.</li>
            <li>Anyway, no regrets.</li>
            <li>when i would let go of my hair to release, it wouldnt jist slide right off like it does w/ other wands, and thats only because of the shape &amp; position i was holding it (skinny end up, wider end down).</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve owned curling iron before but never really used them because my hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl</li>
            <li> and I can never successfully curl the back of my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> quit a few times because I got too cocky and stopped wearing the heat protective glove</li>

            <li> This is a great curling iron for every day use.  It heats up quickly and I love the tapered design.  The cord is a great length and is very hefty.  The switch is in a bit of a tricky spot, but this applies to most curling irons.  The price is a bargain for a curling iron of this type.</li>
            <li> This is probably a great quality wand but I just find a regular curling iron easier to use.</li>
            <li> I love this curling wand. I purchased it on 06/2011 and it came quickly and I started using it immediately. It came with a glove which protects my hands perfectly, even when I hold the hair on to the wand itself. I don&#x27;t even have to curl all my hair since the curls cover any straight hair that I miss. I get tons of complements all the time when I curl my hair with the wand. It heats up quickly and gets very hot. I don&#x27;t put mouse, hair spray, or anything in my hair and it stays all day. When I wake up after sleeping on the curls, it still is curly without any product! I&#x27;m going to buy more wands for my sisters, nieces, and mom as Christmas gifts. I LOVE IT! The best thing about it is that the wand is skinny at the top and wider at the bottom, making it so your hair does not slip off. My hair fine and is shoulder length, just so you know. If you are looking for a curling wand, this is the one to chose. It&#x27;s inexpensive, ships quickly, and works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most perfect curl for my daughter&#x27;s hair! I have been looking for something like it but haven&#x27;t found anything great. I am a hair stylist and it will be great for my clients too. The curl looks like a unique spiral that stays in all day and into the next day! Includes a glove.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used much of it yet, but only tried it. And so far, it does the job. It&#x27;s convenient to use and the curl holds pretty well. Anyway, no regrets.</li>
            <li> I love the shape of curls it makes. I also use it to curl just the ends of my hair. I like that it includes the glove and hair clips. I can recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron. Includes a great glove so your hand doesn&#x27;t burn. Caution! It gets really hot. I had to practice but the end result is fun curly hair!  Must have :)</li>
            <li> My hairstylist used this on my hair and I fell in love with the waves and curls it created. I bought it the next day and I haven&#x27;t been happier. I have never used a wand before but it was pretty easy to pick up how to use it. Great iron to create those beachy loose waves!</li>
            <li> I bought this exact Le Angelique curling iron but in pink. I bought it after I saw a tutorial video on YouTube where the girl used this curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;m pretty low maintenance and never do anything with my hair. I&#x27;ve owned curling iron before but never really used them because my hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl and I can never successfully curl the back of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when I saw this curling iron on sale for $40.00 when it&#x27;s normally $200.00, my shopaholic kicked in and I had to buy it. And man I&#x27;m so glad I did! My hair looked ADORABLE! Cute little spiral curls and the back looked great! It took a little getting used to because it&#x27;s not like most curling irons, but it only took me about 40 minutes to do my whole head... but I know I will get faster over time. The curls also lasted for 3 days!!! I was so happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must mention that I did burn myself quit a few times because I got too cocky and stopped wearing the heat protective glove haha. It comes with the glove for a reason, so wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely LOVE this curling iron and I will be curling my hair a lot now that it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is amazing!! Makes the best wavy curls and I&#x27;ve gone thru lots of irons. Amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> I love the look this reverse barrel curling wand gives! Great packaging also and it included the protective glove. It was delivered quickly as well. It met all my expectations.</li>
            <li> GREATT CURLING IRON! It gets hot really fast and makes cute curls. The wand is different from the picture. It is like a baseball barrel instead of a flat top.  That is the only con.</li>
            <li> This iron definitely was a great buy. It gets hot fast and creates the most beautiful waves. Definitely a must have. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love love love this iron. It does not have adjustable temperature so its baseline is hotter than the surface of the sun. You do have to watch your fingers! The shape of this iron gives a very natural, lived in wave with serious lasting power. I love how easy it is to create waves of different sizes with one tool.</li>
            <li> Super Duper curls/waves.  I am a cosmetologist and this wand gets so much use!</li>
            <li> shipped super fast! the heat setting heats up pretty in a short time, which is good, instead of taking FOREVER before you can actual do your hair. i thought the reverse-taper shape of this curling wand would give a really unique effect, and it definately did, but for me it was slightly difficult to use in gettig your hair OFF the iron when its done curling. when i would let go of my hair to release, it wouldnt jist slide right off like it does w/ other wands, and thats only because of the shape &amp; position i was holding it (skinny end up, wider end down). other than that, great quality curling iron</li>
            <li> It is great quality and gets very hot, but the iron is thinner than I expected and makes my curls a bit tighter than I wanted.  If you use larger chunks of hair, it still looks nice but next time I would buy a thicker barrel.</li>
            <li> Beautiful curls that last all day. The curls next day are a little loose but still nice ! Love this - i get many compliments after I curl my hair w this wand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly love the way my curls come out , I think I bought a barrel too small for my super long hair (its at my nipples adam and eve style) but I am giving it 5 stars for the quality and the heat, it heats fast and curls well.</li>
            <li> I got it on time and I love it. It gives your hair beautiful curls:)&lt;br /&gt;I told my friends to get it as well</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this iron. It comes with a real glove to protect your hands from burns.</li>
            <li> OOMG AMMMMMAZING. Works so well, surprised it was so cheap.</li>
