            <li>After sunning it is nice to use.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best moisturizer ever!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the smell either, I actually kind of like it.</li>
            <li>I really liked the product, I use it after I&#x27;ve tanned &amp; showered to keep the scalley skin away...</li>
            <li>but after awhile of using I really liked it and could tell a differnce in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturising &amp; the scent is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>even if you don&#x27;t tan its a nice lotion.</li>
            <li>This really is the best lotion.</li>
            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice, light smell to it.</li>
            <li>It smells good but not girly or too strong.  </li>
            <li>The price is very good on Amazon, it is a large bottle.</li>
            <li>I purchased this along with designer skin tan intensifier because it was cheap and reviews were good.</li>
            <li>this moisturizer works great to hydrate skin after being exposed to a tanning bed or a long day in the sun and smells really good too!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to smell like fruit, and I don&#x27;t like to smell like flowers, and pears aren&#x27;t exactly known for their great odor.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light though so those with extremly-dry skin might need something heavier.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the sent is very light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and feel of this lotion.</li>
            <li>the smell was so refreshing, yummy, and eleghant.</li>
            <li>and the smell is sexy.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>This lotion is my favorite of all time.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Angel.</li>
            <li>and I am in love.</li>
            <li>Just thought I would mention don&#x27;t let that stop you from buying this fabulous product!</li>
            <li>Most scented lotions I cant use because it irritates my skin and causes breakouts.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion, and even though a splurge, I continually purchase it.  </li>
            <li>And I just LOVE the scent.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that Amazon carries this lotion because it&#x27;s very moisturizing because of the hemp seed oil, avocado oil, and Vitamin A, E, and C.  </li>
            <li>I love the Kiwi Pear fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Nice light scent, doesnt seem greasy...</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>Not the cheapest, but not terrible.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have been able to use this lotion and not feel sticky.</li>
            <li>I love this product and was so glad that I was even able to find it so cheap!</li>
            <li>Much better price than the tanning salon in my town.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great product</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for after tanning for many years and I love the smell and</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s a pretty nice size bottle!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, but didn&#x27;t realize that it had paraben in it...</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion of all time .</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>Love all Designer skin products.</li>
            <li>Glad to have some again.</li>
            <li>I love to use it 2 times a day....</li>
            <li>Great price and fast delivery</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>High quality lotion and has a great &amp;#34;peary&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I first got a sample packet of this lotion from my tanning salon, I LOVED the product</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years, I used to buy it at a salon, it is outstanding, smells great, and makes your body, so soft.</li>
            <li>Very true to description.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, keeps skin soo soft.</li>
            <li>The lotion is a really good moisturizer for the whole body.</li>
            <li>It is not oily or greasy, and it dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly into my skin too.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky, has a great refreshing smell, and it&#x27;s a very big bottle.</li>
            <li>I received it very quickly also.</li>
            <li>but still think this is a great moisturizer and was thrilled to be able to purchase it from Amazon for less that</li>
            <li>I have loved this lotion since I was in high school.  </li>
            <li>The lotion itself is fine but the pump does not work</li>
            <li>Also, the lotion has the perfect consistency, not too heavy or light, and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I just tried using the Angel Kiwi body lotion because it was free with my lotion purchase and so far I am SUPER happy with it.</li>
            <li>and so I now use this and love it Justas much!!</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin great leaving my skin feel the same.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth</li>
            <li>It was smooth and not greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>Oh and forgot to add that they added a free sample to my order</li>
            <li>Smells fabulous</li>
            <li>All of their lotions are fabulous</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough great things about this lotion.</li>
            <li>The lotion does go on smooth, but the fragrance is light and fades before I leave the house after applying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and does the trick.</li>
            <li>, they wrapped it in case the pump opened, and I even got a FREE sample packet from Pauly D&#x27;s line,</li>
            <li>Great for someone who spends extra time in the sun.</li>
            <li>I love the fruity smell and the way it soaks right into my skin without leaving it feeling greasy at all.</li>
            <li>It smells great - a clean slightly fruity smell but not at all overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>(I originally bought a bottle from tanning salon /</li>
            <li>After I use this I always feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I wish it smelled better but other than that it was a good purchase</li>
            <li>Make skin soft and smell nice</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone who wants hydrated skin with a light fragrance!</li>
            <li>It was really sweet and fruity</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you dont have spend forever rubbing the lotion it because it absorbs really well almost immediately.</li>
            <li>If raters here love this lotion, they really need to try Juicy and be blown away.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and doesn&#x27;t linger or interfere with my perfume, but nice enough I enjoy putting it on.</li>
            <li>I love the smell but it does not moisturize very well, even compared to store bought lotion.</li>
            <li>Smells great, and very inexpensive for a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Angel absorbs into your skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li>It has such a nice light scent that lasts.</li>
            <li>A light scented after tanning lotion that works great, leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft all day long.  </li>
            <li>, my tan seems to be lasting longer, it smells fabulous, great for guy or girl, it dries pretty fast, and doesn&#x27;t make you look oily or greasy.</li>
            <li>It is nice and thick and makes you feel like an ANGEL.It is my most favorite moisturizer to use</li>
            <li>Thank you - exactly as promised.!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any more dry patches.:)</li>
            <li>I purchased this item for after tanning in an indoor bed, it has an amazing scent and it keeps my skin healthy and firm.</li>
            <li>Smells great, and it&#x27;s not too heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion is by far my favorite ever.</li>
            <li>The smell is so fresh.</li>
            <li>Not overpowering, but simple and nice.  </li>
            <li>It is thick, makes your skin look healthy, and smells good, too.  </li>
            <li>Fresh and fruity.</li>
            <li>I use it fresh out of the shower and after tanning</li>
            <li>thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li>It is a great deal considering how big the bottle is and it was shipped within a reasonable amount of time, but I had high expectations for the scent</li>
            <li>and you will find you still have lotion in the bottle stuck to the sides or right at the mouth of the bottle that wont come out</li>
            <li>or if you just want that just right moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Not sure, but the seller was great about returning</li>
            <li>At first I did not know if it was worth the price I paid</li>
            <li>The plain kind I would suggest for a man!</li>
            <li>I even used it on my face, it&#x27;s made with hemp and super gentle.</li>
            <li>Also, ships very fast.</li>
            <li>Spreads on smooth leaving your skin feeling angel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky or too oily like most are, i use it all the time and it helps my tan last longer</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to smell better than that, and it definitely doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I first fell for the smell</li>
            <li>Keeps skin looking young and smooth.</li>
            <li>Australian Gold (Forever After or Kisses, IMO, are way better moisturizers.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice but not overwhelming very fresh smelling to me</li>
            <li>The thing I like about this is that the scent fades pretty quickly but for some reason it lightly lingers on my clothes for several days.</li>
            <li>Everyone always asks why my skin is so soft and the this is the trick!!!!</li>
            <li>A very nice moistorizing lotion that is long lasting yet</li>
            <li>this smells so good and much cheaper than the salons.i use it everyday</li>
            <li>When you first put it on, you are expecting it to feel super greasy, but then it just soaks in and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>and I have never had a positive test.</li>
            <li>Used this product in the past and it was reall good on my skin.</li>
            <li>Great lotion that I previously could only find at tanning salons.</li>
            <li>It smelled decent!</li>
            <li>but it really moisturizes your skin really well</li>
            <li>The price can&#x27;t be beat here, a salon charged my three times as much.</li>
            <li>Real deal Just like their products..</li>
            <li>I also notice it really helping contain the acne on my face.</li>
            <li>And much cheaper than buying it in the tanning salon</li>
            <li>Very soothing to skin.</li>
            <li>I have always wanted this body lotion; thanks for amazon for carrying this product...</li>
            <li>Overall a good value purchased through amazon vs my local tanning salon but product is not as long lasting as I had hopped but still a good deal and would purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li>I also use it in the winter when my skin tends to get a little dry and discovered it worked great and didn&#x27;t leave a sticky feel like some moisturizers did.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years and will continue to use it as long as it is still available.  </li>
            <li>When you first put it on, it feels greasy but after about a minute, it completely absorbs.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and leaves my skin so silky and the moisture lasts all day long!</li>
            <li>I could have gotten my husband his own bottle and the lotion I spent A $100 on and had money left over to get hair done or</li>
            <li>The reviews I read prior to finally making my decision to purchase this lotion are what influenced me the most.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It has such a sweet smell leaving your skin soo soft.</li>
            <li>nice, thick lotion...would buy again</li>
            <li>This product lasts a long time and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I live by this lotion!!&lt;br /&gt;Wheter you tan or just like using body lotion</li>
            <li>Well this is my second time to order this product so that tell anyone that I like the product very much.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I used the blue bottle at first, then they stopped making it</li>
            <li>I use it every day, it goes in soft and smooth and leaves behind a light scent.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and does not feel the least bit greasy.  </li>
            <li>My only problem is I do not think it does a whole lot of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Also, it leaves my skin really soft.</li>
            <li>It works well for my sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li>it was old?  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product  and feel that it makes my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft and burnt skin smell away.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft and keeps the tan for longer.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my skin baby soft</li>
            <li>I use this year round, found it on Amazon at a Good price ordered a few as Christmas Gifts</li>
            <li>I live in central Tennessee where the humidity is high</li>
            <li>but I wanted to let other people know that Forever After is less in price and MUCH better, especially if you are an avid tanner like myself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is soft, thick, and has a gentle scent it will soak right into your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will never use another body lotion as long as I live!</li>
            <li>The kiwi pear scent is a fairly light scent compared to other brands I have used, and thankfully, the scent doesn&#x27;t last too long.  </li>
            <li>Smells fresh and even wakes my skin up a little in the morning!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it several times after getting a little too much sun and not only did is soothe the burn but also kept me from peeling.</li>

            <li> This is absolutely the best moisturizer ever!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell either, I actually kind of like it.</li>
            <li> I really liked the product, I use it after I&#x27;ve tanned &amp; showered to keep the scalley skin away...</li>
            <li> but after awhile of using I really liked it and could tell a differnce in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturising &amp; the scent is wonderful!  </li>
            <li> even if you don&#x27;t tan its a nice lotion.</li>
            <li> This really is the best lotion.</li>
            <li> Nice smell.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice, light smell to it.</li>
            <li> It smells good but not girly or too strong.  </li>
            <li> The price is very good on Amazon, it is a large bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with designer skin tan intensifier because it was cheap and reviews were good.</li>
            <li> this moisturizer works great to hydrate skin after being exposed to a tanning bed or a long day in the sun and smells really good too!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to smell like fruit, and I don&#x27;t like to smell like flowers, and pears aren&#x27;t exactly known for their great odor.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light though so those with extremly-dry skin might need something heavier.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the sent is very light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feel of this lotion.</li>
            <li> the smell was so refreshing, yummy, and eleghant.</li>
            <li> and the smell is sexy.</li>

            <li> This lotion is my favorite of all time.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Angel.</li>
            <li> and I am in love.</li>
            <li> Just thought I would mention don&#x27;t let that stop you from buying this fabulous product!</li>
            <li> Most scented lotions I cant use because it irritates my skin and causes breakouts.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion, and even though a splurge, I continually purchase it.  </li>
            <li> And I just LOVE the scent.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that Amazon carries this lotion because it&#x27;s very moisturizing because of the hemp seed oil, avocado oil, and Vitamin A, E, and C.  </li>
            <li> I love the Kiwi Pear fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Nice light scent, doesnt seem greasy...</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Not the cheapest, but not terrible.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been able to use this lotion and not feel sticky.</li>
            <li> I love this product and was so glad that I was even able to find it so cheap!</li>
            <li> Much better price than the tanning salon in my town.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for after tanning for many years and I love the smell and</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s a pretty nice size bottle!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, but didn&#x27;t realize that it had paraben in it...</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion of all time .</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> Love all Designer skin products.</li>
            <li> Glad to have some again.</li>
            <li> I love to use it 2 times a day....</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> High quality lotion and has a great &amp;#34;peary&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I first got a sample packet of this lotion from my tanning salon, I LOVED the product</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, I used to buy it at a salon, it is outstanding, smells great, and makes your body, so soft.</li>
            <li> Very true to description.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, keeps skin soo soft.</li>
            <li> The lotion is a really good moisturizer for the whole body.</li>
            <li> It is not oily or greasy, and it dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly into my skin too.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky, has a great refreshing smell, and it&#x27;s a very big bottle.</li>
            <li> I received it very quickly also.</li>
            <li> but still think this is a great moisturizer and was thrilled to be able to purchase it from Amazon for less that</li>
            <li> I have loved this lotion since I was in high school.  </li>
            <li> The lotion itself is fine but the pump does not work</li>
            <li> Also, the lotion has the perfect consistency, not too heavy or light, and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I just tried using the Angel Kiwi body lotion because it was free with my lotion purchase and so far I am SUPER happy with it.</li>
            <li> and so I now use this and love it Justas much!!</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin great leaving my skin feel the same.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth</li>
            <li> It was smooth and not greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> Oh and forgot to add that they added a free sample to my order</li>
            <li> Smells fabulous</li>
            <li> All of their lotions are fabulous</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough great things about this lotion.</li>
            <li> The lotion does go on smooth, but the fragrance is light and fades before I leave the house after applying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and does the trick.</li>
            <li> , they wrapped it in case the pump opened, and I even got a FREE sample packet from Pauly D&#x27;s line,</li>
            <li> Great for someone who spends extra time in the sun.</li>
            <li> I love the fruity smell and the way it soaks right into my skin without leaving it feeling greasy at all.</li>
            <li> It smells great - a clean slightly fruity smell but not at all overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> (I originally bought a bottle from tanning salon /</li>
            <li> After I use this I always feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I wish it smelled better but other than that it was a good purchase</li>
            <li> Make skin soft and smell nice</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone who wants hydrated skin with a light fragrance!</li>
            <li> It was really sweet and fruity</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you dont have spend forever rubbing the lotion it because it absorbs really well almost immediately.</li>
            <li> If raters here love this lotion, they really need to try Juicy and be blown away.</li>
            <li> The smell is light and doesn&#x27;t linger or interfere with my perfume, but nice enough I enjoy putting it on.</li>
            <li> I love the smell but it does not moisturize very well, even compared to store bought lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and very inexpensive for a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Angel absorbs into your skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li> It has such a nice light scent that lasts.</li>
            <li> A light scented after tanning lotion that works great, leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft all day long.  </li>
            <li> , my tan seems to be lasting longer, it smells fabulous, great for guy or girl, it dries pretty fast, and doesn&#x27;t make you look oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> It is nice and thick and makes you feel like an ANGEL.It is my most favorite moisturizer to use</li>
            <li> Thank you - exactly as promised.!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any more dry patches.:)</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for after tanning in an indoor bed, it has an amazing scent and it keeps my skin healthy and firm.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and it&#x27;s not too heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion is by far my favorite ever.</li>
            <li> The smell is so fresh.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering, but simple and nice.  </li>
            <li> It is thick, makes your skin look healthy, and smells good, too.  </li>
            <li> Fresh and fruity.</li>
            <li> I use it fresh out of the shower and after tanning</li>
            <li> thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> It is a great deal considering how big the bottle is and it was shipped within a reasonable amount of time, but I had high expectations for the scent</li>
            <li> and you will find you still have lotion in the bottle stuck to the sides or right at the mouth of the bottle that wont come out</li>
            <li> or if you just want that just right moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Not sure, but the seller was great about returning</li>
            <li> At first I did not know if it was worth the price I paid</li>
            <li> The plain kind I would suggest for a man!</li>
            <li> I even used it on my face, it&#x27;s made with hemp and super gentle.</li>
            <li> Also, ships very fast.</li>
            <li> Spreads on smooth leaving your skin feeling angel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky or too oily like most are, i use it all the time and it helps my tan last longer</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to smell better than that, and it definitely doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I first fell for the smell</li>
            <li> Keeps skin looking young and smooth.</li>
            <li> Australian Gold (Forever After or Kisses, IMO, are way better moisturizers.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice but not overwhelming very fresh smelling to me</li>
            <li> The thing I like about this is that the scent fades pretty quickly but for some reason it lightly lingers on my clothes for several days.</li>
            <li> Everyone always asks why my skin is so soft and the this is the trick!!!!</li>
            <li> A very nice moistorizing lotion that is long lasting yet</li>
            <li> this smells so good and much cheaper than the salons.i use it everyday</li>
            <li> When you first put it on, you are expecting it to feel super greasy, but then it just soaks in and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> and I have never had a positive test.</li>
            <li> Used this product in the past and it was reall good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Great lotion that I previously could only find at tanning salons.</li>
            <li> It smelled decent!</li>
            <li> but it really moisturizes your skin really well</li>
            <li> The price can&#x27;t be beat here, a salon charged my three times as much.</li>
            <li> Real deal Just like their products..</li>
            <li> I also notice it really helping contain the acne on my face.</li>
            <li> And much cheaper than buying it in the tanning salon</li>
            <li> Very soothing to skin.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted this body lotion; thanks for amazon for carrying this product...</li>
            <li> Overall a good value purchased through amazon vs my local tanning salon but product is not as long lasting as I had hopped but still a good deal and would purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> I also use it in the winter when my skin tends to get a little dry and discovered it worked great and didn&#x27;t leave a sticky feel like some moisturizers did.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and will continue to use it as long as it is still available.  </li>
            <li> When you first put it on, it feels greasy but after about a minute, it completely absorbs.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth and leaves my skin so silky and the moisture lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> I could have gotten my husband his own bottle and the lotion I spent A $100 on and had money left over to get hair done or</li>
            <li> The reviews I read prior to finally making my decision to purchase this lotion are what influenced me the most.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It has such a sweet smell leaving your skin soo soft.</li>
            <li> nice, thick lotion...would buy again</li>
            <li> This product lasts a long time and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I live by this lotion!!&lt;br /&gt;Wheter you tan or just like using body lotion</li>
            <li> Well this is my second time to order this product so that tell anyone that I like the product very much.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I used the blue bottle at first, then they stopped making it</li>
            <li> I use it every day, it goes in soft and smooth and leaves behind a light scent.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and does not feel the least bit greasy.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is I do not think it does a whole lot of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Also, it leaves my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> It works well for my sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> it was old?  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product  and feel that it makes my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft and burnt skin smell away.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and keeps the tan for longer.</li>
            <li> and it keeps my skin baby soft</li>
            <li> I use this year round, found it on Amazon at a Good price ordered a few as Christmas Gifts</li>
            <li> I live in central Tennessee where the humidity is high</li>
            <li> but I wanted to let other people know that Forever After is less in price and MUCH better, especially if you are an avid tanner like myself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is soft, thick, and has a gentle scent it will soak right into your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will never use another body lotion as long as I live!</li>
            <li> The kiwi pear scent is a fairly light scent compared to other brands I have used, and thankfully, the scent doesn&#x27;t last too long.  </li>
            <li> Smells fresh and even wakes my skin up a little in the morning!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times after getting a little too much sun and not only did is soothe the burn but also kept me from peeling.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the pump doesn&#x27;t always work and when I get a dry spot on my body, it takes days for this lotion to make it not dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty hard to find these days- except online.</li>
            <li> Its so silky and works well on my skin which is prone to red dry patches.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t quite compare to other post tan lotions I&#x27;ve bought, but I like it as a general moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff a long time ago when I went to the tanning salon...</li>
            <li> I just spent $100 on and left without a moisterizer I got on the web and found out</li>
            <li> and I usually have enough to last me another several days!</li>
            <li> Besides that, I would recommend this product to anyone with mildly dry skin or dry skin from tanning.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> I had to keep applying throughout the day whereas with the other two products I&#x27;ve used in the past 2 months, I only had to apply once or twice for ultimate moisture.</li>
            <li> and it will go a long way!!!</li>
            <li> Then ran out and never really thought about it again...</li>
            <li> after I shower,during the day,and whenever my skin feels rough.....</li>
            <li> Although people will see it has hemp in it , I can assure you that I have been drug tested a few times because I am in the medical field</li>
            <li> but they closed.</li>
            <li> and I usually buy only unscented products.</li>
            <li> I had my lotion within a few days of ordering, I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a long time but nowhere in my town sells it anymore.</li>
            <li> but I always put on twice but would buy it again and recommend to other s</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this stuff a long time ago when I went to the tanning salon... Then ran out and never really thought about it again... Last summer I went to Florida and wanted to get brown before I went... and so I bought this because its a great lotion to moisturize your skin... And it smells great :)</li>
            <li> wonderful lotion!!!  Smells great and absorbs into the skin making it feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> Make skin soft and smell nice</li>
            <li> A light scented after tanning lotion that works great, leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft all day long.  The kiwi pear scent is a fairly light scent compared to other brands I have used, and thankfully, the scent doesn&#x27;t last too long.  Also, the lotion has the perfect consistency, not too heavy or light, and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This is the third time we have bought this.  Love the smell and feel of this lotion.</li>
            <li> Well this is my second time to order this product so that tell anyone that I like the product very much. It absorbs into the skin great leaving my skin feel the same.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is fine but the pump does not work so I have to shake it out of the bottle in order to use it.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and very inexpensive for a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have bought this twice already from my tanning salon! It is the best lotion to put on after tanning. Not only does it keep your tan longer but it really moisturizes your skin really well and it smells great too! The only downside is the pump doesnt reach all the way to the bottom as you start getting low so it doesnt work anymore. You have to take the pump out and remove the lotion from the bottle on your own!   Added Tip: Always cut your bottles in half when you think you are out and you will find you still have lotion in the bottle stuck to the sides or right at the mouth of the bottle that wont come out and I usually have enough to last me another several days!</li>
            <li> this moisturizer works great to hydrate skin after being exposed to a tanning bed or a long day in the sun and smells really good too!</li>
            <li> I positively love this stuff! It goes on smooth, I don&#x27;t feel \\&quot;suffocated\\&quot;, it&#x27;s not greasy - it&#x27;s just perfect for all season moisturizing, whether I&#x27;m tanning or not. The only reason I&#x27;m unable to give this product 5 stars is because of the smell. I don&#x27;t like to smell like fruit, and I don&#x27;t like to smell like flowers, and pears aren&#x27;t exactly known for their great odor.</li>
            <li> I have been indoor tanning for 7years. I had purchasedthis product for several reasons. The salon only had two to choose from, I had took notice that the salon could not keep this item on the shelves, and last.... the smell was so refreshing, yummy, and eleghant. It was a must have. I had bought it that day i tried it @ the salon. by day 2, very impressed. does moisture ur skin, if you are red. it takes the sunburn away, it does all thatit saysit will do. got mygirlfriends buying the product too . We all LOVE THIS ANGEL!!!!!! GREAT STUFF.... and the smell is sexy.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy, sticky feeling on my skin. It makes my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> This lotion is my favorite of all time.  It smells great - a clean slightly fruity smell but not at all overwhelming.  It goes on very smooth and does not feel the least bit greasy.  It&#x27;s very light though so those with extremly-dry skin might need something heavier. Supposedly it&#x27;s designed for after-tanning, but I don&#x27;t tan and use it as my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Used thousands of lotions through my life. This lotion is by far my favorite ever. For The last 8 yrs, every night, after I shower. I get a glow (not shimmer) with this lotion. The smell is so fresh.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion!  A very nice moistorizing lotion that is long lasting yet not too strong scented makes this lotion a great buy with the amount that is in the bottle, as according to the price.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended. The shipping was fast and this is one of the best lotions I have ever used. It has such a sweet smell leaving your skin soo soft. You won&#x27;t be disappointed at ALL.</li>
            <li> I live by this lotion!!&lt;br /&gt;Wheter you tan or just like using body lotion this is the lotion that you need.&lt;br /&gt;It is soft, thick, and has a gentle scent it will soak right into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;all you need is a little dab and it will go a long way!!!</li>
            <li> This product was used after tanning and daily to hold skin color!!! Loved it!  It was smooth and not greasy feeling.  The light pear fragrance is wonderful. I would recommend to anyone who wants hydrated skin with a light fragrance! [[ASIN:B000SDI6MI Designer Skin Angel Kiwi Pear Body Lotion 20 Oz Tanning]]</li>
            <li> Smells great and does an excellent job of moisturizing! The price can&#x27;t be beat here, a salon charged my three times as much.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion. My only problem is I do not think it does a whole lot of moisturizing. After sunning it is nice to use. Though I wont be using it 2 times a day as it says on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Phantasmagorical. I&#x27;m obsessed with this lotion, the smell and how soft it makes your skin. I even used it on my face, it&#x27;s made with hemp and super gentle. Plus it&#x27;s way cheaper on here than at stupid tanning salons. You can use it after tanning or after the shower or anytime. I got a small to go lotion bottle from the dollar section at Fred Meyer and always have it with me for my hands. Great lotion!!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I have ordered it over and over for years now.</li>
            <li> Overall a good value purchased through amazon vs my local tanning salon but product is not as long lasting as I had hopped but still a good deal and would purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> This lotion is my favorite and my husband also uses it which is a bonus because he feels as great as I do.. However I moved down south and could not find it anywhere and when I did they wanted $30&lt;br /&gt;Just like the bottle I just spent $100 on and left without a moisterizer I got on the web and found out I could have gotten my husband his own bottle and the lotion I spent A $100 on and had money left over to get hair done or whatever.. Huh I will ALWAYS!! make my purchases from sunless liquidators from now on.. Oh and forgot to add that they added a free sample to my order thanks so much!!! Real deal Just like their products.. Very Very Happy cant wait to get the next best lotion for 70% plus off the salon prices..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for 4 yrs now! Wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else !!!! Feels sooo good and smooth !!!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best moisturizer ever! and smells very nice, too. I use it every day, even when I&#x27;m not tanning.  Also, ships very fast.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell. It was really sweet and fruity but then it grew on me. The thing I like about this is that the scent fades pretty quickly but for some reason it lightly lingers on my clothes for several days. Also, it leaves my skin really soft. When you first put it on, it feels greasy but after about a minute, it completely absorbs. You don&#x27;t even have to wash your hands after using it. The only downside is that it is pretty expensive. Besides that, I would recommend this product to anyone with mildly dry skin or dry skin from tanning.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin moisturized &amp; great smell.  Not overpowering, but simple and nice.  I use this moisturizer on my face as well. I&#x27;m 18, and have acne (not intense but a few zits here and there.) This doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.  Definitely recommend to all age groups.  My mom loves it too, and she&#x27;s 45.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for 3 years and this is the worst product I have ever used and I will never use it again</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion!! I use it everyday and have for years. I used the blue bottle at first, then they stopped making it and so I now use this and love it Justas much!!</li>
            <li> I am a guy, therefore I do not like lotion, but I needed something to put on after tanning to make my tan last longer and this lotion is the answer.  It is not oily or greasy, and it dries very quickly.  It smells good but not girly or too strong.  The only lotion i will use.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Angel.It is nice and thick and makes you feel like an ANGEL.It is my most favorite moisturizer to use after I shower,during the day,and whenever my skin feels rough.....I always have it with me.</li>
            <li> This product has a light scent, wonderful aroma of kiwi and pear. Not greasy, even after sweating. Spreads on smooth leaving your skin feeling angel soft and moisturized. I give this product 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> This lotion keeps you nice and moisturized! It Smells amazing also! I am definitely going to purchase this lotion again</li>
            <li> I am going to Mexico and I am taking this with me. my mom told me about it and I received it and I am in love. Smells fabulous and I recommend it to all you sun bathers!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0017728SM Designer Skin Angel Daily Moisturizer 20 Oz.]]This lotion I have been using for years, it is light weight and non greasy, and smells wonderful but not over powering I use it on my face every morning and it is perfect before makeup or if you just want that just right moisturizer. Although people will see it has hemp in it , I can assure you that I have been drug tested a few times because I am in the medical field and I have never had a positive test. Just thought I would mention don&#x27;t let that stop you from buying this fabulous product! All of their lotions are fabulous I have tried them all !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very,very Nice!Great Item&#x3D;Great Seller+Fast Shipping+Great Communication.Thank U</li>
            <li> This smells awesome. It doesn&#x27;t quite compare to other post tan lotions I&#x27;ve bought, but I like it as a general moisturizer. It works well for my sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li> I have loved this lotion for years. I used to get it at the tanning salon that I went to but they closed. I couldnt find it anywhere because it was sold there under Hemptation, my guess is that is the label they put on it for their store. Anyway, the sent is very light and refreshing. I love the fact that you dont have spend forever rubbing the lotion it because it absorbs really well almost immediately. I have very sensitive skin and this has never bothered me or cause any breakouts from using it. Most scented lotions I cant use because it irritates my skin and causes breakouts.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion, and even though a splurge, I continually purchase it.  It is thick, makes your skin look healthy, and smells good, too.  It is firming and is supposed to extend the life of your tan - I use it all the time, even when not tanning and have great results.</li>
            <li> It smelled decent! The plain kind I would suggest for a man! I got both! But i gave the fruity one away!</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent - even a man can use without feeling girly.  My wife and I tan and use before and afterwards.  Thicker so it does cover a lot of territory.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product abc transaction</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough great things about this lotion. My skin has never felt softer! I don&#x27;t mind the smell either, I actually kind of like it. Angel absorbs into your skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts. You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Love love love this Lotion!!! Everyone always asks why my skin is so soft and the this is the trick!!!!</li>
            <li> It has good scent.&lt;br /&gt;I buy this through international carrier..&lt;br /&gt;5 out of 10 girls asked what the name of product is.&lt;br /&gt;Guess just kills it in Korea region ha</li>
            <li> Sealed Lotions vendor describes this as a Thierry Mugler product and it is NOT.  This description is deceptive, misleading and illegal. Shame on SEALED LOTIONS who describes it as such.</li>
            <li> I will never use another body lotion as long as I live! The scent alone got me hooked! It goes on so smooth and leaves my skin so silky and the moisture lasts all day long! It also preserves my tan so well! I love this stuff! Happy Tanning!</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling silky, not greasy. And I just LOVE the scent. This will definitely be a repeat buy</li>
            <li> A while back, a friend had this lotion and I absolutely LOVED the smell of it, so I&#x27;d been wanting to buy it for some time. I use it every day, it goes in soft and smooth and leaves behind a light scent. It&#x27;s also great to moisturizer to use after tanning as well. I love it.</li>
            <li> Thank you - exactly as promised.!  I adore this lotion, it&#x27;s mildly scented but wonderful if it&#x27;s the only one you are wearing.  Excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really liked the product, I use it after I&#x27;ve tanned &amp; showered to keep the scalley skin away...will but again</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion!  I discovered this when I briefly used tanning beds and purchased it through the tanning salon. I no longer tan but still think this is a great moisturizer and was thrilled to be able to purchase it from Amazon for less that the tanning salon prices. I&#x27;ve used it several times after getting a little too much sun and not only did is soothe the burn but also kept me from peeling. I also use it in the winter when my skin tends to get a little dry and discovered it worked great and didn&#x27;t leave a sticky feel like some moisturizers did.</li>
            <li> High quality lotion and has a great &amp;#34;peary&amp;#34; smell.  I use this especially during the summer--works great as a tan extender.</li>
            <li> The fragrance of this is great (if you like kiwi-pear) but like the bottle recommends, you should apply it twice a day. I&#x27;m not currently tanning, but it IS winter and it seems like I&#x27;m going through a LOT of this to keep my skin hydrated. Not sure I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to have purchased the Angel Kiwi Pear Body Lotion. I&#x27;m happy that Amazon carries this lotion because it&#x27;s very moisturizing because of the hemp seed oil, avocado oil, and Vitamin A, E, and C.  I love the Kiwi Pear fragrance.  This product lasts a long time and absorbs quickly. Love this lotion!</li>
            <li> Nice light scent, doesnt seem greasy...nice, thick lotion...would buy again</li>
            <li> I have owned this lotion before, so I know how it smells. Fresh and fruity. Maybe I it a bad bottle or it was old?  Not sure, but the seller was great about returning</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use this every time after I tan. It helps hold my tan,smells great and keeps my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for after tanning in an indoor bed, it has an amazing scent and it keeps my skin healthy and firm.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have used this before and as always loved it</li>
            <li> I have been using this product  and feel that it makes my skin soft and moisturized. At first I did not know if it was worth the price I paid but after awhile of using I really liked it and could tell a differnce in my skin.  I have been applying to my skin 2 x per day and on occasion have applied 3. (I originally bought a bottle from tanning salon / was recomended by tanning salon for after tanning in tanning beds)&lt;br /&gt; After tanning it seems to hydrate my skin well.  The smell is nice but not overwhelming very fresh smelling to me The price is very good on Amazon, it is a large bottle. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very true to description.  Very moisturising &amp; the scent is wonderful!  Will definitly keep using...even if you don&#x27;t tan its a nice lotion.</li>
            <li> One my favorite lotions! But my daughters found it...</li>
            <li> AMAZING product. Smells great, and it&#x27;s not too heavy on the skin. I used this after tanning, and after the shower because it&#x27;s that good. Leaves my skin feeling soft and burnt skin smell away. I also notice it really helping contain the acne on my face. Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to put on after I got out of the tanning bed and after bathing. It has a very nice, light smell to it. It absorbs very quickly into my skin too. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the pump doesn&#x27;t always work and when I get a dry spot on my body, it takes days for this lotion to make it not dry.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, I used to buy it at a salon, it is outstanding, smells great, and makes your body, so soft.</li>
            <li> I just tried using the Angel Kiwi body lotion because it was free with my lotion purchase and so far I am SUPER happy with it. I am obsessed with the smell, my tan seems to be lasting longer, it smells fabulous, great for guy or girl, it dries pretty fast, and doesn&#x27;t make you look oily or greasy. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave you sticky, has a great refreshing smell, and it&#x27;s a very big bottle. I love this lotion and will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I wish it smelled better but other than that it was a good purchase I would use this product again</li>
            <li> Great lotion that I previously could only find at tanning salons. Smells great, keeps skin soo soft. Not the cheapest, but not terrible. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky or too oily like most are, i use it all the time and it helps my tan last longer</li>
            <li> The reviews I read prior to finally making my decision to purchase this lotion are what influenced me the most. It is a great deal considering how big the bottle is and it was shipped within a reasonable amount of time, but I had high expectations for the scent and I should have just purchased Designer Skin&#x27;s Juicy again. I was expecting it to smell better than that, and it definitely doesn&#x27;t. The lotion does go on smooth, but the fragrance is light and fades before I leave the house after applying. If raters here love this lotion, they really need to try Juicy and be blown away.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with designer skin tan intensifier because it was cheap and reviews were good. I love it. Its so silky and works well on my skin which is prone to red dry patches. It smells wonderful! And the best and most surprising thing about it is that my PICKY husband loves it too. I will be ordering again. I don&#x27;t have any more dry patches.:)</li>
            <li> I first fell for the smell and I usually buy only unscented products. The lotion is a really good moisturizer for the whole body. I live in central Tennessee where the humidity is high and I will tend to shy away from lotion in the summer....and pay the price with dry skin. I have been able to use this lotion and not feel sticky. The smell is light and doesn&#x27;t linger or interfere with my perfume, but nice enough I enjoy putting it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It started over a decade ago when I purchased it as a tan extender from a tanning bed. It&#x27;s pretty hard to find these days- except online. It&#x27;s light weight and does the trick. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I had my lotion within a few days of ordering, I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a long time but nowhere in my town sells it anymore. I love this product and was so glad that I was even able to find it so cheap!</li>
            <li> This is a very good after tanning moisturizing lotion. Much better price than the tanning salon in my town. Smells great!</li>
            <li> I first got a sample packet of this lotion from my tanning salon, I LOVED the product so I HAD to buy it!! It was going for 40.00 dollars at my salon, got a bargain from amazon!! And am I so glad I bought from this seller!! Great shipping (got here in 4 days), they wrapped it in case the pump opened, and I even got a FREE sample packet from Pauly D&#x27;s line, \\&quot;The After Party\\&quot;! If your debating which seller to buy from, DEFINETLY buy from this one!!! Will be back to buy ALL my tanning products from!!!(:</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product</li>
            <li> Oove the scent great moisture skin feels great after applying but I always put on twice but would buy it again and recommend to other s</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and keeps the tan for longer. I only go tanning once or twice a week and it Has kept my tan even if I miss days! Smells fresh and even wakes my skin up a little in the morning!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for after tanning for many years and I love the smell and the way it wakes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I use it everyday after I tan and it goes on great. It doesn&#x27;t stay sticky or thick, it blends into my skin. I will definitely purchase this product again. oh, and the smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This really is the best lotion. I have been using this over the summers for years now. Great for someone who spends extra time in the sun.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best but it smells amazing and get&#x27;s the job done! Also it&#x27;s a pretty nice size bottle!</li>
            <li> I use this year round, found it on Amazon at a Good price ordered a few as Christmas Gifts</li>
            <li> Nice smell. Not too over powering. Works awesome to moisturize skin. I use it fresh out of the shower and after tanning and it keeps my skin baby soft</li>
            <li> this smells so good and much cheaper than the salons.i use it everyday esp after tanning..works great will order again.</li>
            <li> But they need to make it without parabens.  I love this lotion, but didn&#x27;t realize that it had paraben in it...</li>
            <li> Used this product in the past and it was reall good on my skin. It is great for use after indoor tanning. Keeps skin looking young and smooth.</li>
            <li> Always great. Feels great, smells great..... My favorite lotion of all time . And much cheaper than buying it in the tanning salon</li>
            <li> I have recently started tanning and use this to help keep my skin moisturized. I love the fruity smell and the way it soaks right into my skin without leaving it feeling greasy at all. When you first put it on, you are expecting it to feel super greasy, but then it just soaks in and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion. Love all Designer skin products. Was a day later receiving the package but, still had it in plenty of time.</li>
            <li> Great smell. Very soothing to skin. Got it as gift years ago... Glad to have some again.</li>
            <li> I have loved this lotion for years! It has such a nice light scent that lasts. I received it very quickly also. I will buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted this body lotion; thanks for amazon for carrying this product...It has a great fragrance....I love to use it 2 times a day....</li>
            <li> I have loved this lotion since I was in high school.  It is lightly scented and doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy or thick feeling behind.  After I use this I always feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have been using it for years and will continue to use it as long as it is still available.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell but it does not moisturize very well, even compared to store bought lotion. Australian Gold (Forever After or Kisses, IMO, are way better moisturizers. I had to keep applying throughout the day whereas with the other two products I&#x27;ve used in the past 2 months, I only had to apply once or twice for ultimate moisture. Not trying to knock anything but I wanted to let other people know that Forever After is less in price and MUCH better, especially if you are an avid tanner like myself.</li>
