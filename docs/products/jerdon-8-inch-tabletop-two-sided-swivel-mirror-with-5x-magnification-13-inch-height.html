            <li>If i saw a mirror like this in a store, I would have probably assumed it was more like $30-35.</li>
            <li>but I love the nickel finish.</li>

            <li>The replacement mirror had two stickers on the mirror that the first did not have.</li>
            <li>This leads me to believe that the first mirror I got may have been a return.</li>

            <li>And the price was reasonable too.</li>
            <li>This mirror is nice and heavy and works well for me.</li>
            <li>cuz that makes my desk more messy with bunch of wires.  </li>
            <li>I particularly love the magnifying side, which now enables me to pluck my eye brows and save $10 that I usually pay the salon to do it biweekly.</li>
            <li>cuz it&#x27;s very sturdy and simple.</li>
            <li>Heavy, right size, very high quality and color (nickel).</li>
            <li>Looks kind of top heavy but the base is substantial enough that this does not seem to be an issue.</li>

            <li> Great, especially for the price. I really only wanted to use the regular side rather than the magnified size, so it was perfect for me. I understand what people are saying about the magnified side being a little annoying in that you have to be right up to the mirror for things to look clear, but I thought I&#x27;ve noticed that for most mirrors. I know my last one was like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also looks like good quality. If i saw a mirror like this in a store, I would have probably assumed it was more like $30-35.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror for my mom as a Christmas present and she loves it! Definitely a great product for the cost.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect size for my desk!, i like it cuz it&#x27;s very sturdy and simple. color is also good. i like this short neck unlike others. the best thing is that there are screws to make circling tight on the each side. I didn&#x27;t need a light for my mirrow cuz that makes my desk more messy with bunch of wires.  If you wanna put on the desk, this will be perfect,!</li>
            <li> I love this mirror so much. Great for applying makeup and taking care of face because of magnification. It is hard to find colors other than silver or dark bronze in the stores like tj maxx but I love the nickel finish. It is different</li>
            <li> What can I say about this mirror? It&#x27;s beautiful and VERY useful. I particularly love the magnifying side, which now enables me to pluck my eye brows and save $10 that I usually pay the salon to do it biweekly.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and wide base. Bought it because I didn&#x27;t want my cats to knock it over on my desk. I bought the nickel coated mirror and it does look a lot better than the cheaper coats. The magnified side is pretty good too. It stands just tall enough to do my makeup on my desk which I can appreciate.</li>
            <li> This is a good mirror. Well made. Good magnification and clarity. Just what I needed. And the price was reasonable too.</li>
            <li> Great gift at an outstanding price..Great value for the buck...</li>
            <li> I love it, and she loves it.  I got here a tiny compact type for travel, too, and she likes that.  But if it breaks, I wonder if I can train here to use the smartphone &amp;#34;selfie&amp;#34; for emergencies and quickies.  Should work?  Works for me.</li>
            <li> Great size.  looks so nice in my bathroom with all the chrome fixtures.</li>
            <li> This mirror was just what I was looking for. I love the quality and finnish, as well as the size. However, mine arrived broken as well. Now I have the hassle of repacking and returning. I am hopeful the replacement will arrive intact. I will update this review when I receive the next one. UPDATE:The replacement mirror came in perfect shape and is just what i wanted. The replacement mirror had two stickers on the mirror that the first did not have. This leads me to believe that the first mirror I got may have been a return. In any case I am upping the rating to 4 stars. However, I guess ordering mirrors online has an element of risk.</li>
            <li> Great quality, great price. The light is definitely bright enough, it has 3 levels, I only use the highest though. The magnification is perfect, not too low, not too high. I&#x27;ve become obsessed with this since I got, I use it almost daily because now I see how much hair I was missing on my eyebrows and chin.</li>
            <li> Was said to be arriving in mid January, but made it before Christmas. Was exactly as described. Good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Heavy, solid and well built.  Looks kind of top heavy but the base is substantial enough that this does not seem to be an issue.</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy mirror.  If you&#x27;re worried that it might tip over or get knocked over easily, DON&#x27;T.  This mirror has a heavy base and stays put where you put it.  Nice product.</li>
            <li> First of all I gave 1 star not because of bad quality or bad service. I tried to find out such mirror several days. And I found it. Heavy, right size, very high quality and color (nickel). Magnifies is perfect. But when I turned it to the regular mirror side, the mirror was broken or beated off exactly where mirror fixed to the frame. It was not because of transportation. Of course I did not leave broken mirror at home. You should be careful when you&#x27;re buying items by internet.</li>
            <li> this is EXACTLY what I was looking for!!! The size it awesome, it seems huge to me, after using a 5&amp;#34; mirror for so long :( its beautiful, i love it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This is a great mirror, both the height and the diameter. The magnification is 5X which is also great to get a close of areas. What I like best is the large diameter. I have purchased two of these as gifts for a man and woman and they both love it.</li>
