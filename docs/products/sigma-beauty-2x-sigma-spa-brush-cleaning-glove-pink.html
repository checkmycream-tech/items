    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>great investment for my brushes!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that this glove works best as a mat.</li>
            <li>An excellent buy.</li>
            <li>This has been the best purchase !!!</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li>Great for MUA&#x27;s...</li>
            <li>I also like the ridges in between the thumbs because they are great for squeezing water out of the brushes.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>I use the cheap brush shampoo from a cheaper brand and it worked great!</li>
            <li>I pay good money for my brushes</li>
            <li>She loved it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with how clean my brushes are when I use this mitt.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this and will happily be washing my brushes all the time now.</li>
            <li>LOVE this and will happily be washing my brushes all the time now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I splurged on this!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>What an amazing idea and invention.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a need for either the &#x27;Refine&#x27; or the &#x27;Refine Plus&#x27; zones, but the textures on the linear &#x27;Wash&#x27; and the &#x27;Rinse&#x27; side are both effective.</li>
            <li>For now I am using a baby shampoo which is just as effective, but including the Sigma makeup glove makes cleaning my brushes so effortless.</li>
            <li>Good old fashion cleaning with my hand is the best.</li>
            <li>Great sellers with fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>So I wash 10 of my most used brushes And</li>
            <li>I love this item.</li>
            <li>I think what I like the most is that I KNOW I am getting out all of the dirt AND soap.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way my brushes feel after I have used this product.</li>
            <li>On top of that the brush bristles would get stuck everywhere on the glove.  </li>
            <li>I love the Sigma 2X Sigma Spa Brush Cleaning Glove.  </li>
            <li>Interesting and effective method to keep makeup brushes clean.</li>
            <li>Makes washing brushes more thorough and easy.</li>
            <li>I would not have believed my brushes could get this clean!</li>
            <li>and it stains somewhat easily.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I thought I would love it as it&#x27;s such a great idea.  </li>
            <li>The make-up comes out of your brushes so easily.  </li>
            <li>This almost makes me enjoy cleaning my brushes.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is really worth the money or a great gift for someone with lots of makeup brushes or they don&#x27;t have many and just need to wash them on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>Great product but packaging left a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li>So easy to clean brushes</li>
            <li>Your hand is comfortable all during the washing &amp; after.</li>
            <li>This thing makes cleaning SO much easier!!!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and highly effective at deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>I have found myself cleaning my brushes more regularly, now that I have this handy helper :)  Definitely worth the money, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY worth the $$$!</li>
            <li>but I can feel when my brushes are clean and not so clean.</li>
            <li>My dense brushes have never been this clean.</li>
            <li>use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Liquid Soap in the Baby Mild formula.</li>
            <li>use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Liquid Soap in the Baby Mild formula.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was so EASY to DEEPLY clean all my brushes in a FRACTION of my normal time.</li>
            <li>Try not to roll your eyes (because I did), but it really does make me excited to clean my brushes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you could get this kind of deep cleaning of makeup brushes with a silicone matt for cooking like others have posted.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li>It looked silly to me even with one thumb, LOL!</li>
            <li>have many brushes including a bunch of big dense ones like the SigMax brushes.</li>
            <li>you have a bunch of brushes or even if you don&#x27;t have that many but have some of the big dense ones, think of this glove as an investment.</li>
            <li>you have a bunch of brushes or even if you don&#x27;t have that many but have some of the big dense ones, think of this glove as an investment.</li>
            <li>I was dubious at first, but this thing really works!  </li>
            <li>In addition, it comes with a nice soft removable terry lining, which kept my hand dry and cool while washing.</li>
            <li>and I honestly can&#x27;t understand why Sigma would include that rather than just make a left hand glove for left handed people and a right hand glove for right handed people.</li>
            <li>Deep clean!</li>
            <li>I always clean my brushes now, due to this being so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>glove also makes it easy to know, just by sight, when your brush is completely clean, soap foam is white, and completely rinsed, no foam comes out of your brush when swirled after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with how much easier it was to clean my make-up brushes with this cleaning glove.  </li>
            <li>I was kind of expecting a stiff, rubbery glove (like an oven mitt) and while this does resemble the shape, I was pleasantly surprised how light and flexible this was.</li>
            <li>So many times, my brushes would dry, and I could tell I didn&#x27;t get all the soap</li>
            <li>Previously I watched a YouTube video on how to effectively utilize the glove.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they will dry faster than ever.</li>
            <li>I ran across this new version &amp; watched the video on Sigma&#x27;s site and thought I would try it out because I really needed something to make this easier right</li>
            <li>This glove makes cleaning your brushes so much easier, wish I had purchased this item sooner.</li>
            <li>This is not an absolute must have, but it does cut a substantial amount of time from the task of cleaning brushes.</li>
            <li>the different areas have a very useful purpose that do all the work.</li>
            <li>My brushes are such a breeze now to clean with this glove</li>
            <li>The terry inner glove made the whole silicone glove experience really nice and cozy.</li>
            <li>They felt 50% dry right after washing!</li>
            <li>(right &amp; left ) &amp;</li>
            <li>Everything is new and improved.</li>
            <li>like this new design, with the 2 thumbs, because you can always use your dominant hand to hold the brush.</li>
            <li>like this new design, with the 2 thumbs, because you can always use your dominant hand to hold the brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a nice, fluffy inner glove that helps you not get sweaty or whatever.</li>
            <li>brushes are thoroughly deep cleaned for the first time in ages.</li>
            <li>brushes are thoroughly deep cleaned for the first time in ages.</li>
            <li>so I definitely want the real deal.</li>
            <li>They really designed this to actually do all the work for you AND save your hands &amp; nails.</li>
            <li>So it made it through the first few brushes like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>I know the brush cleaning products that are phenomenal and the products that are a total waste.</li>
            <li>If you use your brushes daily, and wash your brushes weekly, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I do feel that it gets my brushes cleaner than my former approach of just swirling them in the palm of my hand with the cleanser cake soap, but I find that I really only use 1 or 2 of the textures on the whole glove.</li>
            <li>Just so you know, I have seen the original version of this glove for awhile &amp; have been extremely skeptical about how useful it could be.</li>
            <li>Put your brush under water, dab of brush cleaner and when you scrub it produces a nice foamy clean that gets all the way to the base of the brushes and rinses like a dream.</li>
            <li>Plus, I can never seem to get the big dense ones clean enough deep in the center</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is really well made and should last a really long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is really well made and should last a really long time.</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not buy directly from Sigma is because they were out of this color.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH more junk came off them, I was both thrilled and disgusted.</li>
            <li>I lay it flat in the sink with the faucet on low, swirl my brushes in the Beauty Blender Cleanser solid cake, then rub them around on the various textures of the cleaning glove until the water rinses clear.</li>
            <li>Finally I tried the well deposit brush, it took a little longer than the other brushes but it is finally clean.</li>

            <li> great investment for my brushes!!!</li>
            <li> My brushes are such a breeze now to clean with this glove</li>
            <li> Great for MUA&#x27;s... Saves time! Deep clean!</li>
            <li> This almost makes me enjoy cleaning my brushes.  I&#x27;m impressed with how clean my brushes are when I use this mitt.  I usually listen to everything Wayne Goss (internet make-up star) has to say, but on this mitt, he got it wrong--it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> A must have it works wonders cuts time !!!</li>
            <li> I know I know. $40 on a glove? That&#x27;s crazy right. That&#x27;s what I thought. But I said oh what the heck, if I don&#x27;t like it I can return it. So I wash 10 of my most used brushes And a few brushes that I&#x27;ve forgotten about that hadn&#x27;t been washed or used since Christmas 2014. I also watched one brush that has a well deposit inside and it&#x27;s almost impossible to clean. So it made it through the first few brushes like a hot knife through butter. The dirt VANISHED. Finally I tried the well deposit brush, it took a little longer than the other brushes but it is finally clean.</li>
            <li> I would not have believed my brushes could get this clean!</li>
            <li> This thing is insane crazy GOOD. I always cleaned my brushes by hand with the beauty blender cleansing liquid. I had a set of supposedly &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; brushes that I used on this mitt with the same cleansing liquid and SO MUCH more junk came off them, I was both thrilled and disgusted. The brushes looked like they did the day after they came out of their packages. I like that one side if doe face, and one is for eye. I also like the ridges in between the thumbs because they are great for squeezing water out of the brushes. A+!!!</li>
            <li> I received this for Christmas from a GF who purchased it from my wish list.  This has cut the time I take to wash my brushes in a third of the time! Of course once I got this the mat came out! lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that this glove works best as a mat. I lay it flat in the sink with the faucet on low, swirl my brushes in the Beauty Blender Cleanser solid cake, then rub them around on the various textures of the cleaning glove until the water rinses clear. It&#x27;s a little tedious to try and wear it but using it as a mat works well. I&#x27;ve noticed some color fading (from the detergent in the cleanser cake?) and it stains somewhat easily. In the areas where I&#x27;ve cleaned brushes that had either black gel eyeliner or foundation on them, the glove is stained. Haven&#x27;t tried using makeup remover on it but may give it a go. I do feel that it gets my brushes cleaner than my former approach of just swirling them in the palm of my hand with the cleanser cake soap, but I find that I really only use 1 or 2 of the textures on the whole glove. I don&#x27;t see a need for either the &#x27;Refine&#x27; or the &#x27;Refine Plus&#x27; zones, but the textures on the linear &#x27;Wash&#x27; and the &#x27;Rinse&#x27; side are both effective. Really a gratuitous &amp;#34;uni-tasker&amp;#34; as Alton Brown says, but a neat addition to a makeup fanatic&#x27;s accessory collection.</li>
            <li> So convenient!  I have found myself cleaning my brushes more regularly, now that I have this handy helper :)  Definitely worth the money, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this item. I always clean my brushes now, due to this being so easy to use. I used to put off cleaning my make up brushes, and that is not good for your skin. I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> An excellent buy. Try not to roll your eyes (because I did), but it really does make me excited to clean my brushes. Very easy to use and highly effective at deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> Everything is new and improved. However if there was one thing I could change about it, it would be the two thumb feature.. I think the two thumbs idea is just stupid and I honestly can&#x27;t understand why Sigma would include that rather than just make a left hand glove for left handed people and a right hand glove for right handed people. The two thumbs on the glove makes wearing it so completely awkward. It doesn&#x27;t feel right.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you could get this kind of deep cleaning of makeup brushes with a silicone matt for cooking like others have posted. I just received this today and like that you can hold brushes under the water while you work them into the groves of the glove. The matt one that lays flat in your sink that costs less doesn&#x27;t seem like it would work as well since you&#x27;d have to dump water on the different areas to rinse it off - but if you used the kitchen hand sprayer, I guess that would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a nice, fluffy inner glove that helps you not get sweaty or whatever. Not a huge deal.  I use the cheap brush shampoo from a cheaper brand and it worked great! I think what I like the most is that I KNOW I am getting out all of the dirt AND soap. So many times, my brushes would dry, and I could tell I didn&#x27;t get all the soap out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I splurged on this! I have been accumulating brushes and learning how to use them (I don&#x27;t pay lots of money for brushes, since I&#x27;m such a bargain hunter &amp; can&#x27;t stand to spend $ on something if there is a dupe out there). This is really worth the money or a great gift for someone with lots of makeup brushes or they don&#x27;t have many and just need to wash them on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This has been the best purchase !!! It is so easy to use. Water does not go through the glove. However, if used for a long period of time, it gets hot and slightly uncomfortable in there.&lt;br /&gt;This glove has significantly decreased my brush cleaning time.</li>
            <li> The product was as described. Great sellers with fast shipping!! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> This makes cleaning my brushes easier and it saves a lot of time</li>
            <li> Great product but packaging left a lot to be desired. I was afraid the item had been used or that there might be a hole in the glove but thank goodness, there was not. The only reason I did not buy directly from Sigma is because they were out of this color. This glove makes cleaning your brushes so much easier, wish I had purchased this item sooner.</li>
            <li> Where has this been all my life??? I was kind of expecting a stiff, rubbery glove (like an oven mitt) and while this does resemble the shape, I was pleasantly surprised how light and flexible this was. In addition, it comes with a nice soft removable terry lining, which kept my hand dry and cool while washing. This thing makes cleaning SO much easier!!! I used to put soap and water on my brushes and lather in my hand, rinse....this thing does all the work for you! Put your brush under water, dab of brush cleaner and when you scrub it produces a nice foamy clean that gets all the way to the base of the brushes and rinses like a dream. No more repeating and repeating after rinsing and finding foundation residue at the base of the brush. ABSOLUTELY worth the $$$!</li>
            <li> Horrible item I clean my brushes better myself. Wish I didn&#x27;t throw away packaging so I could return it.</li>
            <li> What an amazing idea and invention. I was like a kid in a candy store, ripping open the package and running to the bathroom to wash every makeup brush I could find. Previously I watched a YouTube video on how to effectively utilize the glove. I must admit that I wasn’t disappointed.  I can’t speak for anyone else but I can feel when my brushes are clean and not so clean. I know the brush cleaning products that are phenomenal and the products that are a total waste. Sephora has a product called “Solid”. I absolutely love the way my brushes feel after I have used this product. For now I am using a baby shampoo which is just as effective, but including the Sigma makeup glove makes cleaning my brushes so effortless. I’m not sure about purchasing a generic brand or even making a DIY like I’ve viewed on YouTube. I pay good money for my brushes so I definitely want the real deal. Do yourself a favor and purchase the Sigma.</li>
            <li> I saw this in a magazine and knew my sister would like this. I bought it for her and she uses it all the time. Makes washing brushes more thorough and easy.</li>
            <li> Works great! So easy to clean brushes</li>
            <li> I used it twice and that was it.  I thought I would love it as it&#x27;s such a great idea.  However, I feel as if it&#x27;s an unnecessary step to get all the brushes clean.  I also have to find a storage for it.  On top of that the brush bristles would get stuck everywhere on the glove.  I tried to get it out and it&#x27;s impossible.  I would not recommend it or ever get it again.  Good old fashion cleaning with my hand is the best.</li>
            <li> This is not an absolute must have, but it does cut a substantial amount of time from the task of cleaning brushes. I dab a bit of my Kirkland (Costco) brand Shampoo on the glove then swirl around my brushes. If you use your brushes daily, and wash your brushes weekly, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just so you know, I have seen the original version of this glove for awhile &amp; have been extremely skeptical about how useful it could be. It looked silly to me even with one thumb, LOL! However, I am coming off of two arm and hand surgeries back to back (right &amp; left ) &amp; all my brushes were extremely dirty and I was dreading washing them like the plague. (I&#x27;m still recovering so my hands &amp; arms are only at 80% strength) I ran across this new version &amp; watched the video on Sigma&#x27;s site and thought I would try it out because I really needed something to make this easier right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have many brushes including a bunch of big dense ones like the SigMax brushes. I loath the chore of washing my brushes. I do it less often than I should. My hands become prunes, I wreck my nails and it takes for-like-ever! Plus, I can never seem to get the big dense ones clean enough deep in the center no matter how long I stand there and try to wash them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I used this brush cleaning glove and HOLY FRIGGIN&#x27; MOLY!!! It&#x27;s next level stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was so EASY to DEEPLY clean all my brushes in a FRACTION of my normal time. My dense brushes have never been this clean. It was an actual pleasure to wash them! Never thought I would ever say that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not get an imitation. I saw those &amp; thought about saving some money but in the end bought this glove. They really designed this to actually do all the work for you AND save your hands &amp; nails. It is well thought out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the different areas have a very useful purpose that do all the work. You need all the different areas. The area where you shape your brush at the end actually also squeezes out all the excess water from even those dense SigMax brushes. They felt 50% dry right after washing! I&#x27;m sure they will dry faster than ever. The terry inner glove made the whole silicone glove experience really nice and cozy. Your hand is comfortable all during the washing &amp; after. None of that sweaty, sticky feeling you can get with rubber gloves. My hand was completely dry even after about 30 brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this new design, with the 2 thumbs, because you can always use your dominant hand to hold the brush. With one thumb you would have to switch hands to use the other side of the glove. One side is for face/larger brushes &amp; the other is for eye/smaller brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Liquid Soap in the Baby Mild formula. Get yourself a pump dispenser &amp; mix half soap and half water in the dispenser. Having the pump helps speed along the washing process as you just pump the soap onto the center cleaning area of the glove. You never have to put down the brush you are cleaning. This also helps keep the brush aimed down helping you not get water running up into the ferrule by accident as you work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This glove also makes it easy to know, just by sight, when your brush is completely clean, soap foam is white, and completely rinsed, no foam comes out of your brush when swirled after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brushes are thoroughly deep cleaned for the first time in ages. They look brand new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a bunch of brushes or even if you don&#x27;t have that many but have some of the big dense ones, think of this glove as an investment. It will help you preserve the life of your brushes and keep bacteria off your face, yuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really well made and should last a really long time. They only thing I could see happening is replacing the inner glove as it is terry cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this and will happily be washing my brushes all the time now. My face, hands &amp; nails are all going to benefit.feeling you can get with rubber gloves.

            <li> I love the Sigma 2X Sigma Spa Brush Cleaning Glove.  It makes cleaning brushes a breeze. I would Higlhy Recommend.</li>
            <li> I was dubious at first, but this thing really works!  The make-up comes out of your brushes so easily.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for a friend. She loved it. She said it cut her brush cleaning down by half and she has a ton of brushes. So that&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how much easier it was to clean my make-up brushes with this cleaning glove.  I plan on giving it as a gift to my friends.</li>
            <li> Interesting and effective method to keep makeup brushes clean.</li>
