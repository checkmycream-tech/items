            <li>my favorite..</li>
            <li>I thought to myself, \\&quot;jeez, that sure is a trailer park sounding name for a perfume\\&quot;, but began an internet search.</li>
            <li>As understated and lovely as Carolina Herrera&#x27;s designs.  </li>
            <li>One of my two favorite scents.</li>

            <li>Christmas came and she was extremely happy with both the \\&quot;Chick\\&quot; perfume and the other gifts I got her</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fade quickly.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite fragance of all time.</li>

            <li>Pleasant scent, cleaner than Carolina Herrera, slightly sharper than 212.</li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t like floral fragrances, you gotta wear Carolina Herrera \\&quot;Chic\\&quot; during Spring ;)</li>
            <li>I found it and got it in the largest bottle, hoping that women are like men, they like their perfume like we like our gun oil, in large containers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m big expert of Perfumes, got huge collection at home</li>
            <li>but nothing makes people more curious than Carolina Herrera \\&quot;Chic\\&quot;.</li>

            <li>shipment was fast.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this perfume -- I get compliments on it all the time.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using \\&quot;Carolina Herrera\\&quot; Eau De Parfum for many years and always get good compliments from strangers &amp; friends.I loved it ! This is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This is one of my go to fragrances. A must try for anyone that loves to smell wonderful ! Amazon is the place to shop for all of the hard to find classics !</li>
            <li> I got in on time but I don&#x27;t like it smell. I ordered it to try it because I read that combination with mix of roses, musk and others.</li>
            <li> This product never came, thank you know that happened because if he was charged to my credit card.  I asked other 3 products from different vendors and they came</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite fragance of all time. I looked all over for it when I was at the end of my last bottle. So happy I found it here!</li>
            <li> You can buy this product even if you have not use it before. I love the fragrance of this Carolina Herrera Eau de Parfume</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this perfume!!!! If you love floral, fresh fragrance this is your perfume!!! I&#x27;m big expert of Perfumes, got huge collection at home but nothing makes people more curious than Carolina Herrera \\&quot;Chic\\&quot;. Tens of people ask  \\&quot;What are you wearing\\&quot;.... I wear it all year long coz I&#x27;m addicted to it... One of the few perfumes that keeps the smell for very long time ;) Even if you don&#x27;t like floral fragrances, you gotta wear Carolina Herrera \\&quot;Chic\\&quot; during Spring ;)</li>
            <li> I love this parfum a lot! it´s my favorite.. I received it in perfect conditions! I recommend to buy it!</li>
            <li> Excellent. Doesn&#x27;t fade quickly. People randomly stop and ask what you&#x27;re wearing. Pleasant scent, cleaner than Carolina Herrera, slightly sharper than 212. Clean, but with a very slight hint of musk. Sort of jasmine with a kick, but nicer.</li>
            <li> Well, the little lady said that if I was looking for a Christmas Present for her (I had already gotten her what I had intended to give her so that statement meant, \\&quot;get me this too\\&quot;), to get her a bottle of a perfume called \\&quot;Chick\\&quot;. I thought to myself, \\&quot;jeez, that sure is a trailer park sounding name for a perfume\\&quot;, but began an internet search. Of course there is no perfume called \\&quot;Chick\\&quot;, so it came to me that perhaps she meant \\&quot;Chic\\&quot;, pronounced like the Condom or the Arab Chieftan, so I did another internet search. This required me to ask what the bottle \\&quot;looked like\\&quot;. She described it from memory, which was of course photographic in quality so I went to Amazon to look for the best price. I found it and got it in the largest bottle, hoping that women are like men, they like their perfume like we like our gun oil, in large containers. It arrived packed perfectly and I even had Amazon wrap it for me as my wrapping tends to turn out looking like cat shredded newsprint. Christmas came and she was extremely happy with both the \\&quot;Chick\\&quot; perfume and the other gifts I got her so the day went very well. No complaints and the price at Amazon beat the snot outta Walmart without having to fight the frenzied wide bottomed hordes.&lt;br /&gt;Have a happy New Year everyone!</li>
            <li> Very nice perfume.  Light, fresh. floral notes. Always receive compliments on this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Similair to Chanel No. 19 but more modern.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent. Must buy!</li>
            <li> I have loved this perfume for years.  Light, with an orange blossom base (I think!), it makes me happy.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous sensual fragrance.  As understated and lovely as Carolina Herrera&#x27;s designs.  One of my two favorite scents.</li>
            <li> I got this scent as a sample at a spa and have been using it ever since.  Every time someone comes close, they comment on how wonderful the scent is.  I am allergic to many perfumes, but this one is a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;Very hard to find, so I always order it on Amazon.  Love Amazon too, as they are on target with every purchase.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product that I received is broken, the bottle was damaged in transit.. What can I do in this case?? You&#x27;ll send me other?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you can help me because it&#x27;s a christmas gift...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Americo Carrillo</li>
            <li> This was a gift but she liked it and said its the same as in the brick and mortar stores and it was cheaper for me on Amazon</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this perfume -- I get compliments on it all the time.  it smells great, is unique, and it&#x27;s hard to find as it&#x27;s no longer sold in stores.</li>
