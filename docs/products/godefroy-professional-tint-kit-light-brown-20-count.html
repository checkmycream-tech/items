            <li>Great value, easy to use.</li>
            <li>NORTHEAST BEAUTY made everything very easy and affordable.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows have always been very light.</li>
            <li>You can always add more.  </li>
            <li>but now I can&#x27;t recommend it more.</li>
            <li>wish there were more color options.</li>
            <li>Be sure you don&#x27;t use any Acne soaps or lotions with Benzoyl Peroxide though.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>but wish it were more brown than it is.  </li>
            <li>The shipping  could have been better but over all</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product .  </li>
            <li>Perfect for ppl w strawberry blonde hair...</li>
            <li>I still have to use my pencil more than I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>have had much better luck with this eyebrow pencil:  </li>
            <li>The application was easy, though I recommend you be sure you brows are freshly shaped before hand to give you a good line to follow.  </li>
            <li>So this is the bulk one made for stylists but will save you significant money!  </li>
            <li>I can tell they are darker but not as bold as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I decided to try another brand, but the process was much trickier and, I thought, not as good.</li>
            <li>I was able to get this larger Godefroy kit at a great price, and it arrived in a snap.</li>
            <li>This was really easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I dye my brows before I get them waxed to ensure all the hairs are easily seen, I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years</li>
            <li>It was easy to mix and apply and all that.</li>
            <li>It is quick and easy to use and sure beats having to go to the salon.</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous - easy to mix,</li>
            <li>safe to use and quick processing.  </li>
            <li>but I should have bought one shade darker for my light brown eyebrows.</li>
            <li>So that is the reason I bought the light brown.</li>
            <li>Now it seems it is way too light.</li>
            <li>I have extremely light eyebrows, however my hair is not that light.  </li>
            <li>My hair color- light brown</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives me a medium brown color instead of light brown which I prefer.</li>
            <li>I ordered the light brown from Ameritrax linen .</li>
            <li>I have medium brown hair with light eyebrows .</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I went with the light brown .</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine paying $20 at a salon for one tint when you can do it yourself for so cheap.</li>
            <li>It starts out light</li>
            <li>I use \\&quot;light brown\\&quot; pencils and powder to fill in my brows, so when I ordered \\&quot;light brown\\&quot; brow tint</li>
            <li>Works well for me, I am blond with light brown brows which&lt;br /&gt;get</li>
            <li>However, this is in no way light brown.  </li>
            <li>Covers grey brows beautifully.</li>
            <li>if you want it lighter, 1 - 2 min would be perfect... at least on my eyebrows....</li>
            <li>However the product was very easy to use and not messy.</li>
            <li>Having said that, I still have to use a little powder each morning to make my eyebrows look fuller, but I&#x27;m really happy with the tint.  </li>
            <li>But fades after a few days to look great.</li>
            <li>This dye works great on my light blonde and white eyebrows</li>
            <li>the baby fine hairs that normally would not show at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Covers grey hairs amazingly well.</li>
            <li>I get a nice medium brown color (because I leave it in long)</li>
            <li>The first day you apply the dye, everytime, I suggest waiting until right before you shower, then doing it.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m on my 2nd or 3rd box and this is great stuff.  </li>
            <li>Sure the henna is natural and the packaging really pushes that fact</li>
            <li>Good product, not good color for gingers! :)</li>
            <li>maybe i should use the more permanent product next time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used pencils and powders to fill in and shape, but this was my first use of tint.  </li>
            <li>but now that I found this kit my whole eyebrow world has changed!  </li>
            <li>I have really blonde eyebrows which are getting more sparse</li>
            <li>In my first try, I opened and used a while capsule.</li>
            <li>and I am still using my first box.</li>
            <li>First time I used it I had to leave it in longer than 2-3 mins.  </li>
            <li>&gt; Start with short times and just add if you need more.</li>
            <li>I ordered the light brown and it barely shows up.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a holy grail item for me especially at this price and being so easy to use.</li>
            <li>But this has really given me some ease in the morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this twice now and really like it.  </li>
            <li>I really expected more from this product, I color my hair alot</li>
            <li>Then I purchase this kit in light brown and it is the SAME THING.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you follow the instructions carefully</li>
            <li>(FYI I am light skinned with brown hair that I highlight blonde)</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than going to a salon.</li>
            <li>This product works really well and did the job, but the color was NOTHING like the picture on the box.</li>
            <li>I really need a lighter color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical at first as to if I would be able to do it myself or not, but as it turns out this kit makes it super easy to dye your brows!  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use and the color lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>This was very easy to use and covered my few gray eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Light brown is clearly not brown, and is more black than brown.  </li>
            <li>My eyebrows got irritated mildly though, not enough to stop using it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different tints and found this one to be the nicest color and last the longest.  </li>
            <li>the older I get.  </li>
            <li>The dye gets a little dark on your skin,  and can tint it pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and mix.... much better than Just for Men and other heavy chemical based treatments.</li>
            <li>Leave it on less time than you think if you don&#x27;t want to end up looking like Groucho Marx!  :-)  </li>
            <li>Relative easy to apply and seems to last too.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have had no problems.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to chemicals</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, I purchased the light brown because everyone said the others were too dark</li>
            <li>I bought both the light brown and dark brown.  </li>
            <li>But take my naturally blond eyebrow&#x27;d word for it, this stuff rocks!</li>
            <li>quite simple and easy to use, capsules are too large tho and sometimes make a mess.</li>
            <li>I bought this because, in my old age, my eyebrows are turning silver.</li>
            <li>I tried to leave it on longer after cleaning my eyebrows really well the second time I used it.  </li>
            <li>and I recommend it if you&#x27;re not too sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li>WOW I have eyebrows again.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate at all.</li>
            <li>only experimented a short time before I got the right color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light brown is dark enough and I mix two if I want a darker look.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a decent product</li>
            <li>However, it would be good for black hair, maybe dark brown hair, and definitely if you have blonde hair and want bold, dark eyebrows.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows have so many white hairs that it is hard to see them.  </li>
            <li>I see white hairs not grey and needed to color them before I pull them all out.  </li>
            <li>I only need half a capsule so this stuff really lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Also, I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate at all.</li>
            <li> only experimented a short time before I got the right color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The light brown is dark enough and I mix two if I want a darker look.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a decent product</li>
            <li> However, it would be good for black hair, maybe dark brown hair, and definitely if you have blonde hair and want bold, dark eyebrows.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows have so many white hairs that it is hard to see them.  </li>
            <li> I see white hairs not grey and needed to color them before I pull them all out.  </li>
            <li> I only need half a capsule so this stuff really lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Each capsule makes a larger amount of tint than most will need, so I put it on a little thick and keep a wet q-tip on hand to remove any tint from the skin around my brows.</li>
            <li> If your eyebrows are mostly grey, you will need to leave it on for the extra time specified.  </li>
            <li> It lasted a little longer but not long enough.  </li>
            <li> It only colored the inner half of my brows.  </li>
            <li> This product can be a little messy to mix up, but it works very well.  </li>
            <li> Next time, I&#x27;ll poke a hole and only dispense a little.</li>
            <li> I open the capsules very carefully and can get two applications from each capsule.</li>
            <li> Be careful to only apply the dye to your hair and not much to the skin, Even if you do get some dye on your skin, one shower</li>
            <li> I wanted a dark blonde but didn&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li> Comes out dark, even after following reviews of others which advise to shorten the development time to 30 seconds or so.</li>
            <li> My skin reacted to the chemicals, the same reaction I get if I use typical hair dye products.  </li>
            <li> I left it on for less time</li>
            <li> I only use about half a capsule to dye both of my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> , I had recently purchase the Godefroy Tint Kit (not Professional) in Medium Brown, however after leaving it in my brows for less than 5 minutes I noticed that the color was TOO DARK...</li>
            <li> I have spent years coloring with pencil.</li>
            <li> It sinks in gradually so you can experiment with the time you need to let it set</li>
            <li> If I had blond eyebrows, I would only leave it on for a few seconds at a time until you get the correct color.</li>
            <li> but if you leave it on longer, say to cover grey hair, it will eventually turn black.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll take the color off in a few days flat!</li>
            <li> I got this really excited at the thought of cutting down my make up routine time by not having to use my eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li> Flimsy measuring cups and stuff to mix and loose color powder in little capsules.  </li>
            <li> The color was a little darker than I expected.  </li>
            <li> and I have dark brown brows.</li>
            <li> it is dark brown.</li>
            <li> Blonde hair sucks.  </li>
            <li> and It was still too dark.</li>
            <li> My brows looked too dark for my face.</li>
            <li> Seemed that for me (a redhead) it was a bit dark.</li>
            <li> This is still a dark colored brown .</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish this worked to make my eye lashes darker too.</li>
            <li> I also thought it was a tad bit too dark</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too dark but it does its job</li>
            <li> I also have to leave it on for a few minutes to dye those resistant silvers and it does NOT make the other brows too dark.</li>
            <li> Looks dark brown to me, just a \\&quot;hair\\&quot; lighter than black.  </li>
            <li> Comes out a little dark but fades in a couple of days</li>
            <li> The color is a little dark.</li>
            <li> I do leave it on a little longer than directions state.</li>
            <li> I now pierce the end of the capsule and squeeze the powder into the little container to mix.</li>
            <li> All I can say is, this is NOT light brown...</li>
            <li> I got tired of paying my hairdresser 20 bucks to tint my blonde eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> it makes all the difference in my face without being to harsh .</li>
            <li> (I usually let it set for a couple minutes, wash it off then some areas get another couple of minutes).</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Also I am not a fan of the capsules, very messy.</li>
            <li> Learned that the hard way.</li>
            <li> I was however disappointed on the fact that they keep the powder in capsules, which makes it easier to open and messy.</li>
            <li> If you shower, scrub your face after and it will take care of the ridiculous darkness.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> Silly</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will be hitting the store tomorrow to get some auburn hair dye to put on my brows...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The application was easy, though I recommend you be sure you brows are freshly shaped before hand to give you a good line to follow.  The color was a little darker than I expected.  Leave it on less time than you think if you don&#x27;t want to end up looking like Groucho Marx!  :-)  You can always add more.  It&#x27;s been great not to have to pencil or powder my brows in each morning!</li>
            <li> Great product but I should have bought one shade darker for my light brown eyebrows.I can tell they are darker but not as bold as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I am a redhead and have blonde eyebrows. I have spent years coloring with pencil. I bought this because I wanted to omit part of my morning makeup routine. The dye is perfect tint for redheads. I do leave it on a little longer than directions state. But even if you take it off and realize you need longer it makes plenty to do so with each application. I do want you to know that I need to reapply about every 2/3 weeks max. But this has really given me some ease in the morning. The mix is very simple to do, you just open capsule and add stated cream. Do not hesitate on this item if you color your eyebrows!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s taken some time to learn the specifics of how it works (6 treatments) with my beard but now I can&#x27;t recommend it more. I have very sensitive skin and have had no problems. It sinks in gradually so you can experiment with the time you need to let it set (I usually let it set for a couple minutes, wash it off then some areas get another couple of minutes). Easy to use and mix.... much better than Just for Men and other heavy chemical based treatments. NORTHEAST BEAUTY was great to work with and everything was exceptional. NORTHEAST BEAUTY made everything very easy and affordable.</li>
            <li> I bought this because, in my old age, my eyebrows are turning silver. After reading the reviews, I purchased the light brown because everyone said the others were too dark and I have dark brown brows. All I can say is, this is NOT light brown... it is dark brown. I also have to leave it on for a few minutes to dye those resistant silvers and it does NOT make the other brows too dark. If I had blond eyebrows, I would only leave it on for a few seconds at a time until you get the correct color. Otherwise you could look like Groucho!&lt;br /&gt;One last remark, those capsules do NOT twist a part - they just burst and get the powder all over. I now pierce the end of the capsule and squeeze the powder into the little container to mix.</li>
            <li> it is a great idea but it fades very quickly maybe i should use the more permanent product next time</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the good reviews.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still like it, I just wish it lasts longer.  It lasts only about 4 days for me.  I tried to leave it on longer after cleaning my eyebrows really well the second time I used it.  It lasted a little longer but not long enough.  The reviews said about two weeks, some said one week, etc, but it only lasts about 4 days for me.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to chemicals so I&#x27;m limiting its usage and save it for when I go on a vacation or when I don&#x27;t want to bother with dealing with my eyebrows which is really thin and light.  My skin reacted to the chemicals, the same reaction I get if I use typical hair dye products.  My eyebrows got irritated mildly though, not enough to stop using it.  I bought both the light brown and dark brown.  The light brown is dark enough and I mix two if I want a darker look.  Overall, it&#x27;s a decent product and I recommend it if you&#x27;re not too sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li> Stumbled upon this Godefroy product in a catalog and gave it a try.  I&#x27;ve used pencils and powders to fill in and shape, but this was my first use of tint.  I really loved the results!  It was easy to use and the color lasted a long time. All in all, I was delighted. I decided to try another brand, but the process was much trickier and, I thought, not as good. So I looked around and found the Salon Guys through Amazon. I must say they are top rate! I was able to get this larger Godefroy kit at a great price, and it arrived in a snap. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I needed color for my eyebrows. I have naturally blonde hair that needs hi &amp; low lites now.  My eyebrows have always been very light. I see white hairs not grey and needed to color them before I pull them all out.  I&#x27;ve used this twice now and really like it.  I wanted a dark blonde but didn&#x27;t find it. This lt brown worked. You can make it darker if you leave it on longer. It only takes about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I got tired of paying my hairdresser 20 bucks to tint my blonde eyebrows.  If I don&#x27;t color or pencil them then I look like a woman with no eyebrows.  Blonde hair sucks.  Anyway, I&#x27;m on my 2nd or 3rd box and this is great stuff.  Takes no time at all and I do just as good a job as my hairdresser for a pennies on the dollar.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I was very skeptical at first as to if I would be able to do it myself or not, but as it turns out this kit makes it super easy to dye your brows!  I used to spend like 40$ plus on getting my eyebrows waxed and dyed and I would leave the salon not feeling great about either, but now that I found this kit my whole eyebrow world has changed!  The first day you apply the dye, everytime, I suggest waiting until right before you shower, then doing it.  The dye gets a little dark on your skin,  and can tint it pretty good.  If you shower, scrub your face after and it will take care of the ridiculous darkness.  But take my naturally blond eyebrow&#x27;d word for it, this stuff rocks!</li>
            <li> Would not recommend this eyebrow tinting kit to anyone! Even when following directions, this kit does the opposite of what you want -- darkens INSTEAD of lightening. Ordered one for myself and one for my daughter; both will be  going back!!</li>
            <li> I really expected more from this product, I color my hair alot and I was looking for a LIGHTER shade to match with my blonde hair, I had recently purchase the Godefroy Tint Kit (not Professional) in Medium Brown, however after leaving it in my brows for less than 5 minutes I noticed that the color was TOO DARK...The next time I tinted my brows I left it on for less time and It was still too dark. My brows looked too dark for my face. Then I purchase this kit in light brown and it is the SAME THING. I was hoping to have a lighter color, and I had bleached my brows before hand. However the product was very easy to use and not messy. I was however disappointed on the fact that they keep the powder in capsules, which makes it easier to open and messy.</li>
            <li> good product, but I wish it came in a lighter color</li>
            <li> Sure the henna is natural and the packaging really pushes that fact but they totally leave out&lt;br /&gt;the toxic chemicals in the lotion that set the henna.&lt;br /&gt;I despise deception in advertising.</li>
            <li> I have used Godfrey before but in a brown. Seemed that for me (a redhead) it was a bit dark. So that is the reason I bought the light brown. Now it seems it is way too light. Perhaps I have to leave it on for longer than 2 minutes, just worried that it may color my skin.</li>
            <li> quite simple and easy to use, capsules are too large tho and sometimes make a mess. I only use about half a capsule to dye both of my eyebrows. wish there were more color options.</li>
            <li> Product works great, just incomplete. Had to YouTube the directions as there were none included.</li>
            <li> So if you tint your brows, this is the way to go! I was ordering the smaller box with only 3 or 4 capsules thinking that this packaging was somehow different. It&#x27;s not!!!  So this is the bulk one made for stylists but will save you significant money!  I&#x27;ve tried many different tints and found this one to be the nicest color and last the longest.  Be sure you don&#x27;t use any Acne soaps or lotions with Benzoyl Peroxide though. They&#x27;ll take the color off in a few days flat! Learned that the hard way. lol</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by a family member.  My eyebrows have so many white hairs that it is hard to see them.  I can use this to cover the gray and WOW I have eyebrows again.  It is quick and easy to use and sure beats having to go to the salon.</li>
            <li> This product can be a little messy to mix up, but it works very well.  If your eyebrows are mostly grey, you will need to leave it on for the extra time specified.  It arrived very quickly, and I have already used it twice saving me $40 at the salon!! Just make sure you follow the instructions carefully and you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem!</li>
            <li> I have extremely light eyebrows, however my hair is not that light.  I ordered the light brown and it barely shows up.  Also I am not a fan of the capsules, very messy.</li>
            <li> My hair color- light brown&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for one year now and I love it.  I only need half a capsule so this stuff really lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I like to leave it on for 7 minutes but I also gradually worked my way up so I would have no surprises.&lt;br /&gt;It gives me a medium brown color instead of light brown which I prefer. Going a bit darker helps define&lt;br /&gt;even the baby fine hairs that normally would not show at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a holy grail item for me especially at this price and being so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have really blonde eyebrows which are getting more sparse the older I get.  The light brown Godefroy eyebrow tint is perfect and my brows look much better than when I was using eyebrow powder. Having said that, I still have to use a little powder each morning to make my eyebrows look fuller, but I&#x27;m really happy with the tint.  Each capsule makes a larger amount of tint than most will need, so I put it on a little thick and keep a wet q-tip on hand to remove any tint from the skin around my brows. Leave it on for 2 or 3 minutes then wipe the product off. Also, I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate at all.</li>
            <li> Great product but wish it were more brown than it is.  Light brown is clearly not brown, and is more black than brown.  Relative easy to apply and seems to last too.  Covers grey hairs amazingly well.</li>
            <li> I ordered the light brown from Ameritrax linen . The shipping  could have been better but over all I am pleased with the product .  I have medium brown hair with light eyebrows . After reading the reviews I went with the light brown . If your expecting a honey color or different shade of brown this is not for you . This is still a dark colored brown . I use about les than 1/4 of the capsule with the developer and leave it on for about 5 minutes or so . My eyebrows look great and has not stained my skin at all. I use Nivea cream to outline the brow so the dye doesn&#x27;t leak.  I get a nice medium brown color (because I leave it in long) it makes all the difference in my face without being to harsh .</li>
            <li> This was really easy to use. I can&#x27;t imagine paying $20 at a salon for one tint when you can do it yourself for so cheap. One capsule is enough to tint my brows about 10 times. In my first try, I opened and used a while capsule. Next time, I&#x27;ll poke a hole and only dispense a little. My only complaint is that I wish this worked to make my eye lashes darker too. I tried, but it didn&#x27;t seem to work. (FYI I am light skinned with brown hair that I highlight blonde)</li>
            <li> Great buy!  Perfect for ppl w strawberry blonde hair... I leave it on my eyebrow 2 - 3 minutes.. Comes out a little dark but fades in a couple of days and then it&#x27;s perfect!  if you want it lighter, 1 - 2 min would be perfect... at least on my eyebrows....</li>
            <li> Not for eyelashes! even though the package had picture of lashes on the box.  Silly me should&#x27;ve read ALL the instructions.</li>
            <li> Comes out dark, even after following reviews of others which advise to shorten the development time to 30 seconds or so. But fades after a few days to look great. It does cover the stubborn grays.</li>
            <li> The deal is that the longer you leave this on, the darker it gets.  It starts out light but if you leave it on longer, say to cover grey hair, it will eventually turn black.  Flimsy measuring cups and stuff to mix and loose color powder in little capsules.  Forget it!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Good result. Much cheaper than going to a salon. Convenience of doing at home any time at all.</li>
            <li> The color is a little dark. Covers grey brows beautifully.</li>
            <li> This dye works great on my light blonde and white eyebrows, It doesn&#x27;t last 6 weeks, but for this price I don&#x27;t mind dying them every month, Use Vaseline around your eyebrows to limit any color bleed on to the skin. Be careful to only apply the dye to your hair and not much to the skin, Even if you do get some dye on your skin, one shower and it&#x27;s gone. I dye my brows before I get them waxed to ensure all the hairs are easily seen, I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years and I am still using my first box. I open the capsules very carefully and can get two applications from each capsule.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This product works really well and did the job, but the color was NOTHING like the picture on the box. It came out black/gray with a greenish tint. I just did it, and it does not go with my red hair at all! I use \\&quot;light brown\\&quot; pencils and powder to fill in my brows, so when I ordered \\&quot;light brown\\&quot; brow tint I thought it would be the same. I was wrong. However, it would be good for black hair, maybe dark brown hair, and definitely if you have blonde hair and want bold, dark eyebrows. But redheads, no! It was easy to mix and apply and all that. Just the color is not for me. Needless to say, I will be hitting the store tomorrow to get some auburn hair dye to put on my brows... Good product, not good color for gingers! :)</li>
            <li> I got this really excited at the thought of cutting down my make up routine time by not having to use my eyebrow pencil.  I have very blonde eyebrows so if I don&#x27;t use a pencil it looks as if I don&#x27;t have eyebrows at all.  First time I used it I had to leave it in longer than 2-3 mins.  It only colored the inner half of my brows.  I also thought it was a tad bit too dark but it was workable.  I wasn&#x27;t very happy with the results.  So I decided to grow my brows out so they would be longer and fuller.  Well that worked alittle but still not like I had hoped.  It seems to not want to color the finer hair of my brows at all.  So still it just colored the thicker part of my brows by my nose.  I still have to use my pencil more than I had hoped.  I will still use the kit because it does help alittle and I payed for it so its gonna get used.  I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again though</li>
            <li> Works well for me, I am blond with light brown brows which&lt;br /&gt;get a gray hair in there now and again.&lt;br /&gt;I only experimented a short time before I got the right color.&lt;br /&gt; Start with short times and just add if you need more.</li>
            <li> I used to spend $25-30 every 4-6 weeks to get eyebrows tinted.  When we moved to Florida I could not find a convenient spa so decided to try this myself!  This product is fabulous - easy to mix, safe to use and quick processing.  This product will even cover those straggling gray hairs if you give it a second application.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too dark but it does its job I&#x27;ll continue using it but no longer buying it</li>
            <li> Great value, easy to use. love having this to make my invisible brows appear again!</li>
            <li> This was very easy to use and covered my few gray eyebrows.  However, this is in no way light brown.  I wouldn&#x27;t even call it medium brown.  Looks dark brown to me, just a \\&quot;hair\\&quot; lighter than black.  I really need a lighter color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had much better luck with this eyebrow pencil:  \\&quot;Maybelline Define-A-Brow Eyebrow Pencil\\&quot; (in medium brown).</li>
