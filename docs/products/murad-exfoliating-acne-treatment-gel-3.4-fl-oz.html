    <ol>
            <li>I have had the best luck with this one!</li>
            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>Murad products are all great!  </li>
            <li>This works great for visible blackheads.</li>
            <li>It is an excellent product.gentle but effective.</li>
            <li>Great for clearing out pores</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s all about using a good combination of products and applications.</li>
            <li>arrived in good condition</li>
            <li>i just love all the Murad products!</li>
            <li>This was a great price and it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Great product for occaisonal acne breakouts, not too drying and works quickly!  </li>
            <li>This, along with Murad&#x27;s clarifying cleanser and skin perfecting lotion are the perfect skin regimen (I would say that I have combination skin), and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly and a great price.</li>
            <li>but nothing works better than this magical gel!</li>
            <li>works great and the price is right</li>
            <li>so it was nice to find a much much larger size for a good price!!</li>
            <li>Use with a very light hand or you&#x27;ll hurt your skin.</li>
            <li>Seen way more results using this product than anything with benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>My face has a healthier glow for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>so I love finding deals on Amazon!This product</li>
            <li>So a couple more weeks go by</li>
            <li>and it will eventually get better.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I just wish I could get my teenager to be more dilligent,</li>
            <li>And there&#x27;s a huge notable difference in both the decrease of blemishes and scars and an increase in smoothness.</li>
            <li>This product has been made temporarily available - http://www.murad.com/exfoliate-acne/</li>
            <li>This stuff will reduce acne and blackheads and make your skin really smooth.</li>
            <li>It has also improved my skin texture significantly.</li>
            <li>Gel is nice, but can be drying and make sensitive skin peel.</li>
            <li>Anyways I&#x27;ve been off the stuff for two weeks now and my face has cleared up tremendously.</li>
            <li>Authentic and brand new.</li>
            <li>Powerful stuff.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m really doing a good job of using an occassional salicylic acid and glycolic acid peel and giving myself an at home facial on a more routine basis, my acne is even further reduced.</li>
            <li>you might break out at first.</li>
            <li>but it most definitely did not for me.</li>
            <li>But if you had dry skin you might experience more flaking, etc.</li>
            <li>I tried a sample size of this and found that this works really well for me.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really seem to work very well.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and a lot of blackheads.</li>
            <li>I really think it has helped to reduce the amount of acne.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for years and really like the product.</li>
            <li>After using the product for a week I noticed a little more breakouts than usual and thought this was normal because the retinol causes you to break out at first before it gets better.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This gel is gentle and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But even after two months of using this product everyday I was breaking out more than ever before.</li>
            <li>Cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>The two combined have reduced my acne to nothing more than a small pimple once in a while.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin free from breakouts, and also smooths those pesky small wrinkles we develop as we get older.  </li>
            <li>use this before lotion in morning, helps with Adult acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve still had some breakouts, but overall, it has really reduced the frequency and severity of them.</li>
            <li>However everything I&#x27;ve tried over the counter hasn&#x27;t completely gotten rid of my breakouts</li>

            <li> I tried everything to control my rosacea; including acupuncture, prescription medicines, and treatments to name a few</li>

    <ol>
            <li> use this before lotion in morning, helps with Adult acne. Not drying</li>
            <li> works great and the price is right</li>
            <li> This product has been made temporarily available - http://www.murad.com/exfoliate-acne/</li>
            <li> Seen way more results using this product than anything with benzoyl peroxide. If you use the entire Murad Acne System, you will definitely see improvements in your skin.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this for years and continues to use as after shave lotion.  It has no smell as he has allegery to perfume.</li>
            <li> Gel is nice, but can be drying and make sensitive skin peel. Use sparingly. Only use occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, would still recommend.</li>
            <li> I tried everything to control my rosacea; including acupuncture, prescription medicines, and treatments to name a few but nothing works better than this magical gel! Cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> Powerful stuff. Use with a very light hand or you&#x27;ll hurt your skin. This works great for visible blackheads. For deeper acne you&#x27;ll want benzoyle.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample size of this and found that this works really well for me.  I still get some bumps on my forehead but I have never found a &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; over the counter acne cream or gel and I have tried various OTC acne products.  I have had the best luck with this one!</li>
            <li> Authentic and brand new. Excellent.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really seem to work very well.</li>
            <li> I use this every single day immediately after my morning face wash and I wouldn&#x27;t go a day without it. I am a firm user and believer of Murad products and I recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and a great price.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product.gentle but effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year or so and it seems to be helping with my breakouts. I have oily skin so it doesn&#x27;t seem to be too drying for me. But if you had dry skin you might experience more flaking, etc.</li>
            <li> This product has to be used consistently long term. you might break out at first. I Did. I have very oily skin and a lot of blackheads. This stuff will reduce acne and blackheads and make your skin really smooth. I think my skin looks younger too. I use it with &amp;#34;Cellbone prep skin refresher&amp;#34;. The two combined have reduced my acne to nothing more than a small pimple once in a while. And there&#x27;s a huge notable difference in both the decrease of blemishes and scars and an increase in smoothness.</li>
            <li> I like this. I use it in the day and retin a at night. A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 8 months now. I really think it has helped to reduce the amount of acne. It has also improved my skin texture significantly. My face has a healthier glow for sure. It&#x27;s not a complete miracle product. I&#x27;ve still had some breakouts, but overall, it has really reduced the frequency and severity of them. If I&#x27;m really doing a good job of using an occassional salicylic acid and glycolic acid peel and giving myself an at home facial on a more routine basis, my acne is even further reduced. So it&#x27;s all about using a good combination of products and applications. I would highly recommend this product. FYI - I use the entire Murad Acne line, which include the salicylic face cleanser, non-SPF moisturizer, the sulfur spot treatment and sulfur mask.</li>
            <li> Murad products are all great!  I have been using this exfoliating gel for years- who knew you could get Acne after 40 years of age?</li>
            <li> The kiddo goes through this stuff like crazy so it was nice to find a much much larger size for a good price!!</li>
            <li> This, along with Murad&#x27;s clarifying cleanser and skin perfecting lotion are the perfect skin regimen (I would say that I have combination skin), and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product for occaisonal acne breakouts, not too drying and works quickly!  I have combination skin and can even use this product in the winter.</li>
            <li> Murad doesn&#x27;t disappoint! I love this stuff. It gets rid of acne AND smooths my skin. This was a great price and it arrived very quickly. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> i just love all the Murad products! These products are very expensive so I love finding deals on Amazon!This product I put a thin layer all over my face at night and it just seems to brighten my skin and clear up any beginning blimishes.</li>
            <li> This gel is gentle and does not irritate my sensitive skin. Have been using it for years and really like the product.</li>
            <li> After reading that other people seemed to have luck with this product I decided to give it a shot. I don&#x27;t have bad acne, just mild breakouts on my neck along my jawline. However everything I&#x27;ve tried over the counter hasn&#x27;t completely gotten rid of my breakouts so I decided look for something stronger. I noticed that this product contained retinol which was something that I haven&#x27;t used before so I figured it may work for me. After using the product for a week I noticed a little more breakouts than usual and thought this was normal because the retinol causes you to break out at first before it gets better. So a couple more weeks go by and I start breaking out even worse. I still figure that is how it&#x27;s supposed to work and it will eventually get better. But even after two months of using this product everyday I was breaking out more than ever before. Before I used this junk I would only break out a little on my neck but now it was all over my face, including my cheeks and forehead and I never would break out on my forehead before using this stuff. And this stuff is way expensive, totally not worth it. I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I felt inclined to with this product because it was such a bad experience. Anyways I&#x27;ve been off the stuff for two weeks now and my face has cleared up tremendously. Keep in mind everybody&#x27;s skin is different and this might work for some people but it most definitely did not for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad products for years.  This is one of my staples.  It keeps my skin free from breakouts, and also smooths those pesky small wrinkles we develop as we get older.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  Don&#x27;t for get to pair it with a Murad moisturizer, such as Skin Perfecting Lotion.</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad products like this for 15 years now....Nothing compares, that I&#x27;ve found anyway.  It has made me totally, in control of my acne.  I just wish I could get my teenager to be more dilligent, &#x27;cause IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> arrived in good condition</li>
            <li> Great for clearing out pores</li>
    </ol>
