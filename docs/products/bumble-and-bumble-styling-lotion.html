    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product to style and protect hair from heat damage during straightening or curling.</li>
            <li>When I couldn&#x27;t get it over the counter anymore, Amazon had the best price.  </li>
            <li>This product is great!</li>
            <li>This styling lotion is the best I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff!  </li>
            <li>Great for styling hair.</li>
            <li>Great for blow-drying.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair good texture for styling and provides a very light hairspray-like hold.</li>
            <li>Great for fine hair when combined with heat styling.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>I sometimes spray it before curling my hair with my straightner and it gives it a nice \\&quot;va-va-voom\\&quot; but doesn&#x27;t curl as well.</li>
            <li>It offers wonderful protection from the heat and stress from styling tools.  </li>
            <li>It holds curl very well and smells good too!</li>
            <li>love this product, but when it arrived the cap was cracked.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>use this in conjunction with Garnier Fructis&#x27; Color protect shampoo/conditioner, as well as Alterna&#x27;s Caviar CC cream, and my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to try this at a salon before trying it,</li>
            <li>does everything I need it to do and more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to apply and, unlike mousse or gels, you don&#x27;t have to work the product through your hair with your fingers...</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I still enjoy it, though.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this product I have noticed a significant reduction in split ends.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use much product on my hair after washing it, but bumble &amp; bumble is light but gives me umph.  </li>
            <li>lightweight spray works great to detangle, smooth, shine, and add manageability to most any hair type, but I use it daily on my fine, straight but thick and colored/highlighted hair.</li>
            <li>(I blowdry my hair each day), and really adds a bit of volume and shine, too, which for my hair type is nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li>My hair is lightly layered and below chin length and the clear \\&quot;lotion\\&quot; gives body, shape, and light control while its light moisturizers maintain a soft, natural look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to figure out exactly what the lotion is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>And John Frida&#x27;s Frizz-Ease definitely still works better for anti-humidity.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time about a week ago.</li>
            <li>Those same moisturizers help to detangle your hair and give it more strength.  </li>
            <li>I normally am able to find drugstore dupes because I typically can&#x27;t justify the price tags of most high end products.  </li>
            <li>love this product-lasts a long time</li>
            <li>This really helps my hair to curl.</li>
            <li>This with Bumble&#x27;s setting, very flexible hold hairspray</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, especially if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different products to achieve the same effect the this styling lotion imparts but have not succeeded.  </li>
            <li>I will mess around with it some more and give it another chance</li>
            <li>This lotion makes my hair so soft, I use it for blow drying and also use it to set my hair with large rollers for volume</li>
            <li>and i sometimes spritz a little more after I&#x27;m done to keep everything together.</li>
            <li>Nice for heat protection and volumizing but hard to apply-</li>
            <li>i have medium-thick, normal hair</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it...</li>
            <li>I get a style that holds all day looking soft and natural.</li>
            <li>I have fine very straight hair, so probably it was just a poor choice for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d been buying this styling lotion for years at a local salon, but I found that I can usually get it for a much better price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight- doesn&#x27;t feel like there is any gunk in your hair like some other volumizing products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so disappointed because it has such great reviews.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed because it has such great reviews.</li>
            <li> Now when I added this as well I found my hair was much harder to stay on my curling wand, and actually and definitely did not help style it.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely a splurge in my book, but it has done wonders for my hair (pixie cut, asian hair, DIFFICULT to syle), so it is beyond worth it to</li>
            <li> This is Watered down and Barely works.</li>
            <li> Even on the days I don&#x27;t dry my hair, I use this to protect it and get rid of tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put a few different products in my hair religiously after it&#x27;s watched.</li>
            <li> I spray it onto my dry hair just before curling,  will buy again!</li>
            <li> I use this before I blowdry my hair for a little extra volume and styling control.</li>
            <li> Definitely notice a difference in my hair being less frizzy!</li>
            <li> I spray a slight mist on dry hair before curling it.</li>
            <li> Plus a little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> Another thing I like about it is that there&#x27;s absolutely no flaking off of the dried lotion.</li>
            <li> Lots of products make my hair greasy and weigh it down, but not this.</li>
            <li> I just spritz it through my hair after towel drying; then blow dry and style as usual.</li>
            <li> I spritz a little on and comb it through before blow drying or styling</li>
            <li> , it is even a little humidity resistant.</li>
            <li> the spout is like a narrow spray gel</li>
            <li> It made my hair look sort of greasy when it dried.</li>
            <li> I think it actually made it worse.</li>
            <li> The only product that works for my thin, limp hair.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to get it all over your hair.</li>
            <li> In the morning it&#x27;s literally Victoria Secret waves.</li>
            <li> It may just be the wrong product for my hair type.</li>

            <li> Great for styling hair. I spritz a little on and comb it through before blow drying or styling and i sometimes spritz a little more after I&#x27;m done to keep everything together. Gives my hair good texture for styling and provides a very light hairspray-like hold.</li>
            <li> Bumble and Bumble products never cease to amaze me!  This lotion makes my hair so soft, I use it for blow drying and also use it to set my hair with large rollers for volume, it is even a little humidity resistant.</li>
            <li> This really helps my hair to curl. I spray it onto my dry hair just before curling,  will buy again!</li>
            <li> love this product, but when it arrived the cap was cracked.Doesn&#x27;t affect the product except I can&#x27;t pack it and take it anywhere</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and I love it. I&#x27;ve strayed a couple of times, trying to find something cheaper, but my hair suffered and so I&#x27;ve come back for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lightweight spray works great to detangle, smooth, shine, and add manageability to most any hair type, but I use it daily on my fine, straight but thick and colored/highlighted hair. Lots of products make my hair greasy and weigh it down, but not this. It detangles it, protects it from heat (I blowdry my hair each day), and really adds a bit of volume and shine, too, which for my hair type is nothing short of amazing. Even on the days I don&#x27;t dry my hair, I use this to protect it and get rid of tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in conjunction with Garnier Fructis&#x27; Color protect shampoo/conditioner, as well as Alterna&#x27;s Caviar CC cream, and my hair has never looked better. Highly recommended, especially if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product to style and protect hair from heat damage during straightening or curling. Since I&#x27;ve been using this product I have noticed a significant reduction in split ends. My hair dresser even commented.</li>
            <li> Nice for heat protection and volumizing but hard to apply- the spout is like a narrow spray gel so it&#x27;s hard to get it all over your hair. Smells nice. Great for blow-drying. Very lightweight- doesn&#x27;t feel like there is any gunk in your hair like some other volumizing products.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It helps keep curl in with no stickiness or alcohol smell.  It is my second bottle and nothing else compares.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much product on my hair after washing it, but bumble &amp; bumble is light but gives me umph.  When I couldn&#x27;t get it over the counter anymore, Amazon had the best price.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I use this before I blowdry my hair for a little extra volume and styling control. I spray a slight mist on dry hair before curling it. This with Bumble&#x27;s setting, very flexible hold hairspray I get a style that holds all day looking soft and natural. i have medium-thick, normal hair and I was able to try this at a salon before trying it, but I know I will never not be using this product with my hair.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work out for me. It may just be the wrong product for my hair type. It made my hair look sort of greasy when it dried. I have fine very straight hair, so probably it was just a poor choice for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while. It helps from damaging my hair from using a hair curler or iron. It also gives your hair shine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to figure out exactly what the lotion is supposed to do. I sometimes spray it before curling my hair with my straightner and it gives it a nice \\&quot;va-va-voom\\&quot; but doesn&#x27;t curl as well. And John Frida&#x27;s Frizz-Ease definitely still works better for anti-humidity. I still enjoy it, though.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair shiny and protected from heat damage! Plus a little bit goes a long way so its not the cheapest product but I usually only have to buy this once a year and I use it daily!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair so I try different lotions.  This was o.k.</li>
            <li> This product is great! Definitely notice a difference in my hair being less frizzy!</li>
            <li> I spray this into my hair at night before I whip it in a bun and sleep on it. In the morning it&#x27;s literally Victoria Secret waves. It holds curl very well and smells good too!</li>
            <li> Great for fine hair when combined with heat styling.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time about a week ago. I put a few different products in my hair religiously after it&#x27;s watched. A moisturizer and a leave in spray were added as well when I tried this styling lotion. I&#x27;ve never had issues with either of the products, only positives! Now when I added this as well I found my hair was much harder to stay on my curling wand, and actually and definitely did not help style it. I think it actually made it worse. I&#x27;m so disappointed because it has such great reviews. I will mess around with it some more and give it another chance but for it&#x27;s price, when I run out I won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This is Watered down and Barely works. Pay the money at the salon.</li>
            <li> This styling lotion is the best I have ever tried.  It does not leave a sticky residue.  Yet it keeps the hairstyle in place without hairspray.</li>
            <li> The only product that works for my thin, limp hair.  Can&#x27;t live without it...does everything I need it to do and more.</li>
            <li> love this product-lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  I just spritz it through my hair after towel drying; then blow dry and style as usual.

I&#x27;ve tried so many different products to achieve the same effect the this styling lotion imparts but have not succeeded.
