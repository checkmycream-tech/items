    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best price for the amount is the 6oz bottle.</li>
            <li>Wonderful cologne.</li>
            <li>but he was very happy with it,</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my uncle and he loved it!</li>
            <li>Amazon also did a great job on delivery because I had it in no time after my order.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Smells so good she can&#x27;t handle it sometimes</li>
            <li>Always good.</li>
            <li>This New Perfume is a excellent Product Good Size I recommend It!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Essenza has a very refreshing manly scent.</li>
            <li>The smell is good but despite Eau De Parfum, the smell doesn&#x27;t stay for more than an hour.</li>
            <li>I kind of figured that the price was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>Smells okay</li>
            <li>I bought two more 6 oz.</li>
            <li>Whereas the one I got from Macy&#x27;s lasts more than a day.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne on my husband.</li>
            <li>It is ok</li>
            <li>but my favorite is Armani</li>
            <li>I love it as it has got some characteristics and is the ONE for males.</li>
            <li>Got this for christmas and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Normally, I have nothing but good to say about Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Very rich fragrance, sweet smell that lingers for a while.</li>
            <li>good buy, satisfied with the purchase, smooth scent that stays long :)</li>
            <li>Light sprits is all I need.</li>
            <li>Sure, I paid anywhere from $20-$80 more, but it put my mind at ease knowing that it was real.</li>
            <li>Smell lasts all day, very fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I like to mix this with the original...</li>
            <li>Stick with the original.</li>
            <li>Had bought originally a 1.3 oz bottle at Dillard for $85.</li>
            <li>It is a parfum (so more concentration of the fragrance source) and the scent [fortunately] stays on your skin much longer.</li>
            <li>I like it as much as he does:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s either that, or I got super unlucky.</li>
            <li>I might consider giving them another chance and ordering this from them again once my current bottles run out (the price is good, no argument there) , but if you want to take zero risks, albeit higher price, stick to department stores.</li>
            <li>this is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne and not always easily found locally.  </li>
            <li>but worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you like the original, you will most likely like this one.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know why I was sent a counterfeit, but the price is a little too good to be true.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not over-powering - just right - lasts all day...</li>
            <li>bottles, one from from a Duty Free at the airport across the United States, and the other from a nearby department store , both of which were authentic (the packaging, the color, and the smell).</li>
            <li>The smell is very international and sexy.</li>
            <li>When I first sprayed it right after opening the box, it smelled \\&quot;similar\\&quot; to the real stuff, but not identical.</li>
            <li>I own many different fragrances and this one was not worth the money to me.</li>
            <li>The magnetic cap is very functional and a smart solution!</li>
            <li>and it is very noticeably better and different.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t pay much attention at first, but after 30 minutes or so, the smell on my body wasn&#x27;t Essenza, but some scent very close to rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>Amazon really needs to take a closer look as to quality of their stock that they sell.</li>
            <li>Just as intense as the de toilette but lasts longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Secondly, the color of the cologne was different from what I have seen; the one I got was clear and had no color, whereas the ones I&#x27;ve sampled were more of a light and transparent shade of goldenrod.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really am hoping that I did get unlucky, because I really like Amazon, but they pulled one on me this time.</li>
            <li>, I could immediately tell this was not the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I still have some of the real cologne, purchased from Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m here to testify that this is the real deal...</li>
            <li>i think this cologne is slightly different from the last time i purchased it, but it still smells nicely</li>
            <li>I previously owned Giorgio Armani&#x27;s other cologne  Acqua Di Gio and loved it!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this fragrance to anyone.</li>
            <li>The scent smells different on different people and you might not be used to the (EDP) new type, plus your senses change ; that being said, this is a genuine product...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Moving on to the most important thing which convinced me it was fake was the smell.</li>
            <li>Fresh smell and lasts long.</li>
            <li>First off let me say the two fragrances are VERY similar.</li>
            <li>I am beginning to wonder if Amazon sells seriously old stock or if they knowingly sell counterfeits.  </li>
            <li>I cannot really go into the specifics of the smell, but if I were to vaguely describe it, it would fall along the lines of a light &amp; fresh cologne that is semi-sweet with hints of citrus.</li>
            <li>Not sure whether product is genuine.</li>
            <li>First of all, it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the Essenza</li>
            <li>There are no regrets.</li>
            <li>So, either this is a very watered down Essenza</li>
            <li>I also am not sure this is a genuine product like other people have mentioned.</li>

            <li> There are no regrets.</li>
            <li> So, either this is a very watered down Essenza</li>
            <li> I also am not sure this is a genuine product like other people have mentioned.</li>
            <li> The bottle amout is enough for a long time usage.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay for long enough time either.</li>
            <li> much as I love the Essenza EDP as an overall product, the one I received from Amazon was disappointing.</li>
            <li> I now see other reviews by people for several different scents</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some other reviews here that says it does not last long</li>
            <li> Does not live up to advertised hype.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price is a bit up there, especially if you consider the department store price (nearly double), but for the same reason, less people will have it/use it, and you can strive to be a little unique.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The following day, I sprayed it farther from my body, but it had the alcohol scent again after half an hour.</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long Long Long Way?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased some fakes of this very cologne in the past and my wife was not pleased.</li>
            <li> Used less and it lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> My job has a restaurant for its staff and usually anyone who eats there leaves smelling of food because the ventilation system to keep the food scent out of the eating area stopped working recently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was watered down, \\&quot;damaged\\&quot; or just flat out</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but told myself maybe I sprayed too much and too close to my body.</li>
            <li> Get a bigger one (at least 3 to 6 ounce) as the one (Giorgio Armani For Men-Eau De Toilette) sold in the Amazon website is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Scent is very weak and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> After a few hours, I can&#x27;t even smell it.</li>
            <li> A waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> Even though being EDP it is not a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very small (less than 2 inch size bottle)and charging 20 US dollars.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Acqua Di Dio as one of my go-to fragrances in the past, and the Essenza EDP is an improved version of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had every order (the past 4 years this product has been avaliable for the discount)  </li>
            <li> But do not buy the small Giorgio Armani For Men-Eau De Toilette(.17 ounce).</li>
            <li> Additionally, by getting these two, it had convinced me that the one I received on Amazon was fake simply due to</li>
            <li> This pattern remained unchanged, but eventually took a turn for the worse because it began to smell like alcohol even sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like the smell, but it is expensive.</li>
            <li> I blind bought this thinking</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with Armani.</li>
            <li> Expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> for the money spent absolutely horrible purchase which I wish never happened.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;SO DISAPPOINTING</li>
            <li> Wtf!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all these bad reviews are about...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am beginning to wonder if Amazon sells seriously old stock or if they knowingly sell counterfeits.  Regardless, the smell lasts all of 30 minutes and then it is absent from then on...for the money spent absolutely horrible purchase which I wish never happened.  Amazon really needs to take a closer look as to quality of their stock that they sell.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, but it is expensive. The best price for the amount is the 6oz bottle. would buy again</li>
            <li> Just as intense as the de toilette but lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;Get it.  There are no regrets.</li>
            <li> Smells okay but I recommend trying it before you buy. I blind bought this thinking I couldn&#x27;t go wrong with Armani. I own many different fragrances and this one was not worth the money to me. I ended up giving it away as a gift.</li>
            <li> Not what &amp;#34;everybody&#x27;s wearing&amp;#34; - strive to be different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive but worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not over-powering - just right - lasts all day...</li>
            <li> Fresh smell and lasts long. I temporarily put aside my Lacoste white, Tuscanny Per Uomo and CK ONe Summer. Light sprits is all I need.</li>
            <li> Smells stronger than the one I buy in the store.  Used less and it lasted a long time.  Wonderful cologne.</li>
            <li> He loves this  scent. A lot of men do , not one of my favoirites but he was very happy with it,</li>
            <li> The product itself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Acqua Di Dio as one of my go-to fragrances in the past, and the Essenza EDP is an improved version of it. If you like the original, you will most likely like this one. It is a parfum (so more concentration of the fragrance source) and the scent [fortunately] stays on your skin much longer. I cannot really go into the specifics of the smell, but if I were to vaguely describe it, it would fall along the lines of a light &amp; fresh cologne that is semi-sweet with hints of citrus. Definitely not woody or smoky side of fragrance lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is a bit up there, especially if you consider the department store price (nearly double), but for the same reason, less people will have it/use it, and you can strive to be a little unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product I received:&lt;br /&gt;(this is not about the commercial product, but the specific one I received from Amazon in 2012)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I love the Essenza EDP as an overall product, the one I received from Amazon was disappointing. I&#x27;m not sure if it was watered down, \\&quot;damaged\\&quot; or just flat out fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin with, the interior of the fragrance box had several \\&quot;tear\\&quot; marks (imagine removing a sticker from a box and ripping the surface coating/layer off). Secondly, the color of the cologne was different from what I have seen; the one I got was clear and had no color, whereas the ones I&#x27;ve sampled were more of a light and transparent shade of goldenrod.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on to the most important thing which convinced me it was fake was the smell. I tried samples from department stores so I know how it should smell. When I first sprayed it right after opening the box, it smelled \\&quot;similar\\&quot; to the real stuff, but not identical. I didn&#x27;t pay much attention at first, but after 30 minutes or so, the smell on my body wasn&#x27;t Essenza, but some scent very close to rubbing alcohol. I was skeptical, but told myself maybe I sprayed too much and too close to my body. The following day, I sprayed it farther from my body, but it had the alcohol scent again after half an hour. This pattern remained unchanged, but eventually took a turn for the worse because it began to smell like alcohol even sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why I was sent a counterfeit, but the price is a little too good to be true. It&#x27;s either that, or I got super unlucky. I bought two more 6 oz. bottles, one from from a Duty Free at the airport across the United States, and the other from a nearby department store , both of which were authentic (the packaging, the color, and the smell). Sure, I paid anywhere from $20-$80 more, but it put my mind at ease knowing that it was real. Additionally, by getting these two, it had convinced me that the one I received on Amazon was fake simply due to the differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really am hoping that I did get unlucky, because I really like Amazon, but they pulled one on me this time. I might consider giving them another chance and ordering this from them again once my current bottles run out (the price is good, no argument there) , but if you want to take zero risks, albeit higher price, stick to department stores.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied. I&#x27;ve purchased some fakes of this very cologne in the past and my wife was not pleased. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item from Amazon (ships by and sold from Amazon). First of all, it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as the Essenza I bought from Macy&#x27;s. After a few hours, I can&#x27;t even smell it. Whereas the one I got from Macy&#x27;s lasts more than a day. Smell is also different. Bottle seems to be legitimate with the magnetic cap and matching serial numbers. So, either this is a very watered down Essenza or it is not stored properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Do not buy even if it is sold by Amazon!</li>
            <li> I kind of figured that the price was too good to be true.  When I received my package, it all looked legit, however, after opening and trying some on, I could immediately tell this was not the real thing.  Even the color of the cologne is off.  I still have some of the real cologne, purchased from Macy&#x27;s and it is very noticeably better and different. I will be returning this to Amazon.  I now see other reviews by people for several different scents say that Amazon sells fakes.  A waste of time and money.  Normally, I have nothing but good to say about Amazon.  Not this time.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my uncle and he loved it!</li>
            <li> Girlfriend couldn&#x27;t be happier about this purchase. Smells so good she can&#x27;t handle it sometimes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all these bad reviews are about... I&#x27;ve had every order (the past 4 years this product has been avaliable for the discount)  authenticed and I&#x27;m here to testify that this is the real deal... The scent smells different on different people and you might not be used to the (EDP) new type, plus your senses change ; that being said, this is a genuine product... 90 doll hair savings, every 7 months or so. Cause I use a lot... Keep Em coming... I like to mix this with the original... With a sprits of CK1 every now and then, you know, to switch it up...</li>
            <li> this is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne and not always easily found locally.  I like it as much as he does:)</li>
            <li> i think this cologne is slightly different from the last time i purchased it, but it still smells nicely</li>
            <li> Scent is very weak and doesn&#x27;t last long. Does not live up to advertised hype. Would not buy again. Stick with the original.</li>
            <li> Very rich fragrance, sweet smell that lingers for a while. Recommended. Will receive compliments.</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long Long Long Way?</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne on my husband. The smell is very international and sexy. Everyone complements him. It reminds me of vacation in Ibiza, Spain.</li>
            <li> This New Perfume is a excellent Product Good Size I recommend It! The magnetic cap is very functional and a smart solution!</li>
            <li> It is ok but my favorite is Armani By Giorgio Armani For Men-Eau De Toilette. I love it as it has got some characteristics and is the ONE for males. But do not buy the small Giorgio Armani For Men-Eau De Toilette(.17 ounce). Get a bigger one (at least 3 to 6 ounce) as the one (Giorgio Armani For Men-Eau De Toilette) sold in the Amazon website is a waste of money. Very small (less than 2 inch size bottle)and charging 20 US dollars.</li>
            <li> Got this for christmas and I absolutely love it. Smell lasts all day, very fresh scent. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I previously owned Giorgio Armani&#x27;s other cologne  Acqua Di Gio and loved it! I saw gio armani essenza in a department store and immediately decided to sample it. First off let me say the two fragrances are VERY similar. Essenza has a very refreshing manly scent. I&#x27;ve read some other reviews here that says it does not last long but I have never had that experience with this cologne.  My job has a restaurant for its staff and usually anyone who eats there leaves smelling of food because the ventilation system to keep the food scent out of the eating area stopped working recently. This cologne survived the scent of food which lingers on your clothes, it actually over powered it without being overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I wear this cologne I ALWAYS get compliments, especially from women. I would highly recommend this fragrance to anyone. Amazon also did a great job on delivery because I had it in no time after my order.</li>
            <li> The smell is good but despite Eau De Parfum, the smell doesn&#x27;t stay for more than an hour. Not sure whether product is genuine. Before placing the order went to Macys and the tester was exellent and smell stayed for almost two days.</li>
            <li> Always good. I buy it for years.</li>
            <li> It was fake.&lt;br /&gt;I got it as a gift and I have recently realized it was fake.&lt;br /&gt;SO DISAPPOINTING</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time. Even though being EDP it is not a strong fragrance. The bottle amout is enough for a long time usage.</li>
            <li> Expensive for what you get. Doesn&#x27;t stay for long enough time either. I would not recommend this one to anyone</li>
            <li> This was a Prime product and took 5 days to get it. I also am not sure this is a genuine product like other people have mentioned.</li>
            <li> good buy, satisfied with the purchase, smooth scent that stays long :)</li>
            <li> Had bought originally a 1.3 oz bottle at Dillard for $85. But saw the 6oz for $90. Wtf! Refund! This one will do but I wondered if there was a difference in quality.</li>
