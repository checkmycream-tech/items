            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love CND products and this is no exception!</li>
            <li>It provides an excellent first layer to hold on your polish of choice.</li>
            <li>Love this item!  </li>
            <li>You will love this product!</li>
            <li>The nail polish itself is awesome in the first month.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>It takes something that&#x27;&#x27;s supposed to make you look nice, and makes your hands look unkempt.</li>
            <li>Normally I do my own nails with CND Shellac product.  </li>
            <li>I would never have bought it on my own</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in day 3 now of my own manicure</li>
            <li>Formula is awesome and one dip covers one whole hand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a must have for those who do their own manicures.</li>
            <li>My nails stay looking nice longer.</li>
            <li>So glad I invested in good quality products.</li>
            <li>works super great.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more! :)</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s works even better with cnd top shine !</li>
            <li>The basecoat provides a great foundation to your manicure and the polish really does stick much better!</li>
            <li>Great product and highly recommend for any ladies who love their nail art, but hates the chipping!</li>
            <li>My new favorite top coat, wish it was a bit thicker but its still really awesome top coat.</li>
            <li>Hope it works better for you than it did for me.</li>
            <li>I applied a coat before the color and another coat on top of my color before my top coat.</li>
            <li>CND stickey polish is 3 free and does what it says!</li>
            <li>Be sure and try it</li>
            <li>Have tried many brands -- OPI, Essie, Orly, Deborah Lippman</li>
            <li>I do still use a non-chip top coat</li>
            <li>Love it :)</li>
            <li>However when I did not use the product and used a better nail polish</li>
            <li>I did not find CND Stickey to work as well and made the switch to Essie instead which seems more nourishing on my nails as well.</li>
            <li>It seems to work better if you do one hand at a time.</li>
            <li>I order extras to make sure I have both products on hand at all times.</li>
            <li>Better than nothing, but nothing majical.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I seen many recommendation of it</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Nail polish does not stay on my nails for more than a day or two without this product.</li>
            <li>Now polish lasts for a week or more.</li>
            <li>, I could see the window on my nail because the reflection of the shiny top coat.</li>
            <li>but besides that i still love it</li>
            <li>I am so glad she did.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been pleased with my purchases on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the others will peel soon</li>
            <li>Nothing works better.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will be buying again.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>:) It&#x27;s cheaper to buy this than get my nails done at a salon.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>have found that if I apply it after using OPI Skip Chip, I get better results.</li>
            <li>The basecoat, with the top coat...</li>
            <li>It really works great.</li>
            <li>Mostly because I have a lot of oils in my nails and polish does not adhere well.</li>
            <li>and I used the Seche Vita top coat.</li>
            <li>Love it, Recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>while &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; place the color on top.</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li>My polish lasts more than a week or so (depending on the top brand).</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>A friend told me about it, and I thought, here&#x27;s one more product that does not work.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than any</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell if it makes my manicure any better.  </li>
            <li>Did not notice any improvement when applying polish on top.  </li>
            <li>This product helps the spreading of the polish to be more even.</li>
            <li>It really helps the polish stay on longer and is truly a great product.</li>
            <li>Polish doubles its staying time with this and its lovely counterpart, Seche Vite top coat.</li>
            <li>give the nail polish a smooth application!  </li>
            <li>Grab more then one  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, works great for nail art and dries fast.</li>
            <li>My manicure has lasted nearly a week and still looks beautiful.  </li>
            <li>This basecoat let&#x27;s me get weeks of wear out of the cute (and cheap) drugstore polish that I love.</li>
            <li>they are my very first CND&#x27;s ever to own.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s significantly better than some of the other excellent products out there.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good, nail polish lasts for a few days with no chips, but works best with the CnD top coat as well.</li>
            <li>My manicure would look great for a full 5-7 days, but it was high maintenance.</li>
            <li>I am in front of a computer all day for work, so my polish chips very quickly and often I have to change my color 1-2 times a week.</li>
            <li>What I will say: this product goes on easily, and does smooth out the nail.</li>
            <li>goes on smooth, sleek and easy.</li>
            <li>I love using this when I want a quick polish and don&#x27;t feel like dealing with taking off the gel polish after a week.  </li>
            <li>It gave my nails a smooth &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; for my polish.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m going to do all my nails over, with no base coat.</li>
            <li>Great product couldn&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
            <li>Worth the $$$ :)</li>
            <li>Used in salons,now available at home.  </li>
            <li>My nail polish still chipped every time I would polish them, and I do not buy cheap polish.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>It was well worth the search and the trip to go get it!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this after reading reviews.</li>
            <li>Worth the splurge!</li>
            <li>I was excited to find a product that would minimize nail polish chipping.</li>
            <li>It is a very good base coat, the best one I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>My design this week included one color in OPI, one from Essie, and one Sally Hansen insta dry, so they all worked great</li>
            <li>I received it right on time, very quick.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase, and I will be back to painting my own nails again!</li>
            <li>I wash my hands frequently, since I teach Pre-K and have 3 children of my own.</li>
            <li>It really does make the nail polish adhere better, and resist chipping and peeling.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad it does help some to keep the polish on.</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of the right amount, it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li>This is a great compliment to the other nail products.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m lucky if I make it a week without having to take it off.    </li>
            <li>I bought this because it claimed to help keep nails from chipping as quickly.  </li>
            <li>It even keeps my super cheap fast drying polish on!</li>
            <li>In less than 30 minutes I have a great manicure that lasts 2-3 times longer than before using the CND products.</li>
            <li>This product will literally hold my manicure for up to a whole week without chipping!!</li>
            <li>excellent for weak and brittle nails.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this and clear color and top coat.  </li>
            <li>These 3 polishes were fun to try mind</li>
            <li>I use this every time I give myself a fresh Manicure.</li>
            <li>Made sure to wash dishes with gloves and didn&#x27;t do too much housework (really anything that will ruin the manicure.).</li>
            <li>This basecoat is effective in making my polish last for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>worth it</li>
            <li>This stuff dries pretty quickly, too.&lt;br /&gt;Put</li>
            <li>and it looks like I came right out of a salon.  </li>
            <li>If you have oily nail beds and your polish peels right off like mine did, you should give this a try.</li>
            <li>before chipping, now (if paired with the right polish), I can go 5 days without seeing a chip.</li>
            <li>After 5-7 days I add a whole new coat of color plus another top coat.</li>
            <li>Combine it with their Super Shiny top coat &amp; your polish will last longer than your pedi/mani.  </li>
            <li>It goes on and dries quick ready for the nail polish color.</li>
            <li>Then 2 coats of polish (any brand), then follow with a nice thick coat of CND Vinylux Top Coat.</li>
            <li>It also dries very fast,</li>
            <li>This combined with wrapping my tips and using Poshe quick dry top coat, my mani lasts 6+ days without chips or tip wear.</li>
            <li>I use it with CND&#x27;S quick dry top coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is a bit strong, but it dissipates pretty quickly, and it doesn&#x27;t add too much extra time to your manicure since it also dries</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this, I put OPI \\&quot;You</li>
            <li>Next I&#x27;m trying CND top coat.</li>
            <li>First of all, my husband and I share this account so I (the wife) am writing this.</li>
            <li>Use this along with the CND top coat for even longer lasting results.  </li>
            <li>It makes my nail polish last for more than 4 days.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something to consider, if you are interested).  </li>
            <li>The one I got looks different from the picture shown, but it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I work with my hands a lot, so I was so glad when I found this stuff - as it actually prolongs my mani.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product it makes my polish last 10 days!</li>
            <li>Really keeps my polish on well!</li>
            <li>I make sure I have several on hand, and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>You can see it through clear or light colored polishes.</li>
            <li>My product is exactly as described &amp; I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it;)</li>
            <li>This is exactly as it says..</li>
            <li>It really does an excellent job of anchoring your nail polish down, and it makes my at-home manicures last much longer than they ever did before I began using</li>
            <li>I got the Pink CND and Super Shiny top coat to review.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this to everyone who wants a salon quality manicure :)</li>
            <li>Granted, my nails tend to chip easily despite the fact that I keep them very short.</li>
            <li>be sure to get it all because the Dry Kwik is oily.</li>
            <li>I used to touch up the tips of my nails every single night and add a coat of top coat.</li>
            <li>It certainly kept the polish on my nails.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s easy to apply and fast drying to add the next color cost ...</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, protects my nails &amp; really helps my manicures last longer.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s nearly a whole week.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>It really helps the color stick and go on evenly.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I expected so much more from this product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this really helps, but I keep this along with my Essie topcoat in the fridge.  </li>
            <li>So much so that I wound up just not using any.</li>
            <li>It really prevents your nail polish from chipping or peeling away.  </li>
            <li>very toxic smelling stuff, immediate headache had to throw it out</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful after reading the reviews on this product.   </li>
            <li>It leaves a smooth surface for the next layer of polish to go on to.</li>
            <li>I really like the brush</li>
            <li>The price is comparable to drug store brands, so you really aren&#x27;t losing anything by trying it.  </li>
            <li>I just expected more from a hyped product/company.  </li>
            <li>This product really helped the polish stay on my fingers...</li>
            <li>This basecoat really makes all the difference in extending a manicure.</li>
            <li>it makes my polish much easier to peal off when it&#x27;s time for it to go.</li>
            <li>Very protective but can cause paint to peel off easier ( in one piece)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this helped my nail polish stay on very well.</li>
            <li>My polish applied smoothly and dried looking top notch professional.</li>
            <li>but she was able to wear that manicure for a few days longer which is a success to me.</li>
            <li>Also I love that it is a thin formula because it is easy to apply and dries fast!</li>
            <li>The pink CND is a very bold and pretty color.</li>
            <li>I gave it numerous tries with many different polishes (Essie, OPI, Chanel, Nars, etc) and top coats (SV, Poshe).</li>
            <li>My polish does seem to resist chipping a little bit more, but it also peels more quickly, so it&#x27;s not really a trade off.  </li>
            <li>but I can say without hesitation that this product works a hundred times better than anything you&#x27;ll find in a drug store OR than whatever they use at your average strip mall nail salon.     </li>
            <li>Then I add a little color on the very edges and another top coat.</li>
            <li>I was new to trying CND products...and they did not disappoint!  </li>
            <li>and whenever I try to use it it bubbled on my nails, hence my new bottle!</li>
            <li>By the next day, I am able to peel it off in an almost entire sheet.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Next I put Sally Hansen&#x27;s Dry Kwik nail polish dryer on top of the polish, leave on for 5 minutes then gently wash this off with liquid soap and water--</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend to use with the CND Super Shiney top coat - the combination of these products along with a high quality polish provides for a long lasting manicure.</li>
            <li>I use it with the new gel polish that you can buy over the counter that does not need a UV light to dry.</li>
            <li>seems like it helped my nail polish stick a little better, was recommended by a manicurist.</li>
            <li>I use this with essie and seche vite top coat for a long lasting, high quality finish.</li>
            <li>Love it and will always buy this as long as possible.</li>
            <li>givin it 3 stars because it is 2 days longer than they normally chip</li>
            <li>when I&#x27;m done applying Stickey to all ten fingers, I can start with the colored varnish straight away on my first nail.</li>
            <li>Normally when I put polish on, it starts peeling off on day one.  </li>
            <li>It took quite a while for my nails to return to their normal status</li>
            <li>I do the right hand in the same way.</li>
            <li>I change my polish far too frequently to really speak to the longevity, but no complaints so far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought so many different base coats and this is definitely the best.</li>
            <li>New item for me.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t work, I just had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this as much as everyone else, especially because my nail polish chips after a day or two.</li>
            <li>Went on smooth even when there was only a teeny bit left in the bottle.</li>
            <li>my polish lasts a full 7 days without chipping (as long as it&#x27;s not super cheap polish, which is going to chip regardless).</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good base coat for years as I love nail polish but</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t deduct any stars for this issue, I was just a bit surprised at first that it did not dry</li>
            <li>I am on day three with no chipping, which is usually not the case.</li>
            <li>really well to the nail, so far so good, 3rd day, and polish hasn&#x27;t chipped, usually my nails chip on the same day, i paint them, I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li>BUT, even with light pastel polish and only a few days&#x27; wear, there is SIGNIFICANT yellow staining on my nails after using it.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough positive about CND stickey.</li>
            <li>It is the best base coat when new.</li>
            <li>I have a habit of smacking into things (accidentally), and most of my previous manicures would last, unchipped, about 3 days, tops.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and actually makes my manicures last longer.</li>
            <li>With using this product, I still had to polish my nails pretty much every other day or not wear nail polish at all, because of my busy schedule.</li>
            <li>Makes polish last SO MUCH longer.  </li>
            <li>Would not waste my time polishing nails without it.</li>
            <li>I have natural nails and never polish them because with a clerical job, the polish chips within one day of polishing my nails.  </li>
            <li>It allows those of us with natural nails to wear polish and look polished like we have acrylic nails on.  </li>
            <li>(at least better than any of these).  </li>
            <li>It does really seem to make the manicure last longer, meaning no lifting or chipping of the polish.  </li>
            <li>It really makes your polish last longer.  </li>
            <li>but i was hoping for at least a week when i used CND top coat as well.</li>
            <li>I was pleasently surprised.  </li>
            <li>Helps so much when it comes to making my polish last.</li>
            <li>My hands are busy</li>
            <li>The best thing ever...can&#x27;t complain about this nail base.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST base coat....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent base coat .</li>
            <li>So my quest for the perfect base coat continues...</li>
            <li>This base coat is the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This product is the best base coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>This base coat is awesome.</li>
            <li>This is a nice &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; base coat, and does seem to help polish adhere better.</li>
            <li>One of the best base coats I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The base coat works awesome !</li>
            <li>This is one if the best base coats I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>First, let your nails dry completely before applying any nail polish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super sticky, so it allows for maximum adherence; I usually do a coat at the very tip of my nails (where chips start), which helps polish stay on longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only two days in, but my mani still looks like new!</li>
            <li>During the fourth week I begin to apply my nail polish first and the stickey second</li>
            <li>I always painted my nails prior to this with no problem, I&#x27;ll just chalk it up to getting older.  </li>
            <li>In the left picture I just did pink and super shiny, and wow it is like mirror shiny</li>
            <li>This is the best base I&#x27;ve found for bare nails before applying nail polish.  </li>
            <li>I usually use OPI nail polish, so it is not like I am using cheap polish.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time for reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Dries super fast &amp; a little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t over use</li>
            <li>Another application of the Sally Hansen Dry Kwick, leaving on for about 5-10 minutes, longer if you have time, then gently wash it off.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get the larger size just because I don&#x27;t use it up fast enough.</li>
            <li>really great base coat and dries fast</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many nail polishes, top and base coats from a variety of lines.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>In most cases it would not make any issues I suppose, but you need to be careful about polishes perfectly over any of this base coat or you might get a slight grey cast at an edge.</li>
            <li>I only gave this product four stars,because, although it works pretty well, I have a couple different products that do the same thing just as well, and they are a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>This pruduct in only sold at professional hair salons, but my salon doesn&#x27;t sell this product so as always I could count  on amazon!</li>
            <li>This is a great base coat, one of the best I have used so far, and I&#x27;ve used base coats from OPI, Essie, China Glaze, and Sally Hansen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very nice base coat; highly recommend!</li>
            <li>For me, there isn&#x27;t a huge difference in the time my polish lasts using this and using nothing, and at least by using nothing, I avoid all the chemicals involved with painting and with removal (your nail beds are rather absorbent, which makes me think twice about the things I put on them.  </li>
            <li>I used this, then painted two coats of regular china glaze polish, and my nails definetly stayed chip free for longer than usual.</li>
            <li>I used to spend $3 extra when I got a professional manicure for this nail polish.  </li>
            <li>So far only tried it once, with Esse Polish, but I think it keeps color on for longer.  </li>
            <li>this product was featured in In Style&#x27;s bests but so far I think it&#x27;s so so, after I applied it to my nail, the polish still lasts only two to three days</li>
            <li>I always only do natural nail designs.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li>By starting with sticky &amp; ending with shiney, I can get about a week from my manicure when used with OPI polish on natural nails.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it has made it past one full day EVER.</li>
            <li>I used a thin coat of Stickey, 2 coats of my Essie polish and a coat of SV as a top coat.</li>
            <li>I really like Seche Vita top coat, but I was not crazy about the base coat, so I tried this.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and pedicures will last at least 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently wearing a home manicure of my regular old polish from two weeks ago!</li>
            <li>This is the best base coat I&#x27;ve found, especially when used in conjunction with CND Air Dry finish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a preschool teacher with my hands in water many times a day, &amp; my feet, oh my poor feet, stepped on regularly in my open toed shoes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Friday night, I noticed the first little chip.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried maybe 2-3 different base coats before this one, but I just love how smooth this goes on.</li>
            <li>Then I apply a coat of CND Air Dry finish, which is a fast dry polish in itself.</li>
            <li>The Kwik Dry makes my nails dry faster, otherwise they stay tacky much longer.  </li>
            <li>They seem to be growing fast and less breakage</li>
            <li>/&gt;Alcohol denat., ethyl acetate, heptane, butyl acetate, polyvinyl butyral, trimethyl pentanyl diisobutyrate (moderate to high toxicity concern in humans, organ toxicity and bioaccumulation), nitrocellulose (classified as expected to be toxic or harmful), tosylamide/epoxy resin, isopropyl alcohol (reproductive, organ system and developmental toxicity), benzophenone-1 (human endocrine disruptor)</li>
            <li>Best base coat, hands down (pun intended).</li>
            <li>Best base coat I have used, hands down.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly use it when I am off the Shellac for a few days.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this item!  </li>
            <li> You will love this product!</li>
            <li> The nail polish itself is awesome in the first month.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> It takes something that&#x27;&#x27;s supposed to make you look nice, and makes your hands look unkempt.</li>
            <li> Normally I do my own nails with CND Shellac product.  </li>
            <li> I would never have bought it on my own</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in day 3 now of my own manicure</li>
            <li> Formula is awesome and one dip covers one whole hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must have for those who do their own manicures.</li>
            <li> My nails stay looking nice longer.</li>
            <li> So glad I invested in good quality products.</li>
            <li> works super great.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for more! :)</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s works even better with cnd top shine !</li>
            <li> The basecoat provides a great foundation to your manicure and the polish really does stick much better!</li>
            <li> Great product and highly recommend for any ladies who love their nail art, but hates the chipping!</li>
            <li> My new favorite top coat, wish it was a bit thicker but its still really awesome top coat.</li>
            <li> Hope it works better for you than it did for me.</li>
            <li> I applied a coat before the color and another coat on top of my color before my top coat.</li>
            <li> CND stickey polish is 3 free and does what it says!</li>
            <li> Be sure and try it</li>
            <li> Have tried many brands -- OPI, Essie, Orly, Deborah Lippman</li>
            <li> I do still use a non-chip top coat</li>
            <li> Love it :)</li>
            <li> However when I did not use the product and used a better nail polish</li>
            <li> I did not find CND Stickey to work as well and made the switch to Essie instead which seems more nourishing on my nails as well.</li>
            <li> It seems to work better if you do one hand at a time.</li>
            <li> I order extras to make sure I have both products on hand at all times.</li>
            <li> Better than nothing, but nothing majical.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I seen many recommendation of it</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Nail polish does not stay on my nails for more than a day or two without this product.</li>
            <li> Now polish lasts for a week or more.</li>
            <li> , I could see the window on my nail because the reflection of the shiny top coat.</li>
            <li> but besides that i still love it</li>
            <li> I am so glad she did.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been pleased with my purchases on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the others will peel soon</li>
            <li> Nothing works better.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> :) It&#x27;s cheaper to buy this than get my nails done at a salon.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> have found that if I apply it after using OPI Skip Chip, I get better results.</li>
            <li> The basecoat, with the top coat...</li>
            <li> It really works great.</li>
            <li> Mostly because I have a lot of oils in my nails and polish does not adhere well.</li>
            <li> and I used the Seche Vita top coat.</li>
            <li> Love it, Recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> while &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; place the color on top.</li>
            <li> Just ok.</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li> My polish lasts more than a week or so (depending on the top brand).</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> A friend told me about it, and I thought, here&#x27;s one more product that does not work.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than any</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell if it makes my manicure any better.  </li>
            <li> Did not notice any improvement when applying polish on top.  </li>
            <li> This product helps the spreading of the polish to be more even.</li>
            <li> It really helps the polish stay on longer and is truly a great product.</li>
            <li> Polish doubles its staying time with this and its lovely counterpart, Seche Vite top coat.</li>
            <li> give the nail polish a smooth application!  </li>
            <li> Grab more then one  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works great for nail art and dries fast.</li>
            <li> My manicure has lasted nearly a week and still looks beautiful.  </li>
            <li> This basecoat let&#x27;s me get weeks of wear out of the cute (and cheap) drugstore polish that I love.</li>
            <li> they are my very first CND&#x27;s ever to own.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s significantly better than some of the other excellent products out there.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, nail polish lasts for a few days with no chips, but works best with the CnD top coat as well.</li>
            <li> My manicure would look great for a full 5-7 days, but it was high maintenance.</li>
            <li> I am in front of a computer all day for work, so my polish chips very quickly and often I have to change my color 1-2 times a week.</li>
            <li> What I will say: this product goes on easily, and does smooth out the nail.</li>
            <li> goes on smooth, sleek and easy.</li>
            <li> I love using this when I want a quick polish and don&#x27;t feel like dealing with taking off the gel polish after a week.  </li>
            <li> It gave my nails a smooth &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; for my polish.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going to do all my nails over, with no base coat.</li>
            <li> Great product couldn&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
            <li> Worth the $$$ :)</li>
            <li> Used in salons,now available at home.  </li>
            <li> My nail polish still chipped every time I would polish them, and I do not buy cheap polish.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> It was well worth the search and the trip to go get it!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this after reading reviews.</li>
            <li> Worth the splurge!</li>
            <li> I was excited to find a product that would minimize nail polish chipping.</li>
            <li> It is a very good base coat, the best one I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> My design this week included one color in OPI, one from Essie, and one Sally Hansen insta dry, so they all worked great</li>
            <li> I received it right on time, very quick.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase, and I will be back to painting my own nails again!</li>
            <li> I wash my hands frequently, since I teach Pre-K and have 3 children of my own.</li>
            <li> It really does make the nail polish adhere better, and resist chipping and peeling.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad it does help some to keep the polish on.</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of the right amount, it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li> This is a great compliment to the other nail products.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m lucky if I make it a week without having to take it off.    </li>
            <li> I bought this because it claimed to help keep nails from chipping as quickly.  </li>
            <li> It even keeps my super cheap fast drying polish on!</li>
            <li> In less than 30 minutes I have a great manicure that lasts 2-3 times longer than before using the CND products.</li>
            <li> This product will literally hold my manicure for up to a whole week without chipping!!</li>
            <li> excellent for weak and brittle nails.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this and clear color and top coat.  </li>
            <li> These 3 polishes were fun to try mind</li>
            <li> I use this every time I give myself a fresh Manicure.</li>
            <li> Made sure to wash dishes with gloves and didn&#x27;t do too much housework (really anything that will ruin the manicure.).</li>
            <li> This basecoat is effective in making my polish last for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> worth it</li>
            <li> This stuff dries pretty quickly, too.&lt;br /&gt;Put</li>
            <li> and it looks like I came right out of a salon.  </li>
            <li> If you have oily nail beds and your polish peels right off like mine did, you should give this a try.</li>
            <li> before chipping, now (if paired with the right polish), I can go 5 days without seeing a chip.</li>
            <li> After 5-7 days I add a whole new coat of color plus another top coat.</li>
            <li> Combine it with their Super Shiny top coat &amp; your polish will last longer than your pedi/mani.  </li>
            <li> It goes on and dries quick ready for the nail polish color.</li>
            <li> Then 2 coats of polish (any brand), then follow with a nice thick coat of CND Vinylux Top Coat.</li>
            <li> It also dries very fast,</li>
            <li> This combined with wrapping my tips and using Poshe quick dry top coat, my mani lasts 6+ days without chips or tip wear.</li>
            <li> I use it with CND&#x27;S quick dry top coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is a bit strong, but it dissipates pretty quickly, and it doesn&#x27;t add too much extra time to your manicure since it also dries</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this, I put OPI \\&quot;You</li>
            <li> Next I&#x27;m trying CND top coat.</li>
            <li> First of all, my husband and I share this account so I (the wife) am writing this.</li>
            <li> Use this along with the CND top coat for even longer lasting results.  </li>
            <li> It makes my nail polish last for more than 4 days.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s something to consider, if you are interested).  </li>
            <li> The one I got looks different from the picture shown, but it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I work with my hands a lot, so I was so glad when I found this stuff - as it actually prolongs my mani.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product it makes my polish last 10 days!</li>
            <li> Really keeps my polish on well!</li>
            <li> I make sure I have several on hand, and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> You can see it through clear or light colored polishes.</li>
            <li> My product is exactly as described &amp; I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it;)</li>
            <li> This is exactly as it says..</li>
            <li> It really does an excellent job of anchoring your nail polish down, and it makes my at-home manicures last much longer than they ever did before I began using</li>
            <li> I got the Pink CND and Super Shiny top coat to review.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this to everyone who wants a salon quality manicure :)</li>
            <li> Granted, my nails tend to chip easily despite the fact that I keep them very short.</li>
            <li> be sure to get it all because the Dry Kwik is oily.</li>
            <li> I used to touch up the tips of my nails every single night and add a coat of top coat.</li>
            <li> It certainly kept the polish on my nails.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s easy to apply and fast drying to add the next color cost ...</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, protects my nails &amp; really helps my manicures last longer.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s nearly a whole week.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> It really helps the color stick and go on evenly.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I expected so much more from this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this really helps, but I keep this along with my Essie topcoat in the fridge.  </li>
            <li> So much so that I wound up just not using any.</li>
            <li> It really prevents your nail polish from chipping or peeling away.  </li>
            <li> very toxic smelling stuff, immediate headache had to throw it out</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful after reading the reviews on this product.   </li>
            <li> It leaves a smooth surface for the next layer of polish to go on to.</li>
            <li> I really like the brush</li>
            <li> The price is comparable to drug store brands, so you really aren&#x27;t losing anything by trying it.  </li>
            <li> I just expected more from a hyped product/company.  </li>
            <li> This product really helped the polish stay on my fingers...</li>
            <li> This basecoat really makes all the difference in extending a manicure.</li>
            <li> it makes my polish much easier to peal off when it&#x27;s time for it to go.</li>
            <li> Very protective but can cause paint to peel off easier ( in one piece)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this helped my nail polish stay on very well.</li>
            <li> My polish applied smoothly and dried looking top notch professional.</li>
            <li> but she was able to wear that manicure for a few days longer which is a success to me.</li>
            <li> Also I love that it is a thin formula because it is easy to apply and dries fast!</li>
            <li> The pink CND is a very bold and pretty color.</li>
            <li> I gave it numerous tries with many different polishes (Essie, OPI, Chanel, Nars, etc) and top coats (SV, Poshe).</li>
            <li> My polish does seem to resist chipping a little bit more, but it also peels more quickly, so it&#x27;s not really a trade off.  </li>
            <li> but I can say without hesitation that this product works a hundred times better than anything you&#x27;ll find in a drug store OR than whatever they use at your average strip mall nail salon.     </li>
            <li> Then I add a little color on the very edges and another top coat.</li>
            <li> I was new to trying CND products...and they did not disappoint!  </li>
            <li> and whenever I try to use it it bubbled on my nails, hence my new bottle!</li>
            <li> By the next day, I am able to peel it off in an almost entire sheet.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Next I put Sally Hansen&#x27;s Dry Kwik nail polish dryer on top of the polish, leave on for 5 minutes then gently wash this off with liquid soap and water--</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend to use with the CND Super Shiney top coat - the combination of these products along with a high quality polish provides for a long lasting manicure.</li>
            <li> I use it with the new gel polish that you can buy over the counter that does not need a UV light to dry.</li>
            <li> seems like it helped my nail polish stick a little better, was recommended by a manicurist.</li>
            <li> I use this with essie and seche vite top coat for a long lasting, high quality finish.</li>
            <li> Love it and will always buy this as long as possible.</li>
            <li> givin it 3 stars because it is 2 days longer than they normally chip</li>
            <li> when I&#x27;m done applying Stickey to all ten fingers, I can start with the colored varnish straight away on my first nail.</li>
            <li> Normally when I put polish on, it starts peeling off on day one.  </li>
            <li> It took quite a while for my nails to return to their normal status</li>
            <li> I do the right hand in the same way.</li>
            <li> I change my polish far too frequently to really speak to the longevity, but no complaints so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought so many different base coats and this is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> New item for me.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t work, I just had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this as much as everyone else, especially because my nail polish chips after a day or two.</li>
            <li> Went on smooth even when there was only a teeny bit left in the bottle.</li>
            <li> my polish lasts a full 7 days without chipping (as long as it&#x27;s not super cheap polish, which is going to chip regardless).</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good base coat for years as I love nail polish but</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t deduct any stars for this issue, I was just a bit surprised at first that it did not dry</li>
            <li> I am on day three with no chipping, which is usually not the case.</li>
            <li> really well to the nail, so far so good, 3rd day, and polish hasn&#x27;t chipped, usually my nails chip on the same day, i paint them, I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> BUT, even with light pastel polish and only a few days&#x27; wear, there is SIGNIFICANT yellow staining on my nails after using it.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say enough positive about CND stickey.</li>
            <li> It is the best base coat when new.</li>
            <li> I have a habit of smacking into things (accidentally), and most of my previous manicures would last, unchipped, about 3 days, tops.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and actually makes my manicures last longer.</li>
            <li> With using this product, I still had to polish my nails pretty much every other day or not wear nail polish at all, because of my busy schedule.</li>
            <li> Makes polish last SO MUCH longer.  </li>
            <li> Would not waste my time polishing nails without it.</li>
            <li> I have natural nails and never polish them because with a clerical job, the polish chips within one day of polishing my nails.  </li>
            <li> It allows those of us with natural nails to wear polish and look polished like we have acrylic nails on.  </li>
            <li> (at least better than any of these).  </li>
            <li> It does really seem to make the manicure last longer, meaning no lifting or chipping of the polish.  </li>
            <li> It really makes your polish last longer.  </li>
            <li> but i was hoping for at least a week when i used CND top coat as well.</li>
            <li> I was pleasently surprised.  </li>
            <li> Helps so much when it comes to making my polish last.</li>
            <li> My hands are busy</li>
            <li> The best thing ever...can&#x27;t complain about this nail base.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST base coat....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent base coat .</li>
            <li> So my quest for the perfect base coat continues...</li>
            <li> This base coat is the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This product is the best base coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> This base coat is awesome.</li>
            <li> This is a nice &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; base coat, and does seem to help polish adhere better.</li>
            <li> One of the best base coats I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The base coat works awesome !</li>
            <li> This is one if the best base coats I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> First, let your nails dry completely before applying any nail polish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super sticky, so it allows for maximum adherence; I usually do a coat at the very tip of my nails (where chips start), which helps polish stay on longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only two days in, but my mani still looks like new!</li>
            <li> During the fourth week I begin to apply my nail polish first and the stickey second</li>
            <li> I always painted my nails prior to this with no problem, I&#x27;ll just chalk it up to getting older.  </li>
            <li> In the left picture I just did pink and super shiny, and wow it is like mirror shiny</li>
            <li> This is the best base I&#x27;ve found for bare nails before applying nail polish.  </li>
            <li> I usually use OPI nail polish, so it is not like I am using cheap polish.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time for reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Dries super fast &amp; a little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t over use</li>
            <li> Another application of the Sally Hansen Dry Kwick, leaving on for about 5-10 minutes, longer if you have time, then gently wash it off.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get the larger size just because I don&#x27;t use it up fast enough.</li>
            <li> really great base coat and dries fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many nail polishes, top and base coats from a variety of lines.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> In most cases it would not make any issues I suppose, but you need to be careful about polishes perfectly over any of this base coat or you might get a slight grey cast at an edge.</li>
            <li> I only gave this product four stars,because, although it works pretty well, I have a couple different products that do the same thing just as well, and they are a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> This pruduct in only sold at professional hair salons, but my salon doesn&#x27;t sell this product so as always I could count  on amazon!</li>
            <li> This is a great base coat, one of the best I have used so far, and I&#x27;ve used base coats from OPI, Essie, China Glaze, and Sally Hansen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very nice base coat; highly recommend!</li>
            <li> For me, there isn&#x27;t a huge difference in the time my polish lasts using this and using nothing, and at least by using nothing, I avoid all the chemicals involved with painting and with removal (your nail beds are rather absorbent, which makes me think twice about the things I put on them.  </li>
            <li> I used this, then painted two coats of regular china glaze polish, and my nails definetly stayed chip free for longer than usual.</li>
            <li> I used to spend $3 extra when I got a professional manicure for this nail polish.  </li>
            <li> So far only tried it once, with Esse Polish, but I think it keeps color on for longer.  </li>
            <li> this product was featured in In Style&#x27;s bests but so far I think it&#x27;s so so, after I applied it to my nail, the polish still lasts only two to three days</li>
            <li> I always only do natural nail designs.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li> By starting with sticky &amp; ending with shiney, I can get about a week from my manicure when used with OPI polish on natural nails.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it has made it past one full day EVER.</li>
            <li> I used a thin coat of Stickey, 2 coats of my Essie polish and a coat of SV as a top coat.</li>
            <li> I really like Seche Vita top coat, but I was not crazy about the base coat, so I tried this.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and pedicures will last at least 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently wearing a home manicure of my regular old polish from two weeks ago!</li>
            <li> This is the best base coat I&#x27;ve found, especially when used in conjunction with CND Air Dry finish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a preschool teacher with my hands in water many times a day, &amp; my feet, oh my poor feet, stepped on regularly in my open toed shoes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Friday night, I noticed the first little chip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried maybe 2-3 different base coats before this one, but I just love how smooth this goes on.</li>
            <li> Then I apply a coat of CND Air Dry finish, which is a fast dry polish in itself.</li>
            <li> The Kwik Dry makes my nails dry faster, otherwise they stay tacky much longer.  </li>
            <li> They seem to be growing fast and less breakage</li>
            <li> /&gt;Alcohol denat., ethyl acetate, heptane, butyl acetate, polyvinyl butyral, trimethyl pentanyl diisobutyrate (moderate to high toxicity concern in humans, organ toxicity and bioaccumulation), nitrocellulose (classified as expected to be toxic or harmful), tosylamide/epoxy resin, isopropyl alcohol (reproductive, organ system and developmental toxicity), benzophenone-1 (human endocrine disruptor)</li>
            <li> Best base coat, hands down (pun intended).</li>
            <li> Best base coat I have used, hands down.  </li>
            <li> I will certainly use it when I am off the Shellac for a few days.  </li>
            <li> These are slightly more expensive than the drug store products, but because my manicure lasts much longer, I use less in the long run.</li>
            <li> The Stickey base coat is something that will take practice finding the right way to do it, but sure gives that jelly look.</li>
            <li> I paint my nails less and less now, because I do a lot with my hands and my polish rarely makes it two days without chipping or peeling.  </li>
            <li> For the first time, I am ready to change the color because I am bored with it and not because I actually have to.</li>
            <li> This makes regular polish last as long as gel.</li>
            <li> it just doesnt last long enough.</li>
            <li> Unheard of before with any other products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative - this stuff dries out very quickly and gets so thick and gunky you can&#x27;t use it, so you really only get about a half bottle&#x27;s worth for the money.</li>
            <li> This base coat is amazing!  </li>
            <li> not sure if it really works or it&#x27;s just in my head.</li>
            <li> Polish does not seem to last as long with the basecoat.</li>
            <li> at long last I have nails.</li>
            <li> It works great and it does last longer than my other base coats.  </li>
            <li> ... was a huge disappointment and did NOT stand up to its claims.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers must have ordered directly but Amazon, I think this item was a fraud.</li>
            <li> It is a slightly tacky basecoat that helps polish adhere and not chip off as early.  </li>
            <li> I do alot of nail art and repaint my nails frequently, and found that this stained my nails a bit green, and left a residue that never went away until i buffed it off.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price, and a thin layer is sufficient so even when doing a manicure and pedicutre 2-3 per month, one bottle should last a while!</li>
            <li> Love this base coat polishes stay much longer now</li>
            <li> When finally used, it did not live up to the advertising.</li>
            <li> I noticed the bottle size has been reduced probably by half and the price is the same or higher, so that&#x27;s disappointing, but overall it&#x27;s still worth it for me.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it that long, but it seems to hold the polish on my daughters nails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I started using these two products, my nails are as long as my sister&#x27;s acrylic nails</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time with no lifting.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to take a long time because the date said about two weeks, so imagine my surprise when I got home and saw this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved this base coat, used it until it was all gone.</li>
            <li> I starting wearing regular polish, but I had to change it every two days because it turned into a chipped mess.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this for very long, so</li>
            <li> letting the Stickey dry longer than before.</li>
            <li> If there is moisture in them from a cuticle soak or shower, they will shrink as they dry</li>
            <li> Use this product as ordered: put it on dry prepped nails and then immediately--</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your nails either.</li>
            <li> However, when it gets older it leaves your nails with a slight green tint.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite base coat by far.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool base coat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really tough on nail polish and really hold the crown as a nail chip queen!  </li>
            <li> A true game changer!</li>
            <li> This base coat REALLY makes your polish stick, and the price is right!  </li>
            <li> The polish went on uneven and would not dry.</li>
            <li> Again, uneven and the polish would not dry.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it lasted any longer than the other high end base coats available.</li>
            <li> Over the last year or so, I&#x27;ve learned little secrets to getting and keeping a longer manicure.</li>
            <li> and she used this base coat, and told me how amazing it is...</li>
            <li> After applying it leaves a sticky rough finish.</li>
            <li> I am on Day 5 with minimal wear.</li>
            <li> So that was a big waste of time.</li>
            <li> I want a product that I can use that will protect my polish against everyday activities such as washing dishes, doing laundry and carrying groceries...</li>
            <li> This works better than any base coats I&#x27;ve tried at getting polish to actually stay on my nail for longer than a day or two.  </li>
            <li> I use the stickey base coat on my left hand, apply one thick coat of good nail polish.</li>
            <li> Nice base coat for doing my nails.</li>
            <li> Nice base coat.</li>
            <li> Have only used once, not sure if it&#x27;s any better than regular base coat like Revlon.</li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t work for me, my nails chipped just as quickly as if I used any old base coat.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on all the other reviews and I have to say I am not disapointed.  </li>
            <li> and seriously i wouldnt even consider it that because it was so minimal and was barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very careful with my nails for another 30 minutes, but I can do things like read and work on my computer at that point.  </li>
            <li> (I am very rough with my hands, so a week is a lot for me)</li>
            <li> I mentioned to a friend that I was tired of taking the time to polish/dry my nails only to have them peel off by the next night</li>
            <li> Almost imperceptible, but if you use it under a sheer polish it is going to influence the color very slightly.  </li>
            <li> Feels very hard and natural.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice it doing any better at that than my other base coats.</li>
            <li> this is not really worth it, it says its supposed to help your polish stay on longer</li>
            <li> Love this base coat.</li>
            <li> I love this base coat that keeps the polish on longer.</li>
            <li> I did my fingernails Sunday evening with this base coat,  2 coats of OPI color, and Dabu as the top coat.  </li>
            <li> It works better if you put on the polish while the stickey base coat is still \\&quot;stickey\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> i really love this base coat it keeps</li>
            <li> I am still searching for the top and base coat that would last for at least 5 days.</li>
            <li> This polish will last for at least a week if you use the base and top coat also.</li>
            <li> But CND Stickey Base Coat is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I thought this base coat was just ok.  </li>
            <li> I had better results with Butter London&#x27;s Nail Foundation (Base Coat).</li>
            <li> I love the Stickey base coat by CND.</li>
            <li> I love the Stickey Base.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this base coat.</li>
            <li> Have had problems with nail polish containing glitter staying on no matter what I used as a base or top coat.</li>
            <li> Found that with this base coat the polish topcoat wears better.</li>
            <li> I love Stickey base coat.</li>
            <li> Gets globby and impossible to apply after a while, and doesn&#x27;t last long, but I do use it really frequently.</li>
            <li> I paint my nails about once every week and once this gets down to the bottom, where the brush ends, you can&#x27;t reach the bottom portion of it.</li>
            <li> I actually got bored of my last polish color before it needed replacement.</li>
            <li> My manicure lasted a week with slight chipping that was not noticeable to anyone but me.</li>
            <li> Your nail polish is then getting thicker and less useable.</li>
            <li> and my manicures now last anywhere from 1-2 weeks (which is long enough from me as I get bored with my color too often and change within that 1-2 week time frame) even when doing housework!</li>
            <li> I usually get tired of my polish color before I need a new manicure.</li>
            <li> The CND Stickey base coat has held up much better and the only &amp;#34;chip&amp;#34; that has occured was because of a broken nail.</li>
            <li> What I mean is that you will have grow out long before the polish</li>
            <li> I am not sure that I need to replace my favorite base coast though.</li>
            <li> , it makes it an easy job to apply the base coat.</li>
            <li> Make manicures last at least 1 week longer!</li>
            <li> I did 1 stickey base coat on the pinky and ring finger, then 2 coats of pink and super shiny.</li>
            <li> I used to use the China Glaze Strong Adhesive Base Coat, but it would consistantly chip within a few hours of application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of CND&#x27;s sticky base coat &amp; shiney topcoat.</li>
            <li> I have trouble keeping nail polish to stay on my nails.</li>
            <li> Anyway, here is the list of ingredients (with the ewg descriptions beside a few ingredients):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did help hold off chips a few days longer than if I hadn&#x27;t used it, and I will probably continue to use...</li>
            <li> number one base available</li>
            <li> nice thin base coat.</li>
            <li> I sometimes like to do intricate nail art, but sometimes I will just do a plain one color uniformly across my nail.</li>
            <li> This no better than a cheap bottle base coat.</li>
            <li> I do know that she has been getting her nails done in this manner the past few months.</li>
            <li> However, it sadly did not work any better than any other Base Coat.</li>
            <li> I was in the process of trying base coats and the name \\&quot;Super</li>
            <li> This base coat dries quick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a super liquidy base coat.</li>
            <li> Seems a little dull when it goes on.  </li>
            <li> and my polish has chipped very little after six days.</li>
            <li> I am going on day 8 with my nail polish with very little touch ups needed throughout the week</li>
            <li> This product is horrible, even my best polish starts peeling pretty much right away, worst base ever!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this base coat!</li>
            <li> No more polish staining on my nail beds.</li>
            <li> , after a week there have usually been about 2-4 chips and some tip wear with both of them.   </li>
            <li> I was hoping that I had found a product that would help my nail color stay put, but what I found was that I had wasted my money!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Maybe there are other high end base coats that work as well as this one</li>
            <li> Then the other two fingers I did 1 stickey base coat, pink, then stickey base coat, pink, and super shiny.</li>
            <li> My manicure usually lasts for about 5-7 days without chipping, and I am not the type of girl that goes about their day delicately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using CND&#x27;s Stickey Base Coat for about three years, ever since I first read about it in a beauty magazine.  </li>
            <li> I get a manicure in a professional salon every other week and the manicurist always uses this base coat.</li>
            <li> I am very hard on my nails and so a week with little or no chipping is a miracle.</li>
            <li> I was using Essie sticky base coat, but the effect still wouldn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in how long the polish stays on compared to my last one (Maybelline Salon Base Coat)</li>
            <li> Use for long lasting nail polish base.</li>
            <li> , maybe I type too hard on my computer.</li>
            <li> hard to find, now that Ulta doesn&#x27;t carry.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this base is that it does  lay down a very thin veil of blue color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using Sech Vite, but it has Tolulene which is bad for one&#x27;s health and the environment and also makes my polish shrink a little bit on the edges on occasion.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time last night on a DIY manicure, with CND base coat.</li>
            <li> I use this with Barielle topcoat and my manicure lasts for at least a week.</li>
            <li> so I find I have to manicure at least once a week no matter what.</li>
            <li> It extends the life of manicures and pedicures by at least a week.</li>
            <li> I can use some of the cheapest polishes and this base coat keeps it from chipping for much longer.</li>
            <li> or it will get too thick &amp; it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> CND Stickey Base Coat really does the trick though.</li>
            <li> Also, it became really thick</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try other base coats as long as this one exists.</li>
            <li> thing that I did not much care for is the very slight green tint of this base coat.</li>
            <li> can get it at Ulta, but it&#x27;s less expensive here.</li>
            <li> This was not a good buy.</li>
            <li> So I tried this sticky base coat and so far no signs of peeling.</li>
            <li> And I am HARD on my nails!     </li>
            <li> I am very hard on my nails and was hoping this would be just what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I am a bit skeptical about using a new base coat.</li>
            <li> If you want your manicures to last, get this base coat.</li>
            <li> but i change up my base coat based on what my nails need so my nails dont get too yellow</li>
            <li> Aides in nail growth as well, as I have thin nails.</li>
            <li> My manicures are lasting about a week without chipping with CND&#x27;s stickey base coat.</li>
            <li> They look worse than my mom&#x27;s nails, and she&#x27;s a smoker.  </li>
            <li> My nails have never been longer and stronger (they used to split and peel) and I credit this as PART of the secret.</li>
            <li> As you keep brushing your nail color on, as you go from one finger to the next, it seems like the stickey base coat is sticking to the nail polish.</li>
            <li> I really like this CND Stickey nail base!  </li>
            <li> This is the only nail base I will use...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it keeps my polish on than any other base coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other base &amp; topcoats, but don&#x27;t get the wear that I get from the CND products.</li>
            <li> It makes your polish stay chip-free for longer than any other base coat I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different base coats and found them all to be disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference using this product as a base coat.  </li>
            <li> With stickey base coat, it will stay on 3-4 days, depending on the polish you use, some longer some a little less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> can never go wrong with CND polish</li>
            <li> I also do not wear or like fake nails; acrylic or gel.</li>
            <li> I think that this base coat is no better than any that I have used from Revlon and others.  </li>
            <li> My nail polish seemed to chip/peel off quicker than usual after using this stickey base coat.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that this base makes my polish stay on longer than any other base.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, this stuff has been a life and time-saver!</li>
            <li> The brush is very thin so application bis a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> I thought perhaps the OPI was bad, but when I tried it with Orly Bonder, it worked just find.</li>
            <li> I have bad nails</li>
            <li> My friend tried it and was disappointed, as well.</li>
            <li> The nail polish stays even longer with the base coat</li>
            <li> but the tips still wear off even with the base.</li>
            <li> I now use a dehydrator/pH balancer before my base coat.</li>
            <li> Two days ago I did a google search on tacky base coats and came across CND.</li>
            <li> If there is a reason that nail salons don&#x27;t use &#x27;Stickey Base Coat&#x27;</li>
            <li> I bought this as a base coat to use with Jamberry nail wraps as my wraps tend to lift at the edges.  </li>
            <li> If you want to look like you have acrylic or gel nails, get this base coat.</li>
            <li> I switched to Essie Protein Base Coat paired with Out the Door topcoat.</li>
            <li> Anyway after manicures at the salon I decided to buy the stickey base coat myself</li>
            <li> base coat does stay a bit sticky until polish is used.</li>
            <li> Base Coat.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When removed you will see that the base coat does not bleed through.</li>
            <li> I DO rotate between the CND sticky base coat and the OPI Maintenance base coat.</li>
            <li> This base coat just blows anything else I&#x27;ve tried out of the water.</li>
            <li> If you have never used a base coat with your manicures, you need to start using this product.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers said this base coat provided them 1 or 2 weeks of wear with no chips but that wasn&#x27;t my experience.</li>
            <li> I have never used a base coat before as I wear acrylics.  </li>
            <li> I worked in a Spa for years, and this is what we used as a base coat in manicures.  </li>
            <li> I used to be a manicurist and this base coat sticks to your nails with a tackiness that allows the polish to adhere to it for a stronger attachment.</li>
            <li> hate that it never stays longer than 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li> this base coast allowed the polish to stay on longer</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The Stickey Base coat came just in time for the review!</li>
            <li> with that being said, I HATE CHIPPED POLISH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this base coat. It truly is &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; which helps to adhere your polish. Makes your polish last longer.</li>
            <li> Good product, works well.</li>
            <li> It is a very good base coat, the best one I have ever tried. I use it with the new gel polish that you can buy over the counter that does not need a UV light to dry. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great base coat. It gave my nails a smooth &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; for my polish. I am on day three with no chipping, which is usually not the case.</li>
            <li> The nail polish stays even longer with the base coat but the tips still wear off even with the base.</li>
            <li> The product did work, the nail polish lasted a week without chipping. The reason I gave one star was it discolored my nails, my nails turned yellow. I discarded the product.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Haven&#x27;t had it that long, but it seems to hold the polish on my daughters nails.</li>
            <li> New item for me.  Great!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this as much as everyone else, especially because my nail polish chips after a day or two. The first time I tried this, I put OPI \\&quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jaques\\&quot; over it. The polish went on uneven and would not dry. I removed the polish and tried again... letting the Stickey dry longer than before. Again, uneven and the polish would not dry. I thought perhaps the OPI was bad, but when I tried it with Orly Bonder, it worked just find. Perhaps I got an defective bottle of Stickey, but I didn&#x27;t want to buy another bottle to find out. Hope it works better for you than it did for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved having a beautiful manicure, but I stopped doing/getting my nails done on a regular basis for several years because chipping annoys me to no end. It takes something that&#x27;&#x27;s supposed to make you look nice, and makes your hands look unkempt. Over the last year or so, I&#x27;ve learned little secrets to getting and keeping a longer manicure. I now use a dehydrator/pH balancer before my base coat. I was using Essie sticky base coat, but the effect still wouldn&#x27;t last long. Two days ago I did a google search on tacky base coats and came across CND. I read all the great reviews and decided to try it out. I had to call around to find it. One store in my area had it, so I had them put it on hold. It was well worth the search and the trip to go get it! I&#x27;m only two days in, but my mani still looks like new! I applied a coat before the color and another coat on top of my color before my top coat. I can&#x27;t say enough. Next I&#x27;m trying CND top coat. I&#x27;m currently using Sech Vite, but it has Tolulene which is bad for one&#x27;s health and the environment and also makes my polish shrink a little bit on the edges on occasion. CND stickey polish is 3 free and does what it says! I couldn&#x27;t ask for more! :)</li>
            <li> Makes polish last SO MUCH longer.  Would not waste my time polishing nails without it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all the rage is about this product. After applying it leaves a sticky rough finish.</li>
            <li> Normally I do my own nails with CND Shellac product.  I wanted something to  use for those occasions when I don&#x27;t have time to do the Shellac process.  I ordered this and clear color and top coat.  They worked just great!  I have not heard anyone else mention this but regular nail polish remover would not work at removing.  I had to use acetone to remove it.  I did not have to soak them but it took a bit of work to get this off.  All in all I will certainly use it when I am off the Shellac for a few days.  It certainly kept the polish on my nails.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite base coat by far. It keeps the polish from chipping and prevents discoloration of my nails. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and will continue to repurchase in the future.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I have ever tried.  I went to a local nail tech supply store and they recommended it for me.  I have natural nails and never polish them because with a clerical job, the polish chips within one day of polishing my nails.  I put this stuff on prior to polishing with a neon color polish and oh my gosh, my polish didn&#x27;t chip and it stayed on several days without wearing off.  It allows those of us with natural nails to wear polish and look polished like we have acrylic nails on.  It is the best.  Be sure and try it and you will not regret it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product came recommended by my local beauty supply. I gave it numerous tries with many different polishes (Essie, OPI, Chanel, Nars, etc) and top coats (SV, Poshe). I don&#x27;t think it has made it past one full day EVER. Granted, my nails tend to chip easily despite the fact that I keep them very short. I had equal results with no basecoat, or just some cheapy product.    What I will say: this product goes on easily, and does smooth out the nail. I gave it one star because it&#x27;s called \\&quot;Stickey\\&quot; - as in it&#x27;s supposed to make your nail polish stick, and it did nothing of the sort.</li>
            <li> Maybe there are other high end base coats that work as well as this one but I can say without hesitation that this product works a hundred times better than anything you&#x27;ll find in a drug store OR than whatever they use at your average strip mall nail salon.     With this product, it was 5 days before I saw a chip at all and 10 days before my nails got to the point that I felt like I had to take the polish off. When I get my nails done in salons, it typically only takes 2 days for the polish to chip and I&#x27;m lucky if I make it a week without having to take it off.    If there is a reason that nail salons don&#x27;t use &#x27;Stickey Base Coat&#x27; it&#x27;s probably because they know that their customers wouldn&#x27;t have to come in as often if they did. I would HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this after reading reviews. I didn&#x27;t notice ANY increase in wear or chip protection. Bummer.</li>
            <li> I went to the salon to get my nails painted and she used this base coat, and told me how amazing it is...well 5 days later I have zero chips. My nails look like they were just painted. I had to order it. This stuff is amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this base coat that keeps the polish on longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an alright product! I only gave this product four stars,because, although it works pretty well, I have a couple different products that do the same thing just as well, and they are a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> Have tried many brands -- OPI, Essie, Orly, Deborah Lippman --the CND is the best.  (at least better than any of these).  I would never have bought it on my own but when I had a pedicure the technician used this and recommended it.  It does really seem to make the manicure last longer, meaning no lifting or chipping of the polish.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this base is that it does  lay down a very thin veil of blue color. Almost imperceptible, but if you use it under a sheer polish it is going to influence the color very slightly.  So now I only use it for pedicures under opaque colors.</li>
            <li> This product is an Allure award winner and I know why. Keeps color on your nails for longer! I do still use a non-chip top coat but I have seen a difference in the longevity of my nail polish. I will continue to purchase over and over. A must have!</li>
            <li> This is a great basecoat. It goes on smooth, protects my nails &amp; really helps my manicures last longer. Love it :)</li>
            <li> I bought this as a base coat to use with Jamberry nail wraps as my wraps tend to lift at the edges.  This base coat is amazing!  It works so well!  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I actually got this as a gift for my daughter for Christmas.  She will have to let me know what she thinks of this product.  I do know that she has been getting her nails done in this manner the past few months.</li>
            <li> I used his product for three weeks and saw no help with the polish staying on my nails.  During the fourth week I begin to apply my nail polish first and the stickey second and my polish has chipped very little after six days. However when I did not use the product and used a better nail polish my polish did not chip for the same amount days.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this base coat! I did my fingernails Sunday evening with this base coat,  2 coats of OPI color, and Dabu as the top coat.  Friday night, I noticed the first little chip. That&#x27;s nearly a whole week. And I am HARD on my nails!     I can&#x27;t recommend this product highly enough. If you want your manicures to last, get this base coat. If you want to look like you have acrylic or gel nails, get this base coat.</li>
            <li> After using this for a few months, I noticed that my nails were really drying out. I switched to Essie Protein Base Coat paired with Out the Door topcoat. I am going on day 8 with my nail polish with very little touch ups needed throughout the week and they still look great. For the first time, I am ready to change the color because I am bored with it and not because I actually have to. I did not find CND Stickey to work as well and made the switch to Essie instead which seems more nourishing on my nails as well.</li>
            <li> seems like it helped my nail polish stick a little better, was recommended by a manicurist.</li>
            <li> This is the best base coat I&#x27;ve found, especially when used in conjunction with CND Air Dry finish. It seems to work better if you do one hand at a time. I use the stickey base coat on my left hand, apply one thick coat of good nail polish. Using one coat is my personal preference; 2 coats should work as well.  It works better if you put on the polish while the stickey base coat is still \\&quot;stickey\\&quot;.  I do the right hand in the same way. Next I put Sally Hansen&#x27;s Dry Kwik nail polish dryer on top of the polish, leave on for 5 minutes then gently wash this off with liquid soap and water--be sure to get it all because the Dry Kwik is oily. Then I apply a coat of CND Air Dry finish, which is a fast dry polish in itself. Another application of the Sally Hansen Dry Kwick, leaving on for about 5-10 minutes, longer if you have time, then gently wash it off. The Kwik Dry makes my nails dry faster, otherwise they stay tacky much longer.  I&#x27;m very careful with my nails for another 30 minutes, but I can do things like read and work on my computer at that point.  In less than 30 minutes I have a great manicure that lasts 2-3 times longer than before using the CND products. I usually get tired of my polish color before I need a new manicure. These are slightly more expensive than the drug store products, but because my manicure lasts much longer, I use less in the long run. It does take longer to remove the polish, but this shows the product keeps the polish on like it should. I order extras to make sure I have both products on hand at all times.</li>
            <li> Somewhere along the line in the last year my nailpolish had been peeling off. I always painted my nails prior to this with no problem, I&#x27;ll just chalk it up to getting older.  Anyway after manicures at the salon I decided to buy the stickey base coat myself and I&#x27;m in day 3 now of my own manicure and it looks like I came right out of a salon.  Definitely worth the purchase, and I will be back to painting my own nails again! YAY!</li>
            <li> I used this, then painted two coats of regular china glaze polish, and my nails definetly stayed chip free for longer than usual. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Better than nothing, but nothing majical.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I seen many recommendation of it but in reality it does not make a difference for me.</li>
            <li> I have trouble keeping nail polish to stay on my nails. It peels and chips within hours of putting it on. Using Sticky under the polish, it sticks. I actually got bored of my last polish color before it needed replacement. That was a week of wear and tear without any chips or peeling. I have oily nails and even acrylic nails don&#x27;t stick. I am in love with Sticky!! It even keeps my super cheap fast drying polish on!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Nail polish does not stay on my nails for more than a day or two without this product. Now polish lasts for a week or more. On my toes it lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li> I got the Pink CND and Super Shiny top coat to review. The Stickey Base coat came just in time for the review! The pink CND is a very bold and pretty color. Formula is awesome and one dip covers one whole hand. The Stickey base coat is something that will take practice finding the right way to do it, but sure gives that jelly look. In the left picture I just did pink and super shiny, and wow it is like mirror shiny, I could see the window on my nail because the reflection of the shiny top coat. My new favorite top coat, wish it was a bit thicker but its still really awesome top coat. In the middle picture I played around a bit. I did 1 stickey base coat on the pinky and ring finger, then 2 coats of pink and super shiny. Then the other two fingers I did 1 stickey base coat, pink, then stickey base coat, pink, and super shiny. Just click the image and you can see for yourself! These 3 polishes were fun to try mind they are my very first CND&#x27;s ever to own. I just love the formulas and how great they work!</li>
            <li> I use this every time I give myself a fresh Manicure. I think it has strengthened my nails. They seem to be growing fast and less breakage ans I&#x27;m not doing anything else differently. No more polish staining on my nail beds.</li>
            <li> i really love this base coat it keeps my well manicure nails from chipping. i literally lasted a week before i finally got a chip and seriously i wouldnt even consider it that because it was so minimal and was barely noticeable. i love this stuff!! only downfall i have is that it tends to make my nails bed yellow but i change up my base coat based on what my nails need so my nails dont get too yellow or when i start seeing that happen i just give my nails a breather and dont do anything with them. but besides that i still love it and i always use it</li>
            <li> I loved this base coat, used it until it was all gone. Went on smooth even when there was only a teeny bit left in the bottle. It also held the polish to the nail longer than sally hansen or seche vite or nailtech. I use this with essie and seche vite top coat for a long lasting, high quality finish. Aides in nail growth as well, as I have thin nails.</li>
            <li> Finally! Finally my nail polish lasts longer than a day. I don&#x27;t know what it is but my nail polish never stays on. By the next day, I am able to peel it off in an almost entire sheet. I mentioned to a friend that I was tired of taking the time to polish/dry my nails only to have them peel off by the next night and she recommended this product. I am so glad she did. I used a thin coat of Stickey, 2 coats of my Essie polish and a coat of SV as a top coat. I am on Day 5 with minimal wear. This has NEVER happened before. Even after getting them done at a salon, my polish only lasts 3-4 days TOPS. If you have oily nail beds and your polish peels right off like mine did, you should give this a try. I&#x27;ll never use anything else!</li>
            <li> this pre application to your nail polish is a must-have. It goes on and dries quick ready for the nail polish color. It really helps the color stick and go on evenly.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. My manicures are lasting about a week without chipping with CND&#x27;s stickey base coat. It&#x27;s a must have for those who do their own manicures.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been pleased with my purchases on Amazon.  Prompt deliveries, products as they are represented to be, quality perfect.  I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> goes on smooth, sleek and easy. nice thin base coat. can never go wrong with CND polish</li>
            <li> Got this as a recommendation from a nail polish blog. The price was great. I received it right on time, very quick. Packaged well. Works great!</li>
            <li> The best thing ever...can&#x27;t complain about this nail base. Love it and will always buy this as long as possible.</li>
            <li> First of all, my husband and I share this account so I (the wife) am writing this. I spent a lot of time last night on a DIY manicure, with CND base coat. As of 9AM this morning, I noticed that on two nails, the polish was already peeling up and a third was chipped. So that was a big waste of time. I&#x27;m sure the others will peel soon so I&#x27;m going to do all my nails over, with no base coat.</li>
            <li> This product will literally hold my manicure for up to a whole week without chipping!! (I am very rough with my hands, so a week is a lot for me) Definitely recommend this to everyone who wants a salon quality manicure :)</li>
            <li> My manicurist recommended tihs product for my nails and I really like it. Thank you. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend to use with the CND Super Shiney top coat - the combination of these products along with a high quality polish provides for a long lasting manicure. Mine usually last for about 2 weeks. This is the BEST base coat....once you use it you can&#x27;t stop. Well worth the price, and a thin layer is sufficient so even when doing a manicure and pedicutre 2-3 per month, one bottle should last a while!</li>
            <li> I bought this product on the recommendation from a nail tech that uses it for manicures in her nail salon and I am very glad I did. I used to use the China Glaze Strong Adhesive Base Coat, but it would consistantly chip within a few hours of application. The CND Stickey base coat has held up much better and the only &amp;#34;chip&amp;#34; that has occured was because of a broken nail.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent base coat .</li>
            <li> Lasted 2-3 days, even polish on my toes chipped. I expected so much more from this product.  I am still searching for the top and base coat that would last for at least 5 days.</li>
            <li> I used to spend $3 extra when I got a professional manicure for this nail polish.  Now I do it at home.  This polish will last for at least a week if you use the base and top coat also.</li>
            <li> I am a bit skeptical about using a new base coat. But CND Stickey Base Coat is fabulous! Nothing works better. My manicure lasted a week with slight chipping that was not noticeable to anyone but me. The color I was wearing was red, so chips are noticeable. I will be purchasing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base coat does stay a bit sticky until polish is used. This is not a treatment per se, so I would not recommend that it can be worn alone.</li>
            <li> So far only tried it once, with Esse Polish, but I think it keeps color on for longer.  Also used an Esse topcoat.  Polish lasted about 5 days.  Made sure to wash dishes with gloves and didn&#x27;t do too much housework (really anything that will ruin the manicure.). I don&#x27;t know if this really helps, but I keep this along with my Essie topcoat in the fridge.  I read that it helps preserve the polishes for longer.</li>
            <li> This works better than any base coats I&#x27;ve tried at getting polish to actually stay on my nail for longer than a day or two.  BUT, even with light pastel polish and only a few days&#x27; wear, there is SIGNIFICANT yellow staining on my nails after using it.  They look worse than my mom&#x27;s nails, and she&#x27;s a smoker.  So my quest for the perfect base coat continues...</li>
            <li> This base coat is the best I have ever used.  I can use some of the cheapest polishes and this base coat keeps it from chipping for much longer.</li>
            <li> Dries super fast &amp; a little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t over use or it will get too thick &amp; it won&#x27;t work. Works pretty good, nail polish lasts for a few days with no chips, but works best with the CnD top coat as well.</li>
            <li> My nails have never been longer and stronger (they used to split and peel) and I credit this as PART of the secret. First, let your nails dry completely before applying any nail polish. If there is moisture in them from a cuticle soak or shower, they will shrink as they dry and if you&#x27;ve already applied polish it will crack and chip sooner.&lt;br /&gt;Then apply a generous coat of Stickey. Then 2 coats of polish (any brand), then follow with a nice thick coat of CND Vinylux Top Coat. This stuff dries pretty quickly, too.&lt;br /&gt;Put it this way...I used to touch up the tips of my nails every single night and add a coat of top coat. Every night. My manicure would look great for a full 5-7 days, but it was high maintenance. (I model - my nails always have to look perfect.)&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using these two products, my nails are as long as my sister&#x27;s acrylic nails AND I only have to touch up the tips maybe every 3-4-days. Then I add a little color on the very edges and another top coat. After 5-7 days I add a whole new coat of color plus another top coat. My manicures have been good that way for 12 days! Unheard of before with any other products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative - this stuff dries out very quickly and gets so thick and gunky you can&#x27;t use it, so you really only get about a half bottle&#x27;s worth for the money. I tried thinning it a bit with acetone but it didn&#x27;t work, I just had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> This is the best base coat I have ever used! It kept my polish on for an entire week! I was washing dishes gloveless and washed my hair without chipping. For me that is saying a lot. Also I love that it is a thin formula because it is easy to apply and dries fast!</li>
            <li> this is not really worth it, it says its supposed to help your polish stay on longer but NO IT DOES NOT!!!!!</li>
            <li> It works great and it does last longer than my other base coats.  Goes on easy and pedicures will last at least 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is a must have to keep your coat on for days without chipping!!! I love this product and will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It really makes your polish last longer.  Use this along with the CND top coat for even longer lasting results.  CND makes great products.  Would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> It makes my nail polish last for more than 4 days. :) It&#x27;s cheaper to buy this than get my nails done at a salon. Good investment!</li>
            <li> I thought this base coat was just ok.  I still had some chipping after three days.  I had better results with Butter London&#x27;s Nail Foundation (Base Coat).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it keeps my polish on than any other base coat. The brush is very thin so application bis a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> Where has this been all my life? I&#x27;ve tried different base coats and found them all to be disappointing. So much so that I wound up just not using any. CND Stickey Base Coat really does the trick though. It dries quickly and actually makes my manicures last longer. That&#x27;s saying something for me. I&#x27;m always using my hands and my nails are into everything. So I&#x27;m quite impressed with this product and I&#x27;ll be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works great for nail art and dries fast. This is a great compliment to the other nail products.</li>
            <li> Great product couldn&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
            <li> I was in the process of trying base coats and the name \\&quot;Super Sticky\\&quot; made me decide to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit stickier than others, and it does the job. I am not sure that I need to replace my favorite base coast though. I think it&#x27;s a good one to try for yourself !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I did not much care for is the very slight green tint of this base coat. In most cases it would not make any issues I suppose, but you need to be careful about polishes perfectly over any of this base coat or you might get a slight grey cast at an edge. I can&#x27;t deduct any stars for this issue, I was just a bit surprised at first that it did not dry clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: August 2014&lt;br /&gt;I have recently started using this CND  Stickey. Base Coat.&lt;br /&gt;I have found that if I apply it after using OPI Skip Chip, I get better results.</li>
            <li> this product was featured in In Style&#x27;s bests but so far I think it&#x27;s so so, after I applied it to my nail, the polish still lasts only two to three days, maybe I type too hard on my computer.</li>
            <li> I love the Stickey base coat by CND. My sister turned me on to this. It really prevents your nail polish from chipping or peeling away.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> This product is the best base coat I&#x27;ve ever used.  Combine it with their Super Shiny top coat &amp; your polish will last longer than your pedi/mani.  What I mean is that you will have grow out long before the polish chips.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a preschool teacher with my hands in water many times a day, &amp; my feet, oh my poor feet, stepped on regularly in my open toed shoes.&lt;br /&gt;It will last minimum 2 weeks.  I know, it doesn&#x27;t seem possible, but try it, it works.&lt;br /&gt;You can get it at Ulta, but it&#x27;s less expensive here.</li>
            <li> I was new to trying CND products...and they did not disappoint!  The basecoat, with the top coat...my polish lasts a full 7 days without chipping (as long as it&#x27;s not super cheap polish, which is going to chip regardless).</li>
            <li> I love the Stickey Base.  My nails stay looking nice longer.</li>
            <li> Best base coat I have used in awhile!</li>
            <li> hardened up after 6 months, was too &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; to use</li>
            <li> very toxic smelling stuff, immediate headache had to throw it out</li>
            <li> I sometimes like to do intricate nail art, but sometimes I will just do a plain one color uniformly across my nail. EITHER WAY I always only do natural nail designs. I really like Seche Vita top coat, but I was not crazy about the base coat, so I tried this. It really works great. I love it! When I painted my nails it dried fast so I could almost immediately put on my color. I am in front of a computer all day for work, so my polish chips very quickly and often I have to change my color 1-2 times a week. Mostly because I have a lot of oils in my nails and polish does not adhere well. But it is day 3 and I have no chips in my nails. My design this week included one color in OPI, one from Essie, and one Sally Hansen insta dry, so they all worked great and I used the Seche Vita top coat. They look perfect. So far so good! My polish applied smoothly and dried looking top notch professional. Love it, Recommend this product.  Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Makes the nail polish last longer.</li>
            <li> This makes regular polish last as long as gel. I&#x27;m currently wearing a home manicure of my regular old polish from two weeks ago! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I was told the my nails are too acidic to hold polish, which is why it always starts chipping the same day I put polish on. I loved the reaults of gel, but it made my nails brittle. I starting wearing regular polish, but I had to change it every two days because it turned into a chipped mess. This basecoat let&#x27;s me get weeks of wear out of the cute (and cheap) drugstore polish that I love.</li>
            <li> I love CND products and this is no exception! Use this product as ordered: put it on dry prepped nails and then immediately--while &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; place the color on top. When removed you will see that the base coat does not bleed through. It can be pricey at salons hence why I bought this on Amazon. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your nails either. I DO rotate between the CND sticky base coat and the OPI Maintenance base coat. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this base coat. This base coat just blows anything else I&#x27;ve tried out of the water. My manicure usually lasts for about 5-7 days without chipping, and I am not the type of girl that goes about their day delicately. I have a habit of smacking into things (accidentally), and most of my previous manicures would last, unchipped, about 3 days, tops. Will definitely be repurchasing this in the future!</li>
            <li> My sister can&#x27;t wear nail polish for longer than 2 days without chipping so I purchased this and I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but she was able to wear that manicure for a few days longer which is a success to me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that this base makes my polish stay on longer than any other base.  My polish starts to chip after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Just ok. My nail polish still peeled &amp; chipped on the 4th day. But im givin it 3 stars because it is 2 days longer than they normally chip but i was hoping for at least a week when i used CND top coat as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference using this product as a base coat.  My polish seems to stay a bit longer, but even some still chip off after a day or two.  Still, it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I was told this is the best nail product you can buy. I was also told if you put this on your nails won&#x27;t chip or peel off in sheets; that was a lie. This no better than a cheap bottle base coat. I won&#x27;t be spending the extra money on this again.</li>
            <li> Polish does not seem to last as long with the basecoat.</li>
            <li> Very nice base coat; highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My polish actually lasts over a week!  I put this under any cheap nail polish and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> my nails still chipped after 4 days</li>
            <li> Amazing deals on great products. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great base coat. I&#x27;ve bought so many different base coats and this is definitely the best. I&#x27;m running out and will be replacing it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of CND&#x27;s sticky base coat &amp; shiney topcoat. The basecoat provides a great foundation to your manicure and the polish really does stick much better! By starting with sticky &amp; ending with shiney, I can get about a week from my manicure when used with OPI polish on natural nails. I&#x27;ve tried other base &amp; topcoats, but don&#x27;t get the wear that I get from the CND products.</li>
            <li> This is a great base coat product. This helps my nail polish lasts well over a week. If you have never used a base coat with your manicures, you need to start using this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it claimed to help keep nails from chipping as quickly.  I didn&#x27;t notice it doing any better at that than my other base coats.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service</li>
            <li> This base coat is awesome. My polish lasts more than a week or so (depending on the top brand). Once you get the hang of the right amount, it&#x27;s fabulous. Definitely a must buy.</li>
            <li> this is a great addition to the one week polish, seems like it is the foundation to the house!  you need to get it to to extend the life of the CDN weekly polish. I love it</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful after reading the reviews on this product.   I am very hard on my nails and was hoping this would be just what I was looking for.  And it didn&#x27;t work for me, my nails chipped just as quickly as if I used any old base coat. I usually use OPI nail polish, so it is not like I am using cheap polish. Siiiigh ! I will have to keep looking....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this for very long, so I don&#x27;t know how well it prevents staining yet. It leaves a smooth surface for the next layer of polish to go on to. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in how long the polish stays on compared to my last one (Maybelline Salon Base Coat), after a week there have usually been about 2-4 chips and some tip wear with both of them.   I really like the brush, it makes it an easy job to apply the base coat. It also dries very fast, when I&#x27;m done applying Stickey to all ten fingers, I can start with the colored varnish straight away on my first nail.</li>
            <li> I paint my nails less and less now, because I do a lot with my hands and my polish rarely makes it two days without chipping or peeling.  I think that this base coat is no better than any that I have used from Revlon and others.  My polish does seem to resist chipping a little bit more, but it also peels more quickly, so it&#x27;s not really a trade off.  The price is comparable to drug store brands, so you really aren&#x27;t losing anything by trying it.  I just expected more from a hyped product/company.  For me, there isn&#x27;t a huge difference in the time my polish lasts using this and using nothing, and at least by using nothing, I avoid all the chemicals involved with painting and with removal (your nail beds are rather absorbent, which makes me think twice about the things I put on them.  It&#x27;s something to consider, if you are interested).  Anyway, here is the list of ingredients (with the ewg descriptions beside a few ingredients):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alcohol denat., ethyl acetate, heptane, butyl acetate, polyvinyl butyral, trimethyl pentanyl diisobutyrate (moderate to high toxicity concern in humans, organ toxicity and bioaccumulation), nitrocellulose (classified as expected to be toxic or harmful), tosylamide/epoxy resin, isopropyl alcohol (reproductive, organ system and developmental toxicity), benzophenone-1 (human endocrine disruptor)</li>
            <li> I used to buy this at Ulta.  A friend told me about it, and I thought, here&#x27;s one more product that does not work.  I was pleasently surprised.  Normally when I put polish on, it starts peeling off on day one.  With stickey base coat, it will stay on 3-4 days, depending on the polish you use, some longer some a little less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very hard to find, now that Ulta doesn&#x27;t carry.  I noticed the bottle size has been reduced probably by half and the price is the same or higher, so that&#x27;s disappointing, but overall it&#x27;s still worth it for me.</li>
            <li> This product really helped the polish stay on my fingers... But it&#x27;s easy to apply and fast drying to add the next color cost ... Great product</li>
            <li> Great product and good price!</li>
            <li> This base coat is great. I like it better than any I have ever used. Makes your pedicure last longer.</li>
            <li> This base coat REALLY makes your polish stick, and the price is right!  I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> This base coat dries quick. It provides an excellent first layer to hold on your polish of choice. In addition it protects the nail from discoloring nail polishes. A must have!</li>
            <li> Stayed on only for a day or so</li>
            <li> This base coat is GREAT. Helps so much when it comes to making my polish last.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula or what, but the last two bottles that I bought didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference. In fact, as you use it, it makes your nail polish that it comes in contact with it get thicker and thicker. As you keep brushing your nail color on, as you go from one finger to the next, it seems like the stickey base coat is sticking to the nail polish. Then when you insert the nail color brush back into its bottle, it&#x27;s like the stickiness is being transferred. Your nail polish is then getting thicker and less useable.</li>
            <li> This basecoat is effective in making my polish last for 2 weeks.  I use the CND topcoat with it.</li>
            <li> Seems a little dull when it goes on.  Can&#x27;t tell if it makes my manicure any better.  Did not notice any improvement when applying polish on top.  Will probably try something different when the bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers said this base coat provided them 1 or 2 weeks of wear with no chips but that wasn&#x27;t my experience. I buffed the tops of my nails and used this but still had some chipping. It did help hold off chips a few days longer than if I hadn&#x27;t used it, and I will probably continue to use...but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle, foolproof product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on all the other reviews and I have to say I am not disapointed.  It works great!!!</li>
            <li> Came on time. The one I got looks different from the picture shown, but it&#x27;s okay because it&#x27;s the same thing...</li>
            <li> I was hoping that I had found a product that would help my nail color stay put, but what I found was that I had wasted my money! This was not a good buy.</li>
            <li> This basecoat really makes all the difference in extending a manicure. I use this with Barielle topcoat and my manicure lasts for at least a week. I am very hard on my nails and so a week with little or no chipping is a miracle.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool base coat not sure if it really works or it&#x27;s just in my head. Been meaning to actually test it out.</li>
            <li> This product helps the spreading of the polish to be more even. Works well for my needs.</li>
            <li> This is a nice &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; base coat, and does seem to help polish adhere better. I change my polish far too frequently to really speak to the longevity, but no complaints so far!</li>
            <li> Great formula. One of the best base coats I&#x27;ve tried. Helps with longevity of polish.</li>
            <li> Have had problems with nail polish containing glitter staying on no matter what I used as a base or top coat. Constant peel off. So I tried this sticky base coat and so far no signs of peeling. I am very pleased. I let this stuff sit on overnight and then apply polish over it. Lasts a long time with no lifting.</li>
            <li> I used this product as directed and almost lost all my nails. It took quite a while for my nails to return to their normal status</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using CND&#x27;s Stickey Base Coat for about three years, ever since I first read about it in a beauty magazine.  It really does an excellent job of anchoring your nail polish down, and it makes my at-home manicures last much longer than they ever did before I began using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a bit strong, but it dissipates pretty quickly, and it doesn&#x27;t add too much extra time to your manicure since it also dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product to try out if you struggle with peeling and chipping nail polish.</li>
            <li> Great base coat. Would definitely purchase it again. Just wish it was sold locally. You have to try this product.</li>
            <li> My nail polish seemed to chip/peel off quicker than usual after using this stickey base coat. I used OPI and Wet n Wild polish over it. Possibly it works only with CND brand nail enamel. My friend tried it and was disappointed, as well. I would not reccommend to anyone unless you want to try it with CND polish.</li>
            <li> Found that with this base coat the polish topcoat wears better. Carry this with me to nail salon for them to use</li>
            <li> I was suggested this online, and it works just as stated. I like that it makes my polish much easier to peal off when it&#x27;s time for it to go.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles out of the 2 bottles 1 of them spilled in the box. For the price I paid I didnt mind but its a shame.</li>
            <li> really well to the nail, so far so good, 3rd day, and polish hasn&#x27;t chipped, usually my nails chip on the same day, i paint them, I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on Monday and got it on Wednesday! I was expecting it to take a long time because the date said about two weeks, so imagine my surprise when I got home and saw this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a super liquidy base coat. I&#x27;ve tried maybe 2-3 different base coats before this one, but I just love how smooth this goes on. It never turned my nails green and actually really protected my nails from being stained by the nail polish. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll try other base coats as long as this one exists. But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll get the larger size just because I don&#x27;t use it up fast enough. I paint my nails about once every week and once this gets down to the bottom, where the brush ends, you can&#x27;t reach the bottom portion of it. Also, it became really thick and whenever I try to use it it bubbled on my nails, hence my new bottle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been known to chip a nail walking out of the salon. I work with my hands a lot, so I was so glad when I found this stuff - as it actually prolongs my mani. It&#x27;s super sticky, so it allows for maximum adherence; I usually do a coat at the very tip of my nails (where chips start), which helps polish stay on longer. Before using this, my polish stayed on for 2 days (tops!) before chipping, now (if paired with the right polish), I can go 5 days without seeing a chip. Needless to say, this stuff has been a life and time-saver!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think this prep coat made any difference in longevity of the manicure. Would not buy again</li>
            <li> Love this item!  Make manicures last at least 1 week longer! It is a slightly tacky basecoat that helps polish adhere and not chip off as early.  I find I have grown out before chips.</li>
            <li> I get a manicure in a professional salon every other week and the manicurist always uses this base coat. It really helps the polish stay on longer and is truly a great product. I&#x27;ve bought it for me, my mom, and my aunt, and told my friends about it. This pruduct in only sold at professional hair salons, but my salon doesn&#x27;t sell this product so as always I could count  on amazon!</li>
            <li> This is a great base coat, one of the best I have used so far, and I&#x27;ve used base coats from OPI, Essie, China Glaze, and Sally Hansen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far my favorite. This combined with wrapping my tips and using Poshe quick dry top coat, my mani lasts 6+ days without chips or tip wear. Great product and highly recommend for any ladies who love their nail art, but hates the chipping!</li>
            <li> AMAZING hold for polish!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product it makes my polish last 10 days! It does what it promises, which is to make polish stick. I use it with CND&#x27;S quick dry top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer it 100 times to OPI&#x27;S basecoat, that one did nothing to help polish last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> really great base coat and dries fast</li>
            <li> Really keeps my polish on well!</li>
            <li> Nice base coat for doing my nails. So glad I invested in good quality products. Works great very glad I got this</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a lady I met at Walmart in the nail aisle.  I have never used a base coat before as I wear acrylics.  I love using this when I want a quick polish and don&#x27;t feel like dealing with taking off the gel polish after a week.  I also use this withINM Out The Door top coat....love these products!!</li>
            <li> This is a great base coat that prolongs the life of nail polish. Only drawback is that it does not even out ridges.</li>
            <li> The base coat works awesome ! And it&#x27;s works even better with cnd top shine ! Try them out !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad it does help some to keep the polish on.</li>
            <li> I worked in a Spa for years, and this is what we used as a base coat in manicures.  It makes your polish stay chip-free for longer than any other base coat I have ever used.  Worth the splurge!</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough positive about CND stickey. My best girlfriend hooked me on this. I make sure I have several on hand, and recommend it to everyone. Polish doubles its staying time with this and its lovely counterpart, Seche Vite top coat. You will love this product!</li>
            <li> This is one if the best base coats I&#x27;ve used. I think its a great product and I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like this CND Stickey nail base!  It&lt;br /&gt;helps give the nail polish a smooth application!  This is the only nail base I will use...it&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> Nice base coat. Feels very hard and natural. Helps my nails.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;m really tough on nail polish and really hold the crown as a nail chip queen!  This nail prep product truly increases your days of beautiful un-chipped nails.  It works!  Worth the $$$ :)</li>
            <li> I havent painted my nails in ages b/c it just doesnt last long enough. A friend told me about this product and I am hooked! Its amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  My manicure has lasted nearly a week and still looks beautiful.  I&#x27;ve never had a product like this and plan to buy it for all the girls in my family.  A true game changer!</li>
            <li> helps the color stay longer when you use this. worth it</li>
            <li> Love this base coat polishes stay much longer now</li>
            <li> This product is horrible, even my best polish starts peeling pretty much right away, worst base ever!! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Best base coat, hands down (pun intended). I used to be a manicurist and this base coat sticks to your nails with a tackiness that allows the polish to adhere to it for a stronger attachment. Nice!</li>
            <li> I didnt see any difference in it. My nail colors still chipped</li>
            <li> Have only used once, not sure if it&#x27;s any better than regular base coat like Revlon.</li>
            <li> excellent for weak and brittle nails.  at long last I have nails.</li>
            <li> Gets globby and impossible to apply after a while, and doesn&#x27;t last long, but I do use it really frequently.</li>
            <li> I love Stickey base coat. It is the best base coat when new. However, when it gets older it leaves your nails with a slight green tint.  You can see it through clear or light colored polishes. I&#x27;ve had my current bottle just under a year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s significantly better than some of the other excellent products out there. I didn&#x27;t find it lasted any longer than the other high end base coats available. My hands are busy so I find I have to manicure at least once a week no matter what.</li>
            <li> Used in salons,now available at home.  Use for long lasting nail polish base. Lasts a long time for reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I &amp;#60;Highly Recommend&amp;#62; this seller! My product is exactly as described &amp; I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it;)</li>
            <li> Very protective but can cause paint to peel off easier ( in one piece)</li>
            <li> Delivery within 6 days. The nail polish itself is awesome in the first month. I do alot of nail art and repaint my nails frequently, and found that this stained my nails a bit green, and left a residue that never went away until i buffed it off. I switched to orly!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I have been looking for a good base coat for years as I love nail polish but hate that it never stays longer than 2-3 days.  Started using this and my manicures now last anywhere from 1-2 weeks (which is long enough from me as I get bored with my color too often and change within that 1-2 week time frame) even when doing housework!</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery &amp; great price</li>
            <li> I was excited to find a product that would minimize nail polish chipping. However, it sadly did not work any better than any other Base Coat. I wash my hands frequently, since I teach Pre-K and have 3 children of my own. My nail polish still chipped every time I would polish them, and I do not buy cheap polish. I also do not wear or like fake nails; acrylic or gel. With using this product, I still had to polish my nails pretty much every other day or not wear nail polish at all, because of my busy schedule. I want a product that I can use that will protect my polish against everyday activities such as washing dishes, doing laundry and carrying groceries...with that being said, I HATE CHIPPED POLISH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> this base coast allowed the polish to stay on longer</li>
            <li> This is the best base I&#x27;ve found for bare nails before applying nail polish.  It really does make the nail polish adhere better, and resist chipping and peeling.  I only \\&quot;discovered\\&quot; it after a nail tech at a salon used it during my manicure/pedicure.</li>
            <li> Very good unless it is the problem with chipping and not the top coat. I have bad nails so should not be reviewing. My problems could be my nails.</li>
            <li> Best base coat I have used, hands down.  It extends the life of manicures and pedicures by at least a week.</li>
            <li> Grab more then one  This is exactly as it says.. Your polish will stay on longer and does not chip on day one - two - three- probably can  get a week</li>
            <li> works super great. number one base available</li>
            <li> Helps polish stay on a bit longer</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this helped my nail polish stay on very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many nail polishes, top and base coats from a variety of lines.&lt;br /&gt;This ... was a huge disappointment and did NOT stand up to its claims.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers must have ordered directly but Amazon, I think this item was a fraud.</li>
            <li> This product arrived half-full, with the nail product spilled all over the box &amp; bottle!  When finally used, it did not live up to the advertising.</li>
