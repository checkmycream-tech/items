            <li> Makes my hair feel hard instead of soft.</li>
            <li> When using the antisplit blowdry cream use only a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely frizzy curly hair that will attack people.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday before I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Weighs my hair down.</li>

            <li> this is really working on the ends of my hair.  without using it before, my ends would get frizzy by the end of the day.  now, i just have to put this in, blow dry and go and my hair does not end up frizzy...thanks ms. shelly for introducing me to this!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product at the salon where I have my hair cut.  I use several of Pureology&#x27;s products and they are spendy. This is a good product at a reasonable price.  When using the antisplit blowdry cream use only a small amount.  It will leave a film on your hair if you use too much.  Also,the product&#x27;s fragrance is suttle unless you use more than a few drops. Enjoy this hair product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy in my hair and honestly didn&#x27;t notice a difference.. Save your money and buy something cheaper and if you have thin hair it is to heavy of a product for that hair type</li>
            <li> Kinda of heavy.  Weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> Great product.  LOVE IT!!!!  I use this product everyday and I think it is the best.  I will order from now on.</li>

            <li> Pureology products are my favorite. I have fine but curly hair and it is hard to find products that don&#x27;t weigh down my hair or look greasy.</li>
            <li> This product gives your hair and smooth and soft look without being heavy. I am not a big product person but this I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> Tried a sample of this from my hair dresser, but didnt want to buy a $60 bottle. Found this one at a fraction of the price. I ordered it on a Monday and had it by Wednesday! Makes my (very thinck and long) hair smooth and soft after blowdrying.</li>
            <li> this was one of the other items I bought together to get a nice shine on my hair. It did not get shiney and kinda felt heavy.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff before any other product.. has totally transformed my style.  I have naturally curly, corse, dry hair, that I wash and style every day.  This adds an additional level of soft protection.  Would never go without it!</li>
            <li> I always leave off one star because there is always room for improvement.  However - this product has done wonders for my VERY FINE hair.  Thank you Amazon and Pureology</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been searching for a heat protectant that didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and added shine. This is perfect for my thick naturally curly hair. My hair looks and feels healthier after only 3 days.</li>
            <li> I had used this product before and I love it. Makes my hair so smooth and looks like a salon blow dry</li>
            <li> I would not buy this product again.  Didn&#x27;t seem to work at all and made my hair weighted down.  Just didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this from my stylist, but ran out and needed some asap. I love this product because it protects my hair from the heat of styling products without weighing down my hair. And it&#x27;s so convenient using Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> I was so happy with my order. It was easy to order, the product came in a short wait time, and it was exactly what I wanted for what I paid! Great experience all the way around!</li>

            <li> This is one of the best products for straightening and blow-drying my hair. I have extremely frizzy curly hair that will attack people. Whether my hair is wet or dry I apply it to my hair while either straightening or blow-drying and it eliminates the frizz and helps give my hair body, without my hair looking like I&#x27;ve fried the life out of it. I now don&#x27;t feel as bad about using my flat iron every day. I can&#x27;t wait to see how it holds up with humidity come summer.</li>
            <li> Smooths grizzlies and smells great!  Love the soft feeling of my hair!</li>
            <li> Works great and I have to have fourteen more words in order to submit this so I will keep writing.</li>
            <li> I use this every day on long, fine straight hair. It reduces frizz and keeps my hair nice looking all day. It helps counteract my bang cowlicks w/o weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> Great pre-style product!!</li>
