            <li>a good job on my cheeks, chin and under my nose</li>
            <li>Great for straight shaving and wonderful for travel.  </li>
            <li>Am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Worked amazingly at the beginning</li>
            <li>Nice package.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning is kind of a pain, but what can you do?</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer was effective, though I didn&#x27;t use it much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shave is pretty good, and it is easy on my cuts, and the battery system is the best.  </li>
            <li>Great for a quick shave and for traveling.</li>
            <li>My husband has taken this shaver on three trips so far and is very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Good for clean up shave</li>
            <li>Handy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Good for quick touch up shaves in between</li>
            <li>Well, this isn&#x27;t one of them for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that he has been using it most of the time now  --- and the trip hasn&#x27;t even happened yet.  </li>
            <li>Excellent shaver especially for the price</li>
            <li>But, this one is better than my fancy triple rotating blade razor</li>
            <li>This my 3rd Braun shaver and to me, it is the very best!</li>
            <li>My favorite feature is the AA battery power.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it give a pretty good shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bigger than I thought it would be and is built very good.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers noted, it isn&#x27;t perfect.</li>
            <li>I had the older Braun battery operated shaver and loved it.</li>
            <li>I love it because I know I am going to get a clean, smooth shave every time.</li>
            <li>His beard is rather light.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>AA batteries always available.</li>
            <li>The unit is light weight and&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got it without doing much research and assuming Braun just makes amazing shavers.</li>
            <li>It has flex head and is comfortable.  </li>
            <li>so it is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>All on widely available AAs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I have not yet tried that, although it appears it will survive light washing well.</li>
            <li>It is my backup travel razor and it works great for that second clean up shave.</li>
            <li>Small, light weight, excellent for travel, which is what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Very quick and easy to operate.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>Awesome little travel shaver!</li>
            <li>This unit is great for traveling or just getting a quick shave when necessary.  </li>
            <li>it is strong, gives a good shave, and the protective swing cover means I do not have to use an extra case for the shaver in my toiletry bag.</li>
            <li>When it first stopped charging, I was still able to use it plugged in.  </li>
            <li>A great little battery razor, gives a very smooth shave quickly.</li>
            <li>It is just a bit larger than my original impression from the ad, but it is still a fairly compact device.</li>
            <li>Performance is good enough.</li>
            <li>It is not as good as double edge razor shaving, but in an emergency, it&lt;br /&gt;is</li>
            <li>Requires multiple passes to get the job done, but good results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s full price is $25</li>
            <li>The extreme humidity and heat was a great challenge and the shaver was not even close to working as advertised  </li>
            <li>It may be perfect for people with soft facial hair which isn&#x27;t as dense, but for the rest of the men out there with thick hairs and dense growth, you&#x27;re better off with something more sophisticated, preferably a plug-in shaver imo.</li>
            <li>Extremely good for the cost and for using AA batteries,  I HIGHLY recommend this for the on the go person but make sure you clean it every other shave or you will get particles all over you when shaving.  </li>
            <li>Braun leaves a pretty good shave for an electric – plus this thing runs on regular AA batteries.  </li>
            <li>Great little shaver.</li>
            <li>I need to shave while on the road and this little shaver does a great job.</li>
            <li>Great little shaver.</li>
            <li>Great little shaver.</li>
            <li>am learning to shave with a straight razor, and did not realize before this that straight razors are the reason most guys grew beards before the advent of the safety razor.  </li>
            <li>Keep several of these handy; one in a travel bag, one in the car.</li>
            <li>All-in-all, I am so far pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li>Very nice little unit.</li>
            <li>When I do shave daily, it is pretty easy and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin more than I tend to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t work right</li>
            <li>So far I’ve been using it a lot more than my straight razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit bigger, and the trimmer is no where near as good.</li>
            <li>Good little travel razor.  </li>
            <li>All in all, pretty useful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only problem I had with the shaver is the plastic on-off switch broke off after many years.</li>
            <li>(compressed air is pretty helpful here).</li>
            <li>The hairs got longer and more numerous over time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many battery powered shavers in the past, but the quality of this Braun M90 surpasses by a huge margin any on the market.  </li>
            <li>Works very well for me,</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the M-90, its small compact &amp; has locking cover.</li>
            <li>Tried it out when I received it and it worked very well</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re not saving much by buying it on Amazon either.</li>
            <li>Very well made shaver.</li>
            <li>The M90 gives me a very close shave, as close as a blade and faster  without the hassle of foam.  </li>
            <li>He really likes it.  </li>
            <li>It is also very durable.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re supposed to be able to use this wet.</li>
            <li>It shaves very close</li>
            <li>The best part is the price because it doesn&#x27;t come with all the fancy cleaning system and other bells and whistles that I hardly missed.</li>
            <li>Better than average travel shaver.  </li>
            <li>and he said he has been loving it and uses it everyday!</li>
            <li>My 200.00 razor gave up the ghost, and this way cheaper razor works gar better than the more expensive one.</li>
            <li>Much better than more expensive shaver with close cut to save time.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good replacement but not ideal.</li>
            <li>Either rinse with water and then oil (should come with a starter container of oil to get you hook on that and ordering refills), or use the attached brush, which doesn&#x27;t work particularly well</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this electric razor.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m certain I have gone way over the estimated usage.</li>
            <li>So I had to get a new one.</li>
            <li>It is light weight, and toe batteries last a long time.  </li>
            <li>It is small remember and fills up fast but does a better job than my larger Norelco in terms of a close shave.</li>
            <li>Purchased this because I sometimes forget to shave in the morning (retired old fogy).  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that it works quite well . .</li>
            <li>This is my second one, and I used to use the first only for travel.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the M90 to replace my 15-year old Braun 5564 that finally stopped charging and quit working even in the plugged mode.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as shaving, well, I have an issue with shaving daily</li>
            <li>I like that there is a protective cover over the foil, and it&#x27;s the first little portable I&#x27;ve seen that also has a trimmer.</li>
            <li>Still a few stray light hairs which no razor other than a blade will get.</li>

            <li> Good for clean up shave</li>
            <li> Performance is good enough.</li>
            <li> It is my backup travel razor and it works great for that second clean up shave.</li>
            <li> TThis is the second one I bought as a gift for my dad since the first one has been serving me well for the past three years.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband has taken this shaver on three trips so far and is very happy with it. His beard is rather light. It is well designed.</li>
            <li> As expected. Great little shaver.</li>
            <li> A great little battery razor, gives a very smooth shave quickly. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Fairly good shaver for the price.</li>
            <li> I use it for my scalp to maintain a bald look. Works very well for me, best part is I&#x27;m not tied to a charger, just replace batteries as needed.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this electric razor.  Braun leaves a pretty good shave for an electric – plus this thing runs on regular AA batteries.  All in all, pretty useful.&lt;br /&gt;I am learning to shave with a straight razor, and did not realize before this that straight razors are the reason most guys grew beards before the advent of the safety razor.  I look like I am a member of a 19th century German dueling society with wounds on both side of my face.  Each time I slash myself, and I am waiting to scar up enough to try again, I use the Braun electric.  The shave is pretty good, and it is easy on my cuts, and the battery system is the best.  So far I’ve been using it a lot more than my straight razor.</li>
            <li> Handy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the M-90, its small compact &amp; has locking cover. AA batteries always available. Good for quick touch up shaves in between</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many battery powered shavers in the past, but the quality of this Braun M90 surpasses by a huge margin any on the market.  Great product and great value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AVP</li>
            <li> My 200.00 razor gave up the ghost, and this way cheaper razor works gar better than the more expensive one. What a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RJP</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose, but I wouldn&#x27;t rely on its daily use.</li>
            <li> This unit is great for traveling or just getting a quick shave when necessary.  The unit is light weight and&lt;br /&gt;does a good job when required.  It is not as good as double edge razor shaving, but in an emergency, it&lt;br /&gt;is just what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li> Requires multiple passes to get the job done, but good results.</li>
            <li> Purchased this because I sometimes forget to shave in the morning (retired old fogy).  I carry it in my car, just in case.  Tried it out when I received it and it worked very well</li>
            <li> It works well for me. I really like it. Much better than more expensive shaver with close cut to save time.</li>
            <li> Awesome little travel shaver! I usually only use it when I&#x27;m away from home, but I think it would be totally viable as an everyday shaver.</li>
            <li> I need to shave while on the road and this little shaver does a great job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a piece of crap that runs on batteries, lasts only 60 minutes, and can&#x27;t shave at all. It&#x27;s full price is $25 so you&#x27;re not saving much by buying it on Amazon either. It may be perfect for people with soft facial hair which isn&#x27;t as dense, but for the rest of the men out there with thick hairs and dense growth, you&#x27;re better off with something more sophisticated, preferably a plug-in shaver imo. Reviewers on YouTube say the same thing. I got it without doing much research and assuming Braun just makes amazing shavers. Well, this isn&#x27;t one of them for sure. At least it didn&#x27;t work for me and now I&#x27;m out $20.</li>
            <li> Nice package. Not quite as close shave as Philips rotary.  Good to travel with. I like it has a built in cover.</li>
            <li> I had the older Braun battery operated shaver and loved it. But they don&#x27;t make it anymore. This is a pretty good replacement but not ideal. It&#x27;s a bit bigger, and the trimmer is no where near as good. I&#x27;d get the option without the trimmer next time and save the money. Otherwise, it give a pretty good shave.</li>
            <li> Very well made shaver. Solid feel. Works good. Integral blade guard is very nice feature. Great for touchup shaves&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was a staff member at the National Boy Scout Jamboree that we just held in West Virginia.  The extreme humidity and heat was a great challenge and the shaver was not even close to working as advertised  It missed hairs constantly, and even when I tried to re-shave these missed hairs, the shaver could not cut them.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed -</li>
            <li> Great little shaver. I use it all the time. This is my second shaver like this. The only problem I had with the shaver is the plastic on-off switch broke off after many years. So I had to get a new one.</li>
            <li> purchased the Braun M90 for a second - travel shivery. Am very pleased with it. The M90 is giving me excellent service.</li>
            <li> I purchased the M90 to replace my 15-year old Braun 5564 that finally stopped charging and quit working even in the plugged mode.  When it first stopped charging, I was still able to use it plugged in.  I had purchased a Braun 7000-series as a replacement but that stopped charging after about 4 years (and won&#x27;t run plugged in).  I  purchased a Panasonic to replace that but it died about 3 years later.  The problem with all of them seems to be short battery life.  Unfortunately, these batteries are difficult or even impossible to replace.  Since the M90 uses two AA batteries I could simply change the rechargeable batteries.  Now about the performance of the M90...  It is a single Blane, small size shaver.  Great for straight shaving and wonderful for travel.  It has flex head and is comfortable.  I don&#x27;t have heavy growth or hard hair.  The M90 gives me a very close shave, as close as a blade and faster  without the hassle of foam.  It is rinsable so it is easy to clean.  The best part is the price because it doesn&#x27;t come with all the fancy cleaning system and other bells and whistles that I hardly missed.</li>
            <li> Great little shaver. Has run 2 months on one charge of the rechargeable batteries (not included in the shaver as shipped.)  Still a few stray light hairs which no razor other than a blade will get.</li>
            <li> Better than average travel shaver.  Handles a day&#x27;s growth well, but not up to the job if you let your beard grow for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> While traveling this Brawn Mobile Shaver is the  answer.  It is light weight, and toe batteries last a long time.  Beside you do not have to carry shaving cream and use  water.</li>
            <li> Extremely good for the cost and for using AA batteries,  I HIGHLY recommend this for the on the go person but make sure you clean it every other shave or you will get particles all over you when shaving.  It is small remember and fills up fast but does a better job than my larger Norelco in terms of a close shave.</li>
            <li> A Christmas gift for my son....he said he had one sometime ago and it wore out...so he wanted another of the same thing...he loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to use on an upcoming month-long trip.  He has used a travel Braun in the past, so we decided to go with the same brand.  I&#x27;ve noticed that he has been using it most of the time now  --- and the trip hasn&#x27;t even happened yet.  He really likes it.  Excellent price for a good shave!</li>
            <li> Great for a quick shave and for traveling. I take it with me when I&#x27;m going for a shoot just to freshen up. Works pretty well for a small shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed at the battery life. So far I&#x27;m certain I have gone way over the estimated usage. Regardless, it&#x27;s impressive. All on widely available AAs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as shaving, well, I have an issue with shaving daily, so I do end up with 2-3 days&#x27; growth a lot of times, and this has a hard time catching all my whiskers, especially given the totally random swirl patterns my facial hair likes to grow in. So, unless you&#x27;re shaving every 24 hours, you may find yourself shaving a lot longer and going over spots again and again. When I do shave daily, it is pretty easy and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin more than I tend to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is kind of a pain, but what can you do? Either rinse with water and then oil (should come with a starter container of oil to get you hook on that and ordering refills), or use the attached brush, which doesn&#x27;t work particularly well (compressed air is pretty helpful here).</li>
            <li> nice cut and look great. plus battery is lasting very long time.  good for home and vacation use.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver especially for the price</li>
            <li> This is my second one, and I used to use the first only for travel.  But, this one is better than my fancy triple rotating blade razor and I will use it all the time.  It was less money than replacing my triple blade razor, also.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Small, light weight, excellent for travel, which is what I wanted.  Too weak for everyday home use.</li>
            <li> I hate this and it didn&#x27;t work right so I threw it out.</li>
            <li> Worked amazingly at the beginning but now my husband doesn&#x27;t have as good of a shave as before.  Even after cleaning it.</li>
            <li> This my 3rd Braun shaver and to me, it is the very best! I love it because I know I am going to get a clean, smooth shave every time. It is also very durable. I would recommend it to all you guys that want the best shave!</li>
            <li> Does not give a good shave, plus, it shocked me when I used it wet. You&#x27;re supposed to be able to use this wet. I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> Got this for my dad and he said he has been loving it and uses it everyday!</li>
            <li> Good little travel razor.  Keep several of these handy; one in a travel bag, one in the car.</li>
            <li> Compact, battery operated, very good, close shave. I like that there is a protective cover over the foil, and it&#x27;s the first little portable I&#x27;ve seen that also has a trimmer. Very nice little unit.</li>
            <li> I used to use the same standard sized shaver for both home and travel. I recently replaced my previous shaver with one of the newer types that use a base station cleaner/charger, and the shaver is also somewhat larger, so I purchased this one as a companion small device strictly for travel. I had half expected that being battery powered it would be on the weak side for shaving. I was pleasantly surprised that it works quite well . . it is strong, gives a good shave, and the protective swing cover means I do not have to use an extra case for the shaver in my toiletry bag. It is just a bit larger than my original impression from the ad, but it is still a fairly compact device. I have used it in a carry-on bag, it did not cause any issues with the TSA check. It advertizes washable but I have not yet tried that, although it appears it will survive light washing well. The batteries (2xAA) reside in the bottom under what appears to be a water-resistant rotating/locking cap. All-in-all, I am so far pleased with this shaver.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very quick and easy to operate.&lt;br /&gt;Nice that a brush was included and fits within a pocket in the base of the razor&lt;br /&gt;Did a good job on my cheeks, chin and under my nose&lt;br /&gt;The batteries lasted a long time, once I got beyond the initial set provided with the razor (which only lasted about a week)&lt;br /&gt;Very convenient when camping out of a tent&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer was effective, though I didn&#x27;t use it much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over time, the razor left long hairs on my neck. No amount of back and forth would remove them. The hairs got longer and more numerous over time. Eventually, I used a conventional double bladed razor to remove them.</li>
            <li> I have used this product as my only shaver for years. As other reviewers noted, it isn&#x27;t perfect. It leaves a few long hairs from time to time, but the built in trimmer can take care of those. My favorite feature is the AA battery power. You never end up shaving with the weak end of a charge, as you must periodically do with a rechargeable shaver. They don&#x27;t sell plug-in shavers anymore, so the options are narrow. The crazy thing: a new blade and foil costs nearly as much as a new shaver, so I simply buy the cheaper model without the trimmer and swap out the blade and foil. Seems like a waste, but what can you do?</li>
            <li> This is a very good shaver. It shaves very close I am very happy with it. It&#x27;s bigger than I thought it would be and is built very good.</li>
