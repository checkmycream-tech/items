            <li>Very happy.  </li>
            <li>Always excellent product!!!</li>
            <li>This is the best nipper I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>I was debating if to get the cheaper non-stainless or this and happy</li>
            <li>and it came is a sturdy case that is great for storage</li>
            <li>excellent nippers,I liked that it has a piece of plastic to keep on the tips when it isn&#x27;t being used.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find the 1/4 jaw on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Was worried they wouldn&#x27;t be the right size, but they are perfect!  </li>
            <li>Easy transaction Great product</li>
            <li>She was thrilled with them both.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>After tightening them, it worked ok.  </li>
            <li>This one is sharp and does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>VERY sharp and excellent quality.</li>
            <li>If you like the smaller jaw size this is great.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic clippers.  </li>
            <li>and they will fix it and sharpen it and return it to me for free.</li>
            <li>I have some of their tweezers and they are fantastic.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut cleanly, just hacks away at the cuticle.</li>
            <li>Love it will continue to buy this product it is of good quality and sharp</li>
            <li>These are very sharp, easy to use and work great, this is like my 4th pair</li>
            <li>My wife had a really good pair of cuticle nippers for MANY years, but I was not able to find anyone in the pacific northwest that could sharpen them.</li>
            <li>It looks nice, feels sturdy, moves smoothly and is sharp.  </li>
            <li>I have about ten nippers right now and all of them are nowhere near as good as this one.</li>
            <li>Great item, and feels much nicer than the non-stainless plain brand i had before.  </li>
            <li>These are exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>This one works just as well as my first.</li>
            <li>Had to wait longer than normal for delivery, but, the nippers are worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>If you need a sharp cuticle nipper to clean up your nails, this will fit the bill.</li>
            <li>The product works very well and is very well made.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t open and close smoothly, but is balky and sticky.</li>
            <li>I do like the quality though but wish it didn&#x27;t need so much maintenance.</li>
            <li>Still, this is the size I prefer and I am getting used to this particular</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these cuticle nippers.</li>
            <li>It has always worked very well and when I tried to replace it in local stores, only the 1/2 jaw was available.  </li>
            <li>Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>These are very sharp and precise, the spring that provides resistance from both handles makes it very durable</li>
            <li>I thought that it would last a bit more, it was not sharp enough and the screws that hold the inside pliers to give tension loosened a lot until I lost them</li>
            <li>clippers are extremely sharp and someone working at Sephora told me that Tweezerman accepts their products once a year for sharpening for free.</li>
            <li>When I first tried it, I noticed that it did not spring back.  </li>
            <li>It is way too easy to make a mess with short little snips that cause more issues than they can fix.</li>
            <li>Very high quality, and these things last forever.</li>
            <li>so I hope these last longer than the rest since I paid much more&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll have to tighten them periodically - something I never had to do with my old ones.  </li>
            <li>I had an old Tweezerman nipper which was becoming dull.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Tweezerman due to the solid name brand, and that they were stainless steel and not made in Viet Nam.</li>
            <li>Nothing (and I mean Nothing) in the drugstore was sharp at all and would tear my cuticles even more.</li>

            <li> Apparently you can get clippers in full, 1/2 and 1/4 jaw...which refers to the length of the actual cutting area.</li>

            <li> Sharp cutters.  </li>
            <li> It is sharp.</li>
            <li> only negative comment I have is that the spring that keeps the trimmer stay open is unusual and a bit awkward.</li>
            <li> I have had one in the past and it lasted for a long time</li>
            <li> Not sure if this will fix itself over time.</li>
            <li> Extremely dull blades, I ended up with bleeding cuticles because of all the tugging, i do not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> No gap along the cutting surface when closed.  </li>
            <li> 1/4 jaw (1/4 size) are not easy to find, but they are the size that make the tiniest nips and can get into corners and difficult areas around your nails.</li>
            <li> These were broken when I received them.</li>
            <li> I was also confused about the \\&quot;1/4 jaw\\&quot; thing.</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s practically useless.</li>
            <li> these are going dull already....  :(</li>
            <li> Never can go wrong purchasing Twrezman!</li>
            <li> Am very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Was worried they wouldn&#x27;t be the right size, but they are perfect!  No gap along the cutting surface when closed.  Very happy.  Packaging looked a little old and worn, but that doesn&#x27;t matter, they aren&#x27;t a gift.</li>
            <li> Always excellent product!!! Never can go wrong purchasing Twrezman!</li>
            <li> My wife had a really good pair of cuticle nippers for MANY years, but I was not able to find anyone in the pacific northwest that could sharpen them. I purchased the Tweezerman due to the solid name brand, and that they were stainless steel and not made in Viet Nam. I purchased both the 1/4 jaw and the 1/2 jaw, as she had both sizes before. She was thrilled with them both. VERY sharp and excellent quality.Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> If you like the smaller jaw size this is great.  It looks nice, feels sturdy, moves smoothly and is sharp.  Great item, and feels much nicer than the non-stainless plain brand i had before.  I was debating if to get the cheaper non-stainless or this and happy i got this one. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Easy transaction Great product</li>
            <li> Bought them for my girlfriend, she likes them.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp and precise, the spring that provides resistance from both handles makes it very durable and it came is a sturdy case that is great for storage</li>
            <li> Extremely well made and extremely sharp.  These are exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> These are very sharp, easy to use and work great, this is like my 4th pair so I hope these last longer than the rest since I paid much more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up, yeah these are going dull already....  :(</li>
            <li> The product works very well and is very well made. I believe they shall last me years.</li>
            <li> These were broken when I received them.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut cleanly, just hacks away at the cuticle. It also doesn&#x27;t open and close smoothly, but is balky and sticky. For the price it should be a precision instrument. Will not purchase again. Am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Fantastic clippers.  Easy to use.  Sharp cutters.  Plus there is a protective cover for the tip.  I highly recommend these cuticle nippers.</li>
            <li> Had to wait longer than normal for delivery, but, the nippers are worth the wait.  THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> This is the best nipper I have ever owned. I have about ten nippers right now and all of them are nowhere near as good as this one. I am still not sure if this will get dull as fast as the other ones did, but when it does, I will be willing to buy another one. It is very easy to handle. The spring-like mechanism works like it is supposed to. It is sharp.</li>
            <li> Sending them back. Extremely dull blades, I ended up with bleeding cuticles because of all the tugging, i do not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> Love it. Had another one before, the spring broke. But Tweezerman really stands behind their lifetime warranty, I called them and they said to send it in and they will fix it and sharpen it and return it to me for free. This one works just as well as my first.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman does it again! I have some of their tweezers and they are fantastic. Really needed a very sharp cuticle nipper for my chronically dry and ragged cuticles.Nothing (and I mean Nothing) in the drugstore was sharp at all and would tear my cuticles even more. This one is sharp and does the job perfectly. If you need a sharp cuticle nipper to clean up your nails, this will fit the bill. Very high quality, and these things last forever.</li>
            <li> I was also confused about the \\&quot;1/4 jaw\\&quot; thing. Apparently you can get clippers in full, 1/2 and 1/4 jaw...which refers to the length of the actual cutting area. 1/4 jaw (1/4 size) are not easy to find, but they are the size that make the tiniest nips and can get into corners and difficult areas around your nails. However, the small size makes them more difficult to master. It is way too easy to make a mess with short little snips that cause more issues than they can fix. Still, this is the size I prefer and I am getting used to this particular pair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are extremely sharp and someone working at Sephora told me that Tweezerman accepts their products once a year for sharpening for free. I have to look into that if they ever become dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative comment I have is that the spring that keeps the trimmer stay open is unusual and a bit awkward. Instead of one lever (no idea what they are actually called), there are two that clip into one another. I find the clippers don&#x27;t open wide enough for me and I have to manually adjust them. Not sure if this will fix itself over time. I have only had the clippers for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I had an old Tweezerman nipper which was becoming dull.  It has always worked very well and when I tried to replace it in local stores, only the 1/2 jaw was available.  I was delighted to find the 1/4 jaw on Amazon.  When I first tried it, I noticed that it did not spring back.  I noticed that the screws attaching the middle pieces to the outside ones were loose.  After tightening them, it worked ok.  However, a couple of weeks later the same thing happened.  I guess I&#x27;ll have to tighten them periodically - something I never had to do with my old ones.  I do like the quality though but wish it didn&#x27;t need so much maintenance.</li>
            <li> excellent nippers,I liked that it has a piece of plastic to keep on the tips when it isn&#x27;t being used.</li>
