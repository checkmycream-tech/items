            <li>THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST FOOT SCRUBBERS I&#x27;VE USED</li>
            <li>This is the best friend of both of my feet.</li>
            <li>It did take 2 or 3 times to get the best results.</li>

            <li>I can recommend this foot scrubber and the price was also great.</li>
            <li>My feet look great.  </li>
            <li>They did a great job cleaning the feet and hands, and removing callouses.</li>
            <li>Very effective.</li>
            <li>Very nice feel.</li>
            <li>A GOOD PEDICURE TREATMENT!&lt;br</li>
            <li>would recommend this to others looking for a good solution to soften feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice size, shape, price and - effective!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>and it disappeared was glad to see that I was able to get one again here on Amazon works amazing great product</li>
            <li>Helping the women of Pakistan is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>The company is also incredibly courteous and treats their customers well.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, effective and affordable!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After first use, I loved it!</li>
            <li>It is still fresh and works great after 2 years.  </li>
            <li>My feet always look great right after I&#x27;m done...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for just over a week now and love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE SHAPE AND THE HANDLE.</li>
            <li>This really does a great job of smoothing out your feet</li>
            <li>It would have made a better clay mask than foot scrubber.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I just bought 3 more as gifts.</li>
            <li>Better than anything else.</li>
            <li>I plugged the hole with epoxy, and it works OK, but I expect it to break every time I use it and wouldn&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li>but I had to rebuy it because I loved it so much.</li>
            <li>Perfect pumice with a buffer on the other side.</li>
            <li>/&gt;WASHES EASILY WITH A BRUSH.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to grip too.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Again, while still being comfortable.</li>
            <li>My first one arrived fine, and it is my favorite foot scrubber, but is almost worn smooth after about 1.5 years of use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>The terra-cotta is soft on your skin and highly effective at scrubbing.</li>
            <li>I returned it for a full refund, but am reluctant to reorder as I don&#x27;t know if they are still using the bubble wrap envelope to ship these.</li>
            <li>The product disintegrates on first use!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about how effective this is.</li>
            <li>It stays fresh even though I leave it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It works with the right softening agent...</li>
            <li>I just have to remember to put lotion when I&#x27;m done otherwise the crack right away again.</li>
            <li>Broke right away.</li>
            <li>I loved my previous Gliden Tree Foot Scrubber, which lasted forever.</li>
            <li>Very light weight and very fragile.</li>
            <li>This is my second one I had one many years ago</li>
            <li>First time I used it, it just broke from the handle.</li>
            <li>The handle snapped after first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bah.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It started wearing out after the first use.</li>
            <li>Nothing can exfoliate your feet better and the less rough side is good for the elbows.</li>
            <li>WON&#x27;T OVER EXERT YOURSELF , I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE THAT WANTS</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested in seeing how long it lasts, but it works pretty good with a little soap on it and it gets your feet pretty soft.</li>
            <li>Originally they made these out of solid terracotta clay.</li>
            <li>Does a decent job on my feet.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this scrubber.</li>
            <li>The side that looks like a cheese grater on meth scrubs off dead skin (more gently than you&#x27;d think), while the non-scary looking side buffs the freshly scrubbed skin smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve managed to break 2 of these, and am on my third.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Now my rough foot looks like the protected, smooth foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The texture is rougher and more uneven.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that it seems sturdy and should last a very long time :)</li>
            <li>I got my first one of these when I was in my mid teens and have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li>As far as the complaints go about it breaking, it&#x27;s simple-don&#x27;t drop it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased two so far.</li>
            <li>Also, I used it on my sensitive foot out of curiosity.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Normally I would have said this is an awesome foot scrub, but I am very disappointed about this particular pumice.</li>
            <li>The dead skin rolls right off !</li>
            <li>The regular pumice stones at Walmart or whatever don&#x27;t work nearly as well and this product!!</li>
            <li>Normally, can&#x27;t use anything because it hurts but this foot scrubber seems extra gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>CLEAN REMOVING A LOT OF DEAD SKIN !</li>
            <li>It seems like it will last a long time, if it ever needs replacing, I&#x27;m going to get exactly the same thing!</li>
            <li>The product looks nice, But its useless.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be purchasing another one and sadly have to find a new brand to love.</li>
            <li>Far more so than the grey drug store variety of pumice stones I&#x27;ve used and tossed after not much use in the past.</li>
            <li>This seriously leaves my tootsies as smooth as the pros.</li>
            <li>They say it never wears out, but the middle of mine has worn out so that it&#x27;s not rough anymore and doesn&#x27;t exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>I really like that it doesn&#x27;t ever get worn down.</li>
            <li>When I opened this I noticed right away that there was a chip out of the pumice along with several small spots that look like the start of chips.  </li>

            <li> The main reason, I think, is because the holes/openings in the clay of the rough side are large enough to allow dead skin to drop out of them when gently tapped upside down on a hard surface while still being small enough to be comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> After numerous surgeries and casts on one foot, the other foot seems extra tough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> however it will dry out your feet...</li>
            <li> This was defective - it wasn&#x27;t dried or fired properly because it melted in the form of red dust in my bath from the moment it touched my feet!</li>
            <li> I also think that they should have made both sides rough, rather than having ridges on one side.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even feel rough at all.</li>
            <li> Also, the edges of all the little scrubby holes feel sharper/firmer and less prone to wearing down than traditional grey pumice stones.</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s different now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear shoes, and used my old one everyday for over five years for hard scrubbing until my wife dropped it in the shower and broke it.</li>
            <li> Or when your husband decides to pop your 3 month old baby&#x27;s head around the shower curtain while saying, \\&quot;Peekaboo!\\&quot; in a high-pitched voice, making you scream like a little girl while you violently rip the handle off of your terra-cotta pumice stone in a display of your super strength.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> It never makes my feet feel raw, but it definitely exfoliates the dead skin.  </li>
            <li> No more dry heels!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice and think I will like it, as long as the chips don&#x27;t get bigger and make the pumice useless.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with my heels cracking for years, so this little scrubber has quite a bit to work on.</li>
            <li> The product comes with this little tag \\&quot;...</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> hand crafted, sun dried, and kiln-fired so it never wears out!\\&quot;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It removes the dead, peeling skin and then smooths it.  </li>
            <li> I ordered a second one and it arrived broken as it was packaged in a bubble wrap envelope with no box or protective covering and broke in two pieces during the shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a strict budget for the past year</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clay, and clay tends to break when dropped on a hard floor.</li>
            <li> poor quality and poor customer service.</li>
            <li> Now they are making them out of plaster of pares with a thin coat of fired terracotta.</li>
            <li> Sad story!&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> arrived broken in pieces :(</li>
            <li> To bad you can&#x27;t leave pictures here.</li>
            <li> Never been so disappointed in a purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> Terrible product!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This scrubber is my favorite !!! The regular pumice stones at Walmart or whatever don&#x27;t work nearly as well and this product!! The texture is rougher and more uneven. I use it after a shower so my skin is soft but not soaking wet. The dead skin rolls right off !</li>
            <li> simple but efficient. Does a great job. I highly reccomend this scrubber. Helping the women of Pakistan is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for just over a week now and love it. I&#x27;ve been on a strict budget for the past year so one of the luxuries that I miss is a regular pedicure. Now I don&#x27;t have to! This seriously leaves my tootsies as smooth as the pros. I can&#x27;t say enough about how effective this is. I, and my happy feet, are grateful.     Oh, another plus - their packaging was all recyclable materials.</li>
            <li> Nice size, shape, price and - effective! Far more so than the grey drug store variety of pumice stones I&#x27;ve used and tossed after not much use in the past. The main reason, I think, is because the holes/openings in the clay of the rough side are large enough to allow dead skin to drop out of them when gently tapped upside down on a hard surface while still being small enough to be comfortable to use. A perfect balance! Also, the edges of all the little scrubby holes feel sharper/firmer and less prone to wearing down than traditional grey pumice stones. Again, while still being comfortable. Comfortable, effective and affordable! Can&#x27;t beat that :D</li>
            <li> It works with the right softening agent...however it will dry out your feet...use lots of lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Very effective. Definitely lengthens the time between pedicures. I&#x27;ve purchased two so far. Only downside is the break ability of it. Scrubber dropped in my shower and broke into pieces but I had to rebuy it because I loved it so much.</li>
            <li> I got my first one of these when I was in my mid teens and have been using it ever since. Nothing can exfoliate your feet better and the less rough side is good for the elbows. The company is also incredibly courteous and treats their customers well.</li>
            <li> When I opened this I noticed right away that there was a chip out of the pumice along with several small spots that look like the start of chips.  I&#x27;ve used it twice and think I will like it, as long as the chips don&#x27;t get bigger and make the pumice useless.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST FOOT SCRUBBERS I&#x27;VE USED YET ! , CLEANS THE HEELS AND SOLES OF YOUR FEET CLEAN REMOVING A LOT OF DEAD SKIN ! LOVE THE SHAPE AND THE HANDLE. FITS IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND EASY.&lt;br /&gt;YOU WON&#x27;T OVER EXERT YOURSELF , I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE THAT WANTS A GOOD PEDICURE TREATMENT!&lt;br /&gt;WASHES EASILY WITH A BRUSH.</li>
            <li> This is my second one I had one many years ago and it disappeared was glad to see that I was able to get one again here on Amazon works amazing great product</li>
            <li> First time I used it, it just broke from the handle. The product looks nice, But its useless. Returned it.</li>
            <li> This really does a great job of smoothing out your feet and it&#x27;s easy to grip too.  They say it never wears out, but the middle of mine has worn out so that it&#x27;s not rough anymore and doesn&#x27;t exfoliate.  I also think that they should have made both sides rough, rather than having ridges on one side.</li>
            <li> This was defective - it wasn&#x27;t dried or fired properly because it melted in the form of red dust in my bath from the moment it touched my feet!</li>
            <li> Does a decent job on my feet. I have had problems with my heels cracking for years, so this little scrubber has quite a bit to work on. I really like that it doesn&#x27;t ever get worn down. My feet always look great right after I&#x27;m done...I just have to remember to put lotion when I&#x27;m done otherwise the crack right away again. As far as the complaints go about it breaking, it&#x27;s simple-don&#x27;t drop it! It&#x27;s made of terra cotta, what would happen if you dropped a flower pot?!</li>
            <li> This is the best friend of both of my feet. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. The side that looks like a cheese grater on meth scrubs off dead skin (more gently than you&#x27;d think), while the non-scary looking side buffs the freshly scrubbed skin smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve managed to break 2 of these, and am on my third. Accidents happen. It&#x27;s clay, and clay tends to break when dropped on a hard floor. Or when your husband decides to pop your 3 month old baby&#x27;s head around the shower curtain while saying, \\&quot;Peekaboo!\\&quot; in a high-pitched voice, making you scream like a little girl while you violently rip the handle off of your terra-cotta pumice stone in a display of your super strength.&lt;br /&gt;4 stars instead of 5, because it would benefit from having a rope threaded through the handle, a la \\&quot;soap on a rope.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Love this product! Beets those moldy pumice stones.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  Fell apart immediately.  Clay disintegrated as it was used to make an orange tub.  Handle broke after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> Great product, excellent quality. The terra-cotta is soft on your skin and highly effective at scrubbing. I can recommend this foot scrubber and the price was also great.</li>
            <li> Horrible! I loved my previous Gliden Tree Foot Scrubber, which lasted forever. Not sure what&#x27;s different now but this one disintegrated the minute I used it. It would have made a better clay mask than foot scrubber. I won&#x27;t be purchasing another one and sadly have to find a new brand to love.</li>
            <li> This was my 2nd Terra Cotta Pumice and it only lasted for 2 uses before it broke into 3 pieces. Normally I would have said this is an awesome foot scrub, but I am very disappointed about this particular pumice. I wrote Gilden Tree about a replacement or a refund 3 days ago and have not heard back from them...poor quality and poor customer service.</li>
            <li> Sad story!&lt;br /&gt;1) The rougher side of the product feels the same as the smoother side. Result: I still have calluses.&lt;br /&gt;2) The product disintegrates on first use! My feet were left with a film of orangy red clay.&lt;br /&gt;3) The handle snapped after first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bah.</li>
            <li> The product comes with this little tag \\&quot;...hand crafted, sun dried, and kiln-fired so it never wears out!\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started wearing out after the first use. I won&#x27;t buy this again. To bad you can&#x27;t leave pictures here.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I bought one several years ago and use it all the time.  I just bought 3 more as gifts.</li>
            <li> arrived broken in pieces :(</li>
            <li> The Gilden Tree Foot Scrubber from Amazon is a wonder.  I have used mine for years and recently bought one for my pedicurist!  She loves it, too...It removes the dead, peeling skin and then smooths it.  No more dry heels!</li>
            <li> I had one that got lost in the move, so replaced it with this one.  It is still fresh and works great after 2 years.  It never makes my feet feel raw, but it definitely exfoliates the dead skin.  My feet look great.  It stays fresh even though I leave it in the shower.  I do rinse it off after each use and I do use soap when I use it.</li>
            <li> My first one arrived fine, and it is my favorite foot scrubber, but is almost worn smooth after about 1.5 years of use. I ordered a second one and it arrived broken as it was packaged in a bubble wrap envelope with no box or protective covering and broke in two pieces during the shipping. I returned it for a full refund, but am reluctant to reorder as I don&#x27;t know if they are still using the bubble wrap envelope to ship these.</li>
            <li> Like others, I have tried and tested numerous products to soften my foot. After numerous surgeries and casts on one foot, the other foot seems extra tough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After first use, I loved it! It did take 2 or 3 times to get the best results. Now my rough foot looks like the protected, smooth foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I didn&#x27;t think it was working because I couldn&#x27;t even feel it. Watch out though, it&#x27;s working! It doesn&#x27;t even feel rough at all. Also, I used it on my sensitive foot out of curiosity. Normally, can&#x27;t use anything because it hurts but this foot scrubber seems extra gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to others looking for a good solution to soften feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion would be to have a big handle on it, but this lack won&#x27;t keep me from using it. It seems like it will last a long time, if it ever needs replacing, I&#x27;m going to get exactly the same thing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m interested in seeing how long it lasts, but it works pretty good with a little soap on it and it gets your feet pretty soft. I&#x27;d say that it seems sturdy and should last a very long time :) It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> Perfect pumice with a buffer on the other side. Easy to use. Very nice feel. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but 3 ceramic units shipped in a cardboard box without individual protective wrapping, resulted in one of them being broken!  Come on!  This is a no brainer</li>
            <li> Broke right away. Never been so disappointed in a purchase. Terrible product! Do not waste your money. Stay away from this garbage...</li>
            <li> Originally they made these out of solid terracotta clay. They did a great job cleaning the feet and hands, and removing callouses. They lasted for years. Better than anything else. Now they are making them out of plaster of pares with a thin coat of fired terracotta. Very light weight and very fragile. The one I just bought had a chip out of it revealing the plaster underneath when it arrived. I plugged the hole with epoxy, and it works OK, but I expect it to break every time I use it and wouldn&#x27;t buy another one. I&#x27;m disappointed. I don&#x27;t wear shoes, and used my old one everyday for over five years for hard scrubbing until my wife dropped it in the shower and broke it.</li>
