            <li>Battery life is awesome.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the best thing about this shaver is that I can rinse it under the faucet when I&#x27;m finished with it--and use it in the shower (which I haven&#x27;t tried yet).  </li>
            <li>The razor works well, and shaves the best of all the electric razors I&#x27;ve used</li>

            <li>Very good on-line buying experience.</li>
            <li>This is a very good electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Very good razor.</li>
            <li>It would not hold a charge and it would not shave very good</li>
            <li>The razor is very good, but don&#x27;t bother replying to the email you will get from Philips Norelco asking you to review the razor on their website after you register it.</li>
            <li>Very good razor.</li>
            <li>a wonderful value and it works great.  </li>

            <li>This is a good razor for the value!</li>
            <li>If you can get it for a good price, buy it!</li>
            <li>, to recap, this was a very good razor with great convenience to use it both in-and-out of the shower or with-or-without shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>This is a real good product, does the job well, gives you a fairly close shave, not for those who want a &amp;#34;baby face&amp;#34; level.</li>
            <li>Was a treat for myself and very pleased with construction and performance!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Best of all it gives you a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has greatly simplified my morning routine.</li>
            <li>I opened the package with great anticipation that this would be the razor for me that I&#x27;d been waiting on.  </li>
            <li>great value for the money.</li>
            <li>Purchased as a gift, recipient loves it, that makes me happy,</li>
            <li>ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR GREAT SERVICE.</li>
            <li>Great shaver.</li>
            <li>Still, for every day shaving, its great.</li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>Works great in the shower</li>

            <li>and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>The shave is not as great as I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>Another great advantage that the Philps Norelco line provides is mess-free shave.</li>
            <li>(Depending on the Shaver), which I think is a great perk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it holds a charge well, is water-proof so great in the shower.</li>
            <li>Great shaver that provides a close shave every time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and aforable</li>

            <li>Excellent and nice price.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>The 3 heads however do a great job.  </li>
            <li>for a five day beard requires a lot of shaving on the neck.otherwise the waterproofing is great for cleaning and using shave gell..</li>
            <li>Now my face is adjusted it and it works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a great product.</li>

            <li>This a very nice rechargeable razor.</li>

            <li>This is a very nice shaver.</li>

            <li>The price was fair and delivery was great.  </li>

            <li>For the best shave and system longevity, gotta keep those blades clean and lubricated!</li>
            <li>this razor has a wonderful close shave and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>but I never got a good shave either.  </li>
            <li>This is a good razor.</li>
            <li>Battery life seems fairly good.</li>
            <li>but then again it does charge fairly</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li>and they do a good job.  </li>
            <li>My skin is  smooth and the hair on my chin is cut perfectly without any irritation.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as good as the ones I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>You can buy a darned good Wahl sideburn trimmer for under $20.</li>
            <li>Will never replace shaving with barber soap and a good razor.</li>

            <li>I loved it.  </li>
            <li>What a good decision.  </li>
            <li>While lightweight, it has good power.  </li>
            <li>This razor looks so good and gives a close shave.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it in the shower and may not but good to know</li>

            <li>and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Battery life is amazing and ergonomics are good.  </li>
            <li>Never as good as a razor, but incredibly handy.</li>
            <li>Plus it make him look very nice and handsome.</li>
            <li>I have shaved with an electric razor all of my life, and this razor gives me the best and most comfortable shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li>I think the price was very reasonable and it works great!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I bought it as a hint to shave more!  </li>
            <li>I did ask (against my better judgement) for my wife to try it out in the shower on her legs (as a one time exception to our no razor sharing rule!).  </li>
            <li>It gives me even more of a close shave than the two others did!</li>
            <li>If you use a rotary and like that type of shave experience then you will like this shaver even more!</li>
            <li>but this is the top shaver in my book!</li>
            <li>Love the Norelco products!</li>
            <li>Glad I decided to get it for him this year for Christmas!</li>
            <li>and it is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Shaves real smooth without the feel of pulling.  </li>
            <li>It was great to find an electric one that shaves him comfortably and closely.</li>
            <li>Amazing cut.</li>
            <li>This razor is amazing.</li>
            <li>Razor gives a great, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>touch 2D man talk about a nice razor</li>
            <li>The head swivels as well, making for an nice close shave.</li>
            <li>Nice razor.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had this nice a shave for (well... ever I guess...</li>
            <li>Also, the fact that it comes with a charging cable as opposed to a stand was kind of a letdown.</li>
            <li>This shaver is good, comfortable to use and shave is almost as good as manual razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled this one doesn&#x27;t have that.</li>
            <li>This razor, the Philips Norelco AT830 PowerTouch Rechargeable Cordless Razor, charged up nicely, then I put it to the test.  </li>
            <li>in all, another nice electric razor from Philips Norelco.</li>
            <li>I did some research on the newer type of razors and decided the AT830 was the one I liked.  </li>
            <li>I must say that this thing gives a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>However, the quick-charging system and the aquatic feature are nice.</li>
            <li>+) razor with it&#x27;s own cleaning stand</li>
            <li>and I liked how it fits into my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I have always liked Norelco razors.  </li>
            <li>It dose a nice job.</li>
            <li>We kept the shaver as my husband did not want to bother with returning it as he liked the unit itself.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t own a stick razor, you may be going to work</li>
            <li>Good close shave and nice to be able to use in the shower.</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco shavers for many years/ but the AT830 is superior to all of them/</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice on the cheeks, but its unforgiving on the bread part.</li>
            <li>Nice product,  and it took no time for my face to get used to it.</li>
            <li>Now I own model AT830 since Christmas.</li>
            <li>I have my own model of this in Europe , so a Phillips product</li>
            <li>for day to day use it gives a nice shave.  </li>
            <li>It gives a nice close shave with minimum effort.</li>
            <li>The aquatic feature allows effective..</li>
            <li>cleaning after each shave under a faucet (warm water).</li>
            <li>Nice razor.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best yet.</li>
            <li>Nice close shave</li>
            <li>I have always liked the way the head can be washed and cleaned.</li>
            <li>He has a nice close shave and doesn&#x27;t have to put his health at risk to do that.</li>
            <li>I travel a lot and think that a carrying case would have been a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice floating head on it and does what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>is thrilled.  </li>
            <li>After about two weeks of use have to say I am quite pleased with this unit, would recommend it and the price is fair</li>
            <li>The razor works, kind of.</li>
            <li>just kind of keep getting wider and wider over time until you have to get the razor or trimmer out and shape them again.  </li>
            <li>Even though I liked that razor a lot, I like this razor</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as nice as his</li>
            <li>As with most razors it just does not do a good job on my neck.  </li>
            <li>The AT830 can be  as effective as a razor, with added benefit of no nicks; but it can&#x27;t be treated as if it was a razor:</li>
            <li>Shaves nice and close.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get a good shave for three years or more.</li>
            <li>But it is nice to have a water-resistant shaver that you can wash vigorously without having to worry about drowning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note about all types of shavers and razors.</li>
            <li>but the pivots on each head are nice for around the neck.</li>
            <li>It was handy to have.</li>
            <li>IT shaves really close which is wonderful</li>
            <li>Nice to have.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but not as good as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I recommend this shaver, it does a nice job and saves me some time in the mornings.</li>
            <li>If you honestly want to buy this, here is how to save money on your frustration:  </li>
            <li>Bought this for someone as a Christmas gift and he really liked it, unless he was just being nice to me.</li>
            <li>He feels he gets a nice close shave with it</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t own anything else.</li>
            <li>I had a Norelco Wet/Dry about 6 years ago and really liked it.</li>
            <li>This one fit the bill very nicely.  </li>
            <li>The PowerTouch isn&#x27;t perfect, but it is very good for a shaver that costs less than $100.</li>
            <li>Very happy and highly</li>
            <li>This is the best electric razor I have ever owned -- highly recommended.</li>
            <li>However, I am so impressed with this, at this price, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This model fit the bill...its perfect for a quick shave</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean, and a very good close shave.</li>
            <li>so I replaced the shaver heads after one year and the new heads are wonderful.</li>
            <li>Easy to shave with .. Would recommend this product to anyone.who appreciates a good quality product.</li>
            <li>Amazon is definitely the place to find good deals and review the best ratings on products and sellers (dealers).</li>
            <li>Good price and after 2 months going strong.</li>
            <li>Cleaning it is also very easy.</li>
            <li>but it is smooth--quick and very easy on my face.  </li>
            <li>And each day I can truthfully say I\\&quot;ve never had a better shave!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a great product at a good price.</li>
            <li>This one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>This unit is quite good, if not quite as smooth as the razor.  </li>
            <li>My wife of 53 years examines me Sunday in church where the light is good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Norelco electric shavers since my early 20&#x27;s(about 45 years now) and this one is the best yet.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best electric razor that I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>It is still working perfectly, gives a good close shave, and I love the short time to fully charge it.  </li>
            <li>I also own the 9160XL, triple blade system and it is a lot better than this one.  </li>
            <li>I have always had Norelco&#x27;s shavers but this is the best so far.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best electric razor I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>For me, having a good rotary shaver in the shower is indispensable.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well designed: a comfortably fashioned grip for a surprisingly lightweight unit.</li>
            <li>This razor is by far the best I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>This is By Far, the best Electric Razor</li>
            <li>Being able to wash out the head area is a nice feature, too.</li>
            <li>This is by far the easiest and best shaver.</li>
            <li>I bought this because the reviews stated that it gives a perfect shave on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>She was pleasantly surprised that the heads performed flawlessly under the rush of water.  </li>
            <li>Its&#x27; got to be one of The best Norelco&#x27;s so far.</li>
            <li>This is my 5th or 6th Norelco &amp; by far the best.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this razor so far.  </li>
            <li>I took his old one which still works perfectly to shave my legs... and ladies..you should give it a try..</li>
            <li>price at Amazon was the best found after considerable effort shopping around.  </li>
            <li>But as far as delivery and packaging, everything was perfect.</li>
            <li>He is very happy with it so far.  </li>
            <li>Norelco has by far been the best of the bunch .</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very happy with this unit.  </li>
            <li>Good battery life and smooth cut.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very happy with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>Being able to rinse the head after shaving is very nice feature, keeping the razor always clean.</li>
            <li>My husband loves his new shaver and is happy with its performance, but says it doesn&#x27;t shave curves and edges of his face and neck as well as a good old-fashioned razor.  </li>
            <li>This one has been the best, which one would expect as I keep them for many years and am generations ahead when I buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>I thought why to spend 35$ on new blades when I can buy for 70$ the newest and greatest top of the line shaver?&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives me a good shave, does not irritate my skin and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This is a very fine shaver.</li>
            <li>the close shave is super nice!</li>
            <li>I use one of my old travel pouches which the razor fits in perfectly and a lid from one of cans of shaving gels which the razor is able to stand upright in.</li>
            <li>He has used Norelco shavers for years but his one has been the best yet-durable, comfortable with reasonably priced replacement blades.</li>
            <li>Either way, you&#x27;ll get the closest, most comfortable shave in the shower with a good, low-foam shaving gel.  </li>
            <li>This razor does a great job of not cutting the hair closely and also being able to burn your neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great, easy clean.</li>
            <li>The shave is great because of the quietness of the motor, the triple head configuration of the blades and the easy way to clean it to make every shave just like your first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This razor gives a great shave and I would have rated it higher if it came with a charging stand.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful unit, fast and meets expectations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say for the first time I haven&#x27;t had to do that with this product.</li>
            <li>so I am pretty happy about that.  </li>
            <li>This is the best shaver, giving the best shave I have ever experienced, wet or dry!  </li>
            <li>This new model is wonderful, cuts well, cleans easy.</li>
            <li>I purchased the AT830 from Amazon a couple of months ago, I had to be sold on an $80+ unit, and the Amazon reviewers painted a very accurate picture of the shaver&#x27;s pros and cons.  </li>
            <li>I have  very light  </li>
            <li>Use a very light touch.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>On the flip side, it is very comfortable for him to hold and manuever.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and a very comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Gives me a very smooth shave and lasts almost 2 weeks when I shave 5 Days a week.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable close shave.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to use and gives a rake shave.</li>
            <li>very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to use .  </li>
            <li>This shaver has made the transition to electric very smooth.</li>
            <li>Clean-up is as easy as rinsing the Norelco under warm water...</li>
            <li>This model seemed to be adequate and good for his needs.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice looking razor and easy to recharge.</li>
            <li>This did not turn out to be true as it takes a fair bit longer to make sure I get all the hair with this razor.</li>
            <li>very easy to clean, just rinse with water and it is done!</li>
            <li>Shaver works fine, I would however,  liked to have the option of a stand.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this model as it leaves a very smooth skin, is light weight, and fits the hand like an old friend.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Buy the way my 650 tx still works perfect except I only get two shaves on a charge.</li>
            <li>If the battery lasts it will be outstanding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many electric (and analogue) razors in my life.</li>
            <li>Great item fast shipping five stars</li>
            <li>The razor ran quietly, as many had said, and I never got razor burn or anything like that,</li>
            <li>today in hopes of getting better results...  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned better norelco shavers before.</li>
            <li>The AT-830 is ok.  </li>
            <li>I have several models including the Spectra 8894XL James Bond Razor which in my opinion is best Norelco has ever made!</li>
            <li>In my opinion this razor shaves better than the Senso Touch 3D.</li>
            <li>It is one of the better Norelcoes that I have owned</li>
            <li>If you want all the bells and whistles, i.e., LED displays, battery life indicators, stands, etc., you&#x27;ll have to pay more for a higher-end model.</li>
            <li>I have used a number of Norelco shavers over the last 40+ years and this one is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Giving it time to my face to get use to an electric shaver is a must to be able to compare the type of shave that this unit can give.</li>
            <li>besides gauging for travel, i would have to charge just to make sure since i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s 80%, 70%, just when it&#x27;s 100% or 15%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for the price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very happy to be getting a smooth shave again without the irritation from the old Norelco XL____</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my 3rd norelco razor and its the best of all.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>The trimmers are just ok</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will be a work horse like the others.</li>
            <li>, and that&#x27;s a much better shaver, but it&#x27;s also a lot pricier.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s electric razor finally broke, so I researched the best replacement option, and settled on this one.</li>
            <li>, I LOVE THE CHARGING CORD</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;Always have used an Phillips shaver, and have been satisfied.</li>
            <li>As they rang it up, the price showed $30 MORE than the tag in the case.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a pop-up trimmer on the AT830, but since it&#x27;s otherwise just &#x27;OK&#x27; and costs almost ninety dollars, you may want to continue looking.  </li>
            <li>Still underwhelmed, but it may work better on a face than it does on legs too.  </li>
            <li>Still underwhelmed, but it may work better on a face than it does on legs too.  </li>
            <li>He is able to run it under the water, and it holds a charge.</li>
            <li>providing a comfortably close shave!  </li>
            <li>Got it for myself, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco electric razor for many years and I like its quality and ease of shaving of Phillips products.</li>
            <li>I like this much better.  </li>
            <li>but now he tell me he \\&quot;love it\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco for 30+ years and they just keep gettin better  </li>
            <li>better.  </li>
            <li>But, this razor is a quality product and a good value and would probably be worth giving a try for most people.</li>
            <li>and I love using it to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see that Norelco is keeping up the quality.  </li>
            <li>Most of the trimmers have difficulty in reaching all the areas.</li>
            <li>I have owned Norelco Razors for many years.</li>
            <li>will say that I get a better shave with the Bran--closer, quicker, and with no irritation.</li>
            <li>The pivot feature of the shaver&#x27;s head is probably more helpful than realized.  </li>
            <li>I suspect, too, that most users would get a lot more than 5 or 6 shaves out of every charge.  </li>
            <li>Tried using in shower, did ok but prefer to use with electric shave.</li>
            <li>I need to shave every day, but my face can&#x27;t handle more than two or three days in a row with this shaver before the irritation becomes unbearable.  </li>
            <li>Before this I had a Remington trihead from Walgreens for $40 that was much better than this one.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my Norelco wet/dry shaver glides across my face when used with soap.  </li>
            <li>I would like Norelco&#x27;s razors even more if they incorporated a replaceable battery.  </li>
            <li>Not any more.</li>
            <li>Shave quality with model 6948XL is marginal, although it is better than one got with Norelco rotaries years ago.</li>
            <li>began using Remington electrics years ago, when they were the most reliable units of the day.</li>
            <li>The 810, however, might be OK for anyone with a beard that&#x27;s not so fussy.  </li>
            <li>It takes so many passes to get</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco razors my entire life and this one is the best yet.  </li>
            <li>Could not ask for a better electric razor for the price.</li>
            <li>Donot miss this deal, you will love it</li>
            <li>and I love the way it works on moist skin</li>
            <li>more cuts and nicks.</li>
            <li>and ive been using this for more than 6month</li>
            <li>and i love it.  </li>
            <li>I then tried using a safety razor, but this Norelco works out so much better than either of the 2 options.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but doesn&#x27;t get as close of a shave as I would like.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>Great product, my husband does like it very mcuh.</li>
            <li>In my opinion this is the second best razor ever made by Norelco.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for getting through a beard or more than 3 days of not shaving but</li>
            <li>doesnt shave as close as i like but OK</li>
            <li>No convenience in this except for more profits for norelco top execs.  </li>
            <li>Great Product as I have used straight razor blades all my life</li>
            <li>I Love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying this shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Listening to and reading all the advertising out there, I thought I&#x27;d have to spend more</li>
            <li>Always pleased with how well they work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>tried a Panasonic foil electric and like the Norelco better.  </li>
            <li>Works okay, but it does irritate my face.</li>
            <li>The battery carries many days of charge.</li>
            <li>Based on those 2 factors, I only rate this shaver 3 stars at best.  </li>
            <li>For the price I paid for it, you&#x27;d expect the trimmer to be top notch.  </li>
            <li>It does take some time to get use to an electric razor but over all I would say it is okay.</li>
            <li>Out of the three prior Norelco shavers he has owned, this is the best.</li>
            <li>My son says that the razor is so much better than the one he had.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are many things about this razor that I like, but they are mostly things that do with cosmetics -- not functionality.</li>
            <li>Looks like a good and useful tool.</li>
            <li>Quietness striking.</li>
            <li>, there is no longer an option to insert Nivea shaving gel packets, but the added clippers for trimming more than make up for its loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product more than meets is description and expectations.</li>
            <li>Love the wet/dry.</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>, however, it has been more than 3 weeks and every time I use this razor on my neck, I look like I caught some sort of infectious disease because my skin gets inflamed and puffy in columnar streaks.  </li>
            <li>does excelent job of shaving my face ,much better than blade type</li>
            <li>so I use more power.  </li>
            <li>He said he was very happy with the razor and uses it regularly.</li>
            <li>It provides a slightly better ergonomics than most.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;++ More substantial to hold than the SensoTouch series</li>
            <li>Longer battery life than many SensoTouch models&lt;</li>
            <li>Alternatives like the 1150 offer more value with more features</li>
            <li>For those reasons, I think it&#x27;s the best compromise among the various PN razors in this</li>
            <li>and they can cut the skin more than this rotary</li>
            <li>most users, models like the AT810 will satisfy them.  </li>
            <li>Philips Norelco and love it to pieces...have been using it for a year plus and have 0 complaints.  </li>
            <li>But is ok for day to day use.</li>
            <li>Either your face or your technique begins to adapt and it gets better after a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>My husband is well pleased.</li>
            <li>Buy it, you\\&quot;ll love it.</li>
            <li>However, since it is a wet/dry razor, there is more rubber around the front.  </li>
            <li>which will always give you a better shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Three heads work more efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Before buying this shaver, I read as many reviews as I could find.  </li>
            <li>The price appealed to me and the reviews were okay.</li>
            <li>Have had Norelco razors for many years.</li>
            <li>The clippers on the back is great for sideburns and thinning out!</li>
            <li>It is OK for a teenager.</li>
            <li>I do not like that you cannot use it plugged, but the battery lasts more than one week, so it is acceptable for me.</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco shavers for over forty years now and have enjoyed them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no shave indicator on it that shows how many shaves you can get before recharging the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;The motor</li>
            <li>/&gt;In case Norelco is looking at the reviews, start making them of better quality products and people will buy more of your products.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed this razor.  </li>
            <li>Some great others, not so much.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m sure I can pack it on an extended getaway sans</li>
            <li>It was also better made.</li>
            <li>Best shaves that I&#x27;ve had in the last 3 years!</li>
            <li>The convenience of being able to shave while driving to work is phenomenal too.</li>
            <li>they may make noise more than rotaries but they will give you a closer shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more convenient than the Norelco it replaced (the one with the built in Nivea lotion dispenser) but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as it did.</li>
            <li>The Norelco should be used in a circular motion across the skin, whereas the Panasonic is used in more of an upstroke/downstroke way.  </li>
            <li>This is the series I would most recommend for the value to performance.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact of being able to use a gel.  </li>
            <li>Not so with this cheap piece of @#$#!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>importantly of all is the shaving result and this shaver, which uses the &amp;#34;lift and cut&amp;#34; design, produces a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>However when I went to order it, Amazon showed me this &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; model that&#x27;s supposed to be better and replaces the model my husband uses.</li>
            <li>I have had many, many Norelco razors.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if I had sprung for the healthy priced 3D it would have.</li>
            <li>One more thing.</li>
            <li>If you listen to the radio or music while showering you will love this one.</li>
            <li>I have used a Norelco electric razor for many years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a number of electric razors over the years (mostly Norelco).</li>
            <li>He says the more you use it the better it works, as it kinda conforms to your face.  </li>
            <li>But it will give you one more shave or so at the point</li>
            <li>so it is ok unless you are out traveling.</li>
            <li>Love the Dual/Precision heads.  </li>
            <li>Seemed like it took many passes to do the job.  </li>
            <li>I think the electric razors of 15-20 years ago were better.  </li>
            <li>My latest Remington got</li>
            <li>The shave is excellent and it only takes an hour to charge.</li>
            <li>The Remington shaver was OK</li>
            <li>When I finally decided the Philips Norelco was best for the Money I had another decision to make, which model?</li>
            <li>It leaves his face so nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Review of features found this to be the most affordable model with a trimmer attached.</li>
            <li>I use it more than my manual razor.</li>
            <li>Shave more often.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using Panasonic foil shavers for many years, never, ever had a problem with irritation.</li>
            <li>Norelco makes a top quality product and this is one of them.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>love It.</li>
            <li>how many passes I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Norelco triple head shavers now for many years</li>
            <li>After all is said &amp; done, you&#x27;ll be clean-shaven more often than you&#x27;ve ever been before.</li>
            <li>I have used this series of Norelco shavers for more than a decade (or perhaps two or three).  </li>
            <li>However, he does use it for under the chin area, and is pleased with the performance.  </li>
            <li>We order so many things from Amazon that I would just like to tell them \\&quot;thank you!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Love the product and would recommend.</li>
            <li>smooth shave, easy to clean, great price</li>
            <li>to be truthful</li>
            <li>Produces more heat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even quieter than they used to be, is lighter, and is narrower and fits better in your hand.</li>
            <li>Hubby has had a Norelco Razor for many years.  </li>
            <li>This model has the heads that adjust better to follow the curves of my face.  </li>
            <li>Automatic shut-off is one more thing in life that you don&#x27;t have to pay attention to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The tilting head might help, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that it gives me a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have to keep moving the razor over the skin surface many, many times before the hair probably just gives up and falls off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ok with that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I received the shaver, I was initially pleased with the closeness of the shave that could be achieved using it with gel.  </li>
            <li>I am quite satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>This is an OK razor.  </li>
            <li>but for now it&#x27;s my shaving choice for sure.</li>
            <li>When this happens (always after the warranty), you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REPLACE THE RECHARGABLE BATTERY.</li>
            <li>Phillips does this on their Sonic toothbrushes as well, so just devide your cost of so many uses by the cost of the unit</li>
            <li>The shave has always been a comprise when compared to a blade, to my suprise not any more.</li>
            <li>Now if I could only purchase a charging stand and a travel case, it would be a PERFECT shaver.</li>
            <li>The noise from motor is ok to use.</li>
            <li>Thought it would work better, name brand and the cost of it.</li>
            <li>They state yearly, but its more like quarterly.</li>
            <li>I also love that I can use it in the shower and my wife loves how my face feels when I use it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been more than satisfied with all of them.  </li>
            <li>In a nutshell, I love this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love that I can rinse it under water...</li>
            <li>I got much better shave with a razor.  </li>
            <li>I get even more irritation.</li>
            <li>This is not sufficient reason however not to buy as the shave is outstanding.</li>
            <li>this is the best shave I have ever had with the possible exception of a barber shaver.</li>
            <li>My Philips razor had seen better days.  </li>
            <li>Frankly, I wish I had purchased a top-of-the-line for more money.</li>
            <li>I confess that I have been quite pleased with the closeness of shave</li>
            <li>I am pleased.</li>
            <li>Charged up good and fast, works great, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;During that time I kept using it and with experience I kept getting better shaves.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>I use an electric pre-shave now that that stands my beard up and allows me to get an even better shave.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>I use an electric pre-shave now that that stands my beard up and allows me to get an even better shave.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>I got what i was looking for and love it</li>
            <li>You supposedly get 50 minutes of shaving from one charge, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m getting more.  </li>
            <li>For the first couple of weeks, maybe the first month,  it was the best electric shaver I&#x27;d ever had.</li>
            <li>I wish it had more visible power.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I actually love this shaver.</li>
            <li>(I stuck with it for 10 months, but it never got any better).  </li>
            <li>This is why most shaver manufacturers give you a 30 or 45 day trial period.  </li>
            <li>I also use it on my head (bald) and most people think I use a blade.</li>
            <li>He is satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>love the ability to use it in the shower or with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I had owned a Norelco before, many years ago.</li>
            <li>It was okay</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>- More subdued matte silver/gray color scheme is unique, nice looking  </li>
            <li>If you are in need of a quick shave and have forgotten to charge the unit, a quick five minute charge will give you two to three minutes of use - which is great if you are just touching up or getting rid of some shadow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first shave with it was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because I thought it was a very comfortable shave, and would have given it an excellent rating if the cutters were just a little more effective.  </li>
            <li>He was very pleased and felt it was easy to use, even with his significant tremor.</li>
            <li>Works much better than the original version of this from 20+ years ago!</li>
            <li>You can save money by getting a still-available older model like Norelco&#x27;s 7310 which is a great deal for the cost.</li>
            <li>Nice clean shave.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to spend more than this on a shaver -- this one has everything you&#x27;ll need, and at a pretty good price.</li>
            <li>I had great hopes for this older style Norelco shaver</li>
            <li>So nice to see a clean face.</li>
            <li>All told though I&#x27;m happy with this particular razor.</li>
            <li>Gives him a nice clean shave and he likes the fact that he can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>The thing I&#x27;ve been most impressed with is I have experienced no irritation switching back from non-electric to electric (and I have always had sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>Pretty good</li>
            <li>This electric razor does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>I used it consistently for a good three weeks, and</li>
            <li>This is my first electric razor and it is a good one.</li>
            <li>Pretty good getting 3 months of use without recharging.</li>
            <li>This is perfect if you need to throw it in your bag for a business trip or long weekend and don&#x27;t want to worry about battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great razor better than a blade by far.  </li>
            <li>Quick to charge and a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>Does a great job, its easy to clean, light weight and charges quickly.</li>
            <li>screen - super nice.  </li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s nice to have a quick shave, tho</li>
            <li>It cleans up easily and holds a charge for many uses.  </li>
            <li>is easy and I was glad that this model also had the trimmer on it...</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotating heads also allow you to more easily shave the neck and adam&#x27;s apple area, so I recommend this unit because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this razor although not as good as a straight edge</li>
            <li>This provides a good shave, it is quick, and the device is comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Looks pretty cool and feels great in the hand as well.  </li>
            <li>Being able to use it in a wet environment is an excellent advantage.</li>
            <li>This is a good, solid razor that gives a good shave.</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to clean which is a plus to.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>so it is very easy to keep clean</li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>In addition it is very easy to clean as you can run the blades under water.</li>
            <li>but I got an excellent shave the first time I used my new AT830..  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaving is comfortable even when you don&#x27;t use foam or gel (although it&#x27;s very comfortable with foam).</li>
            <li>The razor will work fine, and you will be pleased, UNTIL tha battery dies.</li>
            <li>I got this to be able to use in the shower and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>I have large hands and feels feel&#x27;s  good in my hand.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get used to being able to rinse the shaver to clean it, but is seems to be ok to do that.</li>
            <li>Some other awesome things about this razor are that it&#x27;s easy to clean, water proof, and has amazing battery life.</li>
            <li>This is a very good basic electric razor.  </li>
            <li>After using this AT830 for the first time I must say it works great - a clean, comfortable shave .</li>
            <li>That said, the AT830 has a wonderful feature set and seemed to fit my requirements (the product description says &amp;#34;cord/cordless operation&amp;#34;) and the price was about what I have paid before for a high end model.  </li>
            <li>PowerTouch delivers one of the closest and most comfortable shaves of any shaver in this price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning a rotary shaver appears more important than cleaning a foil shaver.</li>
            <li>Worked OK at first, but the longer I own it</li>
            <li>so far great product would recomend tis razor to anybody</li>
            <li>it feels as close as a blade, but much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Its best to use these wet with shaving gel.</li>
            <li>After I was satisfied with the smooth treatment the AT830 had given my face</li>
            <li>Battery life is great so far.</li>
            <li>So far it has been a great razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Replaced a 8 year old Norelco 7885XL and this model works great.</li>
            <li>I downgraded the razor to a four because the razor should have come with a container of some sorts that would allow it to travel in a shaving kit without the heads becoming exposed to damage.  </li>
            <li>I think it gives a more comfortable and closer shave when used that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, good choice for the price listed here (which is MUCH lower than the MSRP/sale price at the discount retailer based in Arkansas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shaver head replacement is recommended for once very 12 months for optimum performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>AT830 is good, if not quite as close as one gets from skillful use of a straight razor.</li>
            <li>Husband really likes thr razor so it must be good.</li>
            <li>It is very close to being as good as a safety razor.</li>
            <li>The good news is that every time I buy a new one, it&#x27;s gotten significantly better than the one I owned before.</li>
            <li>have spent years using a blade, and while I strongly dislike the cost of the replacement blades, the shave is perfect.</li>
            <li>I have purposely waited nearly a month before writing this review so I could give this razor a good trial, and I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with it from the very first shave.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to clean and I enjoy wet/dry option.  </li>
            <li>This razor gives me a nice, close shave without any skin irritation, and did so right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>Very Nice razor so far.  </li>
            <li>My husbands razor just stopped working the other day and it was perfect timing in receiving this product to review.  </li>
            <li>First two items I mentioned should be used more in Your promotions of this product!</li>
            <li>The 800 series is the most feature rich of Norelco&#x27;s Mid-tier.</li>
            <li>There is a significant technological leap from my latest shaver.</li>

            <li>And with Amazon returns are painfully easy</li>

            <li>Being able to wash it off saves a ton of effort keeping it clean.</li>
            <li>To be honest, the difference in closeness was greater for me, but I really do have a tougher beard.  </li>
            <li>He also states that it is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Gives a clean shave but takes a bit more time compared to a razor blade.</li>

            <li>Easy to clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>overall I am happy as it definitely better than my braun razor.</li>
            <li>This razor is still going strong.</li>
            <li>So far so good, works better than the one I had</li>
            <li>AT810 offers a good shave at a better value.  </li>
            <li>I strongly suggest it.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I charged it when I bought it almost two months ago, and it is still running strong on that charge.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend t to anyone in need of a good razor.</li>
            <li>I have used Philips for a long time, this is my 4th razor in 20 years, so in my experience they are very good.</li>
            <li>I run hot water over the shave head&#x27;s blades first, to give it a nice warm and softening effect.</li>
            <li>Replaced an old Norelco electric razor with this one and my husband was thrilled with it!</li>
            <li>This is true with a single-blade razor, but I was using a multi-blade razor - and although I am satisfied, after 21 days I have learned it will never replace my multi-blade razor for closeness of shave.  </li>
            <li>the plus side, the shaver is comfortable on the skin and in the hand and is a nice addition to Philips Norelco&#x27;s line of superior shavers, just not, in my opinion, equal to the 1290.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure that I got full value for what I paid.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more comfortable, near zero razor burn and is probably about as close as you can get (no pun intended) to a good blade setup.</li>
            <li>but this new shaver is the best so far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been purchasing high end three head rotary electrics for over 20 years now, and this one has been by far, the best of the lot.</li>
            <li>Being new, it gives a good shave either way.</li>
            <li>using the budget line models is just fine for my purposes.</li>
            <li>bye fine.  </li>
            <li>fine shaver for the price</li>
            <li>Fine product.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in fine shape and on time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The newer HQ8 heads each have two segments with fine, circular holes that are positioned toward the inside of a 3-head assembly.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted many, many years</li>
            <li>the reality is that if you have a marginal beard it will probably work fine for you ...</li>
            <li>This is easy to use, easy to clean and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>Razor works fine</li>
            <li>I tried foaming hand soap in a pump container and it works fine without any skin reaction.  </li>
            <li>(legs, arms &amp; whatnot): Works fine as an arm and leg shaver.</li>
            <li>My previous shaver was the best, it had longer shaving time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this razor, it is very convenient and shaves pretty close.</li>
            <li>It does that just fine.  </li>
            <li>Still, it works fine.</li>
            <li>you are already a Norelco user and that brand works for you, fine.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco AT830 works fine.</li>
            <li>The shaver was fine, The problem was, it irrItated my skin.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get fine hairs on my neck.</li>
            <li>One of the better features is the quick charge function.</li>
            <li>I will work OK for that quick shave when you are on the go and don&#x27;t have time for anything else.</li>
            <li>The battery seems to charge quickly, and although I haven&#x27;t tried to see how many shaves</li>
            <li>so I am not surprised it is so good and so reliable!</li>
            <li>Easy to use easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and light weight and stores easily.</li>
            <li>Great razor, quiet, easy to hold and use, does a fine job on your beard, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I got the AT830 as a Xmas gift from my wife and was real excited until after the first shave.</li>
            <li>This gives a great shave, very easy to clean, and when used with foam it delivers a close and comfortable wet shave.</li>
            <li>No burn and very good shave in the shower wet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, After buying it and using it for about a month, It does shave very good and closer than my older Norelco Spectra 8891XL with new blades</li>
            <li>A huge part of this is the fact that its waterproof (as it should be) which allows it to be used in the shower.</li>
            <li>a revelation!&lt;br /&gt;Philips company made huge steps forward.</li>
            <li>Great electric razor waterproof works as expected on face works better on scalp</li>
            <li>It delivers a close comfortable shave without the razor burn.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy shaving with this razor.</li>
            <li>: The razor gets a four out of five for appearance because of its smooth sleek no frills look.</li>
            <li>I had to go over my face lightly with a blade razor.  </li>
            <li>After just a few weeks, I can state that this is the best shave I have ever received with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>Probably would opt for a more powerful or thinner shaver heads.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean by rinsing in lukewarm  water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comfortable smooth and lives up to hype</li>
            <li>It feels sturdy, and is comfortable to grip.  </li>
            <li>I use cheap shaving creme and even hair conditioner a couple times in an emergency and it delivers a smooth shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>, I would recommend this shaver to all...best price, cheap shipping and a close shave.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also comfortable to hold and lightweight.</li>
            <li>This is important as the shaver cannot be used when plugged in.  </li>
            <li>easy to handle a clean shave also easy to clean after you shave</li>
            <li>Great for a begining teen shaver</li>
            <li>comfortable shave&lt;br /&gt;Ease</li>
            <li>must  trying toget away cheap product,ask said made in china inferior product and workmanship tp Netherlands made</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so smooth and conforming without irritation, and gives a remarkably smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I decided to go cheap and buy this razor.  </li>
            <li>I can attest his face is smooth.  </li>
            <li>Close, no irritation, smooth, definatly reccomend.</li>
            <li>But once everything is in order, it should be quite the smooth</li>
            <li>For once, my husband read the instructions and obediently stick with it for 3 weeks of continual use.</li>
            <li>It has a couple of LED type light for charging, etc.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to keep clean and store.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my dad for Fathers Day, ease of use, lasting battery life before needs recharged and most important good shave.</li>
            <li>Comfortable close shave.</li>
            <li>She loves my smooth skin after a shave.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;++ Smooth operation</li>
            <li>being said - this is great for someone that is starting out with electric razors.  </li>
            <li>My sons liked theirs so much I got one for my husband.</li>
            <li>..... lightweight and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Light weight, seems to be made cheaply</li>
            <li>Has the trimmer always available.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>though I had been using a Philips Norelco electric razor it still took about 2 weeks for me to get used to this one, but eventually it does deliver a close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Despite the light the AT830 still gave me a shave.</li>
            <li>Fourth, the rubber grip is great if you are a shower shaver.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>everything I have seen Philips touch has gone to cheap garbage.</li>
            <li>But a great brand, cut corners and costs and sell it pretending it to be the same thing.</li>
            <li>What I have found is that hair on my beard is normally straight out on day two, resulting in a nice close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is almost as smooth as a razor.  </li>
            <li>He wasn&#x27;t sure if he wanted a cordless-he thought it might not be as powerful as the corded one.  </li>
            <li>The noise level is a wisper, the shave is extreemly comfortable and the efficiency of the shave is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great for the price especially.</li>
            <li>The razor was comfortable in my hand</li>
            <li>It is a very convinient  and effective product.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the shave.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I like my face to be as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, and this is probably the closest I&#x27;ve ever got to that with any electric that I&#x27;ve ever owned..</li>
            <li>Also, I ordered from Amazon and got free shipping with shaver deleivered in two work days.  </li>
            <li>shave itself is smooth and even, although not as close as a blade of course.</li>
            <li>and nick free is better than in the shower, not QUITE as close a shave as the Venus ladies razor but good enough and a lot faster..</li>
            <li>Shaves well and extremely smoothly.  </li>
            <li>He says it is smooth and comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>shave is smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That forever to get smooth face</li>
            <li>Its comfortable, ergonomically and on your skin.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to keep clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all of that, the battery life on this thing is fantastic.</li>
            <li>and my face is fantastically smooth</li>
            <li>Gives me a smooth shave every morning.</li>
            <li>The shave is relatively smooth, but not as smooth as a foil shaver.  </li>
            <li>easy clean up.</li>
            <li>I have light hair and light whiskers.</li>
            <li>easy clean.</li>
            <li>That being said, I also have light colored hair.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable to use and shaves well leaving my face smooth.</li>
            <li>Rinsing it under the faucet makes it really easy to clean and saves time in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the smooth shave I get with this razor and the fact that you can use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Cheap replacement heads.</li>
            <li>This Norelco gives me an incredibly close shave with absolutely no irritation.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy shaving in the shower as it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I am not stupid.  </li>
            <li>It is not as good at shaving as my old worn out razor.</li>
            <li>Philips currently offers models with good performance at premium, intermediate and value prices.</li>
            <li>Frankly I liked my old razor better</li>
            <li>far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as I thought, and the old one works better/</li>
            <li>It gives a good close shave quicker than the old razor that it replaced.  </li>
            <li>The shave isn&#x27;t as close as a manual razor but does a good enough job where I feel I am respectable in appearance.  </li>
            <li>my old 7310XL stopped giving me a good shave even after replacing the blades</li>
            <li>wow the time it saves and how good of a shave it does.</li>
            <li>Not as good as my old shaver</li>
            <li>Also very easy to clean, just ensure to run the blade section though hot water after each use.</li>
            <li>My husband was very pleased with his new razor for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to go back to shaving with an electric (after owning a great remington - years ago)</li>
            <li>Finally a razor I can fall in love with!!</li>
            <li>I could not believe how much I used to pay for blades for this thing!!!</li>
            <li>Overall a very nice option for men with beards/mustaches.  </li>
            <li>so this was very exciting as I have used my braun razor for over 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>soap your face up and when you&#x27;ve had a great shave just flip the heads open and run it under the water to clean it up.</li>
            <li>What a nice surprise that this razor is even better than my I old tried and true razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line - this isn&#x27;t worth the high price tag based upon fair build quality, features and performance (charging time vs useage, and shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first wasn&#x27;t as happy with it as the old one I had for years</li>
            <li>smooth, clean non iritating shaves.</li>
            <li>The accessory trimmers that are available for the higher end Norelcos may be better, but that&#x27;s a lot of money for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>First and most importantly the razor will shred your neck.  </li>
            <li>The waterproof feature is very nice because to clean it all you have to do is open the shaving head and put it under the running water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It flexes very easily and well, and it trims pretty easily, and he says it&#x27;s comfortable and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin very much at all.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I will live with having to plug the Panasonic in more often!</li>
            <li>This is a great razor for the man in your life, but it seems to need recharged more often than previous Norelcos that I have bought for my husband.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for days when I just want a quick shave and closeness is not a big deal.</li>
            <li>Super easy to clean since it&#x27;s water friendly.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean and very quite.</li>
            <li>Just shave again in the evening if you have a hot date, then she&#x27;ll be glad you don&#x27;t have the 5:00 shadow that you would have with a morning blade shave.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s unique to this razor.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>considering I&#x27;m using original blades on the two norelco ones ive had---</li>
            <li>this was a gift and he was excited to get it.</li>
            <li>and it does seem to be shaving better now than when I first got it, but that may just be me getting used to using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I was pleased to find that the first battery charge lasted for 5 or 6 shaves..</li>
            <li>So far, I am very satisfied with the performance of this shaver..</li>
            <li>I originally bought this because I was placed on blood-thinners for a 6-month period of time and the nurses told me to get an electric razor and stop using the blades.</li>
            <li>Familiar with this brand.just registered it.</li>
            <li>As with all Phillips electronics I have purchased, I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>It has a comfortable ergonomic fit/feel in the hand, shaves closely, and has a neat charging option-- it can charge in about a minute for one shave, although the full charger takes about 5 hours and lasts for about 50 minutes of use.  </li>
            <li>Recommended annual blade replacements add significant cost ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The 1150 operates faster and quieter than the AT830, with a better trimmer than either the AT830 or the higher end</li>
            <li>Replacement parts are also easily accessible.</li>
            <li>The cord is not user friendly for storage.</li>
            <li>I find it works best with some shaving cream or gel, and when you have thicker growth (shaving at both morning and night usually leads to stubble and irritation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure this razor will be cheaper on replacement heads too, in that for the at830</li>
            <li>It is comfortable and cool, battery</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>As usual, Amazon service was flawless and I&#x27;d recommend you check them</li>
            <li>so the original set of blades have lasted well over a year and the replacements were about $25.00.</li>
            <li>so the original set of blades have lasted well over a year and the replacements were about $25.00.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Panasonic wet/dry razors that have lasted for more than 5 years, so that was pretty</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was glad to learn of the new Aquatec models, having used the Norelco 6000 and 7000 series Cool Skin razors for many years.  </li>
            <li>This upgraded him to a razor that can be cleaned under the bathroom faucet and also it has new blades so he now is getting a nice clean cut.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works great dry or with water.</li>
            <li>but here&#x27;s a surprise: If you have a Jet Clean for the 8260cc</li>
            <li>the Power Touch AT830 will work in that Jet Clean.</li>
            <li>and he said do not use this razor in that Jet Clean.</li>
            <li>The Power Touch models with Jet Clean arn&#x27;t going to be out</li>
            <li>til around Father&#x27;s Day, so if you like useing Jet Clean, you can use your Power Touch AT830 in the Jet Clean for 8260cc.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the Norelco based upon the excellent reviews at Amazon, but I had low expectations given the modest price.  </li>
            <li>I would find it totally unacceptable for my own us, but Dad looks OK when I am finished shaving him with it</li>
            <li>, it took forever to charge and it was a pain to clean.  </li>
            <li>I can clean it with water instead of just blowing and brushing it every day.</li>
            <li>It does a great job dry.</li>
            <li>I have to clean it for him weekly</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s very quick and if you want a fresh shave it&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li>... have to clean up with a blade after.. stick with the blades.</li>
            <li>I tend to have to repeat area often to get a clean shave on the neck.</li>
            <li>I always clean and change my blades every week</li>
            <li>I can clean it out by rinsing it under tap water or with the brush provided in the kit.</li>
            <li>Gives a clean shave.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in a hurry the dry shave is great.</li>
            <li>i clean it after every shave</li>
            <li>I still have an older Norelco I use for travel that&#x27;s been going strong for more that five years now.</li>
            <li>Philips has been good about honoring their warranty, as they will now send me my 2nd free replacement.</li>
            <li>I do like that you can clean with water.</li>
            <li>So he would just trim it with with electric trimmers and never had a clean shave.</li>
            <li>then just rinse the Norelco clean.</li>
            <li>Although the design is somewhat unchanged the most important thing that saw real progress is the shaving heads.</li>
            <li>My husband,Jay, Won&#x27;t quit raving about the Phillips AT830--It shaves so quickly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry about the need to clean manually.</li>
            <li>so I can rinse it clean without a problem.  </li>
            <li>It works like a charm, and you can take apart the heads to clean them when you need to.</li>
            <li>Clean up</li>
            <li>or you will have to dismantle the thing and use some home made gadgets to clean it out.  </li>
            <li>Just rinse it to clean it.  </li>
            <li>It does the job but not as smooth or as quick as my 8870 .When</li>
            <li>Shaves closer, easier to clean.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product that is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is almost as clean as a razor cut and doesn&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li>I like being able to clean it by washing it with water and getting a good wet shave every day.</li>
            <li>got as a gift at Christmas, grate shaver, very fast shave on smooth results, easy clean out with air can.</li>
            <li>Not much else to say, it is a man&#x27;s shaver, so has long as husband is happy with it, then I am happy.  </li>
            <li>It can trim hairs very well, shapes your beard and is really almost worth getting this razor for on its own!</li>
            <li>I use a little soap in the shower and get very good results.</li>
            <li>Quiet, smooth, easy to clean, and fits nice in the hand.</li>
            <li>The shaver is very comfortable in use and very convenient.  </li>
            <li>He is very particular, and really love this razor.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s much more convenient than a disposable and certainly cheaper over time.</li>
            <li>they ran a special on this AT830.  </li>
            <li>My son was right!</li>
            <li>I find one that works right for me!  </li>
            <li>The new one performs even better, easy to use</li>
            <li>Good clean shave that last all day.</li>
            <li>This changed the way I shaved and left a good clean feel.</li>
            <li>battery life is also very good, I can go a few weeks at a time with</li>
            <li>love it that I can clean it pretty much right away.</li>
            <li>Extremely easy to clean, just run it under hot water.  </li>
            <li>great than expected</li>
            <li>The wet shave feature is great.</li>
            <li>First impression was light and cheap.. &amp;#34;not</li>
            <li>If you just want a good basic no-frills razor, go with this one.</li>
            <li>I definitely think this razor is good</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience with electric razors, but I do know this works better than a manual one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Technique is key with a Norelco: I picked up some really good tips from [...]</li>
            <li>I searched the comments and decided that this was a cut above the cheaper models, and was at a good price.  </li>
            <li>good for the skin and at the same time it&#x27;s shaving</li>
            <li>But I went for Philips ys524 model and that really worked well:-)</li>
            <li>It is not as close a shave as with my prior Fusion, but still good.</li>
            <li>The price is a true value for this quality of razor and shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s somewhat more rugged and won&#x27;t cost as much to replace if lost or damaged.</li>
            <li>NO electric is going to rival a close blade-shave, but this unit still provides a nice soft face nonetheless.</li>
            <li>A full charge takes one hour to fully charge and the charge lasts 50 minutes.</li>
            <li>For a reasonable price, you can have most of the benefits of both the SensoTouch and PowerTouch</li>
            <li>For a reasonable price, you can have most of the benefits of both the SensoTouch and PowerTouch</li>
            <li>really loves this one and is really pleased with the shave he gets from&lt;br /&gt;it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this razor.</li>
            <li>you really need to know more?</li>
            <li>I much prefer the dual operation models (those that can run on either/both AC or battery power) as AC power gives the razor more juice</li>
            <li>In retrospect, I should have noticed that this is touted as being able to be used in the shower - you couldn&#x27;t do that with a model that is capable of AC operation.  </li>
            <li>This is a powerful and smooth razor.</li>
            <li>A full charge allows 50 minutes of shaving time or about 10 shaves.  </li>
            <li>I had an old Norelco which seems to me was more powerful and shaved more closely; but I also think that these blades have to take some time to break in.  </li>
            <li>I suspect that is true for any electric razor though.  </li>
            <li>It seems very quiet, which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>He loved the first one so much he wanted the same kind again.</li>
            <li>It is quiet and gives a good shave.  </li>
            <li>Love the 3 rotating heads, very close shave.</li>
            <li>A good replacement for a similar shaver.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>This has been so far a pretty good razor.</li>
            <li>Easy, smooth, fast shave.</li>
            <li>Pros: easy grip, washable, fast charge,  and comfortable shave / Cons:</li>
            <li>Norelco opted for slower motor speeds in its current shaver and it does not give as good or as quick a shave.</li>
            <li>Runs nice and quiet and easy to rinse.  </li>
            <li>1 hour full recharge, about 3-5 minutes for enouigh charge to do a quick shave...</li>
            <li>colored battery charging display is nice  - Easy to pop open head for cleaning  - Charges quickly, with quick charge feature  CONS:  - No battery life indicator, razor rather button minimalistic  -</li>
            <li>Other than that it works great.</li>
            <li>Just keep in mind that your skin might need quite a bit more time to adjust than you may be willing to give, so don&#x27;t use this thing for the first time right before an important event (like a job interview, wedding, etc.)</li>
            <li>very good razor, you can use it to shave both dry and wet (gel foam), it is really nice and quite but have some problems in trimming the neck area</li>
            <li>, it did a good job, but i still wanted to be able to shave under the shower, after that i bought a panasonic triple head shaver (non rotary) wet/dry type, and gave the other one away to a neighbor, and regreted it a lot!!</li>
            <li>I prefer shaving cream for the fresh clean feeling after shaving.</li>
            <li>morning, I read in an older review that all the Norelco AT models are designed this way, and that if you want to be able to use the shaver on A/C power, the PT models will allow you to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I AM YOUR LOYAL ONLINE BUYER.</li>
            <li>This electric, cordless razor is adequate given that it is not one of Norelco&#x27;s super fancy Sensotouch units.</li>
            <li>I have had several Norelco razors before and they worked ok, but I just wasn&#x27;t satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Lucky me</li>
            <li>Currently Braun is delivering its best foil technology to the U.S. only at premium prices, encouraging another look at alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A charge seems to last 5 days or more and it&#x27;s an asset to be able to rinse the shaver head.</li>
            <li>quickly</li>
            <li>Okay, but will upgrade later to a better model.</li>
            <li>I use it for a quick touch up.</li>
            <li>That said, the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I bought this razor to shave my head with, and it performs that task adequately.  </li>
            <li>You can do a quick charge for three or so minutes that is adequate for a quick shave.</li>
            <li>The reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that while it shaves well, I can&#x27;t get as close a shave as I get with a razor blade, the shave is adequate.  </li>
            <li>se le ve la cara super lisa, tambien les comento que la entrega desde que la solicite hasta que llego</li>
            <li>but I quickly got used to it.</li>
            <li>The unit came quickly, was packaged well and seemed to be a sturdy model.  </li>
            <li>as I said, it is feature packed and charges quickly.</li>
            <li>My husband said this is the best electric shaver that I have ever gotten him (and I have bought several over the last 10 years.)</li>
            <li>The AT830 is far quieter and more comfortable</li>
            <li>In some respects, the more Norelco shavers change, the more they stay the same.</li>
            <li>Super convenient.</li>
            <li>Older Norelco razors worked better.</li>
            <li>It still delivered a great shave and had been trouble free from the start.</li>
            <li>This has helped me bumps tremendously.</li>
            <li>I use this when I&#x27;m in a rush and need a quick shave.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to clean, and charges fast.</li>
            <li>I also like the quick charge feature.  </li>
            <li>At the cost of razor blades shaving every 2 days, this shaver paid for itself rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>glad I went with the AT830/41 with the pivoting heads because it gets the hard to shave spots very nicely.</li>
            <li>Be aware that this particular MODEL comes without the Travel Pouch and, most importantly, WITHOUT the Charging Stand.  </li>
            <li>Overall I found this shaver to be pretty good - does a neat and clean job around the neck</li>
            <li>New heads are readily available too.charges quickly and quietly with no annoying bright charging lights to disturb you when on the road</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that the AT830 isn&#x27;t a pretty decent product in its own right, it is.</li>
            <li>Being able to wash the whiskers off with water allows for a very clean razor when you shave the next day.  </li>
            <li>However, everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and it&#x27;s worth trying a variety of different razors to find out which works best for your skin.</li>
            <li>Holds its charge for many weeks with normal use.</li>
            <li>sure clean hair out regularly as it clogs easily</li>
            <li>After 10 minutes of grinding the top layer of skin off, I stopped and used a normal razor to finish off all the spots this razor would not shave.</li>
            <li>these cases are pretty cheap so for the price it should be included</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m very pleased about the overall performance.</li>
            <li>Normally I avoid Norelco because of their lift &amp; cut system and fears it would generate more razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not as close shave as razor, but pretty close and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I enjoy a clean shave and use a 5-blade razor and a straight razor.</li>
            <li>But given that it is comfortable, quiet, pleasant to use, simple to clean, reasonably inexpensive, and gives a quick and decent shave, I would say that this is a good shaver.</li>
            <li>while dry has proved most effective, even though model AT830 can be washed with hot water.</li>
            <li>After using other electric razors for over 60 years, I found the Norelco to be a wonderful improvement in ease of use, effectiveness in getting the saving job done in a much shorter time and with much improved comfort.  </li>
            <li>I love the newly redesigned chafer.</li>
            <li>The heads on my SensoTouch are more flexible than this model, but I could live with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this, you won&#x27;t regret it, and I&#x27;m sure, live it as I do.</li>
            <li>This one has many new improvements.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the new shaver.</li>
            <li>I will invest in new blades for my Panasonic and know that I am getting a better shave than Norelco can offer.  </li>
            <li>I am just as confident that my new Norelco will perform as well.</li>
            <li>and I think does a better job than the foil razor ever did, either new or after replacing the foil and blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love me new razor.</li>
            <li>, I find the razor overall to be a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>This razor is lightweight, rinses easily and cuts very close to the skin.</li>
            <li>The groomer tool on the back also does a pretty good job, but is nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;He is normally a man of few words, so I&#x27;d say that this razor is the best!</li>
            <li>the past month I discovered that getting the best shave from this product was about technique as much as it was about the product.  </li>
            <li>Functionally speaking, I can&#x27;t say a single good thing about this razor.</li>
            <li>Also so much quicker it is to shave!!</li>
            <li>- this new shaver doesn&#x27;t as good as the old one.</li>
            <li>.. :) I went by the reviews here on Amazon, and wanted to try a little better Norelco, and one that that could be used wet/dry, and also easily rinsed and cleaned.</li>
            <li>But the best thing by far is the razor&#x27;s ability to shave under my jawline: it&#x27;s always been a problem with my previous razors, but this gives me my cleanest shave yet.  </li>
            <li>Nice smooth shave used dry.</li>
            <li>Second, it has an integrated beard trimmer - super handy for trimming up the goatee - the Senseo has a separate trimmer head - requiring you to remove the shaving head, locate the trimmer head, etc.  </li>
            <li>Quick charges in 1 hour, a nice feature over the traditional 8 hour charge cycles but one that is mandatory I think for a razor that can&#x27;t be used when plugged in (see comments</li>
            <li>He gets a very smooth shave and his skin feels soft.  </li>
            <li>I got close shave right from the start, and it was quick as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has been several years since I needed to purchase a new Razor and since I have had great success with Philips Norelco, I thought I would try this one.</li>
            <li>It seems that the first rep that I talked to just wanted me to buy a Jet Clean for this model.</li>
            <li>really seems to be fine).  </li>
            <li>Rinse the heads often with hot water and rinse clean when done, removing the head assembly</li>
            <li>Rinse the heads often with hot water and rinse clean when done, removing the head assembly</li>
            <li>Razor works fine and is much lighter and quieter than the one it replaced.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use; easy to clean; and quiet.  </li>
            <li>My thinking is that hot soap and water wouldn&#x27;t just soften my beard but clean the darn thing out</li>
            <li>This razor shaves very close and is comparable to a straight edge shave....left my face very smooth.  </li>
            <li>My only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; if you will is it is very light which gives the impression that it is cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m convince most of the positive reviews are fake, because there is no way most people could possibly be happy with this razor.</li>
            <li>While this certainly helped with razor burn and bumps (no matter what method I shaved - electric or cartridge), my skin would still look bright red on my neck area after I&#x27;d finished.  </li>
            <li>Norelco has a good thing going, and is smart enough to continue to improve it, rather than redesigning something over and over again from scratch.</li>
            <li>You kind of have to apply a bit more force or get in closer than you desire - which completely defeats the point of having a detail trimmer as you can essentially ruin the style you are aiming for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very close shave that leaves your skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Aquatec technology provides a fast, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>shave is smooth and fast, using a pre-shave powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gave me a very close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I felt this razor was a great razor in almost every aspect, I do have a couple of things I wish it had to round it out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s task was not an unusual one, cut my beard as smooth as a blade, all two inches of it.</li>
            <li>I have had this for a few months now and I am happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>Very quiet yet amazingly efficient at shaving my beard.  </li>
            <li>Very confortable machine, is light and practical..</li>
            <li>He uses it everyday and thinks it is great and a time saver.</li>
            <li>This razor is amazing for the simple reason that I can be watching something on the laptop and just be shaving without even putting on shaving cream.</li>
            <li>You get your money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>Love it, its lots more comfortable than the model with the fixed head (tiny difference in design).</li>
            <li>after using this razor for three weeks now, I can say it was worth every cent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All that means is, if you run the battery completely out, you will have to wait three minutes when you plug it in before you will be able to shave.</li>
            <li>If the razor is reliable and sturdy, it will be worth 5 stars.</li>
            <li>but overall a nice razor for the price.</li>
            <li>but wet is definitely the best way to use it.</li>
            <li>Very quiet and effective.  </li>
            <li>the wet shaving is good as i expected.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>(Oh, and the sideburn trimmer works even better than the old one.)</li>
            <li>This is the only electric razor that my husband has ever liked.  </li>
            <li>Recent Philips models provide thinner combs and more precise mating of cutter blades to combs, as compared with Norelco models of years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Should have bought one of these years ago, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>My old one died after many years of service</li>
            <li>The Powertouch Electric Razor has proven to be an effective tool at daily shaving.</li>
            <li>but trimmer isn&#x27;t worth a flip (pun intended.)  </li>
            <li>This model&#x27;s big innovation is a nice snap-out trimmer.</li>
            <li>Braun Cruzer 6 Face Cruzer, 6 Face Shaver]], but those require even more passes for a complete shave</li>
            <li>Much better than my old razor.</li>
            <li>He loves the wet/dry feature, and his shaves look good, but he says that it&#x27;s not like a 4-bladed wet razor.</li>
            <li>Worth trying if you want to escape the money pit of replacement blade cartridges.</li>
            <li>Trimmer on the back is nice.</li>
            <li>I may be old school, but for $70 to $80 you would think the technology of 2014 would give a better shaving experience.</li>
            <li>This razor gives the same fabulous shave, but it more versatile.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver for my husband for Christmas because his old Norelco just didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cut it&amp;#34; any more.  </li>
            <li>It is much better than my old one.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I really liked my last one, an purchased this model.</li>
            <li>how long it lasts until I have to replace the blades, but very satisfied for now.</li>
            <li>It also has the newer kind of battery which doesn&#x27;t require an initial 12 hour charge, and I think can be charged before it&#x27;s fully discharged without harming it.</li>
            <li>He can finally get the close shave he wants AND stay on top of it without getting a rash. :)</li>
            <li>I have used Remington electric razor my whole life and thought they were good but was fed up with the last one</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Razor is OK but not the quality of my old one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I gave it another shot and spent a good 20 minutes (yes, 20) trying to get it to cut something; after I finished it looked like I hadn&#x27;t even shaved</li>
            <li>but I love it so far.  </li>
            <li>This razor is worth</li>
            <li>I am still of the opinion that this is well worth the money if you do get it please take some time to get used to using it.</li>
            <li>This razor is worth</li>
            <li>I am still of the opinion that this is well worth the money if you do get it please take some time to get used to using it.</li>
            <li>This one is worth the money.</li>
            <li>you could back it off to make it more comfortable for yourself instead of</li>
            <li>that freshly scraped feeling</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>and so far I love it.  </li>
            <li>Very nice razor, nice and quiet, holds a charge well, very slick shave with cream or gel, easy to rinse too, and 2-1/2 year warranty</li>
            <li>The design fits into contours of my face better, it runs at a much lower RPM, you can use it with shaving gel, and it is super easy to clean as you can just flip open the blade chassis while it is still running and run it under hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery power is a great convenience, but only if the battery lasts a long time and is easy to charge.</li>
            <li>I noticed this shaver on sale and the reviews were very positive.  </li>
            <li>I think these other reviewers must be suffering from buyer&#x27;s remorse / confirmation bias and leaving good reviews because they expected it to be good.</li>
            <li>there isn&#x27;t much that you can change on shavers today, but for what it is - it looks great and works just like the other units i&#x27;ve owned in the past.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>I get a really good clean shave; this is an improviment over my old Norelco which I did nto think was possible.  </li>
            <li>I did some research before buying this particular model and it works fine</li>
            <li>Gives a great shave, is quiet and so simple to clean.  </li>
            <li>Item exactly as described and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rugged and takes a charge quickly, but continues to be a learning situation as his first electric razor.</li>
            <li>It charged quickly the first times I used it.</li>
            <li>Came super fast!</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use the pop up trimmer first for a quick run then</li>
            <li>Pros:  - Appropriately sealed containment space  - Small charging plug  - Good weight balance  - Large trimming surface  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean under running water and it seems to hold a charge for a long time!</li>
            <li>Although I do have to use the regular razor to clean up some areas because no matter how many times I run over something with the Norelco, it still leaves a bunch of hair.</li>
            <li>(I currently have a beard, so I use it for trimming, for getting cheeks and neck areas clean, and touching up here and there</li>
            <li>Particularly nice were the floating heads, which were considerably improved over my older model Norelco.</li>
            <li>I purchased this particular razor because it was supposed to be extra good at getting whiskers on my throat.  </li>
            <li>My 18 year old twin boys LOVE their new razors!!!</li>
            <li>Works about as good as every other shaver i&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good shaver but the shave isn&#x27;t as close as some of the other Norelco shaves I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>My first electric razor was a Braun and so far this razor is far superior.</li>
            <li>I originally had a norelco over 20 years ago, didn&#x27;t use it much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it in dry mode and find it to be fast, comfortable and incredibly close.  </li>
            <li>Overall though this is a highly recommended electric razor if you want a good shave on a budget.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t work right.</li>
            <li>In my quest to find the right razor for me I tried a Norelco SensoTouch 3D, a Braun, and now this Norelco AT830.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re right.  </li>
            <li>This shaver does the job, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>it just wasn&#x27;t right for him.</li>
            <li>Yes, you heard right - it won&#x27;t work if it&#x27;s plugged into a wall socket.</li>
            <li>If a hair is lose it slides right out by the way.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>If a hair is lose it slides right out by the way.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>Came in right in time for Father&#x27;s Day</li>
            <li>The articulating heads do not handle the jawline below the ear as well as I had hoped, but other than that, this unit provides a nice, smooth shave at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Those who don&#x27;t need the trimmer function might be happier with the 1290, which has a pretty amazing ability to follow the contours of the face and is very, very quiet.</li>
            <li>First off, they are both relatively quiet razors, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>By making sure that only gentle pressure is applied, even shaving the anterior ramus of the mandible [Chin] becomes easy.  </li>
            <li>and I think its much easier to clean &amp; maintain.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cuts clean and very close.  </li>
            <li>This one is MUCH easier to clean.</li>
            <li>The Braun triple-track design does better than just a curved foil, but it typically needs many passes to provide a uniform shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because it can be used wet or dry it seemed perfect but some men are just died-in the wool razor users and that&#x27;s what they like.</li>
            <li>You can use it wet or dry, I use mine in the shower and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>The pop-up trimmer is adequate (similar to the 1250), but the 1150&#x27;s attachment trimmer works better</li>
            <li>Great first couple shaves, not sure if worth the money over the model below it</li>
            <li>It gives a nice shave and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice close shave &amp; it doesn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li>popup trimmer is really great for my sideburns as they grow pretty quickly and need a trim at least once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading so many positive reviews (should have paid more attention to the negative ones) and reading the product description I decided to give this electric razor a chance, hoping I would have more success with it than older electric razors I had tried.  </li>
            <li>Very light, quick charging, and a long shaving time.</li>
            <li>Gives a better shave than my older razor did with new blades.</li>
            <li>The Norelco AT895 brought a closer, more comfortable shave than expected, even though I had used electric razors for years..</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how easy it is to keep him looking neat</li>
            <li>It charges quickly, and the battery life is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>The pop-up edger is the same as on more economical models.  </li>
            <li>AT830 and 6948XL are among the most useful of current rotary shavers.</li>
            <li>He does mention that he still needs to clean up with a regular blade after using but that it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The product has a soft rubber grip, which is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Reallly was surprised at how easy on face and close shave.  </li>
            <li>I found this to be a nice touch, even in a dry environment.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been quite some time since I tried an electric and the technology has apparently gotten better as this one does the oft-troubling neck pretty well.  </li>
            <li>The pivoting head on this razor is superior to the previous Norelco I owned.</li>
            <li>works a whole lot better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>Wanted shaver that was good for a black man.</li>
            <li>he skin was getting too sensitive and easily cut....</li>
            <li>Great Razor, finally after buying 2 prior to this one,  I got a thumbs up.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and a battery charge last for weeks.</li>
            <li>The functionality of this razor is incredible, if you use it in the shower it will give you a shave that rivals most manual blades without the risk of cutting yourself.</li>
            <li>far it cleans the machine easily but doesn&#x27;t give me a close shave.</li>
            <li>, it delivered a shave that was close enough to be presentable, but not anywhere near as good as a blade.</li>
            <li>The upgrade was not because the first one was inferior but the upgrade had just a little more power and since he also uses it shave his head he opted for more power.</li>
            <li>And it didn&#x27;t sound like the motor was very powerful because it is so quiet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty easy to clean, just pop it open and rise it</li>
            <li>found this to be a somewhat better than average mid-range shaver, good, but not on a par with the 1290 I recently reviewed and which my husband loves.</li>
            <li>I will say it does give me an excellent shave, but it takes twice as long as my previous razor to get it.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and easy / holds a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I like my Norleco wet/dry shavers very much.  </li>
            <li>then I noticed that the shave&lt;br /&gt;quality droped off very fast.</li>
            <li>Oh, it hurts very much.</li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>a design good enough to be in New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art product design</li>
            <li>Since the blades and foils needed to be replaced anyways, on top of a new cord, I figured I&#x27;d just look for a new razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He had a Braun in between these two Norelco&#x27;s, but was very clear about it not being as good as old his old Norelco.</li>
            <li>In fact, even when my face is dry and I&#x27;m in a cool place, my old cheap Norelco did a better shave than this one.</li>
            <li>Then Braun, while owned by Gillette, introduced titanium foil shavers that combined fairly close shaves with little skin irritation, and I switched to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is a little light and really isn&#x27;t as good as the last one as you have to go over areas to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>I like the rinse and wet cleaning that keeps the blades clean for a better shave.  </li>
            <li>Previous models of Norelco shaver&#x27;s i have had supplied coiled cords which makes them much more easy to store.</li>
            <li>He loves it, especially the fact that it can be rinsed out and that it charges so easily and quickly.</li>
            <li>Perhaps my beard is too coarse for foil type razors as I find the this new Norelco to shave even better than the previous model and is a joy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that the shave isn&#x27;t nearly as close, not to mention the price, while not exorbitant, is still a bit high (and the options for razors can be quite mind-boggling).  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric razor, and it works well.</li>
            <li>exactly so I wouldn&#x27;t make any mistakes.  </li>
            <li>third (in the past 10 yeras) and best ever Norelco.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I let it charge fully, I switched it on to have my first shave and allow it the opportunity to impress me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe my facial hair will learn to be intimidated by the AT830 over time, or as I age the hair won&#x27;t be as big a challenge for the three impeccably designed heads ...</li>
            <li>Well, I called back and the Guy that I talked to this time said it was perfectly ok.</li>
            <li>, that would be it.&lt;br /&gt;i love the product and plan to purchase this brand again in the future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, to conclude, if you can bear a shave that isn&#x27;t quite as close in exchange for shaving money in the long-run and much quicker shave, I&#x27;d go for it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this without cream and it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>now that I&#x27;ve finally been able to mail the darn thing out, I have to wait another SIX TO EIGHT weeks to recieve my refund.</li>
            <li>but this one sometimes sticks to my skin if it&#x27;s too hot.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using it on the back of my neck</li>
            <li>This razor gets the job done, but pales in comparison to higher priced models.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommended only if you can&#x27;t afford the better quality models.</li>
            <li>I tried a cheap razor with these three circle blades which seemed to eat my face alive.</li>
            <li>I scanned the razor with my iPhone in the parking lot and found these reviews and the Amazon price (which was slightly higher than their MISTAKE price).</li>
            <li>First, the AT830 Phillips Norelco PowerTouch Rechargeable Cordless Razor features and impressions.  </li>
            <li>initial shave is OK, but again the 2D takes it with closeness of the cut.</li>
            <li>First electric razor ever</li>
            <li>The first one I got as a gift, over 10 years ago worked like a charm from day one.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this razor was the grip.  </li>
            <li>(I think my first one was made of wood and stone!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first electric razor that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>I switched back to an electric razor after many years.  </li>
            <li>If this is the first time you are using a electric shaver - be warned - you are not going to like it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best when charged on a regular schedule as the battery indicator does not indicate when it&#x27;s near empty.  </li>
            <li>This shaver can get a pretty close shave, maybe too close.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not afraid of waking the whole house in the morning when using this one.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works as expected and is a nice feature to have.</li>
            <li>and it goes off on the first day.</li>
            <li>Their low speeds encourage shaving with slower and more strategic motions.</li>
            <li>This was a plus as it was his first electric</li>
            <li>I recommend you spend the extra money on a better razor.</li>
            <li>My first electric razor, was a Norelco, when I entered the Army in 1956.</li>
            <li>Works much better than my last Norelco which did not even give a week of shaves.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>It works ok if used daily, but</li>
            <li>I have used electric razors for years and have tried many different brands.</li>
            <li>It is my first electric</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still on it&#x27;s first charge.  </li>
            <li>Shaves pretty close.</li>
            <li>Clean-up is a cinch, and this unit has the added bonus of being able to be used in the shower for those days where the alarm just wasn&#x27;t enough to get the day started.</li>
            <li>The first two I bought were crappy</li>
            <li>And it has a very efficient built in trimmer for those rare occasions when you just can&#x27;t get rid of a hair.</li>
            <li>This is my third Norelco in the last 35 years and definitely the best of them all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;++ Best for daily shaving of short to medium thickness facial hair</li>
            <li>It does result in skin irritation at first.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t think you need the detail trimmer of the 1150, give the PowerTouch units a try first.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t think you need the detail trimmer of the 1150, give the PowerTouch units a try first.  </li>
            <li>I have a higher end</li>
            <li>I have essential tremors and sure made shaving a breeze.</li>
            <li>Just flip the head up, and you can simply shake most of the fuzz out.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This is the first electric shaver I have owned that compares to a razor!When</li>
            <li>Will be buying 2 more for shortly.</li>
            <li>I was able to get my 8240 back together and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>I have used another (more basic)</li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only issues that I have is that for the price, this should have more features.  </li>
            <li>For this reason they don;&#x27;t want you to be able to use it with the cord attached for obvious reasons.</li>
            <li>I have used norelco&#x27;s shavers for several years, but the triple blade head does a closer shave and feels better.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric razor.  </li>
            <li>SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor first thinking I&#x27;d step up.</li>
            <li>The first lasted 5 years.  </li>
            <li>So far its a smooth running machine.</li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>The Panasonic told me how many minutes of charge I had left - this one just tells me &amp;#34;when</li>
            <li>recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3-31-13-- Have been using razor about 5 days a week and today was the first day I had to recharge.</li>
            <li>The first week I had some skin irritation but that went away after some time.</li>
            <li>On the plus side the battery will last for many shaves before recharging.</li>
            <li>After some online research, I saw that the latest generations of Norelcos have gone back to slotted combs...................</li>
            <li>from Norelco&#x27;s Senseo line, which is nominally a higher end product than this razor&#x27;s pedigree.  </li>
            <li>You have to wait until it&#x27;s charged up enough in order to shave, which is more than 5 minutes</li>
            <li>I had my doubts, but that disappeared the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Only thing I wish was better is the motor.  </li>
            <li>I had been a Norelco user for many years but decided to try another brand, Remington, as a sale opportunity and in the belief that there was not a lot of difference in shavers in similar price ranges.  </li>
            <li>I decided I needed better and read through all the reviews for the different types of shavers.  </li>
            <li>I bought Philips Norelco AT830 for my husband and he LOVES it so much!</li>
            <li>I enjoy its shave so far</li>
            <li>After reading the directions, I charged the razor for the first time.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>Rinsing it out after use is much better than my last one that had to be cleaned manually.</li>
            <li>just push the button to flip open the top and rinse under running water, done.</li>
            <li>Men who might not feel they need to shave every day should do so anyway; short hair shave off more efficiently, (tho</li>
            <li>they are 25-30 dollars, I think the replacements for the Panasonic were pretty close to 50, maybe</li>
            <li>Even though 1150X/46 is similar,  the AT830 feels better in the hand , has longer battery life, has a pop up trimmer and has room to be made with quality parts.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric razor.</li>
            <li>I will buy what I should have bought in the first place, the Braun Series 7.</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely LOVES this shaver!</li>
            <li>My first electric razor.  </li>
            <li>It gives a pretty close shave and has a functional sideburn trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The whole razor is dependent on the battery, which is worth about $18.</li>
            <li>This is the first Aquatec I ever purchased.</li>
            <li>I have to go over the same spot more often with this one.</li>
            <li>I have lost count on how many Norelco shavers I have owned over the last 30+</li>
            <li>Kept charged, cleaned every day, shaved in exactly in the manner as told to in the instructions.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly the one he wanted.</li>
            <li>Proper care will ensure this razor remains in top care for quite a while.</li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wet/dry ability of this razor is a nice feature because it does give you a closer shave when wet.  </li>
            <li>The ability to use it wet is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>My parents have a dog who hates the sound of his old electric razor, but this one does not seem to bother him.  </li>
            <li>When they come up with an electric that shaves closer than a razor without &amp;#34;razor burn&amp;#34; I would be willing to give 5 stars.</li>
            <li>packaged.it was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>As his wife, I love it because it is faster, and I am not left waiting at the front door.</li>
            <li>but I will take more care in my choice,and try further up the range !!</li>
            <li>Sure for some people it has become second nature</li>
            <li>It was the first time for me using an electric shaver, but</li>
            <li>This is the first electric razor I have used that does not break my face out in a rash.  </li>
            <li>model AT830 is a good choice for everyday use at home.</li>
            <li>It is good for a shave after one days growth and for touch-ups...but not for heavy growth or after a weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>almost razor-like, very low noise (i cant stand noise in the morning), better wet than dry but both VERY good...</li>
            <li>After turning it on, I knew right away that it was not going to be powerful enough based on the sound the blades were making.</li>
            <li>We did not compare any notes until after going back to our own new shavers.  </li>
            <li>But overall, I do consider it a shaver that anyone who wants a very comfortable shave at a very reasonable price, this is the shaver for you.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable, efficient, quick and quiet.  </li>
            <li>I think that some of these models like the 7310, which can be found for around half the price of the AT830 if you shop around, are really just as good.</li>
            <li>I spent a fair amount of time writing a very complimentary review and had it rejected by them for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li>This razor has an easy, normal cord, so it&#x27;s much better for plugging in to the bathroom outlet without blocking all the other outlets or making me unplug my blow-dryer,</li>
            <li>Sure it is still new (only had since Christmas of 2014) and the blade are still at their like new sharpness, but is is so comfortable and gives me such a close shave that I am in love with it.</li>
            <li>Easy grip, air dry, cool feel to the face,</li>
            <li>Did I mention I&#x27;ve used other rotary razors on my legs before and liked</li>
            <li>Did I mention I&#x27;ve used other rotary razors on my legs before and liked</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other kind.</li>
            <li>Much of what you would get in the higher end series is the design and LCD display vs. an actual better shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good shaver, I love the way it cuts my face hair and even is perfect to shave head, but  if you want razor last for a very long time be careful to don&#x27;t use it at shower time because even the manufacturer say that razor is perfectly sealed and ready to use it in contact with the shower water it will got filtration&#x27;s inside the circuits and will fail due to short circuit.  </li>
            <li>shave without wetting my face or using any cream.&lt;br /&gt;The fit is right and normal as far as it goes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have only used it as a wet shaver and it performs great.  </li>
            <li>This was a birthday gift for my hubby, it arrived earlier than expected, in great shape and he loves using it.</li>
            <li>My husband goes through shavers like most people go through toilet paper.  </li>
            <li>each used our razors for one week, cleaned them properly with a good blade wash, then traded razors for a second week trial.  </li>
            <li>I actually like the feel of stationary heads, but I have found I have to make multiple passes to get a good shave with all these razors.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say I am glad he loved this shaver.</li>
            <li>This tool is handy but, for full control I recommend a small comb to tease the hair as you</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad they finally have moved their battery chemistry into the modern age of lipo batteries.</li>
            <li>shaver works real well for me, although I do end having to go over the same area more than once.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a decent shaver and as far as I&#x27;m concerned, easy to get used to if you have used one before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy..flip open top and rinse.</li>
            <li>The AT830 got really good reviews about reliability over the newer, more expensive Norelco models</li>
            <li>If I had not read this and went by the first experience with it, I would have certainly returned it and probably written a not so favorable review.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth shave easy to clean and pretty much the same results wet or dry.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the quality of shave that I get and with the money that I have NOT spent on blades it has already paid for itself!</li>
            <li>I enjoy the quality of shave that I get and with the money that I have NOT spent on blades it has already paid for itself!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you very much, for this product, I am very gladd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to clean, the charge lasts a long time, and you get a warning light when the charge is low.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, the battery lasts longer than my Panasonic&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Instead of buying replacement blades, I opted for this razor after seeing positive customer feedback.</li>
            <li>forget all these positive reviews If you are looking for close shave don&#x27;t buy this one or any rotary shaver.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try an electric razor out and after a lot of research and reading all the positive reviews here decided on this one.</li>
            <li>I think the 7310 is pretty much a reliable workhorse.</li>
            <li>Been shaving with this razor in the shower for about a week now and it pretty much performs as advertised.  </li>
            <li>and I did the first charge for the whole night - after a week</li>
            <li>I first bought this in May 2013 and by September 2013 it wouldn&#x27;t charge so Philips replaced the whole unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The razor&#x27;s quietness was also suprising at first but very much appreciated.  </li>
            <li>Both have the same battery and the same shave/charge characteristiscs that are most important to me.</li>
            <li>Might be due to what seems to be a more powerful motor.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t have any irritation and it didn&#x27;t leave many long hairs.</li>
            <li>Battery life is good; I usually charge it once a week.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is one of the better electric razors but not among the most expensive options, so if you&#x27;re looking to upgrade from a cheaper model or want to try your first electric razor without spending a lot of money (in the long run this is cheaper than high end safety blades like Fusion), this is a good product to consider.</li>
            <li>Same great Norelco shaving capability - a little better than my last one (10years ago).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this product as a replacement for an older shaver from the same OEM that the battery had given out on after MANY years of service.</li>
            <li>For charging it doesn&#x27;t come with a stand you set it in like my older model, fortunately the old stand works with this one.</li>
            <li>charge doesn&#x27;t last all that more than the older one I had</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally I feel it could be priced a little better - but knowing the quality that goes into Philips Norelco products I am not shocked that it is priced as it</li>
            <li>I received the new Norelco about a month ago, had another older one, but this one could be used in the shower and also could be cleaned by running water over the flip open blade housing, making it easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It took some getting used to rinsing it out in hot water after every shave (leave it open, on a towel after you shake most of the water out), but this keeps the blades and their housings clean, and ready for the next shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s likely not any razor that would be the one best choice everyone due to different expectations and varieties of skin and hair.</li>
            <li>this one gives a better shave than the more costly one kept this , sent other back save some money buy this one.</li>
            <li>I would say that this new shaver works as well as a fresh blade on the Schick razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>make sure to dry the charge port before charging, as they all have a problem here.</li>
            <li>The full charge took roughly an hour, which provides me about a week of shaving before having to charge it again (again, note that I have a light beard that doesn&#x27;t require a lengthy shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because rotaries are quiet, one easily hears when cutters engage whiskers.</li>
            <li>The stand tips over easily and is an extra requirement to haul around when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the less effective it becomes.  </li>
            <li>When a recharge is necessary, it&#x27;s done very quickly.</li>
            <li>He had previously owned a lower model Norelco and liked it but had to keep buying batteries for it.</li>
            <li>Charging is easy, via a simple AC adapter cord</li>
            <li>I mostly use it dry.</li>
            <li>Semi-close dry but is better in the shower with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>but okay dry if your in a hurry.</li>
            <li>It was easy to order, and arrived in a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li>I love it because I may use it with shaving cream or dry.</li>
            <li>And cleaning the razor isn&#x27;t quite as easy as it had been with prior wet/dry</li>
            <li>I had an older, cheap norelco but the price of a new blade was really high</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this electric razor because it provides not only a nice close shave, but the skin feels soft and not irritated afterwards.</li>
            <li>After confirming via phone with Norelco that I indeed had a purely cordless model, I contacted Amazon and arranged for a return/refund.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product to anyone based on performance, ease of use, and price.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My current razor is the Panasonic ES-LV61, which I admit sets a very high bar for the AT830, but it&#x27;s good to have a high standard of comparison.  </li>
            <li>The battery lasts a long time and has a very clean cut for an electric razor.</li>
            <li>However it is really quiet compared to my old one, and it&#x27;s cool how I can just run hot water over the blades to clean it.</li>
            <li>He likes it very much and the shaver is really a decent one.</li>
            <li>Shaves great, its a Norelco, duh!</li>
            <li>This is my fourth norelco shaver in past 10 years and it is the best so far</li>
            <li>This is very comfortable on your face, and no more clean and renew solution to buy, this cleans up under the fawcet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>when it was time to buy a new one, I went back to my favorite brand.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It makes the second step (razor) easy because the first pass with the Norelco did such a good job that just a little bath-soap on the face is enough lubrication (if you felt a need to do more).  </li>
            <li>It works great wet or dry...</li>
            <li>The shaving platform moves to follow your face contours and great shave dry or wet.  </li>
            <li>Charges fully in less than an hour and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Works great wet &amp; dry.</li>
            <li>I will say it is much quieter than any previous razor I have owned and that is nice.  </li>
            <li>Only used dry so far,but good shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the design are similar among the two, the new one certainly do a better job, thanks to the&lt;br /&gt;additional features.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my face feeling pretty smooth and does a good job of not missing any hairs with only a few passes.</li>
            <li>After several months, the shaver works fine and does what it&#x27;s marketed to do.  </li>
            <li>My face is nice and smooth now, and it&#x27;s only slightly irritated along my neck/under my chin.</li>
            <li>First it was the Remington as a teenager, then the Norelco with two cutters rather than three, through many other  models for years.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is particularly unsatisfactory!</li>
            <li>Smart move on my part....shaves much quicker and closer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to use while traveling for water is not accessible.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The razor does not come with any kind of little carrying case for trips.  </li>
            <li>clean my shaver after each use: just open it up and rinse with hot water from the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mix my shaving lotion with hibiclens to make sure no more infections on my face for an clean shave.</li>
            <li>Yep, each one lasts about 5 years--actually longer if you&#x27;re not concerned about battery life, i.e. willing to keep it plugged in--and I&#x27;d highly recommend the brand.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I give it four stars is that the first one I purchased broke after about four uses; however, amazon replaced it and sent a new one to me very quickly, so there was no loss to me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You don&#x27;t see the charge light until the very end is my only issue.  </li>
            <li>This one is noisy and the aqua benefit really isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>I dosent cut very close.</li>
            <li>- Razor feels solid and comfortable to grip  </li>
            <li>- Comes with cleaning brush, cover  - Equipped with spring-loaded trimmer  - White light</li>
            <li>It feels solid and he finds it comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>Shaving is fast and, doesn&#x27;t require any real patience (e.g., I can shave with the grain, against the grain, in a circular motion...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does indeed give you a very close shave - probably the closest I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric -</li>
            <li>Just glide it gently over the skin and remove all the whiskers.</li>
            <li>The price changed so fast.</li>
            <li>That really disappoints me.</li>
            <li>it ain&#x27;t getting much heavier.</li>
            <li>However, it really does not give a very close shave.</li>
            <li>I called Norelco, and they confirmed that almost all of their low and mid-priced razors are now made in China.</li>
            <li>However, I really don&#x27;t like the design of the 1250X, and I returned it too</li>
            <li>/&gt;This model has a much nicer and wider trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The price seemed reasonable so I picked it up.</li>
            <li>suggest paying this much for THIS razor.  </li>
            <li>suggest paying this much for THIS razor.  </li>
            <li>In  my opinion it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a real razor but it does the job.</li>
            <li>It shaves very close.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t cut very close.</li>
            <li>On the flipside, if I skip shaving Sat/Sun, when I shave for Monday morning it does very well.</li>
            <li>After 65 years of using a straight razor, my husband is now using a Philips Norelco.  </li>
            <li>It is especially gentle enough for shaving the head and neck areas.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended !</li>
            <li>Fortunately it has a 45 day money back guarantee.</li>
            <li>The Norelco was quiet and shaved smoothly.</li>
            <li>very clean!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>No need to pay more than this as anything else is just more of the same at higher price and no better shave.</li>
            <li>I absolutely cannot use a straight razor without bumping up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As the blades wear, it may become more of an issue, but that&#x27;s also to be expected by any electric.  </li>
            <li>The heads do flex to try andcontour your face, but it really doesn&#x27;t do a lot.  </li>
            <li>It is very light-weight, but makes me wonder how durable and long-lasting it will be.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s quiet and light.</li>
            <li>This razor was a Christmas gift and much appreciated by my son who received it.</li>
            <li>* Quiet and smooth shave</li>
            <li>There is no battery meter, only a light that flashes when the battery is about to run out.</li>
            <li>Shaver was better than expected.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>It gets a very close shave.</li>
            <li>The blades, while providing a close shave, are not irritating to the skin, even on the neck area.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>the whole thing can be rinsed in water…</li>
            <li>I had really fast response  .  </li>
            <li>There is a battery light that tells you when it is getting low.</li>
            <li>Very close shave.</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;m not the only guy like this, so this is a detailed review for those of you who are considering an 810 or 830 model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope this helps someone who really has wanted to know the difference.</li>
            <li>Supersharp blades and fast battery recharge.  </li>
            <li>I had shoulder surgery on my dominate side and could not shave with a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it now</li>
            <li>I bought this razor for my husband for Christmas, &amp; much to my surprise~without any prompting he said to me, &amp;#34;I really like that razor.</li>
            <li>It produces a very close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li>Therefore I spent more and bought this one.</li>
            <li>Shaves very close.</li>
            <li>It shaves fast, very close, and works quite well.</li>
            <li>This shaver works very well and you can bring it in the shower with you.  </li>
            <li>very nice&lt;br /&gt;to</li>
            <li>quiet, close shave, comfortable in hand and on face</li>
            <li>Bah on the whole company.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>I AM BACK TO A REALLY SMOOTH SHAVE,</li>
            <li>really do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>need to be recharged much often.</li>
            <li>I love the wet shave for comfort and closeness.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>At the price of this razor it was worth getting rid of the old one and getting a replacement.  </li>
            <li>Also the razor doesn&#x27;t shave very close.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t save you much time shaving.  </li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>Reasonable shave for price.</li>
            <li>and he really enjoys it.</li>
            <li>While both have similar features, this model is louder when shaving, does not feel like it cuts as close, and the trimmer is louder and not as smooth.  </li>
            <li>I get ready in the morning while everyone is asleep</li>
            <li>It sometimes seems to work better wet.  </li>
            <li>In the morning I used a Gillette, which gives a much closer shave than the electrics.</li>
            <li>Be very meticulous where you let it slide.</li>
            <li>Needs about 3 circular pass overs to do a spot, but the speed you do it at doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>My dad lost his hearing with age, which I attributed to noisy shaver, lawn mower, and snow blower -- so quiet is *really* important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One thing to note:  Recharge it before it really needs to be charged since this is a model that can be used in water it will not run when the cord is plugged in so you cannot use it while plugged in and charging.  </li>
            <li>It does a reasonable job at shaving.</li>
            <li>This is much nicer.  </li>
            <li>The heads really hug the face and the result is a very close shave with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>it does not give a very close shave.</li>
            <li>so I needed another shaver fast,</li>
            <li>He says that it works very well.</li>
            <li>hThThe razor is light weight with a battery that seems to last forever.  </li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s not replaceable, unit went straight in the trash.</li>
            <li>Works reasonably well.</li>
            <li>There is no battery meter, only a light that flashes when the battery is about to run out and if it does run out...</li>
            <li>Just contacted Philips and they won&#x27;t replace the whole unit this time, just the handle / body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought the floating head design because I really have to mash it into my face over and over again to get it to cut my beard.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>But it works very well--including the tougher spots like on my neck.  </li>
            <li>But I still occasionally use a cheap two or three blade throw away razor.</li>
            <li>and it did not slide very well.  </li>
            <li>This seems reasonable given that the outer edge would have the highest rotation speed.  </li>
            <li>Really like the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>Also like fast delivery</li>
            <li>SMOOTH , QUIET, QUALITY PRODUCT</li>
            <li>It gives a really close shave for an electric.  </li>
            <li>but it did not deliver a very confortable or efficient shave.  </li>
            <li>haha would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li>he thanks me.  </li>
            <li>Forget trying to use it on a sweaty face, as it sticks too much for that.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not quite as close as a modern safety razor with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Bought for my husband as a gift as he really wanted to try a wet/dry shaver in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>and when he does it gets really irritated from it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and quiet.</li>
            <li>I suggest using shaving cream, makes shave much smoother.</li>
            <li>This was a birthday gift for my brother and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s much quicker and comparatively hassle-free, not to mention nick-free.</li>
            <li>He wanted one that was fast charging and he likes the shave he gets..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Norelco wants you to replace the rotary blade sets every year.</li>
            <li>The fact is that water always find a way to get into, so is better to be careful with it.</li>
            <li>Really quiet and smooth shaving (</li>
            <li>How do they manage to get away with this, without even a label on the package telling people that batteries aren&#x27;t really replaceable amazes me.</li>
            <li>After years and years of using a straight edge razor, shaving cream etc.</li>
            <li>The build is solid and fit, no water can go through it.</li>
            <li>The razor really rates a five.  </li>
            <li>I expected more from Norelco.  </li>
            <li>I just expected better.</li>
            <li>This has give me a much closer shave versus my Fusion razor.</li>
            <li>This one is much closer</li>
            <li>that is when it wants to work.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S REASONABLY PRICED</li>
            <li>It is quiet and runs smoothly, but lacks a charge indicator.  </li>
            <li>He really loves it.  </li>
            <li>I love this razor.it arrived sooner than expected and was well</li>
            <li>3-5 minutes and ready.</li>
            <li>but now he really really loves it and his face is so smoooooth.</li>
            <li>ago I did not realize how much I had come to like my Philips Norelco 830/ 41 Aquatic Power Touch Electric Razor until I had occasion to be without it.</li>
            <li>I really like it because it gives me a close shave without pinching my lip and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to start using an electric shaver, because of some neck surgery and this one works very well.  </li>
            <li>This is working very well.  </li>
            <li>He had never used an electric razor, he thought they all pulled to much.</li>
            <li>Very pleaseed with the charge</li>
            <li>I really like the wet/dry functionality</li>
            <li>It is a really close shave and it does not irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need to go over some of the areas multiple times before it shaves everything perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li>It gives me a fast, close shave.</li>
            <li>Never used it in the shower, but i really like how it feels to my face and head.</li>
            <li>do the job very well, with to much gel the Norelco dont work</li>
            <li>Gvies a really close shave with no irratation</li>
            <li>Really embarrassing.</li>
            <li>It is very quiet which is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same power or speed</li>
            <li>Shaves  as well as my old Norelco shaver, however lacks the most basic features.  </li>
            <li>Long story short, not only does this shaver work great, and charge up in a couple of hours instead of 8, but the first set of blades lasted me a whole year.</li>
            <li>Shaves are closer than my old one and love that you charge it and forget about it for multiple weeks.  </li>
            <li>I really have to spent more time to get a closer shave</li>
            <li>Overall good quality easy to use and close enough shave easy to care for and like the fact you can use it wet or dry</li>
            <li>as I liked the initial shave, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying another -- just not durable enough for me.</li>
            <li>Its a lot faster shave than my old dead electric shaver and feels good.</li>
            <li>Razor seems to hold a good charge unless you are someone like me that has a thick beard.  </li>
            <li>It is very quite, and Blades are Sharp, gives a very Smooth Shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it wet, but the shave is pretty good dry.  </li>
            <li>I have used a Norelco for 20 years, was very satisfied and needed a new battery which is not available.</li>
            <li>All of the other material that I purchased was as good as any I could purchase in a local store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those who want the Jet Clean system should try the 1250cc, as long as they are willing to pay the premium and don&#x27;t mind the hassle and expense of the cleaning fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So he has had this one for a few weeks and this might be a pretty good selection for anyone with a coarse beard.</li>
            <li>I have had models with a few more features in the past, but this one gives a good shave.  </li>
            <li>Its OK but nbot like the other 4 Norelco shavers I had.</li>
            <li>I have bought other Norelco shavers before and have had outstanding results with them.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>The other feature that I like, but haven&#x27;t been able to confirm from the manual, is that the razor seems to cut off charging automatically when its fully charged.</li>
            <li>So this is more a middle-range, workhouse model without the elegance and style of the other razor.</li>
            <li>I usually have a set of replacement heads on hand ; replacing the heads on a yearly basis provides tip top performance !</li>
            <li>I had been using a Philips Norelco HS8420 (which dispenses Nivea lubricant) and was happy with it until after about a year when the blades started to dull and the shave was less comfortable.</li>
            <li>You MUST buy a whole new unit.&lt;br /&gt;Sly!  </li>
            <li>Big improvement is I can clean it in the water and not worry about it.  </li>
            <li>It is light weighted, charges up fast and shaves for a long time on a charge.</li>
            <li>The fact that it can be used both wet or dry was a huge selling point, and is probably his favorite thing about it.</li>
            <li>Much nicer than older model.</li>
            <li>It works fine and holds a charge reasonably long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still have to use a razor for the upper neck to get a  clean shove.</li>
            <li>to work looking clean, this is a solid product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do never submerge it under water, I do always use the shower to rinse it with the necessary amount of water to clean it.</li>
            <li>I bought it mainly for the sideburn trimer, and that works reasonably well.  </li>
            <li>Holds a charge a long time and works fine.  </li>
            <li>And when you are done you can quickly clean it by opening it up and dumping the hair in the garbage followed by rinsing the entire head area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice Norelco brought this back for their lower priced line as in previous product generations only the most high end shavers costing hundreds included indicator lights.</li>
            <li>Quick charging is not as quick as other models</li>
            <li>their high speeds, foil shavers don&#x27;t really cut whiskers.</li>
            <li>It is easily cleaned with hot running water, and since it can be used in the shower, there are no worries about getting too much water on it like the previous razor.  </li>
            <li>I bought this razor to replace one that uses a special shaving lotion by Nivea that can only be bought on-line because the razor is no longer being made.  </li>
            <li>Many times  I have to follow; up my shave with a conventional soap and razor bladed utensil</li>
            <li>overweight feels very cheap, my older 8891XL feels balanced, sturdy and strong, not top heavy, light weight and cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had other Norelco shavers in the past and they all were very good.  </li>
            <li>After nearly 20 minutes of trying to get a closer shave I finally gave up and finished the job (easily) with a manual razor.  </li>
            <li>The Wet shave is just as good as the dry shave, so I don&#x27;t bother with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no shaver head &amp;#34;Personal Comfort Control” adjustment to adjust the blade conditions against you skin as compared to the older 8891XL.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving dust does not stay contained in the head until you open it to clean it, the shaving dust falls all over the handle and makes it dirty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives him a very close shave, it&#x27;s quiet, and recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li>Much approved over my last Norelco electric razor which did an adequate job.  </li>
            <li>I get the best results getting my face wet in a hot shower,  then applying Barbasol sensitive skin shaving cream,  and using only a little pressure with it as I shave</li>
            <li>The Panasonic was okay but was a very loud razor and shaved rough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it helps me that, being an old retired fellow, I no longer shave every single day.  </li>
            <li>So far the shaves have been fast, quiet and smooth and the clean-up of the razor a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a female consumer, I can only speak to my experience, but I really think you&#x27;d be overpaying for a so-so razor with this one when the SensoTouch 2d is so much better and costs about the same.e  </li>
            <li>It glides over my face pretty well, but it some times takes two or three passes to get an area completely shaven.  </li>
            <li>Granted, we aren&#x27;t professional testers, but we tried to stay consistent in our testing.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Note: if you use the fold-out hair trimmer, the charge will not last a full fifty minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first impression of this shaver was that it didn&#x27;t feel as substantial as my old retired Norelco.</li>
            <li>In the past thirty years I&#x27;ve tried just about every kind of hair removal method there is.</li>
            <li>Good but not good for neck</li>
            <li>I finally decided to get rid of my old one (approximately 18 years old and still working flawlessly as the first day) and go for Norelco Powertouch.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>The Norelco gives a better shave than the Braun hands down.</li>
            <li>far as the value, I&#x27;d say we were prepared to spend up to a hundred, and while eighty is a bit much, if it lasts as long as they usually do, and continues to function as well as this one has so far, I feel like that&#x27;s well worth adding a bit of happy convenience to my husband&#x27;s mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My second of this type but the first one was a better dry shave.</li>
            <li>If you are shopping for a new electric razor for under 100.00 you should go with this one!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to clean, pretty quiet, and I haven&#x27;t noticed the whisker pull that a few guys have mentioned.  </li>
            <li>The shave, while not as close as a fresh blade, performs better than a slightly dull razor...</li>
            <li>This new product shaves fast and misses nothing.  </li>
            <li>However, I really like the fact that, unlike the 7000 series, the new models don&#x27;t require a charging stand.  </li>
            <li>The new razor arrived in an unbelievably fast time.  </li>
            <li>but it seems to me that i might be ready for a new head already.</li>
            <li>I had been using an older Norelco XL model, and this new model shaves much closer and faster.  </li>
            <li>After reading some of the reviews, good and bad, I went against my better judgement and placed an order for this razor.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and it can get wet without concern.</li>
            <li>The Norelco is leaps and bounds better than my previous experience with electric razors.  </li>
            <li>but I do enjoy the convience of a dry shave.</li>
            <li>He likes it and uses it more than he ever used his previous electric razor.</li>
            <li>More metal, less plastic, and beefier motors.  </li>
            <li>The dry shave is about as good as my previous models but where this model really excels is in the shower with some shave gel/foam.</li>
            <li>just ok, next time I would consider a different model.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I prefer its charging AC adapter to the curly cable on older models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>-- I&#x27;ve switched to a Panasonic instead -- similar cost but super quality and speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Battery life is decent (could be longer I think)</li>
            <li>I do not have 5 minutes to wait for a quick charge as the manual says (that, if 5 minutes is enough).</li>
            <li>at least so far - the shave isn&#x27;t superior to a blade or the SensoTouch 2D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is quiet and does the job quickly</li>
            <li>That said it&#x27;s great if I&#x27;m in a big hurry or need to touch up before a late day meeting.</li>
            <li>Model 6948XL uses the older HQ56</li>
            <li>Overall, it performs as well or better than current foil shavers and provides uniform shaves somewhat faster.</li>
            <li>The razor is very quiet and shaves quickly and close.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s super quiet.</li>
            <li>I think I have had to charge mine only three times in several weeks...and one of those was on impulse/out of habit. :-)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comfort: This razor utilzes the standard three head design which is traditional of many razors out there.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To summarize, I think it&#x27;s worth to buy at least AT810 for better shaving quality,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>older technology</li>
            <li>received my shaver promptly and only had a few good shaves.</li>
            <li>It does not shave that closely as my older obsolete (and 1/2 the price) electric razor.</li>
            <li>The closeness of shave is far better used wet</li>
            <li>I went from a reguralar electric razor to the Norelco which gives a decent shave.  </li>
            <li>is a lot noisier than my older and still working 8891XL</li>
            <li>They are spot welded to the inside terminals so it prevents you from replacing them when it gets older and the batteries wear out.</li>
            <li>This shaver replaced an older model with battery charging problem.</li>
            <li>in a while I have to catch an occasional hair with a safety razor, and I wouldn&#x27;t use this on my wedding day, but for every day use if you just want a quick shave that gets you</li>
            <li>I just use the Norelco when I need a quick shave before I go out in public to do my grocery shopping, Dr. appointments etc.</li>
            <li>Again, this is a decent razor but not if you want AC capability.  </li>
            <li>The razor shaves fairly decently.  </li>
            <li>Wish it had a more robust charging indicator (waits till only 5 minutes left before notifying) and came with a stand.  </li>
            <li>I just prefer rotary shavers, mainly because they are quieter than foil shavers.</li>
            <li>pleased enough with it that I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>We hope this lasts him a while, so stick around for a 2nd review to see how it performs later :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for decades and have a number of older models in a drawer in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>My main beef against this unit is the power cord.  </li>
            <li>and it actually takes me more time to use this than a regular razor.  </li>
            <li>It took me 5 minutes to figure out why they spent extra money to cripple their own product: When the battery (which you cannot replace) stops holding a charge, you cannot continue to use the shaver by keeping it plugged in.</li>
            <li>Very quiet and provides a quick shave.</li>
            <li>I replaced an older version of this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Decent price    </li>
            <li>I am used to the older models of Norelco.</li>
            <li>In short, it is a fair shaver if you want to save a few dollars.  </li>
            <li>This AT830 replaces an older Norelco that would no longer take a charge.  </li>
            <li>I used it for about 3 months and the shave was decent.</li>
            <li>So &amp;#34;we&amp;#34; highly recommend this particular razor.</li>
            <li>Clean it every other use as the blades cost as much as the whole razor.</li>
            <li>The wet shave is ok, but again, it doesn&#x27;t shave as smoothly as my Panasonic, and I had to go over the same area several times.  </li>
            <li>If this is an issue for you I highly recommend purchasing the PT730</li>
            <li>High quality and seems</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall result:  highly recommended for convenient electric shaving.</li>
            <li>This product met all my expectations and I would recommend it highly to others.  </li>
            <li>He highly recommends The Philips Norelco AT830 PowerTouch razor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The highly scientific test was for each of us to see how our shaves held up by 10 pm every night.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>highly recomend this product for your.</li>
            <li>He would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li>So far so good, my spouse is African American with a very coarse beard.  </li>
            <li>A little bit of an older model; however, it is as advertised and is what I am looking for, so I am pleased.</li>
            <li>Can be used wet or dry and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I shave my head and find the three individual rotary cutters conform to the curve of my head better than the flat foil shavers.</li>
            <li>Have not done wet shaving,but I think it will do just fine.</li>
            <li>Only problem is the recharge plug falls out too easily and razor can&#x27;t be run on wall current - when the battery eventually goes, then so does the whole razor.</li>
            <li>and I still ended up with some stubble in certain spots, like under the jawline and near &#x27;edges&#x27; like sideburns and mustache.  </li>
            <li>He loves that this can be used both wet and dry, and it gives a very close shave, WAY better than the Braun Pulsonic shaver, and it keeps everything pretty neat.</li>
            <li>The charging indicator could use a little more led exposure.</li>
            <li>I have used it two weeks and each day it is a little better shave.  </li>
            <li>I even was able to give myself a little line up with the pop out extension.</li>
            <li>Nice, pretty sharp - be careful</li>
            <li>It gives a clean shave but not baby butt smooth, at least not for me.</li>
            <li>He says it works good even on his tough beard.  </li>
            <li>As it is, the removable head cover comes off the heads too easily exposing the heads to rub against other objects in a shaving kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a nice lotion after to help my skin afterwards and I try not to press too hard while shaving.</li>
            <li>It seems to me, I have to work a little more to get a closer shave with the new head design, but over all it will give years of service, and a close shave with a little bit more skin stretching.</li>
            <li>Had an older model and needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>This razor charges much faster than my old one, one hour vs eight hrs.</li>
            <li>Takes me much longer to get a close shave than the old Norelco.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my blind brother and he gets a great shave every day</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rotary shavers provide much of their action around the edges of disk-shaped \\&quot;combs\\&quot; where whiskers can slip through slots.</li>
            <li>It is very user-friendly as far as it&#x27;s operation, cleaning, understanding how to use it, etc.  </li>
            <li>, it gives me a clean smooth shave wet or dry, I do both</li>
            <li>Shave is much closer than old model.</li>
            <li>Not only does it comfortably trim my hair at several lengths, but it also gives a really close shave for an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I use to the old 25-30 year models, but this one really works well.  </li>
            <li>Well I decided to try an electric razor so that I could shave everyday in hopes of not having razor burn and also looking respectable.  </li>
            <li>* Rechargeable - almost all shavers are, but worth mentioning    * replacement head cost around $25 - typically last around 6-9 months    </li>
            <li>For me, the extra $20 was worth it.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, the convenience for on-the-go shaves and when you don&#x27;t want to hassle with your normal shaving</li>
            <li>but it is several years old and the battery got so it would not hold a full charge.[[ASIN:B007SLMNFY NORELCO AT830/41 POWERTOUCH RECHARGEABLE CORDLESS RAZOR WITH SMARTPIVOT HEADS &amp; AQUATEC TECHNOLOGY -]]</li>
            <li>I bought it for the purpose that it would be faster than with a normal razor.  </li>
            <li>Norelco - it can&#x27;t cost more than a few pennies.  </li>
            <li>Tiring of the blade, I purchased this razor a few months ago and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced it was worth the additional $10 over the next lower model.</li>
            <li>so I hope they prove  true in the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had several Norelco razors in the past and all of them afforded a good shave.</li>
            <li>Good but not great razor.</li>
            <li>Good, not great.  </li>
            <li>I used a small amount of Edge Gel, flip open top, wet cutters with warm water and you will get a smooth close shave, when gel or face begins to dry, just flip open top and wet cutters again.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, my pal felt that his model was fine for him, and he&#x27;s keeping it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that, just fine.</li>
            <li>bought this item brand new and found that it creates more heat in few minutes of it use.</li>
            <li>But it does, in fact, give a nice close shave, dry or wet.  </li>
            <li>The -830 might be better suited to those with less sensitive faces.</li>
            <li>But they&#x27;ve kept the same cutter design, so you get a slower, less effective shave</li>
            <li>The head pops open easily to remove stuckhair and debris, and then snaps back shut.</li>
            <li>Third, it has an easy button to flip up and open the shaving</li>
            <li>I rinse unit and leave top open so it can dry faster.</li>
            <li>This Shaver really does a good job than other shaver I have tried especially in wet shave</li>
            <li>Not much warning when its going to die; if the warning light is on, don&#x27;t start shaving, you won&#x27;t get very far.</li>
            <li>The packaging doesn&#x27;t mention it, but get the razor out of the plastic and written right on the back is MADE IN CHINA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the on/off button wouldn&#x27;t work and sometimes the razor would turn on by itself and run the battery out and sometimes the motor would seize and shut off, right in the middle of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Charges quickly and lasts a long time between charges.</li>
            <li>Yes, you can charge it for a quick 1 minute shave in a pinch, but compared to the 2D&#x27;s quick charge and power for days there&#x27;s no real comparison for the same price</li>
            <li>It charges quickly and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>The smart pivot feature is ok, but not worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>As a female consumer, I can only speak to my experience, but I really think you&#x27;d be overpaying for a so-so razor with this one when the SensoTouch 2d is so much better and costs about the same.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s the model that&#x27;s considerably more expensive, but this one works fine for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is certainly easier than using traditional razors and the product itself seems to be very well made.</li>
            <li>In retrospect, I should have paid more heed to the negative reviews which I largely agree with after using this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love the long lasting Li-Ion battery that does not fade like the old Nicad battery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Speaking about head speed, if feel very slow, but do the job, maybe this kind of Shaver dont need to much speed to cut the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just bought a new model</li>
            <li>My new Norelco AT830 has solved the problem.  </li>
            <li>New heads cost almost as much as a new razor.  </li>
            <li>He resisted getting a new electric razor</li>
            <li>was tempted to buy the new floating head style, but didn&#x27;t feel the need to change what I already</li>
            <li>you probably add up buying the cost of the razors and the chances of a new one being ..</li>
            <li>The new shaver appears and sounds cheaper.</li>
            <li>I have been using my new Norelco AT830 for about a month.  </li>
            <li>It was a brand new model so there was a delay, it shipped to me on 2/9.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being new, it cuts effortlessly.</li>
            <li>but of course it&#x27;s still a new machine/battery, so we won&#x27;t know if the performance of the battery will deteriorate over time.</li>
            <li>This new razor takes just one hour for a 50 minute charge.  </li>
            <li>It was cheaper to just buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new and see if Norelco had caught up or maybe surpassed Panasonic electric razors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m uncertain what my new razor will require.</li>
            <li>and I figured I would splurge and purchase a new one for fathers day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery - even it&#x27;s a brand new device</li>
            <li>so I decided to look for a brand new one that was usable in the shower.</li>
            <li>WiLl probably seek a new electric shaver .</li>
            <li>I returned this immediately and bought a new Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV Wet/Dry Shaver.</li>
            <li>But with a 2-1/2 year warranty you should be covered and after that it&#x27;s probably time for a new one anyway.e anyway.</li>
            <li>My husband loves his new rechargeable razor.</li>
            <li>It gets as close as one of the new blade types.</li>
            <li>so I bough a new one</li>
            <li>I purchase a new unit about every two years.</li>
            <li>The closeness of shave was like a new day in the life of my stubble.</li>
            <li>I wanted a new Norelco that didn&#x27;t break the bank and still gave me a close shave.  </li>
            <li>This new razor shave so close and so effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>My husband needed a new razor.  </li>
            <li>I had not owned an electric razor in over 20 years and in that time the technology had changed and I should take some time to learn to use my new electric razor before I passed judgment</li>
            <li>live overseas</li>
            <li>This new one charges fully in an hour.  </li>
            <li>Once the battery is worn out, you have to purchase a new razor.</li>
            <li>This one I&#x27;ve had for 15 years, I just buy new blades when needed.</li>
            <li>It was time for new blades on my old Panasonic, so I decided to shop for a new shaver and try this Norelco rotary shaver, what a mistake!</li>
            <li>Makes shaving quick and holds a very long charge.</li>
            <li>I use this as a dry shaver and it does a quick and thorough</li>
            <li>When you charge the battery, you can&#x27;t tell whether the battery is full or half full or drained although the picture on the box suggests digital display of percentage of charging.</li>
            <li>I have a rough and nappy beard like most people of African descent.  </li>
            <li>started out using it dry, but quickly switched to shaving in the shower with it.</li>
            <li>That old one still works, but the blades needed to be replaced and the razor costs almost as much as the blades, (I have since found out on youtube how to sharpen them again on an old mirror).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I really like that I am able to use either wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>Finally, I wish the indicator on the front gave me a battery meter with remaining charge instead of just a flashing light that tells me when the battery is low.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d find myself needing to go over the same areas repeatedly, but maybe my strong masculine facial features extend to my stubble as well.</li>
            <li>My old razor with year and a half old blades still does a better job.</li>
            <li>But I miss my old Phillips which was loud, not recharchable, not resistant to water, but it was really fast shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, and although still not as close as a blade, it is better than I expected.</li>
            <li>The charge has held for two an a half weeks and is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>As far as the quality of the shave, it&#x27;s fairly good for me, as I have a thin beard.</li>
            <li>Ordered for my father to replace a very old Norelco Razor that needed new blades.  </li>
            <li>is very Soft, the battery has long duration, fast rechargeable and washable, that was exactly that I looking for me</li>
            <li>I use it dry every other day and it does a nice job, not as close as a regular razor, but still pretty close.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still doing fine, and I believe my shaving time is cut down by about a minute.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone that has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Close shave, quiet, long time between charges, easy to clean, wet or dry,comfortable grip.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend because he has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Related feature is that the back is hinged so I can clean out both areas while holding the razor normally.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps new batteries on their first charge last longer.</li>
            <li>It charges in about an hour, just like the product details say, and while I&#x27;m not sure exactly how long it actually lasts, I&#x27;d be willing to believe the promised 50 minutes, because he&#x27;s used it several days and the power is just as good after that one charge, no decrease in performance as the charge goes</li>
            <li>Quite satisfactory but not quite as good as a sharp razor blade though far less chance of drawing blood.</li>
            <li>It shaves very cleanly, gets into difficult spots around my mouth and the grip permits accurate detailing.  </li>
            <li>but this one gives me the closest and most comfortable shave of any of them (at least wet).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to be able to rinse it off without worries about getting the wrong part wet.  </li>
            <li>As of yet, it has not been any different and my satisfaction is pretty low.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the convenience of simply rinsing under hot water.</li>
            <li>Was I surprised!  </li>
            <li>IT WAS A BIT CHALLENGING GETTING THE GIFT, BUT AS USUAL AMAZON GOT IT TO ME JUST IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is a breeze - just open and rinse under hot water, then air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these shavers now for nearly 50 years!</li>
            <li>I really like Norelco in general and would recommend the AT830 to someone looking for a mid-level cordless razor.</li>
            <li>This one works fine but no advance warning when you need to recharge, unlike the previous versions.</li>
            <li>AT830 actually gave me a better shave than the fancier and more expensive SensoTouch.</li>
            <li>A fine replacement for my previous norelco.  </li>
            <li>, and I tried one extra test once we got our original razors back after week</li>
            <li>He uses it pretty regularly</li>
            <li>The only way to get a closer shave is with a multiple bladed razor, hot shaving cream and hot water.</li>
            <li>but it caught me by surprise the first time I went to plug it in and use it at the same time since it needed a charge boost.</li>
            <li>It is well worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li>This is the first one to actually work on my neck.</li>
            <li>and you can complete a shave!</li>
            <li>First I would say I was concerned about buying this shaver because of some of the low ratings.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another plus is that no expensive cleaning solutions are needed to maintain this model,  just push a button and the head folds open for you to rinse all the gunk and whiskers out!  </li>
            <li>The person I bought this for seemed to like it at first (a month or so) then went back to shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li>how low end this supposedly higher end shaver is.</li>
            <li>I was going to order the exact same model my husband uses because I like how well his shaves.</li>
            <li>My first shave was closer than a \\&quot;real\\&quot; shave, with no discomfort and VERY quiet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  My third Philips Norelco Aquatec razor has now joined the first two among the ranks of the non-functioning.</li>
            <li>This was my first, and last rotary shaver.</li>
            <li>I used a rotary razor many years ago but have been using a foil type razor for the past 30 years.</li>
            <li>So no more memory issues with NiCad or NiMh and lipo has better performance than either of those two.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Take the rotary cutters out of the head a couple times a year, soak them in alcohol, then put them back in, making sure that you put the cutters back in the same screens.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are other significant design flaws.  </li>
            <li>Other Norelcos that I have owned did not have any of these significant design</li>
            <li>When I got into the shower afterword and the hot water hit my face it actually burned where I had shaved.  </li>
            <li>the best.&lt;br /&gt;The razor has reduced the amount of redness I normally experience, but the shave is not that close, as compared to my 10 year old Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I run it over my neck in particular or how hard I press, there is always stubble remaining.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything that really sets it apart from the lower price units, especially the older ones that did not use li-ion batteries.</li>
            <li>the panasonic one was uncomfortable, it became hot after a minute of use (because of the friction) and the shaving wasnt even that good, recently I decided to buy yet another one, and since I missed the norelco so badly, i decided to get another onbe, this time a really wet/dry type, it was even better that the first norelco, smooth shave,</li>
            <li>While I could have repaired it easily I opted for a new razor as I was intrigued with the idea of using it wet and cleaning it with a wash and the total cost for blades and a new battery</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve gotta pull your skin pretty tight to get it to work right, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First use was clean and soft even if you rub against your face in opposite direction of hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;While I did struggle a bit in the neck area, it was due to my fear of getting cut..</li>
            <li>He also needed a new shaver thanks to a dying battery, so we both decided to buy a new model at the same time.  </li>
            <li>my old 7735X go after two weeks with the new models?  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;A coiled cord which is easier and neater - luckily my old coiled cord worked on the new razor so</li>
            <li>the old ones never died i just wanted new ones.</li>
            <li>It seemed that the foil shaver, even a cheap one, cuts closer and with less irritation than a rotary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>how well it would work on a thick beard, but for an average shadow it works great.</li>
            <li>I always shave wet and this gives me what I need to get the job done quickly and without being cut</li>
            <li>he usually had to shave every day with his old shaver, but for this one, he&#x27;s been able to go up to 2-3 days before even looking like he had a 5&#x27;oclock shadow.</li>
            <li>in the User&#x27;s Manual it is recommended that you DO NOT submerge this razor - despite its ability to be used wet or dry, and the fact that it is recommended that you clean it under running hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Love the short charging time and the long lasting battery power.</li>
            <li>The old Norelco razor he had was about 30 years old!</li>
            <li>My son absolutely loves this razor and it is the first electric razor he has owned, he said he will never go back to a regular razor again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;THis happens because first round of electric shave makes your skin so smooth that you don&#x27;t feel an even liitle effort in your second</li>
            <li>It has a rubber grip that makes it easy to handle, especially when using it while wet, or cleaning it under the faucet.  </li>
            <li>This should be able to cut any beard wet or dry.</li>
            <li>AT830 is similar to previous generations of Norelcos, but is better in some ways.</li>
            <li>I found it better to shave dry than wet</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get much use from the awkward to hold  trimmer or close shave under the nose, but an inexpensive trimmer can supplement this otherwise pleasant process.</li>
            <li>Kudos to Amazon on the 830 return and quick 810 shipping of now my current daily shaving buddy!</li>
            <li>I can only imagine that Norelco is trying to hold down the price, but an extra couple of dollars for a case would be nice.  </li>
            <li>He has always had Norelco&#x27;s &amp; they don&#x27;t wear out very often, so this one replaces a very old one, but it&#x27;s the same style &amp; brand.</li>
            <li>Quite quiet for an electric razor as well, and the ability to use it wet as well as dry is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>The rotary heads don&#x27;t have smart pivot, but they still flex enough to contour to your face.  </li>
            <li>blade\\&quot; as they say, it is certainly close enough considering you won&#x27;t need to drop any money on multi-blade cartridges ever again.  </li>
            <li>Although this electric razor is very good for the face area, I broke out with a really bad skin irritation</li>
            <li>It takes 5 times as long as my old norelco to disassemble, clean and put back together.  </li>
            <li>I use it every day, but there are so many models, it&#x27;s hard to choose one.  </li>
            <li>and I have not been able to find if there is a hard case for it.  </li>
            <li>The only difference between the two is the \\&quot;Smart Pivot\\&quot; system on the 830, and I&#x27;d read mixed reviews as to whether it really mattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I admit that I set a high standard for razors, since I normally use a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>My earlier model Norelco did not do this and instead had only a normal electrical plug, which fact I very much</li>
            <li>It shaves fairly closely and though it left a rash the first few times I used it, my skin is growing accustomed to the blades so there now is very little irratation.  </li>
            <li>had an older norelco shaver so this wasn&#x27;t a total ly new experience.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li>The razor was shipped very promptly, and delivery time was much quicker than expected.  </li>
            <li>The AT830 isn&#x27;t that inexpensive, it&#x27;s nearly $90.  </li>
            <li>Beware if you have coarsehair or sensitive</li>
            <li>The shave is very close without pulling on facial hairs, and the razor does not miss any hairs.  </li>
            <li>This is an old guy talking, don&#x27;t know how it will work with a young man&#x27;s iron bristles.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t, however, expect a shave anywhere near as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one to replace one I had for nearly 15 years.  </li>
            <li>The charge stays for a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>Well, it might have something to do with my old (also Phillips) shaver being -</li>
            <li>oh, around 10 years old - and never having replaced the heads -</li>
            <li>where I could really just go back in forth which is much easier than using my standard disposable razor.  </li>
            <li>purchased this razor from Amazon and was surprised to see &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34; on the box.</li>
            <li>Since I felt like I got over on the big box retailer I don&#x27;t really care for, I decided to keep the razor that they took a loss on as a trophy.</li>

            <li>my old Remington did.</li>
            <li>As some others have pointed out, the rotary heads have a bit of a problem on the upper lip, however you can get used to this, at which point there really isn&#x27;t much of a problem.</li>
            <li>I struggled ten minutes a shave and then noticed I&#x27;d missed whole tufts here and there.  </li>
            <li>and I am ready to send it back.</li>
            <li>My Lady out of nowhere remarked \\&quot;Wow the irritation on your neck has completely cleared up\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first waterproof electric razor and now that I using it, I wish I&#x27;d made the switch a long time ago.</li>
            <li>Then you only have to use a straight edge for perilous circumstances, i.e. job interview.</li>
            <li>the way my old one did.</li>
            <li>So far no complaints about the product.</li>
            <li>Bottom portion of the chin, moustache hair near to the nose , hairs 2 cmb below the ears.</li>
            <li>I was concerned about this at first, because unlike a lot of men who can whip thru a shave in 3 - 5 minutes, I seem to take almost twice as long.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only giving it a 1 star rating because it doesn&#x27;t really work on my face.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a trihead shaver to replace my old one.  </li>
            <li>Wahl Professional 8061 5-star Series Rechargeable Shaver ).  </li>
            <li>No case for traveling, however it fits into my old shavers case.  </li>
            <li>so I will continue to use my old cover.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used electric razors my whole life.</li>
            <li>It connects directly to AC power.</li>
            <li>Performance has improved over the Norelco rotary shavers of years ago--the brand Philips distributed in North America before the early 1980s.</li>
            <li>After using it for a couple of weeks, I found that I couldn&#x27;t get as close a shave as with my old 7735X model with the weakening battery.  </li>
            <li>the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon learning of the newer Aquatec models, a friend (who&#x27;s also a Norelco wet/dry fan)</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin and have used electric razors for 20 years.</li>
            <li>I have used a Norelco razor for 30 or 40 years with complete satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>then it is to keep it old school with razor and cream.</li>
            <li>the old one is gone</li>
            <li>Surprised it worked so well.  </li>
            <li>Now that is electric shaving bliss as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>So far this shaver isn&#x27;t living up to the adverts.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how ancient my old Norelco electric shaver had become (it&#x27;s probably 20 years old) until I purchased the Norelco AT830 w/Aquatec Electric Razor.</li>
            <li>Still have the old one as a backup in case.</li>
            <li>Direct quote: &amp;#34;It pivots!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Quiet and fast.</li>
            <li>This product is complete garbage, save yourself and find something else.</li>
            <li>REPLACED MY 10 YEAR OLD NORELCO -</li>
            <li>When I received this one, I was quite surprised with the ergonomic improvements and the reduced noise level that it operated at.</li>
            <li>Also, if you use this razor on soft areas (like your neck) it WILL razorburn you if you put the slightest pressure against your skin.  </li>
            <li>Husband said the razor doesn&#x27;t work as well as his old one that EXPIRED....</li>
            <li>It would have been three years old in August</li>
            <li>My old Norelco shavers lasted a lot longer than this one did.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>My first electric shaver 30 years ago was a Norelco that lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get a very close shave, especially on the neck.</li>
            <li>I got some abrasions on the sections of my shoulders near my neck.  </li>
            <li>carrying case so keep your old one -</li>
            <li>Gentile on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>old Norelco.</li>
            <li>- I don&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;rough or heavy beard&amp;#34;, really a light beard</li>
            <li>I like that is quiet, shaves very well.</li>
            <li>Does everything I wanted plus surprised me with battery life.</li>
            <li>It will be returned tomorrow and for $9 I will buy the *Battery Replacement Kit* which is sold here on Amazon or eBay and fix my old shaver.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s used Norelco for as long as we&#x27;ve been married.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also quicker to complete my shave.  </li>
            <li>and it feels a bit rougher against my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so it will completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li>so it will completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li>The PT730 is also much cheaper but looks and feel s the same.  </li>
            <li>Compared to what I had before it is a &#x27;WOW&#x27; factor</li>
            <li>Or at least be able to buy one.</li>
            <li>So as far as functionality goes it would rate a 5.  </li>
            <li>I frequently skip a day and even with a two-day beard, this Norelco does the job.</li>
            <li>It keeps a charge for a reasonable amount of time and after having dropped it, obviously accidentally, from a height of about 4</li>
            <li>Now I will have to order another set of the Norelco razor heads to use in the old Razor for myself..  </li>
            <li>Mine is about a year old and no complaints.</li>
            <li>My neck skin is really sensitive but with this electric razor I have no problems</li>
            <li>Very quiet and shaves very well.</li>
            <li>In the short time that I have been using this product, I find it to be almost as close a shave as a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>Replaced my old (really old, about 25 years)</li>
            <li>almost needed earplugs with the 25 year old Norelco).</li>
            <li>When my old Norelco was put to rest, I bought this newer model.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace my old Norelco  razor that was not holding its charge.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My husband replaced his old Norelco that he had for 10 years with this model.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how old the shaver was</li>
            <li>The razor is somewhat noisier than my old one.  </li>
            <li>As far as the price point, I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li>but they need to make some changes to get this razor up to the old Norelco standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Heavy and durable, not like some of the cheap lightweight shavers that I&#x27;ve bought before.  </li>
            <li>Cordless  Fast charging (After initial charge of course)  </li>
            <li>Charges fast and keeps the charge for several shaves.</li>
            <li>and I used to have an old model of philips</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m graduating from my old [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life lasts pretty long before a charge</li>
            <li>I when I got home I got rid of that old manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I when I got home I got rid of that old manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old Norelco&#x27;s battery was fading - had to start recharging once a week</li>
            <li>hope it maintains its action.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband to replace his old Norelco razor.</li>
            <li>This razor doesn&#x27;t have a closeness setting and doesn&#x27;t come with a case or stand, all features his old Norelco had.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this Norelco for nearly 2 years, no performance problems.</li>
            <li>i opened up the battery case and it was completely ruined with water damage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the \\&quot;Philips Norelco AT830\\&quot; for a few months, and it was purchased as a replacement for an earlier model which I thoroughly enjoyed using.</li>
            <li>The battery takes several hours to charge but is worth the time because they last forever.</li>
            <li>I figured there had to be some advances in the last few years, but there don&#x27;t seem to be many.  </li>
            <li>The battery is long lasting and charges up quickly.  </li>
            <li>When using a new shaving method, it generally takes a week to get use to it.  </li>
            <li>I do have to rinse the trimmer heads with hot water when I shave, and I remove them to let them dry when I&#x27;m finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>The older Norelco came with a hard travel case that won&#x27;t fit the AT830</li>
            <li>As with any new razor you have to utilize it enough for your body to adjust to the new cut.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth it to get AT830 and pay a little more since I&#x27;m not sure the AT730 works the jawline that closely.  </li>
            <li>thing is quiet, easy to maneuver, and leaves no irritation on black skin.  </li>
            <li>No longer needing to shave daily, I get away easily with charging it about once a week, or less.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it&#x27;s worth to pay additional $9 to get smart pivot (AT830).</li>
            <li>I have had it a few weeks now and am still on my original battey charge.</li>
            <li>You can use it wet with gel or dry and both give a very good, if not great shave.</li>
            <li>Most electrics say not to push too hard but pushing a little harder on the AT830 produces a slightly better shave - on my skull.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The battery life lasts for a very long time and it takes about an hour to get back to a full-charge when the low battery light goes on.</li>
            <li>above all, it seems nicks and, for the most part, razor burn are a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li>I do pop the head open and rinse the entire business end with hot water every day,</li>
            <li>However, there are only 9 blades on an HQ8 cutter versus 15 blades on an older HQ56 cutter.</li>
            <li>he is post op and is doing decently with his left hand all things considered.  </li>
            <li>So whilst not previously sold on electric shavers</li>
            <li>This was a gift for dad seeing that the one prior is older than I am.</li>
            <li>Larger print would help us older guys</li>
            <li>In the last six months of use, there have been no cuts, unlike my older model.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Decent shaver, only downside that doesn&#x27;t make sense is that you can&#x27;t shave while the charger is plugged in.</li>
            <li>Finally, $25 bucks a year to replace the blades plus the initial investment seem a small price for a shaver that does the job just as well if not better than most electrics and many blades.</li>
            <li>big upgrade from my last Norelco is the sink cleaning capability - turn the water on hot and hose it out (blade area and cavity).  </li>
            <li>They picked these particular models, they researched multiple brands and picked these!</li>
            <li>I wanted a decent mid line razor.</li>
            <li>When you first use it you may think it&#x27;s not powerful enough because there isn&#x27;t a feel of strong motor rotation of the blades compared to other shavers.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;full-charge in 1 hour\\&quot; is definitely a big step up from the normal 8 hours charging time of many models, current and past.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a highly rated Panasonic triple blade foil razor the last five or so years, and I don&#x27;t remember it ever working as well as this.</li>
            <li>Overall I highly recomend.</li>
            <li>well, no complaint, worth the money, especially if it last as long as my last one.</li>
            <li>Quiet and light weight, but no better than my older Norelco electric razor.</li>
            <li>so when my old one finally gave up the ghost, I went shopping for a new one.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that it performs better and causes less irritation when wet shaving.</li>
            <li>One of the things that I enjoy about this razor is that you can use it dry or use it wet (with shaving cream).</li>
            <li>buy me a round trip plane ticket, I will take one step off the plane, kick you in the balls as hard as I can and fly back home.  </li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I tried the last wet/dry model (the 8060X) with the fully exposed shaving heads attached to a single stalk.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the pivoting head on the 830 makes a huge difference or not</li>
            <li>After reading a few good and bad reviews I ended selecting this for a Christmas gift and now I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>This AT830 is at least the equal of my old one and probably better.  </li>
            <li>Not sure about not having a battery level indicator though it does have a recharge light.</li>
            <li>I find the cost reasonable as it&#x27;s predecessor lasted a long while</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I expected and I&#x27;ve had no issues with this model that would cause me to replace it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Drying after shave could be dificult, dont specified if you can let it wet after putting under hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cut is fairly close (depends on how thick your hair is) and I only needed minimal touch ups with a blade after using the shaver.</li>
            <li>And I do prefer a rotary blade electric shaver more than all the other electric shavers due to their overall comfort for shaving and the total ease of cleaning by just putting the open shaver under hot water after each shave.  </li>
            <li>However, a little more time will be spent cleaning the shaver.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my father and he has a little trouble with turning it on.&lt;br /&gt;Gives a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>This is a very good shaver, and priced inexpensively enough so that it isn&#x27;t nearly as painful to buy as some have been.</li>
            <li>On the other hand,in a completely dry environment, it cuts just as smooth as it would in (non-scalding) water</li>
            <li>, however I quickly discovered it is only a CORDLESS model - in other words</li>
            <li>It is amazingly quiet, and I can hardly tell it is working, as there is no effect at all on my skin, but like magic the beard hairs are gone after a swipe or two with the shaver.  </li>
            <li>He has only used the new one since receiving it,  </li>
            <li>I thought this would go away after a couple of weeks like the manual said (it takes several weeks for your skin to acclimate to a new razor)</li>
            <li>Just replaced the blades after several years - shaves like new again.</li>
            <li>Have only used this new one for a couple of days, but the quality still seems to be there, I swear by Norelco.  </li>
            <li>I finally took it apart after two months of use, and the blades/housings were like new, and had no buildup of hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this product new in package from a local vendor.</li>
            <li>Using shave gel really helped give me a closer shave than shaving dry</li>
            <li>When using it dry, it leaves my skin really dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros;&lt;br /&gt;-Sleek design&lt;</li>
            <li>Though it still feels odd to rinse an electric appliance immediately after use, such care does keep the blades and the stubble despository clean without electrocuting me.</li>
            <li>So much easier to dry shave with this</li>
            <li>and although the shave does not last as long a  raiser, but pretty close to it.</li>
            <li>I began using this product with shaving gel and water for the first few days before I went back to a full on dry shave.  </li>
            <li>When used with care, this model really does get close enough to approach the same results as a non-electric shave.  </li>
            <li>This razor was to replace my old 25 year old Norelco which I had the batteries replaced 5 times by a local battery repair shop.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does has only a \\&quot;battery charging\\&quot; and low battery indicator, not a gauge for how much charge is there.</li>
            <li>not, I used it everyday for 1, 2 almost 3 weeks before the low charge warning light came on.</li>
            <li>They all still use the same basic rotary blade sets...because they work really well.</li>
            <li>They sounded like they were not spinning fast enough for a proper shave.</li>
            <li>Not only does it not produce a reasonably close shave but produces irritation and rash even after several weeks of use.</li>
            <li>If you have a real heavy beard you will most likely have a heavier 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li>I hate shaving, this shaver does better than most.</li>
            <li>so glad I paid the little extra in the long run anyway...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had Braun shavers to this point in my life and all of them were very loud.  </li>
            <li>I have a full beard, so I only shave with the shaver on the sides of my cheeks to get rid of the few straggler hairs outside of the main beard.  </li>
            <li>I have a very heavy and tough beard, but very sensitive skin; which resulted in quickly dulling most electric razor blades and ruining their foils, and causing razor-burns to my skin in order to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li>[4/5]: The razor gets a four out of five because I feel it has two major flaws.</li>
            <li>I would have thought that there would have been major changes in technology in a 30 years.</li>
            <li>At first my skin would get extremely irritated when I used this, however, now I can use it with no</li>
            <li>I shaved with a blade for many years, but have tried several different electrics over the past year because I like the convenience of not having to stand in front of a bathroom mirror to shave.</li>
            <li>(01/10/2014) - Husband wants me to stress that there are 2 things he did that he thought will be useful to share - 1) since he switched from using a razor blade, he said at first your skin will burn and feel uncomfortable after the shave, but don&#x27;t give up, after 2-3 weeks, your skin will get use to it.</li>
            <li>It was kept clean, used only for dry shaves, charged regularly but not left</li>
            <li>The sideburns trimmer really doesn&#x27;t seem to do too much, but that&#x27;s been a common complaint with most of my Norelco razors.</li>
            <li>After a overnight charge the AT830 plowed through my thick, coarse, dense overgrowth only pausing for an occasional rinse under some warm running water with the lid popped.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think any electric razor will beat a &amp;#34;real razor.&amp;#34; But as I get older it really doesn&#x27;t matter if I have a little stubble, and besides it gives me the&lt;br</li>
            <li>Repair places are far and few between, and even if you do find one, it&#x27;s almost as much to \\&quot;repair\\&quot; as purchasinga new unit.</li>
            <li>While I found the shave to be quite close and the razor made quick work of my stubble, I&#x27;m not sure how much of this is due to the fact that the blades were new.  </li>
            <li>In the past I&#x27;ve always had to shave with an electric, then clean up the stray hairs with a razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting a fast very close dry shave, haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The main difference between this and the Panasonic that I mentioned earlier is that you  don&#x27;t need to do multiple passes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are so many electric razors out now, I know it&#x27;s a tough decision-</li>
            <li>only thing I miss is the digital display on the older model.</li>
            <li>For price of razor, why not include at least a cheap pouch to pack for travel?</li>
            <li>Husband is generally a blade man, but after a bit of getting used to it, he loves this Phillips Electric.  </li>
            <li>The improvements I found in my latest purchase: (1) Improvement in shape and fits the hand comfortably.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though it is listed as a wet and dry shaver, do not immerse it in water-use running water only over the heads and the brush to clean it.</li>
            <li>(you can readily feel that it is not a very close shave).</li>
            <li>only con, so far, would be that it does miss hairs when he&#x27;s shaving his \\&quot;neck-</li>
            <li>My husband still feels like it&#x27;s quite an upgrade from his last old razor, so, we&#x27;re happy!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It shaves the same as my 7 year old Norelco 7140XL.  </li>
            <li>The AT830 isn&#x27;t as sturdy or well made as the 2D, and it takes longer to charge it (5hrs per the book for a &#x27;complete&#x27; charge) with only a 50 minute charged shave time.  </li>
            <li>I recently replaced my 12 year old Norelco Razor with this Aquatec.</li>
            <li>but it was too bulky, loud, and still left me with irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 17 yr old son uses this regularly with no copmplaint, however.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been partial to a straight blade razor.</li>
            <li>I have even not expected that.</li>
            <li>razor is really quiet compared to the old one.</li>
            <li>I took my old 7735 out of retirement for one last shave.  </li>
            <li>but my beard is very aggressive and rough (shave 2</li>
            <li>I can barely feel it working, but boy does it ever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to my old plug in model.  </li>
            <li>This product definitely is not for everyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to a really close shave with a ProGlide razer and this doesn&#x27;t come remotely close.  </li>
            <li>It does not shave a close as my old screen razor, especially along the jaw line and on my neck.  </li>
            <li>only problem I had was when I was shaving near the bottom of my neck</li>
            <li>as the shelves were nearly bare</li>
            <li>If your man has a beard that he cannot remove completely, then this shaver is for definitely for him.  </li>
            <li>My old Norelco Reflex Plus Model 6863 LX that cost me $69 several years ago has: A: 5 level battery life indicator lights and B: If the battery does die while shaving you can just plug it in the wall and finish your shave.</li>
            <li>The only improvement over the old 7140xl is that this have a pivoting front/back motion added to it.</li>
            <li>Needed it to replace a 10 or 15 year old Norelco on its last legs that I dropped.and came a-part.</li>
            <li>I had an old Philips/Norelco for about 20 years and it finally gave out.</li>
            <li>I had to switch back to my old razor to finish the job.</li>
            <li>He said the way it pivots on his face is a big improvement over his old razor.</li>
            <li>Also I have tried three different shaving gels (for sensitive skin), none of which helped or improved closeness or rash development.</li>
            <li>So far I have charged it only once since it arrived</li>
            <li>I have been getting thus far, but only when using shave cream and water.</li>
            <li>Shaver works very well, as expected.</li>
            <li>In reviewing this product, I first provide a caveat - I&#x27;ve never used a cordless razor before as I have partial to the traditional blade and foam.</li>
            <li>Poor didn&#x27;t find the address then took to many days</li>
            <li>When I clean the unit with water the water seems to find places to hide and will run down my hand while shaving even though I have allowed it to dry for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>First of all, if you don&#x27;t want a bunch of details, just scroll down to the IN SUMMARY paragraph at the end!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I drip dry it, and will put blowdryer on high to force any remaining water in the cracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only charged twice since new and husband has been using it daily.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Norelco wet-or-dry razors, I experience far less skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s had it for less than a week now, but so far, he really likes it.</li>
            <li>It has been a long time since I bought a new electric, and advancements have been made.  </li>
            <li>This one removes hairs in places that the narrow neck models could not get to, like right under the nose.  </li>
            <li>not what i EXPECTED DOES does not give a clean shave does leaves face with facial hairs and rough face</li>
            <li>It is exactly what Norelco Should have evolved into given their previous line  of product.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>and I would have to go over areas multiple times for it to cut anything, while other trimmers work the first time.</li>
            <li>this model gives me an adequate shaved, no more.</li>
            <li>It seems to hold a charge longer than my past models and charges fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Despite having been a loyal customer in the past, my perception is the Philips Norelco are no longer producing a quality product.</li>
            <li>I like it every bit as much as the older ones, if not more.</li>
            <li>UPDATE, Don&#x27;t care for this Razor as much as I thought I did, takes forever to shave unless you shave everyday, Will not get the long ones unless you really work at it.</li>
            <li>I have owned 3 other Norelco razors and have found them to be very durable</li>
            <li>It to hard to clean.  </li>
            <li>Not exactly like a blade but very acceptable.  </li>
            <li>It shaves sufficiently close for my liking, although a guy with a lot of thick facial hair might always prefer a straight razor unless he&#x27;s willing to use an electric twice a day to keep up with his growth rate.  </li>
            <li>i am disappointed at phillips for discontinuing the rq12 heads as i have two shavers which i liked very much.</li>
            <li>Only dry,  The only down side is that Phillips has been cheap with the gadgetry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to replacing blades on a stick razor every week, the cost of buying a new electric shaver every two years and replacing the blades once is still less than the cost of a new stick blade every week.  </li>
            <li>It was like a trip down memory lane in that it was very much the same as the Norelco that I used in my youth.</li>
            <li>At first, I mistakenly felt that since this razor was so quiet that it was not powerful.  </li>
            <li>shave one time, with the grain\\&quot; people, with sensitive skin as well as coarse facial hair.  </li>
            <li>The shaver shaves as expected but there is no indicator as to how much of a charge is left on the batteries.</li>
            <li>none has ever &amp;#34;quit on me--&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve simply replaced each one when it was ten years old</li>
            <li>My old one (which was a similar price level back then)</li>
            <li>my 5 year old Norelco 7140 quit working so had to run to to the local Mart store and pick up a shaver before I left.....</li>
            <li>I spent several minutes working the Norelco over my skin, stretching the skin, going &#x27;against the grain&#x27;, circular and straight motions...</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for an earlier model that I left in a motel room, and the old model didn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;tilting&amp;#34; face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a Norelco, so pretty reliable - not great, but this is a average price razor so can&#x27;t expect it to perform like the $150 one - but shaves well, cleans well, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>A simple rinse and its done, add in that it gets a full charge in about an hour I am not sure what else it could offer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noted a steady decline in the quality and closeness of the shave delivered by newer models but, nevertheless, decided to try the AT830 and wet shaving.</li>
            <li>All our outlets are old, so few of them can support the weight of the square plug AND the razor, and plenty of outlets don&#x27;t have enough space above them anyway for the full height of the plugged dock and razor, like his old one, and even if there is room, it often blocks the other outlet.</li>
            <li>I cheated a little not using a pair of scissors first.</li>
            <li>major problem I have always had is that electric razors have never given me a close enough shave</li>
            <li>I have absolutely no complaints with this razor and would highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>I have absolutely no complaints with this razor and would highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>Yes they last a long time, cut your beard short and tight and clean up with water.  </li>
            <li>Out of the box, the initial charge only took a few minutes to get a level that allowed me to take a quick \\&quot;five minute\\&quot; test shave, which, since I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair to begin with, is about all I need anyways.  </li>
            <li>Very close shave, water proof, lasts a long time on a single charge.  </li>
            <li>so I really explored the various choices, and have bought other brands.</li>
            <li>You must take apart to clean and it is way to hard to put back together.  </li>
            <li>The closeness and time shaving were about the same, but I got less irritation with the AT830, particularly in the sensitive area below my chin.</li>
            <li>He has extremely sensitive skin and as such, has problems shaving with a traditional hand-held blade razor.  </li>
            <li>They are apparently intended to emulate the performance of foil shavers, handling short whiskers so that they are squarely cut.</li>
            <li>and I no longer have to run the shaver over my beard multiple times to get a barely acceptable shave as I did with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>it is what I would expect of an electric razor - not nearly as close as my old faithful Gillette Mach 3.</li>
            <li>This razor is several generations later, and I was surprised that the shave had actually improved quite a lot.</li>
            <li>so when the battery eventually becomes weak or unreliable you will still be able to shave with the PT730 for as long as you need to whereas the AT830 will probably need replacement.</li>
            <li>My first Remington electric died after a few years and couldn&#x27;t be recharged.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s terribly useful for lazy people like me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As was my complaint with the 1150x/40, the moment I powered on the AT830 and heard how quiet and slow moving the heads were, I had my doubts about how good the shave would be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old enough to have owned corded razors when battery operated were rare, and it was a bit of a pain to keep them plugged in while shaving, but my experience with battery razors has been that they grow so weak they become almost unusable, and you have to buy a new entire razor when only blade replacement should be required.</li>
            <li>To mow down a 3 or 4 day growth before a real shave with a blade.</li>
            <li>The quality standards of this company have really gone down.</li>
            <li>I was at first a little perturbed that they did not send a charging stand for it, but rather only a charging cord.</li>
            <li>Cleanup is a quick and simple rinse under hot water, no fussing with cumbersome cleaners and expensive cleaning solution refills.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looking at the inside of the blades you can see that the new one has only half of blades comparing to the old one.</li>
            <li>It took me half the time when compared to using my Gillette fusion proglide, and also much safer.</li>
            <li>My brother really like it a lot, less time in the restroom</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quiet: I found this razor much quieter than my previous three head razor (also a philips model) and my wife even noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>Less irritation and VERY close.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, what I do like about this Norelco as compared to the much pricier Panasonic is that it is cheaper, quieter and the maintenance cost is less.  </li>
            <li>As a black man with Pseudofolliculitis Barbae, I&#x27;m very cautious about any shaving product and over the years</li>
            <li>, so I&#x27;m shaving less real estate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have owned several razors over the and in general always had problems getting a lasting close shave.  </li>
            <li>I had been shaving with a Schick Quattro razor since the batteries on my old Norelco died, but the blades were not lasting as long as they used to-</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it I gave up after a few minutes and went back to a manual razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky this sucker didn&#x27;t explode on me.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new electric shaver without the unnecessary additions more commonly seen in the new brands.</li>
            <li>I get a close shave with this model in a single pass and can do a complete shave, around my goatee, in a matter of 10-15 seconds per day.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;new\\&quot; Norelco shavers that use the lithium batteries run at about half the speed (or less) of the original ones that used a pair of rechargeable AA batteries.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research before buying this product, because he has a very heavy beard,  and thought I was purchasing the right electric razor.</li>
            <li>After having a Norelco CoolSkin razor for so many years, it was a little weird at first to go back to an electric shaver without a lotion dispenser</li>
            <li>The last one, eight years old, still works but the battery just does not last as long as it use to.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a shame, because the trimmer helps in shaving under my nose and in a couple of other areas where the normal heads will not reach.</li>
            <li>I ordered a set of new blades at the same time, since I expected to need them in 3 months.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t shave as fast as the wet and dry Panasonic, but gives a close shave even though.</li>
            <li>Very close shave whether it is dry shave or wet shave, doesn&#x27;t burn skin or anything.</li>
            <li>I decided to get this because it is wet and dry capable, also can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li>Once that happened, I found that this machine shaved very quickly and efficiently, and seldom left any hair behind.</li>
            <li>This honestly cuts the same as my 15 year old norelco and no better or worse...</li>
            <li>I have only dry shaved with it now but it is very adaptable to wet shaves which I plan on doing.  </li>
            <li>I really gave it a chance and used it 8 different ways from dry to wet.  </li>
            <li>Only issue is the charging base which is too light to use easily.</li>
            <li>The smart pivot does the job around my neck and jaw area but as I said before it takes a few runs.  </li>
            <li>Found a little too much time needed to get a somewhat close shave.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this model to my friends, especially those having trouble getting a close shave with a foil type razor.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to spend the extra money for the waterproof feature, but it does work very well.</li>
            <li>I not only compared the new models to each other, but also compared these shaves to those Igot with my 7735X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Battery life is awesome.</li>

            <li> The razor works well, and shaves the best of all the electric razors I&#x27;ve used</li>

            <li> Very good on-line buying experience.</li>
            <li> This is a very good electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Very good razor.</li>
            <li> It would not hold a charge and it would not shave very good</li>
            <li> The razor is very good, but don&#x27;t bother replying to the email you will get from Philips Norelco asking you to review the razor on their website after you register it.</li>
            <li> Very good razor.</li>
            <li> a wonderful value and it works great.  </li>

            <li> It was a wise choice!</li>
            <li> This is a good razor for the value!</li>
            <li> If you can get it for a good price, buy it!</li>
            <li> , to recap, this was a very good razor with great convenience to use it both in-and-out of the shower or with-or-without shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> This is a real good product, does the job well, gives you a fairly close shave, not for those who want a &amp;#34;baby face&amp;#34; level.</li>
            <li> Was a treat for myself and very pleased with construction and performance!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Best of all it gives you a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has greatly simplified my morning routine.</li>
            <li> I opened the package with great anticipation that this would be the razor for me that I&#x27;d been waiting on.  </li>
            <li> great value for the money.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift, recipient loves it, that makes me happy,</li>
            <li> ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR GREAT SERVICE.</li>
            <li> Great shaver.</li>
            <li> Still, for every day shaving, its great.</li>
            <li> It works great.  </li>
            <li> It works great.  </li>
            <li> Works great in the shower</li>
            <li> Great product, i still using it.  </li>
            <li> Shaver works great and holds charge as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Nice trimmer and great quality product!</li>
            <li> Working great</li>
            <li> and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> The shave is not as great as I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> Another great advantage that the Philps Norelco line provides is mess-free shave.</li>
            <li> (Depending on the Shaver), which I think is a great perk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it holds a charge well, is water-proof so great in the shower.</li>
            <li> Great shaver that provides a close shave every time.</li>

            <li> Excellent and nice price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> The 3 heads however do a great job.  </li>
            <li> for a five day beard requires a lot of shaving on the neck.otherwise the waterproofing is great for cleaning and using shave gell..</li>
            <li> Now my face is adjusted it and it works great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a great product.</li>

            <li> A very nice shave.</li>
            <li> It shaves very nicely and he went for almost a month before it needed recharging.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  </li>
            <li> Very effective in the neck area.  </li>
            <li> The tilting head is very nice though for around the neck.</li>
            <li> a very nice close cut and no pulling.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice shaver.</li>
            <li> texture provides for a good grip (which is great if you use it in the shower) and it appears to be designed with simplicity in mind.</li>
            <li> He is very happy with it and said it works much better than any he has ever had before.</li>
            <li> The price was fair and delivery was great.  </li>
            <li> but it worked flawlessly for many years.</li>
            <li> I can best answer this when I have had more time to use and read.</li>
            <li> I love the way his face feels after he shaves and he&#x27;s very happy with this razor.</li>
            <li> For the best shave and system longevity, gotta keep those blades clean and lubricated!</li>
            <li> this razor has a wonderful close shave and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> but I never got a good shave either.  </li>
            <li> This is a good razor.</li>
            <li> Battery life seems fairly good.</li>
            <li> but then again it does charge fairly</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li> and they do a good job.  </li>
            <li> My skin is  smooth and the hair on my chin is cut perfectly without any irritation.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as good as the ones I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> You can buy a darned good Wahl sideburn trimmer for under $20.</li>

            <li> Good  </li>
            <li> I was not a stright line shaver and never had a good experience with razor blades</li>
            <li> so realistically I would say this is extreemly good.  </li>

            <li> Battery life is amazing and ergonomics are good.  </li>

            <li> Plus it make him look very nice and handsome.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with an electric razor all of my life, and this razor gives me the best and most comfortable shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I think the price was very reasonable and it works great!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought it as a hint to shave more!  </li>
            <li> I did ask (against my better judgement) for my wife to try it out in the shower on her legs (as a one time exception to our no razor sharing rule!).  </li>
            <li> It gives me even more of a close shave than the two others did!</li>
            <li> If you use a rotary and like that type of shave experience then you will like this shaver even more!</li>
            <li> but this is the top shaver in my book!</li>
            <li> Love the Norelco products!</li>
            <li> Glad I decided to get it for him this year for Christmas!</li>
            <li> and it is absolutely amazing.</li>

            <li> It was great to find an electric one that shaves him comfortably and closely.</li>
            <li> Amazing cut.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing.</li>
            <li> Razor gives a great, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> touch 2D man talk about a nice razor</li>
            <li> The head swivels as well, making for an nice close shave.</li>
            <li> Nice razor.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had this nice a shave for (well... ever I guess...</li>
            <li> Also, the fact that it comes with a charging cable as opposed to a stand was kind of a letdown.</li>
            <li> This shaver is good, comfortable to use and shave is almost as good as manual razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled this one doesn&#x27;t have that.</li>
            <li> This razor, the Philips Norelco AT830 PowerTouch Rechargeable Cordless Razor, charged up nicely, then I put it to the test.  </li>
            <li> in all, another nice electric razor from Philips Norelco.</li>
            <li> I did some research on the newer type of razors and decided the AT830 was the one I liked.  </li>
            <li> I must say that this thing gives a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> However, the quick-charging system and the aquatic feature are nice.</li>
            <li> +) razor with it&#x27;s own cleaning stand</li>
            <li> and I liked how it fits into my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I have always liked Norelco razors.  </li>
            <li> It dose a nice job.</li>
            <li> We kept the shaver as my husband did not want to bother with returning it as he liked the unit itself.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t own a stick razor, you may be going to work</li>
            <li> Good close shave and nice to be able to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for many years/ but the AT830 is superior to all of them/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice on the cheeks, but its unforgiving on the bread part.</li>
            <li> Nice product,  and it took no time for my face to get used to it.</li>
            <li> Now I own model AT830 since Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have my own model of this in Europe , so a Phillips product</li>
            <li> for day to day use it gives a nice shave.  </li>
            <li> It gives a nice close shave with minimum effort.</li>
            <li> The aquatic feature allows effective..</li>
            <li> cleaning after each shave under a faucet (warm water).</li>
            <li> Nice razor.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best yet.</li>
            <li> Nice close shave</li>
            <li> I have always liked the way the head can be washed and cleaned.</li>
            <li> He has a nice close shave and doesn&#x27;t have to put his health at risk to do that.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and think that a carrying case would have been a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice floating head on it and does what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> is thrilled.  </li>
            <li> After about two weeks of use have to say I am quite pleased with this unit, would recommend it and the price is fair</li>
            <li> The razor works, kind of.</li>
            <li> just kind of keep getting wider and wider over time until you have to get the razor or trimmer out and shape them again.  </li>
            <li> Even though I liked that razor a lot, I like this razor</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as nice as his</li>
            <li> As with most razors it just does not do a good job on my neck.  </li>
            <li> The AT830 can be  as effective as a razor, with added benefit of no nicks; but it can&#x27;t be treated as if it was a razor:</li>
            <li> Shaves nice and close.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get a good shave for three years or more.</li>
            <li> But it is nice to have a water-resistant shaver that you can wash vigorously without having to worry about drowning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note about all types of shavers and razors.</li>
            <li> but the pivots on each head are nice for around the neck.</li>
            <li> It was handy to have.</li>
            <li> IT shaves really close which is wonderful</li>
            <li> Nice to have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but not as good as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I recommend this shaver, it does a nice job and saves me some time in the mornings.</li>
            <li> If you honestly want to buy this, here is how to save money on your frustration:  </li>
            <li> Bought this for someone as a Christmas gift and he really liked it, unless he was just being nice to me.</li>
            <li> He feels he gets a nice close shave with it</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t own anything else.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco Wet/Dry about 6 years ago and really liked it.</li>
            <li> This one fit the bill very nicely.  </li>
            <li> The PowerTouch isn&#x27;t perfect, but it is very good for a shaver that costs less than $100.</li>
            <li> Very happy and highly</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever owned -- highly recommended.</li>
            <li> However, I am so impressed with this, at this price, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This model fit the bill...its perfect for a quick shave</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean, and a very good close shave.</li>
            <li> so I replaced the shaver heads after one year and the new heads are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Easy to shave with .. Would recommend this product to anyone.who appreciates a good quality product.</li>
            <li> Amazon is definitely the place to find good deals and review the best ratings on products and sellers (dealers).</li>
            <li> Good price and after 2 months going strong.</li>
            <li> Cleaning it is also very easy.</li>
            <li> but it is smooth--quick and very easy on my face.  </li>
            <li> And each day I can truthfully say I\\&quot;ve never had a better shave!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> This one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This unit is quite good, if not quite as smooth as the razor.  </li>
            <li> My wife of 53 years examines me Sunday in church where the light is good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco electric shavers since my early 20&#x27;s(about 45 years now) and this one is the best yet.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric razor that I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> It is still working perfectly, gives a good close shave, and I love the short time to fully charge it.  </li>
            <li> I also own the 9160XL, triple blade system and it is a lot better than this one.  </li>
            <li> I have always had Norelco&#x27;s shavers but this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric razor I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> For me, having a good rotary shaver in the shower is indispensable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well designed: a comfortably fashioned grip for a surprisingly lightweight unit.</li>
            <li> This razor is by far the best I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> This is By Far, the best Electric Razor</li>
            <li> Being able to wash out the head area is a nice feature, too.</li>
            <li> This is by far the easiest and best shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the reviews stated that it gives a perfect shave on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> She was pleasantly surprised that the heads performed flawlessly under the rush of water.  </li>
            <li> Its&#x27; got to be one of The best Norelco&#x27;s so far.</li>
            <li> This is my 5th or 6th Norelco &amp; by far the best.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this razor so far.  </li>
            <li> I took his old one which still works perfectly to shave my legs... and ladies..you should give it a try..</li>
            <li> price at Amazon was the best found after considerable effort shopping around.  </li>
            <li> But as far as delivery and packaging, everything was perfect.</li>
            <li> He is very happy with it so far.  </li>
            <li> Norelco has by far been the best of the bunch .</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very happy with this unit.  </li>
            <li> Good battery life and smooth cut.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very happy with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> Being able to rinse the head after shaving is very nice feature, keeping the razor always clean.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new shaver and is happy with its performance, but says it doesn&#x27;t shave curves and edges of his face and neck as well as a good old-fashioned razor.  </li>
            <li> This one has been the best, which one would expect as I keep them for many years and am generations ahead when I buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> I thought why to spend 35$ on new blades when I can buy for 70$ the newest and greatest top of the line shaver?&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives me a good shave, does not irritate my skin and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is a very fine shaver.</li>
            <li> the close shave is super nice!</li>
            <li> I use one of my old travel pouches which the razor fits in perfectly and a lid from one of cans of shaving gels which the razor is able to stand upright in.</li>
            <li> He has used Norelco shavers for years but his one has been the best yet-durable, comfortable with reasonably priced replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Either way, you&#x27;ll get the closest, most comfortable shave in the shower with a good, low-foam shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> This razor does a great job of not cutting the hair closely and also being able to burn your neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great, easy clean.</li>
            <li> The shave is great because of the quietness of the motor, the triple head configuration of the blades and the easy way to clean it to make every shave just like your first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This razor gives a great shave and I would have rated it higher if it came with a charging stand.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful unit, fast and meets expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say for the first time I haven&#x27;t had to do that with this product.</li>
            <li> so I am pretty happy about that.  </li>
            <li> This is the best shaver, giving the best shave I have ever experienced, wet or dry!  </li>
            <li> This new model is wonderful, cuts well, cleans easy.</li>
            <li> I purchased the AT830 from Amazon a couple of months ago, I had to be sold on an $80+ unit, and the Amazon reviewers painted a very accurate picture of the shaver&#x27;s pros and cons.  </li>
            <li> I have  very light  </li>
            <li> Use a very light touch.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> On the flip side, it is very comfortable for him to hold and manuever.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and a very comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Gives me a very smooth shave and lasts almost 2 weeks when I shave 5 Days a week.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable close shave.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to use and gives a rake shave.</li>
            <li> very comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable to use .  </li>
            <li> This shaver has made the transition to electric very smooth.</li>
            <li> Clean-up is as easy as rinsing the Norelco under warm water...</li>
            <li> This model seemed to be adequate and good for his needs.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice looking razor and easy to recharge.</li>
            <li> This did not turn out to be true as it takes a fair bit longer to make sure I get all the hair with this razor.</li>
            <li> very easy to clean, just rinse with water and it is done!</li>
            <li> Shaver works fine, I would however,  liked to have the option of a stand.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this model as it leaves a very smooth skin, is light weight, and fits the hand like an old friend.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Buy the way my 650 tx still works perfect except I only get two shaves on a charge.</li>
            <li> If the battery lasts it will be outstanding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many electric (and analogue) razors in my life.</li>
            <li> Great item fast shipping five stars</li>
            <li> The razor ran quietly, as many had said, and I never got razor burn or anything like that,</li>
            <li> today in hopes of getting better results...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned better norelco shavers before.</li>
            <li> The AT-830 is ok.  </li>
            <li> I have several models including the Spectra 8894XL James Bond Razor which in my opinion is best Norelco has ever made!</li>
            <li> In my opinion this razor shaves better than the Senso Touch 3D.</li>
            <li> It is one of the better Norelcoes that I have owned</li>
            <li> If you want all the bells and whistles, i.e., LED displays, battery life indicators, stands, etc., you&#x27;ll have to pay more for a higher-end model.</li>
            <li> I have used a number of Norelco shavers over the last 40+ years and this one is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Giving it time to my face to get use to an electric shaver is a must to be able to compare the type of shave that this unit can give.</li>
            <li> besides gauging for travel, i would have to charge just to make sure since i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s 80%, 70%, just when it&#x27;s 100% or 15%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for the price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very happy to be getting a smooth shave again without the irritation from the old Norelco XL____</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my 3rd norelco razor and its the best of all.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> The trimmers are just ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will be a work horse like the others.</li>
            <li> , and that&#x27;s a much better shaver, but it&#x27;s also a lot pricier.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s electric razor finally broke, so I researched the best replacement option, and settled on this one.</li>
            <li> , I LOVE THE CHARGING CORD</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;Always have used an Phillips shaver, and have been satisfied.</li>
            <li> As they rang it up, the price showed $30 MORE than the tag in the case.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a pop-up trimmer on the AT830, but since it&#x27;s otherwise just &#x27;OK&#x27; and costs almost ninety dollars, you may want to continue looking.  </li>
            <li> Still underwhelmed, but it may work better on a face than it does on legs too.  </li>
            <li> Still underwhelmed, but it may work better on a face than it does on legs too.  </li>
            <li> He is able to run it under the water, and it holds a charge.</li>
            <li> providing a comfortably close shave!  </li>
            <li> Got it for myself, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco electric razor for many years and I like its quality and ease of shaving of Phillips products.</li>
            <li> I like this much better.  </li>
            <li> but now he tell me he \\&quot;love it\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco for 30+ years and they just keep gettin better  </li>
            <li> better.  </li>
            <li> But, this razor is a quality product and a good value and would probably be worth giving a try for most people.</li>
            <li> and I love using it to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to see that Norelco is keeping up the quality.  </li>
            <li> Most of the trimmers have difficulty in reaching all the areas.</li>
            <li> I have owned Norelco Razors for many years.</li>
            <li> will say that I get a better shave with the Bran--closer, quicker, and with no irritation.</li>
            <li> The pivot feature of the shaver&#x27;s head is probably more helpful than realized.  </li>
            <li> I suspect, too, that most users would get a lot more than 5 or 6 shaves out of every charge.  </li>
            <li> Tried using in shower, did ok but prefer to use with electric shave.</li>
            <li> I need to shave every day, but my face can&#x27;t handle more than two or three days in a row with this shaver before the irritation becomes unbearable.  </li>
            <li> Before this I had a Remington trihead from Walgreens for $40 that was much better than this one.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my Norelco wet/dry shaver glides across my face when used with soap.  </li>
            <li> I would like Norelco&#x27;s razors even more if they incorporated a replaceable battery.  </li>
            <li> Not any more.</li>
            <li> Shave quality with model 6948XL is marginal, although it is better than one got with Norelco rotaries years ago.</li>
            <li> began using Remington electrics years ago, when they were the most reliable units of the day.</li>
            <li> The 810, however, might be OK for anyone with a beard that&#x27;s not so fussy.  </li>
            <li> It takes so many passes to get</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razors my entire life and this one is the best yet.  </li>
            <li> Could not ask for a better electric razor for the price.</li>
            <li> Donot miss this deal, you will love it</li>
            <li> and I love the way it works on moist skin</li>
            <li> more cuts and nicks.</li>
            <li> and ive been using this for more than 6month</li>
            <li> and i love it.  </li>
            <li> I then tried using a safety razor, but this Norelco works out so much better than either of the 2 options.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but doesn&#x27;t get as close of a shave as I would like.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> Great product, my husband does like it very mcuh.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is the second best razor ever made by Norelco.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for getting through a beard or more than 3 days of not shaving but</li>
            <li> doesnt shave as close as i like but OK</li>
            <li> No convenience in this except for more profits for norelco top execs.  </li>
            <li> Great Product as I have used straight razor blades all my life</li>
            <li> I Love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Listening to and reading all the advertising out there, I thought I&#x27;d have to spend more</li>
            <li> Always pleased with how well they work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> tried a Panasonic foil electric and like the Norelco better.  </li>
            <li> Works okay, but it does irritate my face.</li>
            <li> The battery carries many days of charge.</li>
            <li> Based on those 2 factors, I only rate this shaver 3 stars at best.  </li>
            <li> For the price I paid for it, you&#x27;d expect the trimmer to be top notch.  </li>
            <li> It does take some time to get use to an electric razor but over all I would say it is okay.</li>
            <li> Out of the three prior Norelco shavers he has owned, this is the best.</li>
            <li> My son says that the razor is so much better than the one he had.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are many things about this razor that I like, but they are mostly things that do with cosmetics -- not functionality.</li>
            <li> Looks like a good and useful tool.</li>
            <li> Quietness striking.</li>
            <li> , there is no longer an option to insert Nivea shaving gel packets, but the added clippers for trimming more than make up for its loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product more than meets is description and expectations.</li>
            <li> Love the wet/dry.</li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> , however, it has been more than 3 weeks and every time I use this razor on my neck, I look like I caught some sort of infectious disease because my skin gets inflamed and puffy in columnar streaks.  </li>
            <li> does excelent job of shaving my face ,much better than blade type</li>
            <li> so I use more power.  </li>
            <li> He said he was very happy with the razor and uses it regularly.</li>
            <li> It provides a slightly better ergonomics than most.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;++ More substantial to hold than the SensoTouch series</li>
            <li> Longer battery life than many SensoTouch models&lt;</li>
            <li> Alternatives like the 1150 offer more value with more features</li>
            <li> For those reasons, I think it&#x27;s the best compromise among the various PN razors in this</li>
            <li> and they can cut the skin more than this rotary</li>
            <li> most users, models like the AT810 will satisfy them.  </li>
            <li> Philips Norelco and love it to pieces...have been using it for a year plus and have 0 complaints.  </li>
            <li> But is ok for day to day use.</li>
            <li> Either your face or your technique begins to adapt and it gets better after a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> My husband is well pleased.</li>
            <li> Buy it, you\\&quot;ll love it.</li>
            <li> However, since it is a wet/dry razor, there is more rubber around the front.  </li>
            <li> which will always give you a better shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Three heads work more efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Before buying this shaver, I read as many reviews as I could find.  </li>
            <li> The price appealed to me and the reviews were okay.</li>
            <li> Have had Norelco razors for many years.</li>
            <li> The clippers on the back is great for sideburns and thinning out!</li>
            <li> It is OK for a teenager.</li>
            <li> I do not like that you cannot use it plugged, but the battery lasts more than one week, so it is acceptable for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for over forty years now and have enjoyed them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no shave indicator on it that shows how many shaves you can get before recharging the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;The motor</li>
            <li> /&gt;In case Norelco is looking at the reviews, start making them of better quality products and people will buy more of your products.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this razor.  </li>
            <li> Some great others, not so much.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m sure I can pack it on an extended getaway sans</li>
            <li> It was also better made.</li>
            <li> Best shaves that I&#x27;ve had in the last 3 years!</li>
            <li> The convenience of being able to shave while driving to work is phenomenal too.</li>
            <li> they may make noise more than rotaries but they will give you a closer shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more convenient than the Norelco it replaced (the one with the built in Nivea lotion dispenser) but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as it did.</li>
            <li> The Norelco should be used in a circular motion across the skin, whereas the Panasonic is used in more of an upstroke/downstroke way.  </li>
            <li> This is the series I would most recommend for the value to performance.</li>
            <li> and I love the fact of being able to use a gel.  </li>
            <li> Not so with this cheap piece of @#$#!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> importantly of all is the shaving result and this shaver, which uses the &amp;#34;lift and cut&amp;#34; design, produces a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> However when I went to order it, Amazon showed me this &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; model that&#x27;s supposed to be better and replaces the model my husband uses.</li>
            <li> I have had many, many Norelco razors.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if I had sprung for the healthy priced 3D it would have.</li>
            <li> One more thing.</li>
            <li> If you listen to the radio or music while showering you will love this one.</li>
            <li> I have used a Norelco electric razor for many years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of electric razors over the years (mostly Norelco).</li>
            <li> He says the more you use it the better it works, as it kinda conforms to your face.  </li>
            <li> But it will give you one more shave or so at the point</li>
            <li> so it is ok unless you are out traveling.</li>
            <li> Love the Dual/Precision heads.  </li>
            <li> Seemed like it took many passes to do the job.  </li>
            <li> I think the electric razors of 15-20 years ago were better.  </li>
            <li> My latest Remington got</li>
            <li> The shave is excellent and it only takes an hour to charge.</li>
            <li> The Remington shaver was OK</li>
            <li> When I finally decided the Philips Norelco was best for the Money I had another decision to make, which model?</li>
            <li> It leaves his face so nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Review of features found this to be the most affordable model with a trimmer attached.</li>
            <li> I use it more than my manual razor.</li>
            <li> Shave more often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using Panasonic foil shavers for many years, never, ever had a problem with irritation.</li>
            <li> Norelco makes a top quality product and this is one of them.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> love It.</li>
            <li> how many passes I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco triple head shavers now for many years</li>
            <li> After all is said &amp; done, you&#x27;ll be clean-shaven more often than you&#x27;ve ever been before.</li>
            <li> I have used this series of Norelco shavers for more than a decade (or perhaps two or three).  </li>
            <li> However, he does use it for under the chin area, and is pleased with the performance.  </li>
            <li> We order so many things from Amazon that I would just like to tell them \\&quot;thank you!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Love the product and would recommend.</li>
            <li> smooth shave, easy to clean, great price</li>
            <li> to be truthful</li>
            <li> Produces more heat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even quieter than they used to be, is lighter, and is narrower and fits better in your hand.</li>
            <li> Hubby has had a Norelco Razor for many years.  </li>
            <li> This model has the heads that adjust better to follow the curves of my face.  </li>
            <li> Automatic shut-off is one more thing in life that you don&#x27;t have to pay attention to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The tilting head might help, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that it gives me a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to keep moving the razor over the skin surface many, many times before the hair probably just gives up and falls off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ok with that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I received the shaver, I was initially pleased with the closeness of the shave that could be achieved using it with gel.  </li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This is an OK razor.  </li>
            <li> but for now it&#x27;s my shaving choice for sure.</li>
            <li> When this happens (always after the warranty), you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REPLACE THE RECHARGABLE BATTERY.</li>
            <li> Phillips does this on their Sonic toothbrushes as well, so just devide your cost of so many uses by the cost of the unit</li>
            <li> The shave has always been a comprise when compared to a blade, to my suprise not any more.</li>
            <li> Now if I could only purchase a charging stand and a travel case, it would be a PERFECT shaver.</li>
            <li> The noise from motor is ok to use.</li>
            <li> Thought it would work better, name brand and the cost of it.</li>
            <li> They state yearly, but its more like quarterly.</li>
            <li> I also love that I can use it in the shower and my wife loves how my face feels when I use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been more than satisfied with all of them.  </li>
            <li> In a nutshell, I love this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love that I can rinse it under water...</li>
            <li> I got much better shave with a razor.  </li>
            <li> I get even more irritation.</li>
            <li> This is not sufficient reason however not to buy as the shave is outstanding.</li>
            <li> this is the best shave I have ever had with the possible exception of a barber shaver.</li>
            <li> My Philips razor had seen better days.  </li>
            <li> Frankly, I wish I had purchased a top-of-the-line for more money.</li>
            <li> I confess that I have been quite pleased with the closeness of shave</li>
            <li> I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Charged up good and fast, works great, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;During that time I kept using it and with experience I kept getting better shaves.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> I use an electric pre-shave now that that stands my beard up and allows me to get an even better shave.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> I use an electric pre-shave now that that stands my beard up and allows me to get an even better shave.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> I got what i was looking for and love it</li>
            <li> You supposedly get 50 minutes of shaving from one charge, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m getting more.  </li>
            <li> For the first couple of weeks, maybe the first month,  it was the best electric shaver I&#x27;d ever had.</li>
            <li> I wish it had more visible power.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I actually love this shaver.</li>
            <li> (I stuck with it for 10 months, but it never got any better).  </li>
            <li> This is why most shaver manufacturers give you a 30 or 45 day trial period.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my head (bald) and most people think I use a blade.</li>
            <li> He is satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> love the ability to use it in the shower or with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I had owned a Norelco before, many years ago.</li>
            <li> It was okay</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> - More subdued matte silver/gray color scheme is unique, nice looking  </li>
            <li> If you are in need of a quick shave and have forgotten to charge the unit, a quick five minute charge will give you two to three minutes of use - which is great if you are just touching up or getting rid of some shadow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first shave with it was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I thought it was a very comfortable shave, and would have given it an excellent rating if the cutters were just a little more effective.  </li>
            <li> He was very pleased and felt it was easy to use, even with his significant tremor.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the original version of this from 20+ years ago!</li>
            <li> You can save money by getting a still-available older model like Norelco&#x27;s 7310 which is a great deal for the cost.</li>
            <li> Nice clean shave.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to spend more than this on a shaver -- this one has everything you&#x27;ll need, and at a pretty good price.</li>
            <li> I had great hopes for this older style Norelco shaver</li>
            <li> So nice to see a clean face.</li>
            <li> All told though I&#x27;m happy with this particular razor.</li>
            <li> Gives him a nice clean shave and he likes the fact that he can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> The thing I&#x27;ve been most impressed with is I have experienced no irritation switching back from non-electric to electric (and I have always had sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li> Pretty good</li>
            <li> This electric razor does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> I used it consistently for a good three weeks, and</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor and it is a good one.</li>
            <li> Pretty good getting 3 months of use without recharging.</li>
            <li> This is perfect if you need to throw it in your bag for a business trip or long weekend and don&#x27;t want to worry about battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great razor better than a blade by far.  </li>
            <li> Quick to charge and a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> Does a great job, its easy to clean, light weight and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> screen - super nice.  </li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s nice to have a quick shave, tho</li>
            <li> It cleans up easily and holds a charge for many uses.  </li>
            <li> is easy and I was glad that this model also had the trimmer on it...</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotating heads also allow you to more easily shave the neck and adam&#x27;s apple area, so I recommend this unit because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this razor although not as good as a straight edge</li>
            <li> This provides a good shave, it is quick, and the device is comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Looks pretty cool and feels great in the hand as well.  </li>
            <li> Being able to use it in a wet environment is an excellent advantage.</li>
            <li> This is a good, solid razor that gives a good shave.</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to clean which is a plus to.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> so it is very easy to keep clean</li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> In addition it is very easy to clean as you can run the blades under water.</li>
            <li> but I got an excellent shave the first time I used my new AT830..  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving is comfortable even when you don&#x27;t use foam or gel (although it&#x27;s very comfortable with foam).</li>
            <li> The razor will work fine, and you will be pleased, UNTIL tha battery dies.</li>
            <li> I got this to be able to use in the shower and it works fine.  </li>
            <li> I have large hands and feels feel&#x27;s  good in my hand.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get used to being able to rinse the shaver to clean it, but is seems to be ok to do that.</li>
            <li> Some other awesome things about this razor are that it&#x27;s easy to clean, water proof, and has amazing battery life.</li>
            <li> This is a very good basic electric razor.  </li>
            <li> After using this AT830 for the first time I must say it works great - a clean, comfortable shave .</li>
            <li> That said, the AT830 has a wonderful feature set and seemed to fit my requirements (the product description says &amp;#34;cord/cordless operation&amp;#34;) and the price was about what I have paid before for a high end model.  </li>
            <li> PowerTouch delivers one of the closest and most comfortable shaves of any shaver in this price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning a rotary shaver appears more important than cleaning a foil shaver.</li>
            <li> Worked OK at first, but the longer I own it</li>
            <li> so far great product would recomend tis razor to anybody</li>
            <li> it feels as close as a blade, but much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Its best to use these wet with shaving gel.</li>
            <li> After I was satisfied with the smooth treatment the AT830 had given my face</li>
            <li> Battery life is great so far.</li>
            <li> So far it has been a great razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Replaced a 8 year old Norelco 7885XL and this model works great.</li>
            <li> I downgraded the razor to a four because the razor should have come with a container of some sorts that would allow it to travel in a shaving kit without the heads becoming exposed to damage.  </li>
            <li> I think it gives a more comfortable and closer shave when used that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, good choice for the price listed here (which is MUCH lower than the MSRP/sale price at the discount retailer based in Arkansas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaver head replacement is recommended for once very 12 months for optimum performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> AT830 is good, if not quite as close as one gets from skillful use of a straight razor.</li>
            <li> Husband really likes thr razor so it must be good.</li>
            <li> It is very close to being as good as a safety razor.</li>
            <li> The good news is that every time I buy a new one, it&#x27;s gotten significantly better than the one I owned before.</li>
            <li> have spent years using a blade, and while I strongly dislike the cost of the replacement blades, the shave is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have purposely waited nearly a month before writing this review so I could give this razor a good trial, and I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with it from the very first shave.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to clean and I enjoy wet/dry option.  </li>
            <li> This razor gives me a nice, close shave without any skin irritation, and did so right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> Very Nice razor so far.  </li>
            <li> My husbands razor just stopped working the other day and it was perfect timing in receiving this product to review.  </li>
            <li> First two items I mentioned should be used more in Your promotions of this product!</li>
            <li> The 800 series is the most feature rich of Norelco&#x27;s Mid-tier.</li>
            <li> There is a significant technological leap from my latest shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot lighter and easy to pack in a toiletry bag for travel.</li>
            <li> Easy to rinse out the chopped hairs making cleaning a snap.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it can be easily cleaned by running tap water over it.</li>

            <li> Clean shave, enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li> And with Amazon returns are painfully easy</li>
            <li> The beard/sideburn trimmer has an especially cheap feel to it, more likely to leave you with razor burn.</li>
            <li> This shaver is perfect for people like him who needs to shave fast but don&#x27;t make time for the old shaving cream and razor approach.</li>
            <li> Easy to wash out too.  </li>
            <li> The battery easily lasts over a week.  </li>
            <li> and I can easily say that It&#x27;s working like a charm.</li>
            <li> Being able to wash it off saves a ton of effort keeping it clean.</li>
            <li> To be honest, the difference in closeness was greater for me, but I really do have a tougher beard.  </li>
            <li> He also states that it is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Gives a clean shave but takes a bit more time compared to a razor blade.</li>
            <li> This product was easy to use with my non-dominate arm and gave me a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Another advantage is that it can be cleaned easily just by holding it under the faucet.</li>
            <li> I also have a deep chin dimple that most razors don&#x27;t handle, but this one does great.</li>

            <li> - it&#x27;s perfect - don&#x27;t get me wrong, you can use this in place of your razor, but you have to be happy with it&#x27;s performance.  </li>
            <li> He travels a lot for work, so it is also easy to charge up and take with him on the go.</li>
            <li> It is waterproof, allowing easy shaving in the</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of those for years, and the Wahl seems to do a very adequate job without irritation.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;++ Water resistant body allows for easy shower use&lt;br</li>

            <li> Easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> overall I am happy as it definitely better than my braun razor.</li>
            <li> This razor is still going strong.</li>
            <li> So far so good, works better than the one I had</li>
            <li> AT810 offers a good shave at a better value.  </li>
            <li> I strongly suggest it.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I charged it when I bought it almost two months ago, and it is still running strong on that charge.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend t to anyone in need of a good razor.</li>
            <li> I have used Philips for a long time, this is my 4th razor in 20 years, so in my experience they are very good.</li>
            <li> I run hot water over the shave head&#x27;s blades first, to give it a nice warm and softening effect.</li>
            <li> Replaced an old Norelco electric razor with this one and my husband was thrilled with it!</li>
            <li> This is true with a single-blade razor, but I was using a multi-blade razor - and although I am satisfied, after 21 days I have learned it will never replace my multi-blade razor for closeness of shave.  </li>
            <li> the plus side, the shaver is comfortable on the skin and in the hand and is a nice addition to Philips Norelco&#x27;s line of superior shavers, just not, in my opinion, equal to the 1290.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure that I got full value for what I paid.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more comfortable, near zero razor burn and is probably about as close as you can get (no pun intended) to a good blade setup.</li>
            <li> but this new shaver is the best so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing high end three head rotary electrics for over 20 years now, and this one has been by far, the best of the lot.</li>
            <li> Being new, it gives a good shave either way.</li>
            <li> using the budget line models is just fine for my purposes.</li>
            <li> bye fine.  </li>
            <li> fine shaver for the price</li>
            <li> Fine product.  </li>
            <li> It arrived in fine shape and on time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The newer HQ8 heads each have two segments with fine, circular holes that are positioned toward the inside of a 3-head assembly.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted many, many years</li>
            <li> the reality is that if you have a marginal beard it will probably work fine for you ...</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, easy to clean and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> Razor works fine</li>
            <li> I tried foaming hand soap in a pump container and it works fine without any skin reaction.  </li>
            <li> (legs, arms &amp; whatnot): Works fine as an arm and leg shaver.</li>
            <li> My previous shaver was the best, it had longer shaving time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this razor, it is very convenient and shaves pretty close.</li>
            <li> It does that just fine.  </li>
            <li> Still, it works fine.</li>
            <li> you are already a Norelco user and that brand works for you, fine.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco AT830 works fine.</li>
            <li> The shaver was fine, The problem was, it irrItated my skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get fine hairs on my neck.</li>
            <li> One of the better features is the quick charge function.</li>
            <li> I will work OK for that quick shave when you are on the go and don&#x27;t have time for anything else.</li>
            <li> The battery seems to charge quickly, and although I haven&#x27;t tried to see how many shaves</li>
            <li> so I am not surprised it is so good and so reliable!</li>
            <li> Easy to use easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and light weight and stores easily.</li>
            <li> Great razor, quiet, easy to hold and use, does a fine job on your beard, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I got the AT830 as a Xmas gift from my wife and was real excited until after the first shave.</li>
            <li> This gives a great shave, very easy to clean, and when used with foam it delivers a close and comfortable wet shave.</li>
            <li> No burn and very good shave in the shower wet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, After buying it and using it for about a month, It does shave very good and closer than my older Norelco Spectra 8891XL with new blades</li>
            <li> A huge part of this is the fact that its waterproof (as it should be) which allows it to be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> a revelation!&lt;br /&gt;Philips company made huge steps forward.</li>
            <li> Great electric razor waterproof works as expected on face works better on scalp</li>
            <li> It delivers a close comfortable shave without the razor burn.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy shaving with this razor.</li>
            <li> : The razor gets a four out of five for appearance because of its smooth sleek no frills look.</li>
            <li> I had to go over my face lightly with a blade razor.  </li>
            <li> After just a few weeks, I can state that this is the best shave I have ever received with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Probably would opt for a more powerful or thinner shaver heads.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean by rinsing in lukewarm  water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comfortable smooth and lives up to hype</li>
            <li> It feels sturdy, and is comfortable to grip.  </li>
            <li> I use cheap shaving creme and even hair conditioner a couple times in an emergency and it delivers a smooth shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> , I would recommend this shaver to all...best price, cheap shipping and a close shave.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also comfortable to hold and lightweight.</li>
            <li> This is important as the shaver cannot be used when plugged in.  </li>
            <li> easy to handle a clean shave also easy to clean after you shave</li>
            <li> Great for a begining teen shaver</li>

            <li> must  trying toget away cheap product,ask said made in china inferior product and workmanship tp Netherlands made</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so smooth and conforming without irritation, and gives a remarkably smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I decided to go cheap and buy this razor.  </li>
            <li> I can attest his face is smooth.  </li>
            <li> Close, no irritation, smooth, definatly reccomend.</li>
            <li> But once everything is in order, it should be quite the smooth</li>
            <li> For once, my husband read the instructions and obediently stick with it for 3 weeks of continual use.</li>
            <li> It has a couple of LED type light for charging, etc.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to keep clean and store.</li>

            <li> Comfortable close shave.</li>
            <li> She loves my smooth skin after a shave.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;++ Smooth operation</li>
            <li> being said - this is great for someone that is starting out with electric razors.  </li>
            <li> My sons liked theirs so much I got one for my husband.</li>
            <li> ..... lightweight and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Light weight, seems to be made cheaply</li>
            <li> Has the trimmer always available.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> though I had been using a Philips Norelco electric razor it still took about 2 weeks for me to get used to this one, but eventually it does deliver a close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Despite the light the AT830 still gave me a shave.</li>
            <li> Fourth, the rubber grip is great if you are a shower shaver.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> everything I have seen Philips touch has gone to cheap garbage.</li>
            <li> But a great brand, cut corners and costs and sell it pretending it to be the same thing.</li>
            <li> What I have found is that hair on my beard is normally straight out on day two, resulting in a nice close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is almost as smooth as a razor.  </li>
            <li> He wasn&#x27;t sure if he wanted a cordless-he thought it might not be as powerful as the corded one.  </li>
            <li> The noise level is a wisper, the shave is extreemly comfortable and the efficiency of the shave is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great for the price especially.</li>
            <li> The razor was comfortable in my hand</li>
            <li> It is a very convinient  and effective product.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the shave.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I like my face to be as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, and this is probably the closest I&#x27;ve ever got to that with any electric that I&#x27;ve ever owned..</li>
            <li> Also, I ordered from Amazon and got free shipping with shaver deleivered in two work days.  </li>
            <li> shave itself is smooth and even, although not as close as a blade of course.</li>
            <li> and nick free is better than in the shower, not QUITE as close a shave as the Venus ladies razor but good enough and a lot faster..</li>
            <li> Shaves well and extremely smoothly.  </li>
            <li> He says it is smooth and comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> shave is smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That forever to get smooth face</li>
            <li> Its comfortable, ergonomically and on your skin.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to keep clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all of that, the battery life on this thing is fantastic.</li>
            <li> and my face is fantastically smooth</li>
            <li> Gives me a smooth shave every morning.</li>
            <li> The shave is relatively smooth, but not as smooth as a foil shaver.  </li>
            <li> easy clean up.</li>
            <li> I have light hair and light whiskers.</li>
            <li> easy clean.</li>
            <li> That being said, I also have light colored hair.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable to use and shaves well leaving my face smooth.</li>
            <li> Rinsing it under the faucet makes it really easy to clean and saves time in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the smooth shave I get with this razor and the fact that you can use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Cheap replacement heads.</li>
            <li> This Norelco gives me an incredibly close shave with absolutely no irritation.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy shaving in the shower as it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I am not stupid.  </li>
            <li> It is not as good at shaving as my old worn out razor.</li>
            <li> Philips currently offers models with good performance at premium, intermediate and value prices.</li>
            <li> Frankly I liked my old razor better</li>
            <li> far, so good.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as I thought, and the old one works better/</li>
            <li> It gives a good close shave quicker than the old razor that it replaced.  </li>
            <li> The shave isn&#x27;t as close as a manual razor but does a good enough job where I feel I am respectable in appearance.  </li>
            <li> my old 7310XL stopped giving me a good shave even after replacing the blades</li>
            <li> wow the time it saves and how good of a shave it does.</li>
            <li> Not as good as my old shaver</li>
            <li> Also very easy to clean, just ensure to run the blade section though hot water after each use.</li>
            <li> My husband was very pleased with his new razor for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to go back to shaving with an electric (after owning a great remington - years ago)</li>
            <li> Finally a razor I can fall in love with!!</li>
            <li> I could not believe how much I used to pay for blades for this thing!!!</li>
            <li> Overall a very nice option for men with beards/mustaches.  </li>
            <li> so this was very exciting as I have used my braun razor for over 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> soap your face up and when you&#x27;ve had a great shave just flip the heads open and run it under the water to clean it up.</li>
            <li> What a nice surprise that this razor is even better than my I old tried and true razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line - this isn&#x27;t worth the high price tag based upon fair build quality, features and performance (charging time vs useage, and shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first wasn&#x27;t as happy with it as the old one I had for years</li>
            <li> smooth, clean non iritating shaves.</li>
            <li> The accessory trimmers that are available for the higher end Norelcos may be better, but that&#x27;s a lot of money for an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> First and most importantly the razor will shred your neck.  </li>
            <li> The waterproof feature is very nice because to clean it all you have to do is open the shaving head and put it under the running water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It flexes very easily and well, and it trims pretty easily, and he says it&#x27;s comfortable and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin very much at all.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I will live with having to plug the Panasonic in more often!</li>
            <li> This is a great razor for the man in your life, but it seems to need recharged more often than previous Norelcos that I have bought for my husband.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for days when I just want a quick shave and closeness is not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Super easy to clean since it&#x27;s water friendly.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean and very quite.</li>
            <li> Just shave again in the evening if you have a hot date, then she&#x27;ll be glad you don&#x27;t have the 5:00 shadow that you would have with a morning blade shave.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s unique to this razor.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> considering I&#x27;m using original blades on the two norelco ones ive had---</li>
            <li> this was a gift and he was excited to get it.</li>
            <li> and it does seem to be shaving better now than when I first got it, but that may just be me getting used to using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I was pleased to find that the first battery charge lasted for 5 or 6 shaves..</li>
            <li> So far, I am very satisfied with the performance of this shaver..</li>
            <li> I originally bought this because I was placed on blood-thinners for a 6-month period of time and the nurses told me to get an electric razor and stop using the blades.</li>
            <li> Familiar with this brand.just registered it.</li>
            <li> As with all Phillips electronics I have purchased, I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It has a comfortable ergonomic fit/feel in the hand, shaves closely, and has a neat charging option-- it can charge in about a minute for one shave, although the full charger takes about 5 hours and lasts for about 50 minutes of use.  </li>
            <li> Recommended annual blade replacements add significant cost ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The 1150 operates faster and quieter than the AT830, with a better trimmer than either the AT830 or the higher end</li>
            <li> Replacement parts are also easily accessible.</li>
            <li> The cord is not user friendly for storage.</li>
            <li> I find it works best with some shaving cream or gel, and when you have thicker growth (shaving at both morning and night usually leads to stubble and irritation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure this razor will be cheaper on replacement heads too, in that for the at830</li>
            <li> It is comfortable and cool, battery</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> As usual, Amazon service was flawless and I&#x27;d recommend you check them</li>
            <li> so the original set of blades have lasted well over a year and the replacements were about $25.00.</li>
            <li> so the original set of blades have lasted well over a year and the replacements were about $25.00.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Panasonic wet/dry razors that have lasted for more than 5 years, so that was pretty</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was glad to learn of the new Aquatec models, having used the Norelco 6000 and 7000 series Cool Skin razors for many years.  </li>
            <li> This upgraded him to a razor that can be cleaned under the bathroom faucet and also it has new blades so he now is getting a nice clean cut.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works great dry or with water.</li>
            <li> but here&#x27;s a surprise: If you have a Jet Clean for the 8260cc</li>
            <li> the Power Touch AT830 will work in that Jet Clean.</li>
            <li> and he said do not use this razor in that Jet Clean.</li>
            <li> The Power Touch models with Jet Clean arn&#x27;t going to be out</li>
            <li> til around Father&#x27;s Day, so if you like useing Jet Clean, you can use your Power Touch AT830 in the Jet Clean for 8260cc.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Norelco based upon the excellent reviews at Amazon, but I had low expectations given the modest price.  </li>
            <li> I would find it totally unacceptable for my own us, but Dad looks OK when I am finished shaving him with it</li>
            <li> , it took forever to charge and it was a pain to clean.  </li>
            <li> I can clean it with water instead of just blowing and brushing it every day.</li>
            <li> It does a great job dry.</li>
            <li> I have to clean it for him weekly</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s very quick and if you want a fresh shave it&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li> ... have to clean up with a blade after.. stick with the blades.</li>
            <li> I tend to have to repeat area often to get a clean shave on the neck.</li>
            <li> I always clean and change my blades every week</li>
            <li> I can clean it out by rinsing it under tap water or with the brush provided in the kit.</li>
            <li> Gives a clean shave.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in a hurry the dry shave is great.</li>
            <li> i clean it after every shave</li>
            <li> I still have an older Norelco I use for travel that&#x27;s been going strong for more that five years now.</li>
            <li> Philips has been good about honoring their warranty, as they will now send me my 2nd free replacement.</li>
            <li> I do like that you can clean with water.</li>
            <li> So he would just trim it with with electric trimmers and never had a clean shave.</li>
            <li> then just rinse the Norelco clean.</li>
            <li> Although the design is somewhat unchanged the most important thing that saw real progress is the shaving heads.</li>
            <li> My husband,Jay, Won&#x27;t quit raving about the Phillips AT830--It shaves so quickly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry about the need to clean manually.</li>
            <li> so I can rinse it clean without a problem.  </li>
            <li> It works like a charm, and you can take apart the heads to clean them when you need to.</li>
            <li> Clean up</li>
            <li> or you will have to dismantle the thing and use some home made gadgets to clean it out.  </li>
            <li> Just rinse it to clean it.  </li>
            <li> It does the job but not as smooth or as quick as my 8870 .When</li>
            <li> Shaves closer, easier to clean.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product that is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is almost as clean as a razor cut and doesn&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li> I like being able to clean it by washing it with water and getting a good wet shave every day.</li>
            <li> got as a gift at Christmas, grate shaver, very fast shave on smooth results, easy clean out with air can.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say, it is a man&#x27;s shaver, so has long as husband is happy with it, then I am happy.  </li>
            <li> It can trim hairs very well, shapes your beard and is really almost worth getting this razor for on its own!</li>
            <li> I use a little soap in the shower and get very good results.</li>
            <li> Quiet, smooth, easy to clean, and fits nice in the hand.</li>
            <li> The shaver is very comfortable in use and very convenient.  </li>
            <li> He is very particular, and really love this razor.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s much more convenient than a disposable and certainly cheaper over time.</li>
            <li> they ran a special on this AT830.  </li>
            <li> My son was right!</li>
            <li> I find one that works right for me!  </li>
            <li> The new one performs even better, easy to use</li>
            <li> Good clean shave that last all day.</li>
            <li> This changed the way I shaved and left a good clean feel.</li>
            <li> battery life is also very good, I can go a few weeks at a time with</li>
            <li> love it that I can clean it pretty much right away.</li>
            <li> Extremely easy to clean, just run it under hot water.  </li>
            <li> great than expected</li>
            <li> The wet shave feature is great.</li>
            <li> First impression was light and cheap.. &amp;#34;not</li>
            <li> If you just want a good basic no-frills razor, go with this one.</li>
            <li> I definitely think this razor is good</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with electric razors, but I do know this works better than a manual one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Technique is key with a Norelco: I picked up some really good tips from [...]</li>
            <li> I searched the comments and decided that this was a cut above the cheaper models, and was at a good price.  </li>
            <li> good for the skin and at the same time it&#x27;s shaving</li>
            <li> But I went for Philips ys524 model and that really worked well:-)</li>
            <li> It is not as close a shave as with my prior Fusion, but still good.</li>
            <li> The price is a true value for this quality of razor and shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat more rugged and won&#x27;t cost as much to replace if lost or damaged.</li>
            <li> NO electric is going to rival a close blade-shave, but this unit still provides a nice soft face nonetheless.</li>
            <li> A full charge takes one hour to fully charge and the charge lasts 50 minutes.</li>
            <li> For a reasonable price, you can have most of the benefits of both the SensoTouch and PowerTouch</li>
            <li> For a reasonable price, you can have most of the benefits of both the SensoTouch and PowerTouch</li>
            <li> really loves this one and is really pleased with the shave he gets from&lt;br /&gt;it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this razor.</li>
            <li> you really need to know more?</li>
            <li> I much prefer the dual operation models (those that can run on either/both AC or battery power) as AC power gives the razor more juice</li>
            <li> In retrospect, I should have noticed that this is touted as being able to be used in the shower - you couldn&#x27;t do that with a model that is capable of AC operation.  </li>
            <li> This is a powerful and smooth razor.</li>
            <li> A full charge allows 50 minutes of shaving time or about 10 shaves.  </li>
            <li> I had an old Norelco which seems to me was more powerful and shaved more closely; but I also think that these blades have to take some time to break in.  </li>
            <li> I suspect that is true for any electric razor though.  </li>
            <li> It seems very quiet, which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> He loved the first one so much he wanted the same kind again.</li>
            <li> It is quiet and gives a good shave.  </li>
            <li> Love the 3 rotating heads, very close shave.</li>
            <li> A good replacement for a similar shaver.  </li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> This has been so far a pretty good razor.</li>
            <li> Easy, smooth, fast shave.</li>
            <li> Pros: easy grip, washable, fast charge,  and comfortable shave / Cons:</li>
            <li> Norelco opted for slower motor speeds in its current shaver and it does not give as good or as quick a shave.</li>
            <li> Runs nice and quiet and easy to rinse.  </li>
            <li> 1 hour full recharge, about 3-5 minutes for enouigh charge to do a quick shave...</li>
            <li> colored battery charging display is nice  - Easy to pop open head for cleaning  - Charges quickly, with quick charge feature  CONS:  - No battery life indicator, razor rather button minimalistic  -</li>
            <li> Other than that it works great.</li>
            <li> Just keep in mind that your skin might need quite a bit more time to adjust than you may be willing to give, so don&#x27;t use this thing for the first time right before an important event (like a job interview, wedding, etc.)</li>
            <li> very good razor, you can use it to shave both dry and wet (gel foam), it is really nice and quite but have some problems in trimming the neck area</li>
            <li> , it did a good job, but i still wanted to be able to shave under the shower, after that i bought a panasonic triple head shaver (non rotary) wet/dry type, and gave the other one away to a neighbor, and regreted it a lot!!</li>
            <li> I prefer shaving cream for the fresh clean feeling after shaving.</li>
            <li> morning, I read in an older review that all the Norelco AT models are designed this way, and that if you want to be able to use the shaver on A/C power, the PT models will allow you to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I AM YOUR LOYAL ONLINE BUYER.</li>
            <li> This electric, cordless razor is adequate given that it is not one of Norelco&#x27;s super fancy Sensotouch units.</li>
            <li> I have had several Norelco razors before and they worked ok, but I just wasn&#x27;t satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Lucky me</li>
            <li> Currently Braun is delivering its best foil technology to the U.S. only at premium prices, encouraging another look at alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A charge seems to last 5 days or more and it&#x27;s an asset to be able to rinse the shaver head.</li>
            <li> quickly</li>
            <li> Okay, but will upgrade later to a better model.</li>
            <li> I use it for a quick touch up.</li>
            <li> That said, the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I bought this razor to shave my head with, and it performs that task adequately.  </li>
            <li> You can do a quick charge for three or so minutes that is adequate for a quick shave.</li>
            <li> The reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that while it shaves well, I can&#x27;t get as close a shave as I get with a razor blade, the shave is adequate.  </li>
            <li> se le ve la cara super lisa, tambien les comento que la entrega desde que la solicite hasta que llego</li>
            <li> but I quickly got used to it.</li>
            <li> The unit came quickly, was packaged well and seemed to be a sturdy model.  </li>
            <li> as I said, it is feature packed and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> My husband said this is the best electric shaver that I have ever gotten him (and I have bought several over the last 10 years.)</li>
            <li> The AT830 is far quieter and more comfortable</li>
            <li> In some respects, the more Norelco shavers change, the more they stay the same.</li>
            <li> Super convenient.</li>
            <li> Older Norelco razors worked better.</li>
            <li> It still delivered a great shave and had been trouble free from the start.</li>
            <li> This has helped me bumps tremendously.</li>
            <li> I use this when I&#x27;m in a rush and need a quick shave.</li>
            <li> It is also easy to clean, and charges fast.</li>
            <li> I also like the quick charge feature.  </li>
            <li> At the cost of razor blades shaving every 2 days, this shaver paid for itself rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li> glad I went with the AT830/41 with the pivoting heads because it gets the hard to shave spots very nicely.</li>
            <li> Be aware that this particular MODEL comes without the Travel Pouch and, most importantly, WITHOUT the Charging Stand.  </li>
            <li> Overall I found this shaver to be pretty good - does a neat and clean job around the neck</li>
            <li> New heads are readily available too.charges quickly and quietly with no annoying bright charging lights to disturb you when on the road</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that the AT830 isn&#x27;t a pretty decent product in its own right, it is.</li>
            <li> Being able to wash the whiskers off with water allows for a very clean razor when you shave the next day.  </li>
            <li> However, everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and it&#x27;s worth trying a variety of different razors to find out which works best for your skin.</li>
            <li> Holds its charge for many weeks with normal use.</li>
            <li> sure clean hair out regularly as it clogs easily</li>
            <li> After 10 minutes of grinding the top layer of skin off, I stopped and used a normal razor to finish off all the spots this razor would not shave.</li>
            <li> these cases are pretty cheap so for the price it should be included</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very pleased about the overall performance.</li>
            <li> Normally I avoid Norelco because of their lift &amp; cut system and fears it would generate more razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not as close shave as razor, but pretty close and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I enjoy a clean shave and use a 5-blade razor and a straight razor.</li>
            <li> But given that it is comfortable, quiet, pleasant to use, simple to clean, reasonably inexpensive, and gives a quick and decent shave, I would say that this is a good shaver.</li>
            <li> while dry has proved most effective, even though model AT830 can be washed with hot water.</li>
            <li> After using other electric razors for over 60 years, I found the Norelco to be a wonderful improvement in ease of use, effectiveness in getting the saving job done in a much shorter time and with much improved comfort.  </li>
            <li> I love the newly redesigned chafer.</li>
            <li> The heads on my SensoTouch are more flexible than this model, but I could live with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this, you won&#x27;t regret it, and I&#x27;m sure, live it as I do.</li>
            <li> This one has many new improvements.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the new shaver.</li>
            <li> I will invest in new blades for my Panasonic and know that I am getting a better shave than Norelco can offer.  </li>
            <li> I am just as confident that my new Norelco will perform as well.</li>
            <li> and I think does a better job than the foil razor ever did, either new or after replacing the foil and blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love me new razor.</li>
            <li> , I find the razor overall to be a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> This razor is lightweight, rinses easily and cuts very close to the skin.</li>
            <li> The groomer tool on the back also does a pretty good job, but is nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;He is normally a man of few words, so I&#x27;d say that this razor is the best!</li>
            <li> the past month I discovered that getting the best shave from this product was about technique as much as it was about the product.  </li>
            <li> Functionally speaking, I can&#x27;t say a single good thing about this razor.</li>
            <li> Also so much quicker it is to shave!!</li>
            <li> - this new shaver doesn&#x27;t as good as the old one.</li>
            <li> .. :) I went by the reviews here on Amazon, and wanted to try a little better Norelco, and one that that could be used wet/dry, and also easily rinsed and cleaned.</li>
            <li> But the best thing by far is the razor&#x27;s ability to shave under my jawline: it&#x27;s always been a problem with my previous razors, but this gives me my cleanest shave yet.  </li>
            <li> Nice smooth shave used dry.</li>
            <li> Second, it has an integrated beard trimmer - super handy for trimming up the goatee - the Senseo has a separate trimmer head - requiring you to remove the shaving head, locate the trimmer head, etc.  </li>
            <li> Quick charges in 1 hour, a nice feature over the traditional 8 hour charge cycles but one that is mandatory I think for a razor that can&#x27;t be used when plugged in (see comments</li>
            <li> He gets a very smooth shave and his skin feels soft.  </li>
            <li> I got close shave right from the start, and it was quick as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has been several years since I needed to purchase a new Razor and since I have had great success with Philips Norelco, I thought I would try this one.</li>
            <li> It seems that the first rep that I talked to just wanted me to buy a Jet Clean for this model.</li>
            <li> really seems to be fine).  </li>
            <li> Rinse the heads often with hot water and rinse clean when done, removing the head assembly</li>
            <li> Rinse the heads often with hot water and rinse clean when done, removing the head assembly</li>
            <li> Razor works fine and is much lighter and quieter than the one it replaced.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use; easy to clean; and quiet.  </li>
            <li> My thinking is that hot soap and water wouldn&#x27;t just soften my beard but clean the darn thing out</li>
            <li> This razor shaves very close and is comparable to a straight edge shave....left my face very smooth.  </li>
            <li> My only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; if you will is it is very light which gives the impression that it is cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m convince most of the positive reviews are fake, because there is no way most people could possibly be happy with this razor.</li>
            <li> While this certainly helped with razor burn and bumps (no matter what method I shaved - electric or cartridge), my skin would still look bright red on my neck area after I&#x27;d finished.  </li>
            <li> Norelco has a good thing going, and is smart enough to continue to improve it, rather than redesigning something over and over again from scratch.</li>
            <li> You kind of have to apply a bit more force or get in closer than you desire - which completely defeats the point of having a detail trimmer as you can essentially ruin the style you are aiming for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very close shave that leaves your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Aquatec technology provides a fast, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> shave is smooth and fast, using a pre-shave powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gave me a very close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I felt this razor was a great razor in almost every aspect, I do have a couple of things I wish it had to round it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s task was not an unusual one, cut my beard as smooth as a blade, all two inches of it.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few months now and I am happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> Very quiet yet amazingly efficient at shaving my beard.  </li>
            <li> Very confortable machine, is light and practical..</li>
            <li> He uses it everyday and thinks it is great and a time saver.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing for the simple reason that I can be watching something on the laptop and just be shaving without even putting on shaving cream.</li>
            <li> You get your money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> Love it, its lots more comfortable than the model with the fixed head (tiny difference in design).</li>
            <li> after using this razor for three weeks now, I can say it was worth every cent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All that means is, if you run the battery completely out, you will have to wait three minutes when you plug it in before you will be able to shave.</li>
            <li> If the razor is reliable and sturdy, it will be worth 5 stars.</li>
            <li> but overall a nice razor for the price.</li>
            <li> but wet is definitely the best way to use it.</li>
            <li> Very quiet and effective.  </li>
            <li> the wet shaving is good as i expected.&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> (Oh, and the sideburn trimmer works even better than the old one.)</li>
            <li> This is the only electric razor that my husband has ever liked.  </li>
            <li> Recent Philips models provide thinner combs and more precise mating of cutter blades to combs, as compared with Norelco models of years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Should have bought one of these years ago, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My old one died after many years of service</li>
            <li> The Powertouch Electric Razor has proven to be an effective tool at daily shaving.</li>
            <li> but trimmer isn&#x27;t worth a flip (pun intended.)  </li>
            <li> This model&#x27;s big innovation is a nice snap-out trimmer.</li>
            <li> Braun Cruzer 6 Face Cruzer, 6 Face Shaver]], but those require even more passes for a complete shave</li>
            <li> Much better than my old razor.</li>
            <li> He loves the wet/dry feature, and his shaves look good, but he says that it&#x27;s not like a 4-bladed wet razor.</li>
            <li> Worth trying if you want to escape the money pit of replacement blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> Trimmer on the back is nice.</li>
            <li> I may be old school, but for $70 to $80 you would think the technology of 2014 would give a better shaving experience.</li>
            <li> This razor gives the same fabulous shave, but it more versatile.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband for Christmas because his old Norelco just didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cut it&amp;#34; any more.  </li>
            <li> It is much better than my old one.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really liked my last one, an purchased this model.</li>
            <li> how long it lasts until I have to replace the blades, but very satisfied for now.</li>
            <li> It also has the newer kind of battery which doesn&#x27;t require an initial 12 hour charge, and I think can be charged before it&#x27;s fully discharged without harming it.</li>
            <li> He can finally get the close shave he wants AND stay on top of it without getting a rash. :)</li>
            <li> I have used Remington electric razor my whole life and thought they were good but was fed up with the last one</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Razor is OK but not the quality of my old one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I gave it another shot and spent a good 20 minutes (yes, 20) trying to get it to cut something; after I finished it looked like I hadn&#x27;t even shaved</li>
            <li> but I love it so far.  </li>
            <li> This razor is worth</li>
            <li> I am still of the opinion that this is well worth the money if you do get it please take some time to get used to using it.</li>
            <li> This razor is worth</li>
            <li> I am still of the opinion that this is well worth the money if you do get it please take some time to get used to using it.</li>
            <li> This one is worth the money.</li>
            <li> you could back it off to make it more comfortable for yourself instead of</li>
            <li> that freshly scraped feeling</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> and so far I love it.  </li>
            <li> Very nice razor, nice and quiet, holds a charge well, very slick shave with cream or gel, easy to rinse too, and 2-1/2 year warranty</li>
            <li> The design fits into contours of my face better, it runs at a much lower RPM, you can use it with shaving gel, and it is super easy to clean as you can just flip open the blade chassis while it is still running and run it under hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery power is a great convenience, but only if the battery lasts a long time and is easy to charge.</li>
            <li> I noticed this shaver on sale and the reviews were very positive.  </li>
            <li> I think these other reviewers must be suffering from buyer&#x27;s remorse / confirmation bias and leaving good reviews because they expected it to be good.</li>
            <li> there isn&#x27;t much that you can change on shavers today, but for what it is - it looks great and works just like the other units i&#x27;ve owned in the past.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> I get a really good clean shave; this is an improviment over my old Norelco which I did nto think was possible.  </li>
            <li> I did some research before buying this particular model and it works fine</li>
            <li> Gives a great shave, is quiet and so simple to clean.  </li>
            <li> Item exactly as described and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rugged and takes a charge quickly, but continues to be a learning situation as his first electric razor.</li>
            <li> It charged quickly the first times I used it.</li>
            <li> Came super fast!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use the pop up trimmer first for a quick run then</li>
            <li> Pros:  - Appropriately sealed containment space  - Small charging plug  - Good weight balance  - Large trimming surface  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to clean under running water and it seems to hold a charge for a long time!</li>
            <li> Although I do have to use the regular razor to clean up some areas because no matter how many times I run over something with the Norelco, it still leaves a bunch of hair.</li>
            <li> (I currently have a beard, so I use it for trimming, for getting cheeks and neck areas clean, and touching up here and there</li>
            <li> Particularly nice were the floating heads, which were considerably improved over my older model Norelco.</li>
            <li> I purchased this particular razor because it was supposed to be extra good at getting whiskers on my throat.  </li>
            <li> My 18 year old twin boys LOVE their new razors!!!</li>
            <li> Works about as good as every other shaver i&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good shaver but the shave isn&#x27;t as close as some of the other Norelco shaves I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> My first electric razor was a Braun and so far this razor is far superior.</li>
            <li> I originally had a norelco over 20 years ago, didn&#x27;t use it much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it in dry mode and find it to be fast, comfortable and incredibly close.  </li>
            <li> Overall though this is a highly recommended electric razor if you want a good shave on a budget.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t work right.</li>
            <li> In my quest to find the right razor for me I tried a Norelco SensoTouch 3D, a Braun, and now this Norelco AT830.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re right.  </li>
            <li> This shaver does the job, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> it just wasn&#x27;t right for him.</li>
            <li> Yes, you heard right - it won&#x27;t work if it&#x27;s plugged into a wall socket.</li>
            <li> If a hair is lose it slides right out by the way.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> If a hair is lose it slides right out by the way.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Came in right in time for Father&#x27;s Day</li>
            <li> The articulating heads do not handle the jawline below the ear as well as I had hoped, but other than that, this unit provides a nice, smooth shave at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Those who don&#x27;t need the trimmer function might be happier with the 1290, which has a pretty amazing ability to follow the contours of the face and is very, very quiet.</li>
            <li> First off, they are both relatively quiet razors, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> By making sure that only gentle pressure is applied, even shaving the anterior ramus of the mandible [Chin] becomes easy.  </li>
            <li> and I think its much easier to clean &amp; maintain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cuts clean and very close.  </li>
            <li> This one is MUCH easier to clean.</li>
            <li> The Braun triple-track design does better than just a curved foil, but it typically needs many passes to provide a uniform shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because it can be used wet or dry it seemed perfect but some men are just died-in the wool razor users and that&#x27;s what they like.</li>
            <li> You can use it wet or dry, I use mine in the shower and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> The pop-up trimmer is adequate (similar to the 1250), but the 1150&#x27;s attachment trimmer works better</li>
            <li> Great first couple shaves, not sure if worth the money over the model below it</li>
            <li> It gives a nice shave and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice close shave &amp; it doesn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> popup trimmer is really great for my sideburns as they grow pretty quickly and need a trim at least once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive reviews (should have paid more attention to the negative ones) and reading the product description I decided to give this electric razor a chance, hoping I would have more success with it than older electric razors I had tried.  </li>
            <li> Very light, quick charging, and a long shaving time.</li>
            <li> Gives a better shave than my older razor did with new blades.</li>
            <li> The Norelco AT895 brought a closer, more comfortable shave than expected, even though I had used electric razors for years..</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how easy it is to keep him looking neat</li>
            <li> It charges quickly, and the battery life is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> The pop-up edger is the same as on more economical models.  </li>
            <li> AT830 and 6948XL are among the most useful of current rotary shavers.</li>
            <li> He does mention that he still needs to clean up with a regular blade after using but that it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The product has a soft rubber grip, which is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Reallly was surprised at how easy on face and close shave.  </li>
            <li> I found this to be a nice touch, even in a dry environment.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been quite some time since I tried an electric and the technology has apparently gotten better as this one does the oft-troubling neck pretty well.  </li>
            <li> The pivoting head on this razor is superior to the previous Norelco I owned.</li>
            <li> works a whole lot better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> Wanted shaver that was good for a black man.</li>
            <li> he skin was getting too sensitive and easily cut....</li>
            <li> Great Razor, finally after buying 2 prior to this one,  I got a thumbs up.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and a battery charge last for weeks.</li>
            <li> The functionality of this razor is incredible, if you use it in the shower it will give you a shave that rivals most manual blades without the risk of cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> far it cleans the machine easily but doesn&#x27;t give me a close shave.</li>
            <li> , it delivered a shave that was close enough to be presentable, but not anywhere near as good as a blade.</li>
            <li> The upgrade was not because the first one was inferior but the upgrade had just a little more power and since he also uses it shave his head he opted for more power.</li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t sound like the motor was very powerful because it is so quiet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty easy to clean, just pop it open and rise it</li>
            <li> found this to be a somewhat better than average mid-range shaver, good, but not on a par with the 1290 I recently reviewed and which my husband loves.</li>
            <li> I will say it does give me an excellent shave, but it takes twice as long as my previous razor to get it.  </li>
            <li> Smooth and easy / holds a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I like my Norleco wet/dry shavers very much.  </li>
            <li> then I noticed that the shave&lt;br /&gt;quality droped off very fast.</li>
            <li> Oh, it hurts very much.</li>
            <li> Very gentle.</li>
            <li> a design good enough to be in New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art product design</li>
            <li> Since the blades and foils needed to be replaced anyways, on top of a new cord, I figured I&#x27;d just look for a new razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He had a Braun in between these two Norelco&#x27;s, but was very clear about it not being as good as old his old Norelco.</li>
            <li> In fact, even when my face is dry and I&#x27;m in a cool place, my old cheap Norelco did a better shave than this one.</li>
            <li> Then Braun, while owned by Gillette, introduced titanium foil shavers that combined fairly close shaves with little skin irritation, and I switched to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one is a little light and really isn&#x27;t as good as the last one as you have to go over areas to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I like the rinse and wet cleaning that keeps the blades clean for a better shave.  </li>
            <li> Previous models of Norelco shaver&#x27;s i have had supplied coiled cords which makes them much more easy to store.</li>
            <li> He loves it, especially the fact that it can be rinsed out and that it charges so easily and quickly.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my beard is too coarse for foil type razors as I find the this new Norelco to shave even better than the previous model and is a joy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that the shave isn&#x27;t nearly as close, not to mention the price, while not exorbitant, is still a bit high (and the options for razors can be quite mind-boggling).  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor, and it works well.</li>
            <li> exactly so I wouldn&#x27;t make any mistakes.  </li>
            <li> third (in the past 10 yeras) and best ever Norelco.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I let it charge fully, I switched it on to have my first shave and allow it the opportunity to impress me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe my facial hair will learn to be intimidated by the AT830 over time, or as I age the hair won&#x27;t be as big a challenge for the three impeccably designed heads ...</li>
            <li> Well, I called back and the Guy that I talked to this time said it was perfectly ok.</li>
            <li> , that would be it.&lt;br /&gt;i love the product and plan to purchase this brand again in the future.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, to conclude, if you can bear a shave that isn&#x27;t quite as close in exchange for shaving money in the long-run and much quicker shave, I&#x27;d go for it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this without cream and it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> now that I&#x27;ve finally been able to mail the darn thing out, I have to wait another SIX TO EIGHT weeks to recieve my refund.</li>
            <li> but this one sometimes sticks to my skin if it&#x27;s too hot.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using it on the back of my neck</li>
            <li> This razor gets the job done, but pales in comparison to higher priced models.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommended only if you can&#x27;t afford the better quality models.</li>
            <li> I tried a cheap razor with these three circle blades which seemed to eat my face alive.</li>
            <li> I scanned the razor with my iPhone in the parking lot and found these reviews and the Amazon price (which was slightly higher than their MISTAKE price).</li>
            <li> First, the AT830 Phillips Norelco PowerTouch Rechargeable Cordless Razor features and impressions.  </li>
            <li> initial shave is OK, but again the 2D takes it with closeness of the cut.</li>
            <li> First electric razor ever</li>
            <li> The first one I got as a gift, over 10 years ago worked like a charm from day one.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this razor was the grip.  </li>
            <li> (I think my first one was made of wood and stone!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I switched back to an electric razor after many years.  </li>
            <li> If this is the first time you are using a electric shaver - be warned - you are not going to like it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best when charged on a regular schedule as the battery indicator does not indicate when it&#x27;s near empty.  </li>
            <li> This shaver can get a pretty close shave, maybe too close.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not afraid of waking the whole house in the morning when using this one.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works as expected and is a nice feature to have.</li>
            <li> and it goes off on the first day.</li>
            <li> Their low speeds encourage shaving with slower and more strategic motions.</li>
            <li> This was a plus as it was his first electric</li>
            <li> I recommend you spend the extra money on a better razor.</li>
            <li> My first electric razor, was a Norelco, when I entered the Army in 1956.</li>
            <li> Works much better than my last Norelco which did not even give a week of shaves.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> It works ok if used daily, but</li>
            <li> I have used electric razors for years and have tried many different brands.</li>
            <li> It is my first electric</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still on it&#x27;s first charge.  </li>
            <li> Shaves pretty close.</li>
            <li> Clean-up is a cinch, and this unit has the added bonus of being able to be used in the shower for those days where the alarm just wasn&#x27;t enough to get the day started.</li>
            <li> The first two I bought were crappy</li>
            <li> And it has a very efficient built in trimmer for those rare occasions when you just can&#x27;t get rid of a hair.</li>
            <li> This is my third Norelco in the last 35 years and definitely the best of them all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;++ Best for daily shaving of short to medium thickness facial hair</li>
            <li> It does result in skin irritation at first.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t think you need the detail trimmer of the 1150, give the PowerTouch units a try first.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t think you need the detail trimmer of the 1150, give the PowerTouch units a try first.  </li>
            <li> I have a higher end</li>
            <li> I have essential tremors and sure made shaving a breeze.</li>
            <li> Just flip the head up, and you can simply shake most of the fuzz out.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I have owned that compares to a razor!When</li>
            <li> Will be buying 2 more for shortly.</li>
            <li> I was able to get my 8240 back together and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> I have used another (more basic)</li>
            <li> Overall I am satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only issues that I have is that for the price, this should have more features.  </li>
            <li> For this reason they don;&#x27;t want you to be able to use it with the cord attached for obvious reasons.</li>
            <li> I have used norelco&#x27;s shavers for several years, but the triple blade head does a closer shave and feels better.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor.  </li>
            <li> SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor first thinking I&#x27;d step up.</li>
            <li> The first lasted 5 years.  </li>
            <li> So far its a smooth running machine.</li>
            <li> THANKS!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic told me how many minutes of charge I had left - this one just tells me &amp;#34;when</li>
            <li> recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3-31-13-- Have been using razor about 5 days a week and today was the first day I had to recharge.</li>
            <li> The first week I had some skin irritation but that went away after some time.</li>
            <li> On the plus side the battery will last for many shaves before recharging.</li>
            <li> After some online research, I saw that the latest generations of Norelcos have gone back to slotted combs...................</li>
            <li> from Norelco&#x27;s Senseo line, which is nominally a higher end product than this razor&#x27;s pedigree.  </li>
            <li> You have to wait until it&#x27;s charged up enough in order to shave, which is more than 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I had my doubts, but that disappeared the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Only thing I wish was better is the motor.  </li>
            <li> I had been a Norelco user for many years but decided to try another brand, Remington, as a sale opportunity and in the belief that there was not a lot of difference in shavers in similar price ranges.  </li>
            <li> I decided I needed better and read through all the reviews for the different types of shavers.  </li>
            <li> I bought Philips Norelco AT830 for my husband and he LOVES it so much!</li>
            <li> I enjoy its shave so far</li>
            <li> After reading the directions, I charged the razor for the first time.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> Rinsing it out after use is much better than my last one that had to be cleaned manually.</li>
            <li> just push the button to flip open the top and rinse under running water, done.</li>
            <li> Men who might not feel they need to shave every day should do so anyway; short hair shave off more efficiently, (tho</li>
            <li> they are 25-30 dollars, I think the replacements for the Panasonic were pretty close to 50, maybe</li>
            <li> Even though 1150X/46 is similar,  the AT830 feels better in the hand , has longer battery life, has a pop up trimmer and has room to be made with quality parts.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor.</li>
            <li> I will buy what I should have bought in the first place, the Braun Series 7.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely LOVES this shaver!</li>
            <li> My first electric razor.  </li>
            <li> It gives a pretty close shave and has a functional sideburn trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The whole razor is dependent on the battery, which is worth about $18.</li>
            <li> This is the first Aquatec I ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I have to go over the same spot more often with this one.</li>
            <li> I have lost count on how many Norelco shavers I have owned over the last 30+</li>
            <li> Kept charged, cleaned every day, shaved in exactly in the manner as told to in the instructions.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly the one he wanted.</li>
            <li> Proper care will ensure this razor remains in top care for quite a while.</li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wet/dry ability of this razor is a nice feature because it does give you a closer shave when wet.  </li>
            <li> The ability to use it wet is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> My parents have a dog who hates the sound of his old electric razor, but this one does not seem to bother him.  </li>
            <li> When they come up with an electric that shaves closer than a razor without &amp;#34;razor burn&amp;#34; I would be willing to give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> packaged.it was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> As his wife, I love it because it is faster, and I am not left waiting at the front door.</li>
            <li> but I will take more care in my choice,and try further up the range !!</li>
            <li> Sure for some people it has become second nature</li>
            <li> It was the first time for me using an electric shaver, but</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor I have used that does not break my face out in a rash.  </li>
            <li> model AT830 is a good choice for everyday use at home.</li>
            <li> It is good for a shave after one days growth and for touch-ups...but not for heavy growth or after a weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> almost razor-like, very low noise (i cant stand noise in the morning), better wet than dry but both VERY good...</li>
            <li> After turning it on, I knew right away that it was not going to be powerful enough based on the sound the blades were making.</li>
            <li> We did not compare any notes until after going back to our own new shavers.  </li>
            <li> But overall, I do consider it a shaver that anyone who wants a very comfortable shave at a very reasonable price, this is the shaver for you.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable, efficient, quick and quiet.  </li>
            <li> I think that some of these models like the 7310, which can be found for around half the price of the AT830 if you shop around, are really just as good.</li>
            <li> I spent a fair amount of time writing a very complimentary review and had it rejected by them for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> This razor has an easy, normal cord, so it&#x27;s much better for plugging in to the bathroom outlet without blocking all the other outlets or making me unplug my blow-dryer,</li>
            <li> Sure it is still new (only had since Christmas of 2014) and the blade are still at their like new sharpness, but is is so comfortable and gives me such a close shave that I am in love with it.</li>
            <li> Easy grip, air dry, cool feel to the face,</li>
            <li> Did I mention I&#x27;ve used other rotary razors on my legs before and liked</li>
            <li> Did I mention I&#x27;ve used other rotary razors on my legs before and liked</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other kind.</li>
            <li> Much of what you would get in the higher end series is the design and LCD display vs. an actual better shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good shaver, I love the way it cuts my face hair and even is perfect to shave head, but  if you want razor last for a very long time be careful to don&#x27;t use it at shower time because even the manufacturer say that razor is perfectly sealed and ready to use it in contact with the shower water it will got filtration&#x27;s inside the circuits and will fail due to short circuit.  </li>
            <li> shave without wetting my face or using any cream.&lt;br /&gt;The fit is right and normal as far as it goes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only used it as a wet shaver and it performs great.  </li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift for my hubby, it arrived earlier than expected, in great shape and he loves using it.</li>
            <li> My husband goes through shavers like most people go through toilet paper.  </li>
            <li> each used our razors for one week, cleaned them properly with a good blade wash, then traded razors for a second week trial.  </li>
            <li> I actually like the feel of stationary heads, but I have found I have to make multiple passes to get a good shave with all these razors.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I am glad he loved this shaver.</li>
            <li> This tool is handy but, for full control I recommend a small comb to tease the hair as you</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m glad they finally have moved their battery chemistry into the modern age of lipo batteries.</li>
            <li> shaver works real well for me, although I do end having to go over the same area more than once.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a decent shaver and as far as I&#x27;m concerned, easy to get used to if you have used one before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy..flip open top and rinse.</li>
            <li> The AT830 got really good reviews about reliability over the newer, more expensive Norelco models</li>
            <li> If I had not read this and went by the first experience with it, I would have certainly returned it and probably written a not so favorable review.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth shave easy to clean and pretty much the same results wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the quality of shave that I get and with the money that I have NOT spent on blades it has already paid for itself!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the quality of shave that I get and with the money that I have NOT spent on blades it has already paid for itself!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you very much, for this product, I am very gladd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to clean, the charge lasts a long time, and you get a warning light when the charge is low.</li>
            <li> On the positive side, the battery lasts longer than my Panasonic&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Instead of buying replacement blades, I opted for this razor after seeing positive customer feedback.</li>
            <li> forget all these positive reviews If you are looking for close shave don&#x27;t buy this one or any rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try an electric razor out and after a lot of research and reading all the positive reviews here decided on this one.</li>
            <li> I think the 7310 is pretty much a reliable workhorse.</li>
            <li> Been shaving with this razor in the shower for about a week now and it pretty much performs as advertised.  </li>
            <li> and I did the first charge for the whole night - after a week</li>
            <li> I first bought this in May 2013 and by September 2013 it wouldn&#x27;t charge so Philips replaced the whole unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor&#x27;s quietness was also suprising at first but very much appreciated.  </li>
            <li> Both have the same battery and the same shave/charge characteristiscs that are most important to me.</li>
            <li> Might be due to what seems to be a more powerful motor.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t have any irritation and it didn&#x27;t leave many long hairs.</li>
            <li> Battery life is good; I usually charge it once a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one of the better electric razors but not among the most expensive options, so if you&#x27;re looking to upgrade from a cheaper model or want to try your first electric razor without spending a lot of money (in the long run this is cheaper than high end safety blades like Fusion), this is a good product to consider.</li>
            <li> Same great Norelco shaving capability - a little better than my last one (10years ago).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a replacement for an older shaver from the same OEM that the battery had given out on after MANY years of service.</li>
            <li> For charging it doesn&#x27;t come with a stand you set it in like my older model, fortunately the old stand works with this one.</li>
            <li> charge doesn&#x27;t last all that more than the older one I had</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally I feel it could be priced a little better - but knowing the quality that goes into Philips Norelco products I am not shocked that it is priced as it</li>
            <li> I received the new Norelco about a month ago, had another older one, but this one could be used in the shower and also could be cleaned by running water over the flip open blade housing, making it easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to rinsing it out in hot water after every shave (leave it open, on a towel after you shake most of the water out), but this keeps the blades and their housings clean, and ready for the next shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s likely not any razor that would be the one best choice everyone due to different expectations and varieties of skin and hair.</li>
            <li> this one gives a better shave than the more costly one kept this , sent other back save some money buy this one.</li>
            <li> I would say that this new shaver works as well as a fresh blade on the Schick razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> make sure to dry the charge port before charging, as they all have a problem here.</li>
            <li> The full charge took roughly an hour, which provides me about a week of shaving before having to charge it again (again, note that I have a light beard that doesn&#x27;t require a lengthy shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because rotaries are quiet, one easily hears when cutters engage whiskers.</li>
            <li> The stand tips over easily and is an extra requirement to haul around when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the less effective it becomes.  </li>
            <li> When a recharge is necessary, it&#x27;s done very quickly.</li>
            <li> He had previously owned a lower model Norelco and liked it but had to keep buying batteries for it.</li>
            <li> Charging is easy, via a simple AC adapter cord</li>
            <li> I mostly use it dry.</li>
            <li> Semi-close dry but is better in the shower with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> but okay dry if your in a hurry.</li>
            <li> It was easy to order, and arrived in a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li> I love it because I may use it with shaving cream or dry.</li>
            <li> And cleaning the razor isn&#x27;t quite as easy as it had been with prior wet/dry</li>
            <li> I had an older, cheap norelco but the price of a new blade was really high</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this electric razor because it provides not only a nice close shave, but the skin feels soft and not irritated afterwards.</li>
            <li> After confirming via phone with Norelco that I indeed had a purely cordless model, I contacted Amazon and arranged for a return/refund.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product to anyone based on performance, ease of use, and price.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My current razor is the Panasonic ES-LV61, which I admit sets a very high bar for the AT830, but it&#x27;s good to have a high standard of comparison.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time and has a very clean cut for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> However it is really quiet compared to my old one, and it&#x27;s cool how I can just run hot water over the blades to clean it.</li>
            <li> He likes it very much and the shaver is really a decent one.</li>
            <li> Shaves great, its a Norelco, duh!</li>
            <li> This is my fourth norelco shaver in past 10 years and it is the best so far</li>
            <li> This is very comfortable on your face, and no more clean and renew solution to buy, this cleans up under the fawcet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when it was time to buy a new one, I went back to my favorite brand.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It makes the second step (razor) easy because the first pass with the Norelco did such a good job that just a little bath-soap on the face is enough lubrication (if you felt a need to do more).  </li>
            <li> It works great wet or dry...</li>
            <li> The shaving platform moves to follow your face contours and great shave dry or wet.  </li>
            <li> Charges fully in less than an hour and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Works great wet &amp; dry.</li>
            <li> I will say it is much quieter than any previous razor I have owned and that is nice.  </li>
            <li> Only used dry so far,but good shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the design are similar among the two, the new one certainly do a better job, thanks to the&lt;br /&gt;additional features.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves my face feeling pretty smooth and does a good job of not missing any hairs with only a few passes.</li>
            <li> After several months, the shaver works fine and does what it&#x27;s marketed to do.  </li>
            <li> My face is nice and smooth now, and it&#x27;s only slightly irritated along my neck/under my chin.</li>
            <li> First it was the Remington as a teenager, then the Norelco with two cutters rather than three, through many other  models for years.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is particularly unsatisfactory!</li>
            <li> Smart move on my part....shaves much quicker and closer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to use while traveling for water is not accessible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The razor does not come with any kind of little carrying case for trips.  </li>
            <li> clean my shaver after each use: just open it up and rinse with hot water from the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mix my shaving lotion with hibiclens to make sure no more infections on my face for an clean shave.</li>
            <li> Yep, each one lasts about 5 years--actually longer if you&#x27;re not concerned about battery life, i.e. willing to keep it plugged in--and I&#x27;d highly recommend the brand.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I give it four stars is that the first one I purchased broke after about four uses; however, amazon replaced it and sent a new one to me very quickly, so there was no loss to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You don&#x27;t see the charge light until the very end is my only issue.  </li>
            <li> This one is noisy and the aqua benefit really isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> works very well.</li>
            <li> I dosent cut very close.</li>
            <li> - Razor feels solid and comfortable to grip  </li>
            <li> - Comes with cleaning brush, cover  - Equipped with spring-loaded trimmer  - White light</li>
            <li> It feels solid and he finds it comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Shaving is fast and, doesn&#x27;t require any real patience (e.g., I can shave with the grain, against the grain, in a circular motion...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does indeed give you a very close shave - probably the closest I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric -</li>
            <li> Just glide it gently over the skin and remove all the whiskers.</li>
            <li> The price changed so fast.</li>
            <li> That really disappoints me.</li>
            <li> it ain&#x27;t getting much heavier.</li>
            <li> However, it really does not give a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I called Norelco, and they confirmed that almost all of their low and mid-priced razors are now made in China.</li>
            <li> However, I really don&#x27;t like the design of the 1250X, and I returned it too</li>
            <li> /&gt;This model has a much nicer and wider trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The price seemed reasonable so I picked it up.</li>
            <li> suggest paying this much for THIS razor.  </li>
            <li> suggest paying this much for THIS razor.  </li>
            <li> In  my opinion it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a real razor but it does the job.</li>
            <li> It shaves very close.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t cut very close.</li>
            <li> On the flipside, if I skip shaving Sat/Sun, when I shave for Monday morning it does very well.</li>
            <li> After 65 years of using a straight razor, my husband is now using a Philips Norelco.  </li>
            <li> It is especially gentle enough for shaving the head and neck areas.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended !</li>
            <li> Fortunately it has a 45 day money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> The Norelco was quiet and shaved smoothly.</li>
            <li> very clean!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> No need to pay more than this as anything else is just more of the same at higher price and no better shave.</li>
            <li> I absolutely cannot use a straight razor without bumping up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As the blades wear, it may become more of an issue, but that&#x27;s also to be expected by any electric.  </li>
            <li> The heads do flex to try andcontour your face, but it really doesn&#x27;t do a lot.  </li>
            <li> It is very light-weight, but makes me wonder how durable and long-lasting it will be.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s quiet and light.</li>
            <li> This razor was a Christmas gift and much appreciated by my son who received it.</li>
            <li> * Quiet and smooth shave</li>
            <li> There is no battery meter, only a light that flashes when the battery is about to run out.</li>
            <li> Shaver was better than expected.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.  </li>
            <li> It gets a very close shave.</li>
            <li> The blades, while providing a close shave, are not irritating to the skin, even on the neck area.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> the whole thing can be rinsed in water…</li>
            <li> I had really fast response  .  </li>
            <li> There is a battery light that tells you when it is getting low.</li>
            <li> Very close shave.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m not the only guy like this, so this is a detailed review for those of you who are considering an 810 or 830 model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope this helps someone who really has wanted to know the difference.</li>
            <li> Supersharp blades and fast battery recharge.  </li>
            <li> I had shoulder surgery on my dominate side and could not shave with a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it now</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband for Christmas, &amp; much to my surprise~without any prompting he said to me, &amp;#34;I really like that razor.</li>
            <li> It produces a very close shave with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Therefore I spent more and bought this one.</li>
            <li> Shaves very close.</li>
            <li> It shaves fast, very close, and works quite well.</li>
            <li> This shaver works very well and you can bring it in the shower with you.  </li>
            <li> very nice&lt;br /&gt;to</li>
            <li> quiet, close shave, comfortable in hand and on face</li>
            <li> Bah on the whole company.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I AM BACK TO A REALLY SMOOTH SHAVE,</li>
            <li> really do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> need to be recharged much often.</li>
            <li> I love the wet shave for comfort and closeness.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> At the price of this razor it was worth getting rid of the old one and getting a replacement.  </li>
            <li> Also the razor doesn&#x27;t shave very close.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t save you much time shaving.  </li>
            <li> He really likes it.</li>
            <li> Reasonable shave for price.</li>
            <li> and he really enjoys it.</li>
            <li> While both have similar features, this model is louder when shaving, does not feel like it cuts as close, and the trimmer is louder and not as smooth.  </li>
            <li> I get ready in the morning while everyone is asleep</li>
            <li> It sometimes seems to work better wet.  </li>
            <li> In the morning I used a Gillette, which gives a much closer shave than the electrics.</li>
            <li> Be very meticulous where you let it slide.</li>
            <li> Needs about 3 circular pass overs to do a spot, but the speed you do it at doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> My dad lost his hearing with age, which I attributed to noisy shaver, lawn mower, and snow blower -- so quiet is *really* important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One thing to note:  Recharge it before it really needs to be charged since this is a model that can be used in water it will not run when the cord is plugged in so you cannot use it while plugged in and charging.  </li>
            <li> It does a reasonable job at shaving.</li>
            <li> This is much nicer.  </li>
            <li> The heads really hug the face and the result is a very close shave with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> it does not give a very close shave.</li>
            <li> so I needed another shaver fast,</li>
            <li> He says that it works very well.</li>
            <li> hThThe razor is light weight with a battery that seems to last forever.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s not replaceable, unit went straight in the trash.</li>
            <li> Works reasonably well.</li>
            <li> There is no battery meter, only a light that flashes when the battery is about to run out and if it does run out...</li>
            <li> Just contacted Philips and they won&#x27;t replace the whole unit this time, just the handle / body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the floating head design because I really have to mash it into my face over and over again to get it to cut my beard.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> But it works very well--including the tougher spots like on my neck.  </li>
            <li> But I still occasionally use a cheap two or three blade throw away razor.</li>
            <li> and it did not slide very well.  </li>
            <li> This seems reasonable given that the outer edge would have the highest rotation speed.  </li>
            <li> Really like the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Also like fast delivery</li>
            <li> SMOOTH , QUIET, QUALITY PRODUCT</li>
            <li> It gives a really close shave for an electric.  </li>
            <li> but it did not deliver a very confortable or efficient shave.  </li>
            <li> haha would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> he thanks me.  </li>
            <li> Forget trying to use it on a sweaty face, as it sticks too much for that.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not quite as close as a modern safety razor with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband as a gift as he really wanted to try a wet/dry shaver in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> and when he does it gets really irritated from it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and quiet.</li>
            <li> I suggest using shaving cream, makes shave much smoother.</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift for my brother and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s much quicker and comparatively hassle-free, not to mention nick-free.</li>
            <li> He wanted one that was fast charging and he likes the shave he gets..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Norelco wants you to replace the rotary blade sets every year.</li>
            <li> The fact is that water always find a way to get into, so is better to be careful with it.</li>
            <li> Really quiet and smooth shaving (</li>
            <li> How do they manage to get away with this, without even a label on the package telling people that batteries aren&#x27;t really replaceable amazes me.</li>
            <li> After years and years of using a straight edge razor, shaving cream etc.</li>
            <li> The build is solid and fit, no water can go through it.</li>
            <li> The razor really rates a five.  </li>
            <li> I expected more from Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I just expected better.</li>
            <li> This has give me a much closer shave versus my Fusion razor.</li>
            <li> This one is much closer</li>
            <li> that is when it wants to work.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S REASONABLY PRICED</li>
            <li> It is quiet and runs smoothly, but lacks a charge indicator.  </li>
            <li> He really loves it.  </li>
            <li> I love this razor.it arrived sooner than expected and was well</li>
            <li> 3-5 minutes and ready.</li>
            <li> but now he really really loves it and his face is so smoooooth.</li>
            <li> ago I did not realize how much I had come to like my Philips Norelco 830/ 41 Aquatic Power Touch Electric Razor until I had occasion to be without it.</li>
            <li> I really like it because it gives me a close shave without pinching my lip and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to start using an electric shaver, because of some neck surgery and this one works very well.  </li>
            <li> This is working very well.  </li>
            <li> He had never used an electric razor, he thought they all pulled to much.</li>
            <li> Very pleaseed with the charge</li>
            <li> I really like the wet/dry functionality</li>
            <li> It is a really close shave and it does not irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I need to go over some of the areas multiple times before it shaves everything perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li> It gives me a fast, close shave.</li>
            <li> Never used it in the shower, but i really like how it feels to my face and head.</li>
            <li> do the job very well, with to much gel the Norelco dont work</li>
            <li> Gvies a really close shave with no irratation</li>
            <li> Really embarrassing.</li>
            <li> It is very quiet which is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same power or speed</li>
            <li> Shaves  as well as my old Norelco shaver, however lacks the most basic features.  </li>
            <li> Long story short, not only does this shaver work great, and charge up in a couple of hours instead of 8, but the first set of blades lasted me a whole year.</li>
            <li> Shaves are closer than my old one and love that you charge it and forget about it for multiple weeks.  </li>
            <li> I really have to spent more time to get a closer shave</li>
            <li> Overall good quality easy to use and close enough shave easy to care for and like the fact you can use it wet or dry</li>
            <li> as I liked the initial shave, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying another -- just not durable enough for me.</li>
            <li> Its a lot faster shave than my old dead electric shaver and feels good.</li>
            <li> Razor seems to hold a good charge unless you are someone like me that has a thick beard.  </li>
            <li> It is very quite, and Blades are Sharp, gives a very Smooth Shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it wet, but the shave is pretty good dry.  </li>
            <li> I have used a Norelco for 20 years, was very satisfied and needed a new battery which is not available.</li>
            <li> All of the other material that I purchased was as good as any I could purchase in a local store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those who want the Jet Clean system should try the 1250cc, as long as they are willing to pay the premium and don&#x27;t mind the hassle and expense of the cleaning fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So he has had this one for a few weeks and this might be a pretty good selection for anyone with a coarse beard.</li>
            <li> I have had models with a few more features in the past, but this one gives a good shave.  </li>
            <li> Its OK but nbot like the other 4 Norelco shavers I had.</li>
            <li> I have bought other Norelco shavers before and have had outstanding results with them.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> The other feature that I like, but haven&#x27;t been able to confirm from the manual, is that the razor seems to cut off charging automatically when its fully charged.</li>
            <li> So this is more a middle-range, workhouse model without the elegance and style of the other razor.</li>
            <li> I usually have a set of replacement heads on hand ; replacing the heads on a yearly basis provides tip top performance !</li>
            <li> I had been using a Philips Norelco HS8420 (which dispenses Nivea lubricant) and was happy with it until after about a year when the blades started to dull and the shave was less comfortable.</li>
            <li> You MUST buy a whole new unit.&lt;br /&gt;Sly!  </li>
            <li> Big improvement is I can clean it in the water and not worry about it.  </li>
            <li> It is light weighted, charges up fast and shaves for a long time on a charge.</li>
            <li> The fact that it can be used both wet or dry was a huge selling point, and is probably his favorite thing about it.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than older model.</li>
            <li> It works fine and holds a charge reasonably long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still have to use a razor for the upper neck to get a  clean shove.</li>
            <li> to work looking clean, this is a solid product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do never submerge it under water, I do always use the shower to rinse it with the necessary amount of water to clean it.</li>
            <li> I bought it mainly for the sideburn trimer, and that works reasonably well.  </li>
            <li> Holds a charge a long time and works fine.  </li>
            <li> And when you are done you can quickly clean it by opening it up and dumping the hair in the garbage followed by rinsing the entire head area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice Norelco brought this back for their lower priced line as in previous product generations only the most high end shavers costing hundreds included indicator lights.</li>
            <li> Quick charging is not as quick as other models</li>
            <li> their high speeds, foil shavers don&#x27;t really cut whiskers.</li>
            <li> It is easily cleaned with hot running water, and since it can be used in the shower, there are no worries about getting too much water on it like the previous razor.  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor to replace one that uses a special shaving lotion by Nivea that can only be bought on-line because the razor is no longer being made.  </li>
            <li> Many times  I have to follow; up my shave with a conventional soap and razor bladed utensil</li>
            <li> overweight feels very cheap, my older 8891XL feels balanced, sturdy and strong, not top heavy, light weight and cheap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had other Norelco shavers in the past and they all were very good.  </li>
            <li> After nearly 20 minutes of trying to get a closer shave I finally gave up and finished the job (easily) with a manual razor.  </li>
            <li> The Wet shave is just as good as the dry shave, so I don&#x27;t bother with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no shaver head &amp;#34;Personal Comfort Control” adjustment to adjust the blade conditions against you skin as compared to the older 8891XL.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving dust does not stay contained in the head until you open it to clean it, the shaving dust falls all over the handle and makes it dirty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives him a very close shave, it&#x27;s quiet, and recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li> Much approved over my last Norelco electric razor which did an adequate job.  </li>
            <li> I get the best results getting my face wet in a hot shower,  then applying Barbasol sensitive skin shaving cream,  and using only a little pressure with it as I shave</li>
            <li> The Panasonic was okay but was a very loud razor and shaved rough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it helps me that, being an old retired fellow, I no longer shave every single day.  </li>
            <li> So far the shaves have been fast, quiet and smooth and the clean-up of the razor a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a female consumer, I can only speak to my experience, but I really think you&#x27;d be overpaying for a so-so razor with this one when the SensoTouch 2d is so much better and costs about the same.e  </li>
            <li> It glides over my face pretty well, but it some times takes two or three passes to get an area completely shaven.  </li>
            <li> Granted, we aren&#x27;t professional testers, but we tried to stay consistent in our testing.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Note: if you use the fold-out hair trimmer, the charge will not last a full fifty minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first impression of this shaver was that it didn&#x27;t feel as substantial as my old retired Norelco.</li>
            <li> In the past thirty years I&#x27;ve tried just about every kind of hair removal method there is.</li>
            <li> Good but not good for neck</li>
            <li> I finally decided to get rid of my old one (approximately 18 years old and still working flawlessly as the first day) and go for Norelco Powertouch.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> The Norelco gives a better shave than the Braun hands down.</li>
            <li> far as the value, I&#x27;d say we were prepared to spend up to a hundred, and while eighty is a bit much, if it lasts as long as they usually do, and continues to function as well as this one has so far, I feel like that&#x27;s well worth adding a bit of happy convenience to my husband&#x27;s mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My second of this type but the first one was a better dry shave.</li>
            <li> If you are shopping for a new electric razor for under 100.00 you should go with this one!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to clean, pretty quiet, and I haven&#x27;t noticed the whisker pull that a few guys have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> The shave, while not as close as a fresh blade, performs better than a slightly dull razor...</li>
            <li> This new product shaves fast and misses nothing.  </li>
            <li> However, I really like the fact that, unlike the 7000 series, the new models don&#x27;t require a charging stand.  </li>
            <li> The new razor arrived in an unbelievably fast time.  </li>
            <li> but it seems to me that i might be ready for a new head already.</li>
            <li> I had been using an older Norelco XL model, and this new model shaves much closer and faster.  </li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews, good and bad, I went against my better judgement and placed an order for this razor.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and it can get wet without concern.</li>
            <li> The Norelco is leaps and bounds better than my previous experience with electric razors.  </li>
            <li> but I do enjoy the convience of a dry shave.</li>
            <li> He likes it and uses it more than he ever used his previous electric razor.</li>
            <li> More metal, less plastic, and beefier motors.  </li>
            <li> The dry shave is about as good as my previous models but where this model really excels is in the shower with some shave gel/foam.</li>
            <li> just ok, next time I would consider a different model.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I prefer its charging AC adapter to the curly cable on older models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> -- I&#x27;ve switched to a Panasonic instead -- similar cost but super quality and speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Battery life is decent (could be longer I think)</li>
            <li> I do not have 5 minutes to wait for a quick charge as the manual says (that, if 5 minutes is enough).</li>
            <li> at least so far - the shave isn&#x27;t superior to a blade or the SensoTouch 2D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is quiet and does the job quickly</li>
            <li> That said it&#x27;s great if I&#x27;m in a big hurry or need to touch up before a late day meeting.</li>
            <li> Model 6948XL uses the older HQ56</li>
            <li> Overall, it performs as well or better than current foil shavers and provides uniform shaves somewhat faster.</li>
            <li> The razor is very quiet and shaves quickly and close.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s super quiet.</li>
            <li> I think I have had to charge mine only three times in several weeks...and one of those was on impulse/out of habit. :-)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comfort: This razor utilzes the standard three head design which is traditional of many razors out there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To summarize, I think it&#x27;s worth to buy at least AT810 for better shaving quality,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> older technology</li>
            <li> received my shaver promptly and only had a few good shaves.</li>
            <li> It does not shave that closely as my older obsolete (and 1/2 the price) electric razor.</li>
            <li> The closeness of shave is far better used wet</li>
            <li> I went from a reguralar electric razor to the Norelco which gives a decent shave.  </li>
            <li> is a lot noisier than my older and still working 8891XL</li>
            <li> They are spot welded to the inside terminals so it prevents you from replacing them when it gets older and the batteries wear out.</li>
            <li> This shaver replaced an older model with battery charging problem.</li>
            <li> in a while I have to catch an occasional hair with a safety razor, and I wouldn&#x27;t use this on my wedding day, but for every day use if you just want a quick shave that gets you</li>
            <li> I just use the Norelco when I need a quick shave before I go out in public to do my grocery shopping, Dr. appointments etc.</li>
            <li> Again, this is a decent razor but not if you want AC capability.  </li>
            <li> The razor shaves fairly decently.  </li>
            <li> Wish it had a more robust charging indicator (waits till only 5 minutes left before notifying) and came with a stand.  </li>
            <li> I just prefer rotary shavers, mainly because they are quieter than foil shavers.</li>
            <li> pleased enough with it that I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> We hope this lasts him a while, so stick around for a 2nd review to see how it performs later :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for decades and have a number of older models in a drawer in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> My main beef against this unit is the power cord.  </li>
            <li> and it actually takes me more time to use this than a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> It took me 5 minutes to figure out why they spent extra money to cripple their own product: When the battery (which you cannot replace) stops holding a charge, you cannot continue to use the shaver by keeping it plugged in.</li>
            <li> Very quiet and provides a quick shave.</li>
            <li> I replaced an older version of this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Decent price    </li>
            <li> I am used to the older models of Norelco.</li>
            <li> In short, it is a fair shaver if you want to save a few dollars.  </li>
            <li> This AT830 replaces an older Norelco that would no longer take a charge.  </li>
            <li> I used it for about 3 months and the shave was decent.</li>
            <li> So &amp;#34;we&amp;#34; highly recommend this particular razor.</li>
            <li> Clean it every other use as the blades cost as much as the whole razor.</li>
            <li> The wet shave is ok, but again, it doesn&#x27;t shave as smoothly as my Panasonic, and I had to go over the same area several times.  </li>
            <li> If this is an issue for you I highly recommend purchasing the PT730</li>
            <li> High quality and seems</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall result:  highly recommended for convenient electric shaving.</li>
            <li> This product met all my expectations and I would recommend it highly to others.  </li>
            <li> He highly recommends The Philips Norelco AT830 PowerTouch razor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The highly scientific test was for each of us to see how our shaves held up by 10 pm every night.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> highly recomend this product for your.</li>
            <li> He would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> So far so good, my spouse is African American with a very coarse beard.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of an older model; however, it is as advertised and is what I am looking for, so I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Can be used wet or dry and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I shave my head and find the three individual rotary cutters conform to the curve of my head better than the flat foil shavers.</li>
            <li> Have not done wet shaving,but I think it will do just fine.</li>
            <li> Only problem is the recharge plug falls out too easily and razor can&#x27;t be run on wall current - when the battery eventually goes, then so does the whole razor.</li>
            <li> and I still ended up with some stubble in certain spots, like under the jawline and near &#x27;edges&#x27; like sideburns and mustache.  </li>
            <li> He loves that this can be used both wet and dry, and it gives a very close shave, WAY better than the Braun Pulsonic shaver, and it keeps everything pretty neat.</li>
            <li> The charging indicator could use a little more led exposure.</li>
            <li> I have used it two weeks and each day it is a little better shave.  </li>
            <li> I even was able to give myself a little line up with the pop out extension.</li>
            <li> Nice, pretty sharp - be careful</li>
            <li> It gives a clean shave but not baby butt smooth, at least not for me.</li>
            <li> He says it works good even on his tough beard.  </li>
            <li> As it is, the removable head cover comes off the heads too easily exposing the heads to rub against other objects in a shaving kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a nice lotion after to help my skin afterwards and I try not to press too hard while shaving.</li>
            <li> It seems to me, I have to work a little more to get a closer shave with the new head design, but over all it will give years of service, and a close shave with a little bit more skin stretching.</li>
            <li> Had an older model and needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> This razor charges much faster than my old one, one hour vs eight hrs.</li>
            <li> Takes me much longer to get a close shave than the old Norelco.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my blind brother and he gets a great shave every day</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rotary shavers provide much of their action around the edges of disk-shaped \\&quot;combs\\&quot; where whiskers can slip through slots.</li>
            <li> It is very user-friendly as far as it&#x27;s operation, cleaning, understanding how to use it, etc.  </li>
            <li> , it gives me a clean smooth shave wet or dry, I do both</li>
            <li> Shave is much closer than old model.</li>
            <li> Not only does it comfortably trim my hair at several lengths, but it also gives a really close shave for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I use to the old 25-30 year models, but this one really works well.  </li>
            <li> Well I decided to try an electric razor so that I could shave everyday in hopes of not having razor burn and also looking respectable.  </li>
            <li> * Rechargeable - almost all shavers are, but worth mentioning    * replacement head cost around $25 - typically last around 6-9 months    </li>
            <li> For me, the extra $20 was worth it.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, the convenience for on-the-go shaves and when you don&#x27;t want to hassle with your normal shaving</li>
            <li> but it is several years old and the battery got so it would not hold a full charge.[[ASIN:B007SLMNFY NORELCO AT830/41 POWERTOUCH RECHARGEABLE CORDLESS RAZOR WITH SMARTPIVOT HEADS &amp; AQUATEC TECHNOLOGY -]]</li>
            <li> I bought it for the purpose that it would be faster than with a normal razor.  </li>
            <li> Norelco - it can&#x27;t cost more than a few pennies.  </li>
            <li> Tiring of the blade, I purchased this razor a few months ago and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced it was worth the additional $10 over the next lower model.</li>
            <li> so I hope they prove  true in the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had several Norelco razors in the past and all of them afforded a good shave.</li>
            <li> Good but not great razor.</li>
            <li> Good, not great.  </li>
            <li> I used a small amount of Edge Gel, flip open top, wet cutters with warm water and you will get a smooth close shave, when gel or face begins to dry, just flip open top and wet cutters again.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, my pal felt that his model was fine for him, and he&#x27;s keeping it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, just fine.</li>
            <li> bought this item brand new and found that it creates more heat in few minutes of it use.</li>
            <li> But it does, in fact, give a nice close shave, dry or wet.  </li>
            <li> The -830 might be better suited to those with less sensitive faces.</li>
            <li> But they&#x27;ve kept the same cutter design, so you get a slower, less effective shave</li>
            <li> The head pops open easily to remove stuckhair and debris, and then snaps back shut.</li>
            <li> Third, it has an easy button to flip up and open the shaving</li>
            <li> I rinse unit and leave top open so it can dry faster.</li>
            <li> This Shaver really does a good job than other shaver I have tried especially in wet shave</li>
            <li> Not much warning when its going to die; if the warning light is on, don&#x27;t start shaving, you won&#x27;t get very far.</li>
            <li> The packaging doesn&#x27;t mention it, but get the razor out of the plastic and written right on the back is MADE IN CHINA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the on/off button wouldn&#x27;t work and sometimes the razor would turn on by itself and run the battery out and sometimes the motor would seize and shut off, right in the middle of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Charges quickly and lasts a long time between charges.</li>
            <li> Yes, you can charge it for a quick 1 minute shave in a pinch, but compared to the 2D&#x27;s quick charge and power for days there&#x27;s no real comparison for the same price</li>
            <li> It charges quickly and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> The smart pivot feature is ok, but not worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> As a female consumer, I can only speak to my experience, but I really think you&#x27;d be overpaying for a so-so razor with this one when the SensoTouch 2d is so much better and costs about the same.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s the model that&#x27;s considerably more expensive, but this one works fine for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is certainly easier than using traditional razors and the product itself seems to be very well made.</li>
            <li> In retrospect, I should have paid more heed to the negative reviews which I largely agree with after using this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love the long lasting Li-Ion battery that does not fade like the old Nicad battery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Speaking about head speed, if feel very slow, but do the job, maybe this kind of Shaver dont need to much speed to cut the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just bought a new model</li>
            <li> My new Norelco AT830 has solved the problem.  </li>
            <li> New heads cost almost as much as a new razor.  </li>
            <li> He resisted getting a new electric razor</li>
            <li> was tempted to buy the new floating head style, but didn&#x27;t feel the need to change what I already</li>
            <li> you probably add up buying the cost of the razors and the chances of a new one being ..</li>
            <li> The new shaver appears and sounds cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have been using my new Norelco AT830 for about a month.  </li>
            <li> It was a brand new model so there was a delay, it shipped to me on 2/9.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being new, it cuts effortlessly.</li>
            <li> but of course it&#x27;s still a new machine/battery, so we won&#x27;t know if the performance of the battery will deteriorate over time.</li>
            <li> This new razor takes just one hour for a 50 minute charge.  </li>
            <li> It was cheaper to just buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new and see if Norelco had caught up or maybe surpassed Panasonic electric razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m uncertain what my new razor will require.</li>
            <li> and I figured I would splurge and purchase a new one for fathers day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery - even it&#x27;s a brand new device</li>
            <li> so I decided to look for a brand new one that was usable in the shower.</li>
            <li> WiLl probably seek a new electric shaver .</li>
            <li> I returned this immediately and bought a new Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV Wet/Dry Shaver.</li>
            <li> But with a 2-1/2 year warranty you should be covered and after that it&#x27;s probably time for a new one anyway.e anyway.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new rechargeable razor.</li>
            <li> It gets as close as one of the new blade types.</li>
            <li> so I bough a new one</li>
            <li> I purchase a new unit about every two years.</li>
            <li> The closeness of shave was like a new day in the life of my stubble.</li>
            <li> I wanted a new Norelco that didn&#x27;t break the bank and still gave me a close shave.  </li>
            <li> This new razor shave so close and so effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> My husband needed a new razor.  </li>
            <li> I had not owned an electric razor in over 20 years and in that time the technology had changed and I should take some time to learn to use my new electric razor before I passed judgment</li>
            <li> live overseas</li>
            <li> This new one charges fully in an hour.  </li>
            <li> Once the battery is worn out, you have to purchase a new razor.</li>
            <li> This one I&#x27;ve had for 15 years, I just buy new blades when needed.</li>
            <li> It was time for new blades on my old Panasonic, so I decided to shop for a new shaver and try this Norelco rotary shaver, what a mistake!</li>
            <li> Makes shaving quick and holds a very long charge.</li>
            <li> I use this as a dry shaver and it does a quick and thorough</li>
            <li> When you charge the battery, you can&#x27;t tell whether the battery is full or half full or drained although the picture on the box suggests digital display of percentage of charging.</li>
            <li> I have a rough and nappy beard like most people of African descent.  </li>
            <li> started out using it dry, but quickly switched to shaving in the shower with it.</li>
            <li> That old one still works, but the blades needed to be replaced and the razor costs almost as much as the blades, (I have since found out on youtube how to sharpen them again on an old mirror).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I really like that I am able to use either wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I wish the indicator on the front gave me a battery meter with remaining charge instead of just a flashing light that tells me when the battery is low.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d find myself needing to go over the same areas repeatedly, but maybe my strong masculine facial features extend to my stubble as well.</li>
            <li> My old razor with year and a half old blades still does a better job.</li>
            <li> But I miss my old Phillips which was loud, not recharchable, not resistant to water, but it was really fast shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, and although still not as close as a blade, it is better than I expected.</li>
            <li> The charge has held for two an a half weeks and is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> As far as the quality of the shave, it&#x27;s fairly good for me, as I have a thin beard.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my father to replace a very old Norelco Razor that needed new blades.  </li>
            <li> is very Soft, the battery has long duration, fast rechargeable and washable, that was exactly that I looking for me</li>
            <li> I use it dry every other day and it does a nice job, not as close as a regular razor, but still pretty close.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still doing fine, and I believe my shaving time is cut down by about a minute.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone that has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Close shave, quiet, long time between charges, easy to clean, wet or dry,comfortable grip.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Related feature is that the back is hinged so I can clean out both areas while holding the razor normally.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps new batteries on their first charge last longer.</li>
            <li> It charges in about an hour, just like the product details say, and while I&#x27;m not sure exactly how long it actually lasts, I&#x27;d be willing to believe the promised 50 minutes, because he&#x27;s used it several days and the power is just as good after that one charge, no decrease in performance as the charge goes</li>
            <li> Quite satisfactory but not quite as good as a sharp razor blade though far less chance of drawing blood.</li>
            <li> It shaves very cleanly, gets into difficult spots around my mouth and the grip permits accurate detailing.  </li>
            <li> but this one gives me the closest and most comfortable shave of any of them (at least wet).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to be able to rinse it off without worries about getting the wrong part wet.  </li>
            <li> As of yet, it has not been any different and my satisfaction is pretty low.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the convenience of simply rinsing under hot water.</li>
            <li> Was I surprised!  </li>
            <li> IT WAS A BIT CHALLENGING GETTING THE GIFT, BUT AS USUAL AMAZON GOT IT TO ME JUST IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is a breeze - just open and rinse under hot water, then air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleaning is a breeze - just open and rinse under hot water, then air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these shavers now for nearly 50 years!</li>
            <li> I really like Norelco in general and would recommend the AT830 to someone looking for a mid-level cordless razor.</li>
            <li> This one works fine but no advance warning when you need to recharge, unlike the previous versions.</li>
            <li> AT830 actually gave me a better shave than the fancier and more expensive SensoTouch.</li>
            <li> A fine replacement for my previous norelco.  </li>
            <li> , and I tried one extra test once we got our original razors back after week</li>
            <li> He uses it pretty regularly</li>
            <li> The only way to get a closer shave is with a multiple bladed razor, hot shaving cream and hot water.</li>
            <li> but it caught me by surprise the first time I went to plug it in and use it at the same time since it needed a charge boost.</li>
            <li> It is well worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> This is the first one to actually work on my neck.</li>
            <li> and you can complete a shave!</li>
            <li> First I would say I was concerned about buying this shaver because of some of the low ratings.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another plus is that no expensive cleaning solutions are needed to maintain this model,  just push a button and the head folds open for you to rinse all the gunk and whiskers out!  </li>
            <li> The person I bought this for seemed to like it at first (a month or so) then went back to shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li> how low end this supposedly higher end shaver is.</li>
            <li> I was going to order the exact same model my husband uses because I like how well his shaves.</li>
            <li> My first shave was closer than a \\&quot;real\\&quot; shave, with no discomfort and VERY quiet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  My third Philips Norelco Aquatec razor has now joined the first two among the ranks of the non-functioning.</li>
            <li> This was my first, and last rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> I used a rotary razor many years ago but have been using a foil type razor for the past 30 years.</li>
            <li> So no more memory issues with NiCad or NiMh and lipo has better performance than either of those two.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Take the rotary cutters out of the head a couple times a year, soak them in alcohol, then put them back in, making sure that you put the cutters back in the same screens.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are other significant design flaws.  </li>
            <li> Other Norelcos that I have owned did not have any of these significant design</li>
            <li> When I got into the shower afterword and the hot water hit my face it actually burned where I had shaved.  </li>
            <li> the best.&lt;br /&gt;The razor has reduced the amount of redness I normally experience, but the shave is not that close, as compared to my 10 year old Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I run it over my neck in particular or how hard I press, there is always stubble remaining.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything that really sets it apart from the lower price units, especially the older ones that did not use li-ion batteries.</li>
            <li> the panasonic one was uncomfortable, it became hot after a minute of use (because of the friction) and the shaving wasnt even that good, recently I decided to buy yet another one, and since I missed the norelco so badly, i decided to get another onbe, this time a really wet/dry type, it was even better that the first norelco, smooth shave,</li>
            <li> While I could have repaired it easily I opted for a new razor as I was intrigued with the idea of using it wet and cleaning it with a wash and the total cost for blades and a new battery</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve gotta pull your skin pretty tight to get it to work right, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First use was clean and soft even if you rub against your face in opposite direction of hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;While I did struggle a bit in the neck area, it was due to my fear of getting cut..</li>
            <li> He also needed a new shaver thanks to a dying battery, so we both decided to buy a new model at the same time.  </li>
            <li> my old 7735X go after two weeks with the new models?  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;A coiled cord which is easier and neater - luckily my old coiled cord worked on the new razor so</li>
            <li> the old ones never died i just wanted new ones.</li>
            <li> It seemed that the foil shaver, even a cheap one, cuts closer and with less irritation than a rotary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> how well it would work on a thick beard, but for an average shadow it works great.</li>
            <li> I always shave wet and this gives me what I need to get the job done quickly and without being cut</li>
            <li> he usually had to shave every day with his old shaver, but for this one, he&#x27;s been able to go up to 2-3 days before even looking like he had a 5&#x27;oclock shadow.</li>
            <li> in the User&#x27;s Manual it is recommended that you DO NOT submerge this razor - despite its ability to be used wet or dry, and the fact that it is recommended that you clean it under running hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Love the short charging time and the long lasting battery power.</li>
            <li> The old Norelco razor he had was about 30 years old!</li>
            <li> My son absolutely loves this razor and it is the first electric razor he has owned, he said he will never go back to a regular razor again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;THis happens because first round of electric shave makes your skin so smooth that you don&#x27;t feel an even liitle effort in your second</li>
            <li> It has a rubber grip that makes it easy to handle, especially when using it while wet, or cleaning it under the faucet.  </li>
            <li> This should be able to cut any beard wet or dry.</li>
            <li> AT830 is similar to previous generations of Norelcos, but is better in some ways.</li>
            <li> I found it better to shave dry than wet</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get much use from the awkward to hold  trimmer or close shave under the nose, but an inexpensive trimmer can supplement this otherwise pleasant process.</li>
            <li> Kudos to Amazon on the 830 return and quick 810 shipping of now my current daily shaving buddy!</li>
            <li> I can only imagine that Norelco is trying to hold down the price, but an extra couple of dollars for a case would be nice.  </li>
            <li> He has always had Norelco&#x27;s &amp; they don&#x27;t wear out very often, so this one replaces a very old one, but it&#x27;s the same style &amp; brand.</li>
            <li> Quite quiet for an electric razor as well, and the ability to use it wet as well as dry is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> The rotary heads don&#x27;t have smart pivot, but they still flex enough to contour to your face.  </li>
            <li> blade\\&quot; as they say, it is certainly close enough considering you won&#x27;t need to drop any money on multi-blade cartridges ever again.  </li>
            <li> Although this electric razor is very good for the face area, I broke out with a really bad skin irritation</li>
            <li> It takes 5 times as long as my old norelco to disassemble, clean and put back together.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day, but there are so many models, it&#x27;s hard to choose one.  </li>
            <li> and I have not been able to find if there is a hard case for it.  </li>
            <li> The only difference between the two is the \\&quot;Smart Pivot\\&quot; system on the 830, and I&#x27;d read mixed reviews as to whether it really mattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I admit that I set a high standard for razors, since I normally use a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> My earlier model Norelco did not do this and instead had only a normal electrical plug, which fact I very much</li>
            <li> It shaves fairly closely and though it left a rash the first few times I used it, my skin is growing accustomed to the blades so there now is very little irratation.  </li>
            <li> had an older norelco shaver so this wasn&#x27;t a total ly new experience.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li> The razor was shipped very promptly, and delivery time was much quicker than expected.  </li>
            <li> The AT830 isn&#x27;t that inexpensive, it&#x27;s nearly $90.  </li>
            <li> Beware if you have coarsehair or sensitive</li>
            <li> The shave is very close without pulling on facial hairs, and the razor does not miss any hairs.  </li>
            <li> This is an old guy talking, don&#x27;t know how it will work with a young man&#x27;s iron bristles.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t, however, expect a shave anywhere near as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one to replace one I had for nearly 15 years.  </li>
            <li> The charge stays for a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> Well, it might have something to do with my old (also Phillips) shaver being -</li>
            <li> oh, around 10 years old - and never having replaced the heads -</li>
            <li> where I could really just go back in forth which is much easier than using my standard disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> purchased this razor from Amazon and was surprised to see &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34; on the box.</li>
            <li> Since I felt like I got over on the big box retailer I don&#x27;t really care for, I decided to keep the razor that they took a loss on as a trophy.</li>

            <li> my old Remington did.</li>
            <li> As some others have pointed out, the rotary heads have a bit of a problem on the upper lip, however you can get used to this, at which point there really isn&#x27;t much of a problem.</li>
            <li> I struggled ten minutes a shave and then noticed I&#x27;d missed whole tufts here and there.  </li>
            <li> and I am ready to send it back.</li>
            <li> My Lady out of nowhere remarked \\&quot;Wow the irritation on your neck has completely cleared up\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first waterproof electric razor and now that I using it, I wish I&#x27;d made the switch a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Then you only have to use a straight edge for perilous circumstances, i.e. job interview.</li>
            <li> the way my old one did.</li>
            <li> So far no complaints about the product.</li>
            <li> Bottom portion of the chin, moustache hair near to the nose , hairs 2 cmb below the ears.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about this at first, because unlike a lot of men who can whip thru a shave in 3 - 5 minutes, I seem to take almost twice as long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it a 1 star rating because it doesn&#x27;t really work on my face.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a trihead shaver to replace my old one.  </li>
            <li> Wahl Professional 8061 5-star Series Rechargeable Shaver ).  </li>
            <li> No case for traveling, however it fits into my old shavers case.  </li>
            <li> so I will continue to use my old cover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used electric razors my whole life.</li>
            <li> It connects directly to AC power.</li>
            <li> Performance has improved over the Norelco rotary shavers of years ago--the brand Philips distributed in North America before the early 1980s.</li>
            <li> After using it for a couple of weeks, I found that I couldn&#x27;t get as close a shave as with my old 7735X model with the weakening battery.  </li>
            <li> the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon learning of the newer Aquatec models, a friend (who&#x27;s also a Norelco wet/dry fan)</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin and have used electric razors for 20 years.</li>
            <li> I have used a Norelco razor for 30 or 40 years with complete satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> then it is to keep it old school with razor and cream.</li>
            <li> the old one is gone</li>
            <li> Surprised it worked so well.  </li>
            <li> Now that is electric shaving bliss as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> So far this shaver isn&#x27;t living up to the adverts.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how ancient my old Norelco electric shaver had become (it&#x27;s probably 20 years old) until I purchased the Norelco AT830 w/Aquatec Electric Razor.</li>
            <li> Still have the old one as a backup in case.</li>
            <li> Direct quote: &amp;#34;It pivots!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Quiet and fast.</li>
            <li> This product is complete garbage, save yourself and find something else.</li>
            <li> REPLACED MY 10 YEAR OLD NORELCO -</li>
            <li> When I received this one, I was quite surprised with the ergonomic improvements and the reduced noise level that it operated at.</li>
            <li> Also, if you use this razor on soft areas (like your neck) it WILL razorburn you if you put the slightest pressure against your skin.  </li>
            <li> Husband said the razor doesn&#x27;t work as well as his old one that EXPIRED....</li>
            <li> It would have been three years old in August</li>
            <li> My old Norelco shavers lasted a lot longer than this one did.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> My first electric shaver 30 years ago was a Norelco that lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get a very close shave, especially on the neck.</li>
            <li> I got some abrasions on the sections of my shoulders near my neck.  </li>
            <li> carrying case so keep your old one -</li>
            <li> Gentile on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> old Norelco.</li>
            <li> - I don&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;rough or heavy beard&amp;#34;, really a light beard</li>
            <li> I like that is quiet, shaves very well.</li>
            <li> Does everything I wanted plus surprised me with battery life.</li>
            <li> It will be returned tomorrow and for $9 I will buy the *Battery Replacement Kit* which is sold here on Amazon or eBay and fix my old shaver.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s used Norelco for as long as we&#x27;ve been married.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also quicker to complete my shave.  </li>
            <li> and it feels a bit rougher against my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so it will completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li> so it will completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li> The PT730 is also much cheaper but looks and feel s the same.  </li>
            <li> Compared to what I had before it is a &#x27;WOW&#x27; factor</li>
            <li> Or at least be able to buy one.</li>
            <li> So as far as functionality goes it would rate a 5.  </li>
            <li> I frequently skip a day and even with a two-day beard, this Norelco does the job.</li>
            <li> It keeps a charge for a reasonable amount of time and after having dropped it, obviously accidentally, from a height of about 4</li>
            <li> Now I will have to order another set of the Norelco razor heads to use in the old Razor for myself..  </li>
            <li> Mine is about a year old and no complaints.</li>
            <li> My neck skin is really sensitive but with this electric razor I have no problems</li>
            <li> Very quiet and shaves very well.</li>
            <li> In the short time that I have been using this product, I find it to be almost as close a shave as a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> Replaced my old (really old, about 25 years)</li>
            <li> almost needed earplugs with the 25 year old Norelco).</li>
            <li> When my old Norelco was put to rest, I bought this newer model.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my old Norelco  razor that was not holding its charge.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My husband replaced his old Norelco that he had for 10 years with this model.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how old the shaver was</li>
            <li> The razor is somewhat noisier than my old one.  </li>
            <li> As far as the price point, I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> but they need to make some changes to get this razor up to the old Norelco standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heavy and durable, not like some of the cheap lightweight shavers that I&#x27;ve bought before.  </li>
            <li> Cordless  Fast charging (After initial charge of course)  </li>
            <li> Charges fast and keeps the charge for several shaves.</li>
            <li> and I used to have an old model of philips</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m graduating from my old [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life lasts pretty long before a charge</li>
            <li> I when I got home I got rid of that old manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I when I got home I got rid of that old manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old Norelco&#x27;s battery was fading - had to start recharging once a week</li>
            <li> hope it maintains its action.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to replace his old Norelco razor.</li>
            <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t have a closeness setting and doesn&#x27;t come with a case or stand, all features his old Norelco had.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this Norelco for nearly 2 years, no performance problems.</li>
            <li> i opened up the battery case and it was completely ruined with water damage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the \\&quot;Philips Norelco AT830\\&quot; for a few months, and it was purchased as a replacement for an earlier model which I thoroughly enjoyed using.</li>
            <li> The battery takes several hours to charge but is worth the time because they last forever.</li>
            <li> I figured there had to be some advances in the last few years, but there don&#x27;t seem to be many.  </li>
            <li> The battery is long lasting and charges up quickly.  </li>
            <li> When using a new shaving method, it generally takes a week to get use to it.  </li>
            <li> I do have to rinse the trimmer heads with hot water when I shave, and I remove them to let them dry when I&#x27;m finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> The older Norelco came with a hard travel case that won&#x27;t fit the AT830</li>
            <li> As with any new razor you have to utilize it enough for your body to adjust to the new cut.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth it to get AT830 and pay a little more since I&#x27;m not sure the AT730 works the jawline that closely.  </li>
            <li> thing is quiet, easy to maneuver, and leaves no irritation on black skin.  </li>
            <li> No longer needing to shave daily, I get away easily with charging it about once a week, or less.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s worth to pay additional $9 to get smart pivot (AT830).</li>
            <li> I have had it a few weeks now and am still on my original battey charge.</li>
            <li> You can use it wet with gel or dry and both give a very good, if not great shave.</li>
            <li> Most electrics say not to push too hard but pushing a little harder on the AT830 produces a slightly better shave - on my skull.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The battery life lasts for a very long time and it takes about an hour to get back to a full-charge when the low battery light goes on.</li>
            <li> above all, it seems nicks and, for the most part, razor burn are a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> I do pop the head open and rinse the entire business end with hot water every day,</li>
            <li> However, there are only 9 blades on an HQ8 cutter versus 15 blades on an older HQ56 cutter.</li>
            <li> he is post op and is doing decently with his left hand all things considered.  </li>
            <li> So whilst not previously sold on electric shavers</li>
            <li> This was a gift for dad seeing that the one prior is older than I am.</li>
            <li> Larger print would help us older guys</li>
            <li> In the last six months of use, there have been no cuts, unlike my older model.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Decent shaver, only downside that doesn&#x27;t make sense is that you can&#x27;t shave while the charger is plugged in.</li>
            <li> Finally, $25 bucks a year to replace the blades plus the initial investment seem a small price for a shaver that does the job just as well if not better than most electrics and many blades.</li>
            <li> big upgrade from my last Norelco is the sink cleaning capability - turn the water on hot and hose it out (blade area and cavity).  </li>
            <li> They picked these particular models, they researched multiple brands and picked these!</li>
            <li> I wanted a decent mid line razor.</li>
            <li> When you first use it you may think it&#x27;s not powerful enough because there isn&#x27;t a feel of strong motor rotation of the blades compared to other shavers.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;full-charge in 1 hour\\&quot; is definitely a big step up from the normal 8 hours charging time of many models, current and past.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a highly rated Panasonic triple blade foil razor the last five or so years, and I don&#x27;t remember it ever working as well as this.</li>
            <li> Overall I highly recomend.</li>
            <li> well, no complaint, worth the money, especially if it last as long as my last one.</li>
            <li> Quiet and light weight, but no better than my older Norelco electric razor.</li>
            <li> so when my old one finally gave up the ghost, I went shopping for a new one.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that it performs better and causes less irritation when wet shaving.</li>
            <li> One of the things that I enjoy about this razor is that you can use it dry or use it wet (with shaving cream).</li>
            <li> buy me a round trip plane ticket, I will take one step off the plane, kick you in the balls as hard as I can and fly back home.  </li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, I tried the last wet/dry model (the 8060X) with the fully exposed shaving heads attached to a single stalk.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the pivoting head on the 830 makes a huge difference or not</li>
            <li> After reading a few good and bad reviews I ended selecting this for a Christmas gift and now I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> This AT830 is at least the equal of my old one and probably better.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about not having a battery level indicator though it does have a recharge light.</li>
            <li> I find the cost reasonable as it&#x27;s predecessor lasted a long while</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected and I&#x27;ve had no issues with this model that would cause me to replace it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Drying after shave could be dificult, dont specified if you can let it wet after putting under hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cut is fairly close (depends on how thick your hair is) and I only needed minimal touch ups with a blade after using the shaver.</li>
            <li> And I do prefer a rotary blade electric shaver more than all the other electric shavers due to their overall comfort for shaving and the total ease of cleaning by just putting the open shaver under hot water after each shave.  </li>
            <li> However, a little more time will be spent cleaning the shaver.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my father and he has a little trouble with turning it on.&lt;br /&gt;Gives a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> This is a very good shaver, and priced inexpensively enough so that it isn&#x27;t nearly as painful to buy as some have been.</li>
            <li> On the other hand,in a completely dry environment, it cuts just as smooth as it would in (non-scalding) water</li>
            <li> , however I quickly discovered it is only a CORDLESS model - in other words</li>
            <li> It is amazingly quiet, and I can hardly tell it is working, as there is no effect at all on my skin, but like magic the beard hairs are gone after a swipe or two with the shaver.  </li>
            <li> He has only used the new one since receiving it,  </li>
            <li> I thought this would go away after a couple of weeks like the manual said (it takes several weeks for your skin to acclimate to a new razor)</li>
            <li> Just replaced the blades after several years - shaves like new again.</li>
            <li> Have only used this new one for a couple of days, but the quality still seems to be there, I swear by Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I finally took it apart after two months of use, and the blades/housings were like new, and had no buildup of hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this product new in package from a local vendor.</li>
            <li> Using shave gel really helped give me a closer shave than shaving dry</li>
            <li> When using it dry, it leaves my skin really dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros;&lt;br /&gt;-Sleek design&lt;</li>
            <li> Though it still feels odd to rinse an electric appliance immediately after use, such care does keep the blades and the stubble despository clean without electrocuting me.</li>
            <li> So much easier to dry shave with this</li>
            <li> and although the shave does not last as long a  raiser, but pretty close to it.</li>
            <li> I began using this product with shaving gel and water for the first few days before I went back to a full on dry shave.  </li>
            <li> When used with care, this model really does get close enough to approach the same results as a non-electric shave.  </li>
            <li> This razor was to replace my old 25 year old Norelco which I had the batteries replaced 5 times by a local battery repair shop.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does has only a \\&quot;battery charging\\&quot; and low battery indicator, not a gauge for how much charge is there.</li>
            <li> not, I used it everyday for 1, 2 almost 3 weeks before the low charge warning light came on.</li>
            <li> They all still use the same basic rotary blade sets...because they work really well.</li>
            <li> They sounded like they were not spinning fast enough for a proper shave.</li>
            <li> Not only does it not produce a reasonably close shave but produces irritation and rash even after several weeks of use.</li>
            <li> If you have a real heavy beard you will most likely have a heavier 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving, this shaver does better than most.</li>
            <li> so glad I paid the little extra in the long run anyway...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had Braun shavers to this point in my life and all of them were very loud.  </li>
            <li> I have a full beard, so I only shave with the shaver on the sides of my cheeks to get rid of the few straggler hairs outside of the main beard.  </li>
            <li> I have a very heavy and tough beard, but very sensitive skin; which resulted in quickly dulling most electric razor blades and ruining their foils, and causing razor-burns to my skin in order to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> [4/5]: The razor gets a four out of five because I feel it has two major flaws.</li>
            <li> I would have thought that there would have been major changes in technology in a 30 years.</li>
            <li> At first my skin would get extremely irritated when I used this, however, now I can use it with no</li>
            <li> I shaved with a blade for many years, but have tried several different electrics over the past year because I like the convenience of not having to stand in front of a bathroom mirror to shave.</li>
            <li> (01/10/2014) - Husband wants me to stress that there are 2 things he did that he thought will be useful to share - 1) since he switched from using a razor blade, he said at first your skin will burn and feel uncomfortable after the shave, but don&#x27;t give up, after 2-3 weeks, your skin will get use to it.</li>
            <li> It was kept clean, used only for dry shaves, charged regularly but not left</li>
            <li> The sideburns trimmer really doesn&#x27;t seem to do too much, but that&#x27;s been a common complaint with most of my Norelco razors.</li>
            <li> After a overnight charge the AT830 plowed through my thick, coarse, dense overgrowth only pausing for an occasional rinse under some warm running water with the lid popped.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think any electric razor will beat a &amp;#34;real razor.&amp;#34; But as I get older it really doesn&#x27;t matter if I have a little stubble, and besides it gives me the&lt;br</li>
            <li> Repair places are far and few between, and even if you do find one, it&#x27;s almost as much to \\&quot;repair\\&quot; as purchasinga new unit.</li>
            <li> While I found the shave to be quite close and the razor made quick work of my stubble, I&#x27;m not sure how much of this is due to the fact that the blades were new.  </li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve always had to shave with an electric, then clean up the stray hairs with a razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting a fast very close dry shave, haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The main difference between this and the Panasonic that I mentioned earlier is that you  don&#x27;t need to do multiple passes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are so many electric razors out now, I know it&#x27;s a tough decision-</li>
            <li> only thing I miss is the digital display on the older model.</li>
            <li> For price of razor, why not include at least a cheap pouch to pack for travel?</li>
            <li> Husband is generally a blade man, but after a bit of getting used to it, he loves this Phillips Electric.  </li>
            <li> The improvements I found in my latest purchase: (1) Improvement in shape and fits the hand comfortably.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though it is listed as a wet and dry shaver, do not immerse it in water-use running water only over the heads and the brush to clean it.</li>
            <li> (you can readily feel that it is not a very close shave).</li>
            <li> only con, so far, would be that it does miss hairs when he&#x27;s shaving his \\&quot;neck-</li>
            <li> My husband still feels like it&#x27;s quite an upgrade from his last old razor, so, we&#x27;re happy!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It shaves the same as my 7 year old Norelco 7140XL.  </li>
            <li> The AT830 isn&#x27;t as sturdy or well made as the 2D, and it takes longer to charge it (5hrs per the book for a &#x27;complete&#x27; charge) with only a 50 minute charged shave time.  </li>
            <li> I recently replaced my 12 year old Norelco Razor with this Aquatec.</li>
            <li> but it was too bulky, loud, and still left me with irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 17 yr old son uses this regularly with no copmplaint, however.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been partial to a straight blade razor.</li>
            <li> I have even not expected that.</li>
            <li> razor is really quiet compared to the old one.</li>
            <li> I took my old 7735 out of retirement for one last shave.  </li>
            <li> but my beard is very aggressive and rough (shave 2</li>
            <li> I can barely feel it working, but boy does it ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to my old plug in model.  </li>
            <li> This product definitely is not for everyone with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to a really close shave with a ProGlide razer and this doesn&#x27;t come remotely close.  </li>
            <li> It does not shave a close as my old screen razor, especially along the jaw line and on my neck.  </li>
            <li> only problem I had was when I was shaving near the bottom of my neck</li>
            <li> as the shelves were nearly bare</li>
            <li> If your man has a beard that he cannot remove completely, then this shaver is for definitely for him.  </li>
            <li> My old Norelco Reflex Plus Model 6863 LX that cost me $69 several years ago has: A: 5 level battery life indicator lights and B: If the battery does die while shaving you can just plug it in the wall and finish your shave.</li>
            <li> The only improvement over the old 7140xl is that this have a pivoting front/back motion added to it.</li>
            <li> Needed it to replace a 10 or 15 year old Norelco on its last legs that I dropped.and came a-part.</li>
            <li> I had an old Philips/Norelco for about 20 years and it finally gave out.</li>
            <li> I had to switch back to my old razor to finish the job.</li>
            <li> He said the way it pivots on his face is a big improvement over his old razor.</li>
            <li> Also I have tried three different shaving gels (for sensitive skin), none of which helped or improved closeness or rash development.</li>
            <li> So far I have charged it only once since it arrived</li>
            <li> I have been getting thus far, but only when using shave cream and water.</li>
            <li> Shaver works very well, as expected.</li>
            <li> In reviewing this product, I first provide a caveat - I&#x27;ve never used a cordless razor before as I have partial to the traditional blade and foam.</li>
            <li> Poor didn&#x27;t find the address then took to many days</li>
            <li> When I clean the unit with water the water seems to find places to hide and will run down my hand while shaving even though I have allowed it to dry for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> First of all, if you don&#x27;t want a bunch of details, just scroll down to the IN SUMMARY paragraph at the end!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I drip dry it, and will put blowdryer on high to force any remaining water in the cracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only charged twice since new and husband has been using it daily.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Norelco wet-or-dry razors, I experience far less skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s had it for less than a week now, but so far, he really likes it.</li>
            <li> It has been a long time since I bought a new electric, and advancements have been made.  </li>
            <li> This one removes hairs in places that the narrow neck models could not get to, like right under the nose.  </li>
            <li> not what i EXPECTED DOES does not give a clean shave does leaves face with facial hairs and rough face</li>
            <li> It is exactly what Norelco Should have evolved into given their previous line  of product.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> and I would have to go over areas multiple times for it to cut anything, while other trimmers work the first time.</li>
            <li> this model gives me an adequate shaved, no more.</li>
            <li> It seems to hold a charge longer than my past models and charges fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> Despite having been a loyal customer in the past, my perception is the Philips Norelco are no longer producing a quality product.</li>
            <li> I like it every bit as much as the older ones, if not more.</li>
            <li> UPDATE, Don&#x27;t care for this Razor as much as I thought I did, takes forever to shave unless you shave everyday, Will not get the long ones unless you really work at it.</li>
            <li> I have owned 3 other Norelco razors and have found them to be very durable</li>
            <li> It to hard to clean.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly like a blade but very acceptable.  </li>
            <li> It shaves sufficiently close for my liking, although a guy with a lot of thick facial hair might always prefer a straight razor unless he&#x27;s willing to use an electric twice a day to keep up with his growth rate.  </li>
            <li> i am disappointed at phillips for discontinuing the rq12 heads as i have two shavers which i liked very much.</li>
            <li> Only dry,  The only down side is that Phillips has been cheap with the gadgetry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to replacing blades on a stick razor every week, the cost of buying a new electric shaver every two years and replacing the blades once is still less than the cost of a new stick blade every week.  </li>
            <li> It was like a trip down memory lane in that it was very much the same as the Norelco that I used in my youth.</li>
            <li> At first, I mistakenly felt that since this razor was so quiet that it was not powerful.  </li>
            <li> shave one time, with the grain\\&quot; people, with sensitive skin as well as coarse facial hair.  </li>
            <li> The shaver shaves as expected but there is no indicator as to how much of a charge is left on the batteries.</li>
            <li> none has ever &amp;#34;quit on me--&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve simply replaced each one when it was ten years old</li>
            <li> My old one (which was a similar price level back then)</li>
            <li> my 5 year old Norelco 7140 quit working so had to run to to the local Mart store and pick up a shaver before I left.....</li>
            <li> I spent several minutes working the Norelco over my skin, stretching the skin, going &#x27;against the grain&#x27;, circular and straight motions...</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for an earlier model that I left in a motel room, and the old model didn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;tilting&amp;#34; face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Norelco, so pretty reliable - not great, but this is a average price razor so can&#x27;t expect it to perform like the $150 one - but shaves well, cleans well, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> A simple rinse and its done, add in that it gets a full charge in about an hour I am not sure what else it could offer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noted a steady decline in the quality and closeness of the shave delivered by newer models but, nevertheless, decided to try the AT830 and wet shaving.</li>
            <li> All our outlets are old, so few of them can support the weight of the square plug AND the razor, and plenty of outlets don&#x27;t have enough space above them anyway for the full height of the plugged dock and razor, like his old one, and even if there is room, it often blocks the other outlet.</li>
            <li> I cheated a little not using a pair of scissors first.</li>
            <li> major problem I have always had is that electric razors have never given me a close enough shave</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints with this razor and would highly recommended it.</li>

            <li> Yes they last a long time, cut your beard short and tight and clean up with water.  </li>
            <li> Out of the box, the initial charge only took a few minutes to get a level that allowed me to take a quick \\&quot;five minute\\&quot; test shave, which, since I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair to begin with, is about all I need anyways.  </li>
            <li> Very close shave, water proof, lasts a long time on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> so I really explored the various choices, and have bought other brands.</li>
            <li> You must take apart to clean and it is way to hard to put back together.  </li>
            <li> The closeness and time shaving were about the same, but I got less irritation with the AT830, particularly in the sensitive area below my chin.</li>
            <li> He has extremely sensitive skin and as such, has problems shaving with a traditional hand-held blade razor.  </li>
            <li> They are apparently intended to emulate the performance of foil shavers, handling short whiskers so that they are squarely cut.</li>
            <li> and I no longer have to run the shaver over my beard multiple times to get a barely acceptable shave as I did with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> it is what I would expect of an electric razor - not nearly as close as my old faithful Gillette Mach 3.</li>
            <li> This razor is several generations later, and I was surprised that the shave had actually improved quite a lot.</li>
            <li> so when the battery eventually becomes weak or unreliable you will still be able to shave with the PT730 for as long as you need to whereas the AT830 will probably need replacement.</li>
            <li> My first Remington electric died after a few years and couldn&#x27;t be recharged.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terribly useful for lazy people like me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As was my complaint with the 1150x/40, the moment I powered on the AT830 and heard how quiet and slow moving the heads were, I had my doubts about how good the shave would be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old enough to have owned corded razors when battery operated were rare, and it was a bit of a pain to keep them plugged in while shaving, but my experience with battery razors has been that they grow so weak they become almost unusable, and you have to buy a new entire razor when only blade replacement should be required.</li>
            <li> To mow down a 3 or 4 day growth before a real shave with a blade.</li>
            <li> The quality standards of this company have really gone down.</li>
            <li> I was at first a little perturbed that they did not send a charging stand for it, but rather only a charging cord.</li>
            <li> Cleanup is a quick and simple rinse under hot water, no fussing with cumbersome cleaners and expensive cleaning solution refills.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looking at the inside of the blades you can see that the new one has only half of blades comparing to the old one.</li>
            <li> It took me half the time when compared to using my Gillette fusion proglide, and also much safer.</li>
            <li> My brother really like it a lot, less time in the restroom</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quiet: I found this razor much quieter than my previous three head razor (also a philips model) and my wife even noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> Less irritation and VERY close.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, what I do like about this Norelco as compared to the much pricier Panasonic is that it is cheaper, quieter and the maintenance cost is less.  </li>
            <li> As a black man with Pseudofolliculitis Barbae, I&#x27;m very cautious about any shaving product and over the years</li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;m shaving less real estate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have owned several razors over the and in general always had problems getting a lasting close shave.  </li>
            <li> I had been shaving with a Schick Quattro razor since the batteries on my old Norelco died, but the blades were not lasting as long as they used to-</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it I gave up after a few minutes and went back to a manual razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky this sucker didn&#x27;t explode on me.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new electric shaver without the unnecessary additions more commonly seen in the new brands.</li>
            <li> I get a close shave with this model in a single pass and can do a complete shave, around my goatee, in a matter of 10-15 seconds per day.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;new\\&quot; Norelco shavers that use the lithium batteries run at about half the speed (or less) of the original ones that used a pair of rechargeable AA batteries.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before buying this product, because he has a very heavy beard,  and thought I was purchasing the right electric razor.</li>
            <li> After having a Norelco CoolSkin razor for so many years, it was a little weird at first to go back to an electric shaver without a lotion dispenser</li>
            <li> The last one, eight years old, still works but the battery just does not last as long as it use to.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a shame, because the trimmer helps in shaving under my nose and in a couple of other areas where the normal heads will not reach.</li>
            <li> I ordered a set of new blades at the same time, since I expected to need them in 3 months.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t shave as fast as the wet and dry Panasonic, but gives a close shave even though.</li>
            <li> Very close shave whether it is dry shave or wet shave, doesn&#x27;t burn skin or anything.</li>
            <li> I decided to get this because it is wet and dry capable, also can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> Once that happened, I found that this machine shaved very quickly and efficiently, and seldom left any hair behind.</li>
            <li> This honestly cuts the same as my 15 year old norelco and no better or worse...</li>
            <li> I have only dry shaved with it now but it is very adaptable to wet shaves which I plan on doing.  </li>
            <li> I really gave it a chance and used it 8 different ways from dry to wet.  </li>
            <li> Only issue is the charging base which is too light to use easily.</li>
            <li> The smart pivot does the job around my neck and jaw area but as I said before it takes a few runs.  </li>
            <li> Found a little too much time needed to get a somewhat close shave.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this model to my friends, especially those having trouble getting a close shave with a foil type razor.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to spend the extra money for the waterproof feature, but it does work very well.</li>
            <li> I not only compared the new models to each other, but also compared these shaves to those Igot with my 7735X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get a noticeably longer lasting shave than with the 810, and it slightly beats even my trusty old 7735X, which until now, no other razor could do.  </li>
            <li> The usefulness of \\&quot;smart pivot\\&quot; is not clear since it adds only a little flexibility to the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I replaced an older Norelco shaver that was similar to this - this one seems to shave a little closer and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li> Came home from a 4 day trip without shaving and this baby gave me a blade like shave right through the thick growth</li>
            <li> after nearly a month of using this product, I highly recommend it for any other black man who likes a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used similar style detail blades before and this one isn&#x27;t nearly as sharp or nearly as power.</li>
            <li> It does not perform much better or much worse than other rechargeable razors I have used.  </li>
            <li> From the first shave I made an effort to follow the instructions and do some experimentation and recommend other black men to do the same.  </li>
            <li> It shaves a little easier than my older Norelco triple header.</li>
            <li> he said he learned not to push the machine against his skin so hard when shaving and that helped too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also worth noting is the battery life remains long lasting.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works as well as my old</li>
            <li> I can say I prefer this shaver over the other shavers because of my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my whole neck was sore and raw from razor burn, and there were bumps everywhere.</li>
            <li> dry skin performance is OK, but &#x27;wet&#x27; is not great.</li>
            <li> dry skin performance is OK, but &#x27;wet&#x27; is not great.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Norelco razor back in the late &#x27;60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Go with this if you are starting out and want a dependable product which will last you for a long time to come.  </li>
            <li> , I had 3-4 shaves… bit of itching (as expected in the first few times of usage) but works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Shaving was accomplished must faster than with the other style, since I didn&#x27;t have to basically mow my face up and down back and forth</li>
            <li> The rotating blades cut through my super thick 5 o&#x27;clock shadow with ease,  resulting in an almost blade like shave!  </li>
            <li> the let it air dry open until the next morning.</li>
            <li> Quite surprised at how quiet it is compared to previous models.</li>
            <li> This shaver was a little more expensive than he usually buys but says it is definitely worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> I gave up after a month and went back to the single razor blades that were in back than.  </li>
            <li> The shave is close and much quieter than the electric razors I have had in the past.  </li>
            <li> He needs to take a blood thinner and each time he cuts himself with a straight razor, the bleeding is excessive.  </li>
            <li> you look at small letters on the box, very closely, you&#x27;ll discover as I did (after purchase and use) that this shaver is not meant to be used plugged in.</li>
            <li> But at least it slaps you across the face to read this review and become aware of</li>
            <li> It gave me a longer lasting shave than the 810 did, but not quite as long as the 830.  </li>
            <li> He also commented on how long the battery lasts which is a big plus</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I guess electric razors have come a long way since he last used one.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t last long, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> will tell how long this one lasts, 3rd time</li>
            <li> This shaver is quieter and the charge long lasting.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s lasting a long time between battery charges.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to it lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> Only issue is that the transformer is not in the shaver itself but part of the cord that has to be carried with you if you leave on a long trip.  </li>
            <li> at LONG last</li>
            <li> last really long.</li>
            <li> Runs quiet and stays charged for a long time; maybe a month.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time (about 2 weeks) between charges with daily use.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t even bother them, but I wait til my facial hair grows out really long and then shave it all at once</li>
            <li> It knocks down the beard but doesn&#x27;t clear the stuble.</li>
            <li> ; mode yet but works very well especially on the neck where it is sometimes hard to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Missing is how much charge is left, a indicator that the shaver needs cleaning an all the other goodies that Model  </li>
            <li> The charge appears to last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Probably would not buy it again; just replace the batteries in the old one for less money.</li>
            <li> I only use it for dry shaving.</li>
            <li> Dry was not as close of a shave, pre shave lotion and shaving cream , about the same, shaving cream a bit closer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doing the Job, although I use it only on dry environment, too scared to try it while having a shower or running water.</li>
            <li> I just keep the head open for a couple hours after cleaning to let it dry.</li>
            <li> I only use this shaver as a dry shaver--haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower or with gel.  </li>
            <li> Like the fact that it&#x27;s lithium, replaced my old 7140xl series which I used for half a decade without any problems.</li>
            <li> it gives me a very close shave , my only complaint i could not get the 50 minutes of shave time as promised</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the pop-up trimmer doesn&#x27;t really lock into place, so it&#x27;s a bit unstable when you need to do a lot of touch-up</li>
            <li> Larger whisker fragments put drag on heads and internal parts.</li>
            <li> The only reason I replaced my old Norelco was because I had to recharge the battery everyday.</li>
            <li> My last shaver lasted a LONG, LONG time, over 15 years.</li>
            <li> I have a thick black beard that grows quickly and in every direction possible.</li>
            <li> When this one dies on me I will be going back to a Remington razor because my thick beard wants a closer faster shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that I had to make SEVERAL passes in order to get every single hair, and to make matters worse, the pop-out trimmer had to be held at just the right angle in order to get short hairs.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was tired of  cleaning my non-aquatec electric shaver ~ tapping it out, cleaning it with a brush then once a month taking out the quirky little spinning hair guillotines and trying to make them fit back in.</li>
            <li> Older razor was getting loud and the blades and trimmer were getting very dull.  </li>
            <li> Only pulling loose hairs with tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I figured that if I spent what I would normally spend on blade in a year and bought an electric razor I would spend a lot less money.</li>
            <li> A big selling point for this AT830 model is that it is a dry or shaving lotion type razor!  </li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t have much beard growth but from reading the other postings here it appears to work well with a heavy beard as well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive neck skin when you wet the shaving head and use Alba AIO Gel (per other reviewers&#x27; recommendation).  </li>
            <li> I have had other norelcos before even the more expensive ones like the 3ds etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used electric rotary razors in the past, mainly because of their convenience rather than their closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it ends up lasting as long as other Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve owned, it&#x27;s definitely a bargain at this price.</li>
            <li> After suffering for 4 years with a Philips Norelco Arcitec (where you had to clean the heads with a pair of tweasers until you finally just bought an expensive head-replacement), I researched online until i found this one.  </li>
            <li> tried using this razor both dry, following an application of an electric pre-shave lotion like Lectric Shave; I also used it wet with some Nivea Sensitive shaving gel (which is what I use/used with my cartridges previously).  </li>
            <li> I find replacement heads are expensive and even though I&#x27;ve a light beard I sometimes do have to go over a spot repeatedly.</li>
            <li> I consider this unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, their &amp;#34;instructions&amp;#34; were overly complicated and way too detailed.</li>
            <li> Charging system is questionable, cord doesn&#x27;t fit well and charging lights ar eratic.</li>
            <li> and it delivers a really close shave even with my heavy dark beard,</li>
            <li> Therefore, to clear any water from the shaver, after shaving the user must hold it and shake it for a few minutes to get any water out of the unit.  </li>
            <li> This shaver holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> wet the face; then just a tiny glob of Edge gel to help things glide; and keep wetting the razor head as I go...</li>
            <li> It takes that long for the whiskers that were lifted up to settle down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Terrific when used wet, say soap or foam.</li>
            <li> Both have internal batteries and wide, pop-up trimmers.</li>
            <li> It now takes WAY too long to shave with this.  </li>
            <li> How long do these lithium batteries go?  </li>
            <li> Long extended period of time for recharging.</li>
            <li> I presume this is to prevent shock in wet areas, such as bathrooms.</li>
            <li> I will probably never buy (or ask for) a rotary-style electric razor again, and will stick with my Remington F4790 for as long as possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Charging is only necessary every few weeks with three to four minutes of daily use.</li>
            <li> Handles long whiskers quite well without pulling.  </li>
            <li> charge lasts a long time, the trimmer does its job</li>
            <li> I spent quite a bit on that one and wanted one similar to travel with.  </li>
            <li> A CHARGE FOR A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> I spend about fives time as long shaving, and I&#x27;m still covered with hair.</li>
            <li> But as long as they sell the Mach3 cartridges, I will stick with the shave in the shower for the convenience and closeness.they sell the Mach3 cartridges, I will stick with the shave in the shower for the convenience and closeness.</li>
            <li> and it took a long time before they shipped it to me.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a minor concern:</li>
            <li> This the 3rd Norelco I have owned,  It works as expected.  </li>
            <li> Long battery life.</li>
            <li> Thought I would miss not having a charging stand, but the battery life is so long, that it does not matter.  </li>
            <li> I had one a really long time ago pack it away when I found it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it that long, so durability of the motor, battery, etc.</li>
            <li> There is long stubble all over my face.</li>
            <li> and you can partially charge it, say for 10 minutes and have several minutes of shave time.  </li>
            <li> Keeps a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> He has used Phillips Norelco Razors for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Why did I wait so long?  </li>
            <li> is that it is still not getting all the whiskers on my neck and is leaving minor rashes there.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s minor is</li>
            <li> I thought that I was careful with my decision making process and read several reviews before deciding on which electric razor to purchase.</li>
            <li> close shave, long battery life</li>
            <li> I prefer the &amp;#34;cordless&amp;#34; models ; the long battery life between &amp;#34;charges&amp;#34; adds to the convenience of going &amp;#34;cordless&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li> This shaver is not as well built and doesn&#x27;t stay charged as long as the one that I was using preveously.</li>
            <li> but they were still usable as long as it was plugged in.</li>
            <li> After a few days of not shaving, it gives a nice close shave leaving a few hairs behind and no irritation.  </li>
            <li> Fits into one of my old travel cases, so for me that&#x27;s not huge.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about this purchase, but after trying it out &#x27;dry&#x27; shaving, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Suffice it to say that this shaver and its very slow motor (despite the claims) is really no more effective than the models at half</li>
            <li> I live in a hot climate and shaving when you&#x27;re sweaty or wet is difficult.</li>
            <li> While it actually did perform a little better and cut a little closer than my previous more expensive Panasonic, it was still a rather poor 4 week shaving experience.</li>
            <li> This is my second version of the same model (with slight improvements).  </li>
            <li> Faster charging, closer shaving wet or dry and quiet operation.</li>
            <li> course, to cut costs, additions such as charging stands and leather pouches have disappeared, but I have some left from previous shavers.</li>
            <li> It works wet or dry and holds a charge well, but the shave is not as close as he would like and has to go over the neck area with a regular shaver.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving daily for over 50 yrs, wet and dry, electric and manual.</li>
            <li> After using Norelco razors in the past I decided to stay with Norelco when purchasing a new razor August 31,2012.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find the right combo with typical manuf.</li>
            <li> I use it wet and dry, and the battery seems to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I had previously used a similar design model for 2 years that was dry shave only.  </li>
            <li> I hope this one last as long as the other one 10 years.</li>
            <li> Pivoting head allows for close shave and lasts a long time on a single charge, design makes for easly cleaning.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, for comparative purposes I also tested the AT830 on someone with thicker facial hair, and it didn&#x27;t cause skin irritation or patchy shaving, so your mileage may vary.  </li>
            <li> The blades were sharp enough to not need any additional stubble cleanup with a disposable razor afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The only reason it didn&#x27;t get a five is that it looked a little too simple.</li>
            <li> He had to switch to a electric shaver per doctor&#x27;s orders due to a medical condition.  </li>
            <li> not sure how the designers were able to get both of those features into such an expensive product, but they succeeded.</li>
            <li> like the ergonomics, the looks, and the fact that it&#x27;s very quiet, but other than that, it</li>
            <li> The doctor ordered my husband to stop using any type of razor blades due to a medical condition.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t last and the razor were never quite sharp enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reason I only gave it three stars is because the other two Norelco razors came with a travel case and charging stand.  </li>
            <li> The blades became too dull to use after only 3 months, and since new blades were almost as expensive as a new shaver, I&#x27;d just get a new shaver.</li>
            <li> (I noticed it wasn&#x27;t staying charged very long anymore).</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor to replace a Norelco I have had for a very long time (12 years).</li>
            <li> So a very long time, using them.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> I had the Nivea HS420 for  a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Battery duration is very long.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the dry shave caused skin irritations, which the Panasonic has managed to avoid.  </li>
            <li> If I need to shave and I had run out of battery I will safely dry shave.  </li>
            <li> I use it dry</li>
            <li> I do set the unit out of the shower to dry when done using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am just used to dry shaving.</li>
            <li> dry 2.</li>
            <li> Dry is not  too shabby either</li>
            <li> My father in law loves this shaver; he can use it dry or in the shower and it has a trimmer attached too.</li>
            <li> I use it dry and it doesn&#x27;t cause a bunch of irritation like a razor.</li>
            <li> dry shaver and shaving creams or gels can be used with it.</li>
            <li> Buff an exfoliation pad to remove dry skin and lift some</li>
            <li> I shave dry.  </li>
            <li> Just as a dry razor.  </li>
            <li> and I dry shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always shaved dry because I travel</li>
            <li> It is also waterproof, so using it in the shower, or dry is an advantage.</li>
            <li> When using the AT830 dry</li>
            <li> In the end I figured out that I prefer a dry shave.</li>
            <li> Not only does this razor not hold a candle to those cheapo ones I&#x27;ve had in the past but it barely works at all.</li>
            <li> Both can be used wet, although I don&#x27;t believe the closeness is much different between wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> I tried the next day with a thin coat of shaving gel and it was much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my main complaint with electrics is that they just cannot match the closeness of a cartridge razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, with that being said, the reason I am reviewing this product and only giving it 2 stars is because I discovered this morning that this razor had decided that yesterday was its last day... in less than 9 months!  </li>
            <li> but I got a rash EVERY SINGLE TIME I used this razor.</li>
            <li> It holds its charge for over 3 weeks of daily shaves, can be used wet or dry, but shaving so close dry, why put up with the extra mess of a wet shave?&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Now I dry shave some mornings when I&#x27;m short on time and wet shave with it other mornings.  </li>
            <li> It has given me an acceptable shave, not really any better or worse than any other Norelco shaver I have owned in the past.  </li>
            <li> However (maybe it&#x27;s just because I take showers at near scalding temperatures), blades usually move smoother in warmer environments</li>
            <li> short, this razor provides an average shave that you would expect out of any electric razor, but the aesthetics and features of this razor make it stand out.</li>
            <li> He enjoys the shave he gets from it, and that there is no more bleeding or sensitive skin issues from it.</li>
            <li> No more cuts for him and his skin is so soft after a shave.</li>
            <li> It total ruins our Friday evening!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall [4/5]: Aside from the poor detail trimmer, average battery life, and lack of a charging station this is a pretty solid razor.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying an electric razor, but I&#x27;ve fallen in love with this one.</li>
            <li> For how long you will use it, spend a little extra and don&#x27;t go dry.</li>
            <li> Even after pre-soak and gel lather and after shave my neck is still red, raw and stingling hours later.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, for a company that makes electric razors, they sure do a piss poor job of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only down side of this shaver is that it cannot be used while being charged  </li>
            <li> The headcan also be completely removed from the body of the razor, but I&#x27;m slightly concerned about the durability of the mechanism that attaches the head to the body of the razor, as it&#x27;s a small piece of metal with a ridge that looks like it could possibly wear over time (or maybe even break) if removed/replaced</li>
            <li> The shave doesn&#x27;t last long, but it makes my mornings a little faster.</li>
            <li> It takes twice as long to shave than with a standard razor, I have to constantly go back over areas due to missed facial hair, and ...at least to me the shave isn&#x27;t that close.</li>
            <li> Sadly my 10 year old razor with original blades that was less expensive cuts the same as my new one.</li>
            <li> I shaved half my face with my SensoTouch, and the other half with this new razor.  </li>
            <li> Before anyone gripes, yes I know that Norelco says you need at least 21 days to try out a new razor.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I would prefer a manual razor to the AT-830 for both a dry and wet shave.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would give this product a try since it is a wet and dry</li>
            <li> This was my second Philips shaver to try in a month; the previous one was the Philips Norelco 1150x/40</li>
            <li> I got this model because of the aquatec feature meaning you can use it either wet or dry.</li>
            <li> This is my second one, previous did not support use in shower.  </li>
            <li> advertised, the razor can work wet or dry, though I do prefer using shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Some parts are plastic but have held up to daily use for the past several months.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this led to some severe irritation, and a few days later, some considerable razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a Nivea pre-shave scrub several times a week, and also some Nivea sensitive skin after-shave balm.  </li>
            <li> Second, the razor test - which according to the Phillips Norelco User&#x27;s Manual will take 21 days, and if not pleased, you can get your money back!  </li>
            <li> I will be using it both wet and dry (in and out of the shower) for this test.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this shaver in the wet mode, as I haven&#x27;t shaved wet in so long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two Norelco razors previously and had the last one twelve years.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the same form as the previous razor</li>
            <li> It comes with an external 15 volt, 5 watt AC-to-DC power converter that charges the battery in an hour or less.</li>
            <li> This is my second Philips Norelco shaver I bought, I previously had the Philips Norelco PT730 and the Braun Series 7</li>
            <li> I have had a Norelco for the previous ten years</li>
            <li> /&gt;++ Can be used for wet or dry shaving, with or without shaving cream or gel&lt;</li>
            <li> Works well with wet or dry shave and the charge lasts for about 15 shaves.</li>
            <li> Wet Dry Feature:</li>
            <li> It can be used wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> This is definately a wet shaver rather than dry.</li>
            <li> I have always shaved dry with electric razors and still do so with this model, so I can&#x27;t address how well it works wet or with shaving gel.</li>
            <li> wanted to give a try on the dry wet version&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one definitely provides the closest shave as compared to my previous two shavers, so they seem to be improving the technology over time.  </li>
            <li> They promise &#x27;wet or dry&#x27; but neither work.</li>
            <li> Just a note : while using it wet , it would take me longer to shave rather than shaving with it dry.</li>
            <li> I have tried it with and without jell, wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> Can shave wet, dry, with lotion or in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It performs as advertised, in my opinion, both dry and wet.  </li>
            <li> I scoured my face with this thing (wet or dry, didn&#x27;t matter) and it literally would not cut the hairs at all.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with the performance of two higher priced Norelco models with the very narrow neck.  </li>
            <li> I have used it with Williams Electric Shave, shaving cream (what a mess), and nothing at all and had the same results-a not close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It charges in about an hour, which is a lot less than the old one, and lasts for a few weeks of shaving once a day.</li>
            <li> Wet and dry, although I haven&#x27;t tried it wet as yet,&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took forever for me to get even a somewhat decent (definitely not good) shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d considered the more expensive version with the fancier head, but I couldn&#x27;t see a real benefit to it and the replacement heads for this one are less expensive as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess that due to the hard water where i now live.</li>
            <li> It does not pull a tough beard as some cheap dull bladed razors do.  </li>
            <li> heads have both the traditional slots that Norelco has been using forever and also a section with little holes.</li>
            <li> My husband has a tough fast growing beard.</li>
            <li> While it is lightweight, it gave him a very close shave on his very dark, thick stubble.  </li>
            <li> The bad news is that they never last more than a few years, so you&#x27;ll end up buying a lot of them.</li>
            <li> For the endlessly annoying neck stubble it is are-you-kidding-me amazing.</li>
            <li> I have to shave my husband who has dementia and he complained about the old Phillips we had.  </li>
            <li> She found it awkward to try and shave in a circular pattern with this razor versus the standard straight pulls of her regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Basing all this comparing it with My old (at least 10 yrs.)  </li>
            <li> I do encourage you to give this product a serious try, especially if you are a professional black man.tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I do encourage you to give this product a serious try, especially if you are a professional black man.</li>
            <li> Shaves as well as the much moe expensive 1290X/46 that I recently purchased.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I&#x27;d have is that the blades don&#x27;t come anywhere close to lasting a year--</li>
            <li> only thing that is missing is the power indicator.</li>
            <li> not what I expected....</li>
            <li> I would have expected a cordless razor to be just that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That is not reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Both can be used when wet.  </li>
            <li> so cannont comment on using it wet.</li>
            <li> The shave feels somewhat rough and the shaver is rather noisy.  </li>
            <li> I have not used it wet.</li>
            <li> shave was about what I expected from any electric.  </li>
            <li> My panasonic leaves a few neck hairs and only get 4 shaves per charge.  </li>
            <li> wet</li>
            <li> Advantage is you can get this wet and use shave cream.  </li>
            <li> Try if for a few weeks and definitely try it in the shower.</li>
            <li> so I could shave without getting my hands wet.  </li>
            <li> Replace blades every six months, so not much cheaper than blades.</li>
            <li> A SHAVE AS EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> the razor is exactly as I expected it.</li>
            <li> my last purchase a few years ago</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;Works in shower, wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;1st electric</li>
            <li> Note I have not used this product wet or with gels or creme or in the shower.  </li>
            <li> it gives a close shave with minimal effort and my face has no irritation.</li>
            <li> I am not getting as close a shave as I expected.  </li>
            <li> It took 2-3 weeks for my face to get adjusted an during that time my neck would be rough afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it wet yet.</li>
            <li> My face was all patchy and rough after using this.  </li>
            <li> Just received the razor and it works as expected.</li>
            <li> I had blades replaced only once few years</li>
            <li> So I need to work much harder to get a clen</li>
            <li> I do skip a few days between shaving which does not keep my skin properly conditioned.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this is a waterproof model as I can open it up every few shaves and flush it out in the sink.</li>
            <li> -Wet or</li>
            <li> Does not shave as close as I expected.</li>
            <li> it just does not work with a wet shave (while using gel or foam)</li>
            <li> Does not trim as close as expected.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it for wet shaving and may never.</li>
            <li> Not much difference between the two, accept fof the head design to pick up longer hair.</li>
            <li> PowerTouch Rechargeable Cordless Razor, Gray/Silver/Black]] is minimal.</li>
            <li> is still an unknown.</li>
            <li> If I wanted a wet shave, I&#x27;d use a blade.</li>
            <li> It performs as expected for an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to using both wet and drive shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and when I pushed harder it irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with irritation wet or</li>
            <li> wet</li>
            <li> I am curious about</li>
            <li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> did few some irritation with initial use</li>
            <li> and  I still need to use blade / hand razor in second round to get finer shaver, the second round becomes piece of cake walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rely on Amazon for a wide range of Norelco&#x27;s shavers as well as replacement heads .</li>
            <li> I also tried using gel with razor cause its supposed to be wet</li>
            <li> A few months later I asked him to tell me what he thinks of it</li>
            <li> 16 months ago I found this on an Amazon Gold Box sale @ $40, only $5 more than the base model at Target.</li>
            <li> I found it to be a weak shaver that didn&#x27;t shave as close as my older Panasonic razor.  </li>
            <li> My skin adjusted to the Norelco very quickly; no rashes, bumps or red spots.</li>
            <li> Norelco charges in less than an hour and the charge goes for two weeks, at least when the shaver is new.</li>
            <li> You also can buy the Jet Clean base Direct from Phillips, mine is already on its way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> sure to pop it up and clean out all the hair in the razor, at least every other shave, as it does accumulate and get disgusting</li>
            <li> The Norelco has three, round rotary blades that seem to adapt to the contours of my face easier than the flat blades of the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> you neck area will be red and raw for hours.  </li>
            <li> Also, the dry shave is slightly less close than the wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 40.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty unhappy that none of the higher rated razors allow the use of the cord when shaving or are sold as corded only.</li>
            <li> After a couple years of use it must be getting dull since I can barely tell I have shaved after I use it now.</li>
            <li> everything I&#x27;ve used causes those painful bumps more or less.  </li>
            <li> but it was still pretty sad.  </li>
            <li> Now that your standard razor comes with 5 blades and razor burn is a thing of the past</li>
            <li> beard,\\&quot; which other reviewers have noted.</li>
            <li> I would give it minus 5 stars if I could!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected!</li>
            <li> Other points about this shaver    </li>
            <li> (..and close to - if not exactly - the 50 minutes specified in the instruction booklet).  </li>
            <li> In the past I had ordered and returned several shavers due to them not shaving as close as described, even after reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Box and shaver says made in china allmy other norelco shavers Netherlands,</li>
            <li> might as well shave with a sharp rock in realty.</li>
            <li> Other than that.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> This razor will get the hairs that my other electric razor would not get.  </li>
            <li> Works well but no better than the last one I had.</li>
            <li> The rotaries may be slower than other electric shavers, but it shaves closer and faster than the Braun and Panasonic shavers</li>
            <li> I stopped using this because I often shave every other day.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this upgrade due to reviews and suggestions on the cheaper model.</li>
            <li> - i can almost shave every other day -</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame as other than the reliability, I do like the shaver and the quality of the shave.</li>
            <li> I also stopped buying the Nivea lubricant because it was too expensive and shaving cream worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is my third Philips Norelco shaver in the past 15 years.  </li>
            <li> So this review compares this shaver to one other electric and a cartridge razor.  </li>
            <li> Also, with the electrics, I cannot get a sharp hairline at sideburns and mustache edges -- the &#x27;burns and &#x27;stache</li>
            <li> All-in-all, I&#x27;d say this is just average given that the shave quality isn&#x27;t quite what I had expected.</li>
            <li> Norelco shavers used to be built like a tank, to last, quality, thought involved in the creation of each shaver so that it did the job and usually with aplomb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed but will keep using it as I know they&#x27;re supposed to get better with time.</li>
            <li> I now shave every two and never more than three days, whereas before I could only manage to shave once a week.</li>
            <li> For decades I was a Remington man, using my Remington electric about every other day, alternating with \\&quot;real\\&quot; shaves.  </li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews, I have seen what a close shave</li>
            <li> but rather that the on/off switch became erratic sometimes working, other times not....and even turning itself on once or twice.</li>
            <li> I have used Philips for over 45 years and will not change for any other brand</li>
            <li> Other that that, I would by</li>
            <li> If I could do it over again, I&#x27;d probably look at other razors.</li>
            <li> and you will find it an extremely overpriced way to shave.</li>
            <li> Does my head too as I am sporting a bald head by choice due to cancer.</li>
            <li> Sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> (yet my skin was extremely irritated)</li>
            <li> They functioned well and lasted a long time but, were heavy and noisy.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a shaver that cuts as well as a blade, however this one is getting closer than any other electric razor I have found.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband for Christmas as he was always complaining about the other cheaper shavers.</li>
            <li> I ordered my electric razor and tried it for the first time I was not happy with it at all!</li>
            <li> It did take a couple of weeks for my skin to get used to the blades but other than that nothing to complain about.</li>
            <li> He was always a blade and shaving creme user, but needed to switch to an electric razor due to failing eyesight.  </li>
            <li> The Senseo always gave me a little trouble with getting the shaving head open for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> His beard is very rough</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can really go wrong with a Norelco razor, it just comes down to how much you feel like splurging for a few extra bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> - Dry shave still causes skin irritation for me, and shave is uneven  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever want to go back to using the expensive blades in my old triple shaver.</li>
            <li> The black rubber grip keeps it from slipping out of your hand.</li>
            <li> Decided on it over the more expensive models based on some poor reviews on the others.</li>
            <li> If you shave dry with it, every few times it will just hum and do nothing but make you choke the life out of the inanimate object.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t feel as durable as the previous razors of past in similar line.</li>
            <li> If I try using this every other day though, my neck actually bruises because I have to press hard against my skin for the shave to be close.  </li>
            <li> Looks like a nice water tight mechanism, without the possibility of little hairs getting EVERYWHERE on the inside (as happened in my Remington with a cleaning base)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Value-priced model 6948XL has a nickel-metal-hydride battery, has cutting heads mounted in a fixed holder and is not waterproof, providing only dry shaving.</li>
            <li> That was a complaint I had with several other rechargeable razors.  </li>
            <li> It does not cut as close as a conventional razor but is acceptable.</li>
            <li> Although I have a tough beard with hairs growing every which way, I have dealt with sensitive skin ever since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> Due to the Lift &amp; Cut technology, your face will feel smoother a half hour after your shave.</li>
            <li> Round and round I went, with little to no hairs actually being removed from skin.</li>
            <li> I would expect at least a standard travel case.  </li>
            <li> At this point I decided to cut my loses and return the razor through the 45 day money back guarantee...</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> would at least get me by until my next shaver purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price was average.</li>
            <li> The only negative features are the recharge cord and lack of a travel case.</li>
            <li> It gives me a much closer shave than what I consider an expensive Norelco razor.</li>
            <li> Small parts and no clear directions on reassembling shaving head after cleaning.    </li>
            <li> The only thing I consider a negative is that it will not work when plugged in.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have is that it should come with a case for traveling.</li>
            <li> My last Phillips was a 8870 and was the bees knees till it packed in after at least eight years of.</li>
            <li> I never liked seeing him cut up by the regular razors.</li>
            <li> Feels good on legs - did a terrible job though.</li>
            <li> Feels good on legs - did a terrible job though.</li>
            <li> but this may depend on how thick you leave your facial hair grow before shaving.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have overly thick facial hair</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, but I&#x27;d never experienced any problems using the Panasonic foil shavers.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave on me, I have a very tough beard though.  </li>
            <li> My previous razor I had for 15 years and was also a Norelco, but had a better base.</li>
            <li> my previous 3-5 year old Norelco was that I needed to replace the sealed shaver not because the rechargeable battery was getting tired</li>
            <li> My only slight negative would be</li>
            <li> I feel like there is an improvement in the movement of the head as it glides over my jaw-line and down on to my neck.</li>
            <li> Had to knock this down from 3 stars to 2.  </li>
            <li> After 5 months of frustration I broke down and bought the AT830.  </li>
            <li> $90 down the drain.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t matter if I hold the button down or not.</li>
            <li> Wished it came with a holder to keep the head down after u rinse it.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> Dry shaving doesn&#x27;t work for me but the Aquatec feature allows me to use a small amount of shaving cream when I shave.  </li>
            <li> Someone with black or dark colored hair may need to shave every day, and/or with shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> My biggest gripe is with shave quality; like other Norelcos that I&#x27;ve owned, it&#x27;s uneven, and tends to shave in patchy sections.  </li>
            <li> It can get a little patchy at times but that is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for over a month now, and it just glides quietly and smoothly, never any razor burn, no matter how hard i grind, or</li>
            <li> and I used it every day for about a week and a half before it became unbearable to continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All the others always left small (and sometimes not so small) hairs on my face after shaving.  </li>
            <li> If you couldn&#x27;t care less where a product is made, don&#x27;t bother to read</li>
            <li> Since all of my previous Norelco razors were made in the Netherlands, I mistakenly assumed that this razor was made in the Netherlands too.</li>
            <li> realize that a lot of people couldn&#x27;t care less where something is made.</li>
            <li> And the price of this AT830 is much less than my SensoTouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comparing it to my previous Braun razor</li>
            <li> This shaver replaces a previous 3-head Norelco whose battery died.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the battery lasts longer than the previous ones.</li>
            <li> much less irritation than a blade</li>
            <li> Odd shape so its somewhat awakard to store.  </li>
            <li> There are some days where I needed to do a wet shave because of how irritating my facial skin was.</li>
            <li> When all else fails, I went back to this updating of their earlier models.  </li>
            <li> No travel pouch included as with previous Norelco</li>
            <li> Miss the LED charge lights on my previous Norelco, but this one was cheaper to purchase.  </li>
            <li> The rotating heads are less flexible than the 1290 and it lacks a stand or a case for carrying.</li>
            <li> Overall the quality of the shave is not that much different than the less expensive versions.</li>
            <li> and my wife commented on how the previous razor would sometimes wake her in the morning, but</li>
            <li> My previous one worked with AC without charging.&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> Battery lasted less than a year before it gave up the ghost.</li>
            <li> My previous Norelco had combs that would not cut longer neck hairs.</li>
            <li> This is the worst and most probably the last product of theirs I will ever buy.</li>
            <li> You can read my previous review of the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> but I was foolish enough to believe these five star claims by either fake reviewers or those with very low expectations.</li>
            <li> I have had previous dissapointments with electronic items made in China</li>
            <li> Previously, I thought the Norelco 2D would be the answer, so I purchased it.</li>
            <li> purchased this product after comparing a competing product being used by black men and choose this one for its reliability after some reviews reported the competing product wore out after a year.  </li>
            <li> Yes, less features.</li>
            <li> I tried a Braun, and it took off half of my face along with the whiskers.  </li>
            <li> it does quite well with longer hair), &amp; forms somewhat of a powder that falls out of the shaver with a slight tap.</li>
            <li> &quot; feeling as my previous Norelcos.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the shaver ceased working 64 days later, conveniently outside of the 45 day money-back guarantee period.</li>
            <li> My previous one from a year ago (Not Norelco) lasted less than a year.</li>
            <li> Norelco doesn&#x27;t cut the mustard (or whiskers) like my previous Norelco&#x27;s did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super hairy</li>
            <li> maybe even two if I don&#x27;t mind that slightly scruffy look.  </li>
            <li> a lot and shaving cream is one less thing to take along.</li>
            <li> he wanted this one which is one upgrade from his previous one.</li>
            <li> so that is one less power cord to bring.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the Norelco, my beard was acclimated to the rotary blades in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve used a Braun that also lasted a long time and a Panasonic that I have never really liked.  </li>
            <li> and I usually use a gel on my wet face before shaving...</li>
            <li> And I like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to mess with a cord while shaving.  </li>
            <li> this is my second electrical shaver, my older was a chinesse bad quality brand called &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34;, that mi wife gave me four years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Any sort of a heavy bead it slows way down.  </li>
            <li> , I generally shave 4-6 times before I put it back on the charger and haven&#x27;t noticed any drop-off in motor speed or cutting performance toward the fifth or sixth use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry that it took so long to switch back to Norelco.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ES-LV81-K Arc 5 Multi Flex Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System, Black]], which I compared to my humble [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I  had read the reviews on the least expensive razor by other owners and they had all stated that they would all purchase the more expensive up graded razor.</li>
            <li> Not perfect but very near.</li>
            <li> I used to use 2 electric razors to shave with, a Norelco Triple Header for my heavy beard and a Braun after I get my heavy beard down.  </li>
            <li> I like to use a little talc or William&#x27;s Lectric Shave which helps the razor deliver a close shave.</li>
            <li> Only a weak battery indicator.  </li>
            <li> little</li>
            <li> I was trying to improve the quality of my shave, so I did a little research and digging around.  </li>
            <li> For a razor in this price range, I would expect a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features</li>
            <li> I was given this item via the Amazon Vine Reviewer Program to test and review, and will be using it exclusively on one leg while I stick with my usual Bic razor on the other leg for comparision in shave quality (closeness) over the 21 day period.  </li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d go out get something a little nicer this time around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a little squeamish about cleaning this shaver by letting water run through it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 other Norelco razors for my husband in past years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the advice from other reviews and this thing is junk--and I do not have a heavy beard!</li>
            <li> You could charge it fully and take it on a week long trip without the charger to save weight, though the charger is very small.</li>
            <li> A little quieter</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little dinged up</li>
            <li> you get when it&#x27;s just a little too close</li>
            <li> He bought the slightly less expensive AT810, while I spent the extra 20 bucks for the 830.  </li>
            <li> I have a heavy dark beard and this razor shaves almost as close as a blade!</li>
            <li> Has a tough beard but loves the fact gel can be used as in shaving prior and he does use the balm afterwards.  </li>
            <li> , I use that in the shower to finish up on any missed spots after my initial morning shave (like I said, tough beard).</li>
            <li> In those days Norelco provided a shave with little skin irritation, but it was a fairly coarse shave with poor feel and appearance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about due for a charge, but I&#x27;ve shaved with it at least half a dozen times for 2-3 minutes without having to recharge yet.  </li>
            <li> I had a Norelco several years ago, but this razor has several configurations of cutting holes and gives a close shave.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with my last razor, because it would always leave a few hairs uncut, and if I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a few days it would take me a long time to shave.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t waste shaving</li>
            <li> I wasted $80+ on this razor.  </li>
            <li> I rinse mine out after every few days.  </li>
            <li> it lets you know when it&#x27;s charging and when the power is dead...</li>
            <li> purchased the AT830 a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> A few minutes with this razor in the morning</li>
            <li> I used it a few times</li>
            <li> I use it before work everyday</li>
            <li> I have used it everyday for over two weeks now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor now for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Even though I hadn&#x27;t used a blade in thirty years, it seemed that it took my skin a few days to get used to the rotary heads.</li>
            <li> It depends too on how often you&#x27;re shaving and how heavy of a beard you have.</li>
            <li> I happen to not have a heavy beard, and</li>
            <li> It gives a close shave for someone with a heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> Not smooth at all.</li>
            <li> , so I lay the razor on its side on a washcloth with the head flipped up until it&#x27;s all dried out.  </li>
            <li> the stand to hold it when not in use was missing from packaging.  </li>
            <li> was missing.</li>
            <li> and heavy feel</li>
            <li> A few premium shavers have cleaning bases that can&#x27;t be bought</li>
            <li> not so well if you let your beard grow for a few days.  </li>
            <li> If the batteries are dead you cannot run the shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have heavy beard</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this or any rotary razor.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the trimmer on the Norelco was so-so and the protective plastic cover for the blades was worthless as it wouldn&#x27;t clip on securely.  </li>
            <li> If the battery went dead, you had to replace the handle assembly.</li>
            <li> The 8240 will let you shave on a dead battery when it is plugged in.  </li>
            <li> A few days before a trip to Florida</li>
            <li> I personally have some difficulty getting a close electric shave without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> After 40 years of Norelco use, I took a sidestep to Panasonic for a few months of unsatisfying shaves.</li>
            <li> I do not use this razor everyday since I&#x27;m retired and don&#x27;t shave everyday.</li>
            <li> Is one star harsh?</li>
            <li> Plus, I still had trouble getting a close shave.</li>
            <li> It certainly isn&#x27;t as heavy or \\&quot;solid\\</li>
            <li> It pay for itself by not have to keep buying razor blades that are not cheap.</li>
            <li> I had a few years ago.</li>
            <li> and I shave everyday.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a few months now.</li>
            <li> I owned a Braun series 5 that shaved close, but the shave was not comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for a few months now, and I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> As for the shaving aspect which I purchased it for, it completely and utterly fails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, as everyone else has mentioned it takes a few runs to get all the whiskers cut.  </li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and this works as well as a blade with no hassle.</li>
            <li> My husband vowed he would shave everyday if he had a rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> and I always dried it off and stored it in my medicine cabinet when I was done.</li>
            <li> Works well with my heavy beard.  </li>
            <li> Over the past 12 years the quality of the Norelco shaves has gone down.  </li>
            <li> , you cannot pull the lever to close it, you have to push the trimmer down manually, a small thing but makes it feel cheaper.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the past one week of our ownership, it performs like a shaver half of its price.  </li>
            <li> Shaves as well as my previous Norelco!</li>
            <li> This razor gives a close shave in half the time of my past Norelco 915x razor.</li>
            <li> previous Norelco had an issue with its trimmer, but there is no problem whatsoever with this one!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get hardly any neck burn from this one compared to the other</li>
            <li> the power button is lack and hard to find if you&#x27;re used to other Norelco razors.</li>
            <li> No more mess ups.</li>
            <li> , unfortunately, I have to give this razor a thumbs down overall.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fifteen days of using this razor on my legs - no other razor, and I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fifteen days of using this razor on my legs - no other razor, and I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> No more fiddling with little brushes and whisker dust.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this isn&#x27;t a real negative, just a personal qualm with it.</li>
            <li> With either current Philips model, it takes less time to get uniform coverage of difficult neck and chin areas than it usually takes with a foil</li>
            <li> My previous Phillips Norelco razor, if the blades got dull, you had&lt;br /&gt;to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 4 months into the new blades, which are still cutting well.</li>
            <li> They make it virtually impossible to open, don&#x27;t give any discription of it&#x27;s power or type, and must be broken from the soldered one, and the new one resoldered in.</li>
            <li> His experience was that they either pulled on the hair in a painful way or just did not cut them short enough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it dry, with shave cream and with shave gel - the results were all poor.  </li>
            <li> The little baby-sized lithium ion battery can hardly get the blades to move.</li>
            <li> Very little to compain about.</li>
            <li> This is no better than the Norelco I bought 5 years ago for $40</li>
            <li> I usually get about three weeks of use between charges.</li>
            <li> I thought I would at least give it a few days to see if anything changed.</li>
            <li> I was a Braun user for years, then for the past 5 years or so, a DE shaver with badger brush and shaving soap.</li>
            <li> His past shavers had it and gave him a warning as to when it needed to be recharged.  </li>
            <li> This went on for over two years because I&#x27;d been assured there was no better shave to be had.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t  waste your time with this hunk of junk!  </li>
            <li> I had a series of operations on my hands over the past thirteen years, and my wife bought me a Norelco shaver like this one</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick heavy stubble, so I&#x27;m no sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco electric razors for many of my 80 years and this model is the worst, notwithstanding its &amp;#34;Powertouch&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Aquatec&amp;#34; features.</li>
            <li> to their products in the past.</li>
            <li> I have used electric razors the past 20 years.</li>
            <li> However, it leaves just enough of a stubble that it is difficult to pull a shirt over my head.  </li>
            <li> Context of the review:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this razor for the past month.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So when battery started to feel weak requiring charge every week and blades felt not as sharp as they used to be</li>
            <li> and he used this horrible smelling stuff called magic shave.</li>
            <li> and then it is not as close as my past shaver.</li>
            <li> I have taken my past Norelco razor over to HongKong, and to Singapore, so I know they work there as well as here.</li>
            <li> NO MORE CUTS..</li>
            <li> Wet my face and apply a thin film of shaving cream to serve as a skin lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Wet my face and apply a thin film of shaving cream to serve as a skin lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> While I have no desire to be electrocuted, it means that once the batteries die in this unit you&#x27;ll either have to buy another shaver, or try to replace the batteries yourself which is a daunting task requiring disassembly, working with really small parts, soldering skills and breaking the water seal</li>
            <li> Not sure if its a defect of this item.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, this is going back to Amazon for a refund.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it cuts as efficiently as it should but am not sure if it&#x27;s the way I use it or the way it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why</li>
            <li> This would be my Christmas gift for my husband, it does arrive on time, but it was total wrong item.</li>
            <li> And it is not the first time I had such an unpleasant experience with Amazon!!!!!!</li>
            <li> No more buying replacement blades every 2 months.</li>
            <li> Not sure how that works,</li>
            <li> Cons:    Chamber that houses hair trimming is somewhat small.  </li>
            <li> so I can usually get away with skipping a day,</li>
            <li> This razor will work for a week or 10 days, but it demands repetitive strokes to get a passable shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately I tried it for my underarms that usually get waxed each summer&#x3D;</li>
            <li> But, as usual with electric razors, the quality of the shave gradually declined.</li>
            <li> (yes I&#x27;m lazy).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had rechargeable shavers in the past that lost their ability to hold a charge</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black male that suffers from razor burn and ingrown hair</li>
            <li> I tried the razor on dry skin, wet skin, skin with gel, skin with soap and the cutting experience never improved.  </li>
            <li> ( very few )</li>
            <li> so have to lay it down on my soap dish, and it has left some razor burn that has been unpleasant, but I think that&#x27;s partly my learning curve with it.  </li>
            <li> Also, if you are a person who sometimes once in 2 days/3 days - this is not for you - Electric shavers are not very good at handling 2-3 days of accumulated hair.  </li>
            <li> I have a tough beard (Mediterranean) and this Norelco tames it at least as well as any other electric I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a electric for over thirty years, but it seemed that the conventional reciprocating microscreen was irritating my face, so I decided to try a rotary.</li>
            <li> but my face had a very difficult time adjusting to the new style of cutting, since rotary razors \\&quot;lift\\&quot; the hair up, and then cut it, and it falls back under the skin line.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hard to please.</li>
            <li> The shaver seemed to be getting dull</li>
            <li> How hard can it be?  </li>
            <li> or so I start to feel and hear that motor is losing its guts while shaving hard parts.</li>
            <li> so he has a hard time buying a shaver that will perform the way he hopes it will.  </li>
            <li> I have hardly any beard to cut.</li>
            <li> No way would a razor have to work hard to give me a close shave .</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, the trimmer has hardly any power</li>
            <li> but at least I have it as a backup.  </li>
            <li> My husband never liked electric razors.  </li>
            <li> The one complaint I have with this shaver is with the pop up trimmer.</li>
            <li> Also, the lack of a chamber for the clipped hair was inconvenient, so I returned it and went back to</li>
            <li> Never liked it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I gave it a 4/5 , 1 star off the bread cutting experience, but it serves as a daily shaver.</li>
            <li> This item was purchased for my father; who recently has been cutting himself with his razor.</li>
            <li> At least his did.</li>
            <li> Negative...</li>
            <li> At least that is what the product info said.  </li>
            <li> Do not be afraid of the extra cost.  </li>
            <li> It seems like Norelco has moved away in 2012 from multiple concentric rings of cutting edges and has just focused on the outer ring.</li>
            <li> only disappointment I had with</li>
            <li> So, for me at least, it did not work well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One complaint.</li>
            <li> I have waited at least 7 weeks for my whiskers to adjust to an electric razor again</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything negative about this razor.  </li>
            <li> Person with slow hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;Owned 2 months now.</li>
            <li> Also do to my thick beard</li>
            <li> It runs so slow</li>
            <li> you have ever owned a REAL Norelco that was made in the Netherlands, after 10 seconds with this piece of crap and you will know</li>
            <li> Mostly, I am disappointed that the new one does not run on AC (plugged in)</li>
            <li> However, I am not very happy that this model did not come with a travel case, as my others have.</li>
            <li> So, users can expect about 7 months of working before failure.</li>
            <li> (The drive parts on 1150X/46 are very small)</li>
            <li> The con&#x27;s - fully charged shave time is about 30 minutes - you cannot use it plugged in (only on battery) - poor cutting ability, you must repeat &amp; repeat.</li>
            <li> I get serious skin irritation, even some blood, and it leaves hairs all over.</li>
            <li> My husband takes blood thinners which make it impossible to use a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> Less flashy and sleek than the SensoTouch models (for those who care about that)&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> I found the less expensive Norelco AT810 to give a closer and easier shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electrical razors for over 30 years and have never had one with such poor cutting capability.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, after getting frustrated with the nicks and razor burn of my razor and, above all, the $13 I was spending on razors every two weeks, I impetuously bought the Norelco...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Intermediate-priced model AT830 has a lithium-ion battery, has cutting heads mounted in a rocking holder and is waterproof, allowing wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Not a good idea in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Not a good value.</li>
            <li> It is simply not as good of a value as either the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> She finds a lot of uncut whiskers and misses a lot of the sermon.  </li>
            <li> Having tried an expensive Panasonic electric that only provided meager results, I decided to give Philips-Norelco  a try and bought this electric razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unbelievable they would but something so useless on the market.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband, he charged it for 2 days before using it and it was weak.  </li>
            <li> Its weak and a toy.</li>
            <li> Seems weak</li>
            <li> I bought this because I hate shaving with a manual razor (and shaving in general).</li>
            <li> This shaver gets NO STARS, but I was forced to put something on the rating by Amazon!</li>
            <li> This razor isn&#x27;t to bad when your face is completely dry.</li>
            <li> I recommend getting the one you can use in the water because if you&#x27;re like me, when you shave it&#x27;s almost impossible to not get the razor wet.</li>
            <li> Previously I&#x27;d used a safety razor out of some misguided sense of manliness and couldn&#x27;t seem to go a week without cutting myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with this razor.</li>
            <li> Cuts my tough beard with EASE ...</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who has a tough beard.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> After it was charged, I tried the razor and found that the motor turns very slowly.</li>
            <li> I always heard how poor electric razors performed.</li>
            <li> I had been buying the least expensive Norelco model when it went on sale at Target.</li>
            <li> I have owned for approximately one year.  </li>
            <li> tried Panasonic not happy</li>
            <li> Leaves longer hairs behind when shaving (all the PNs do this)&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> I hate putting razors in my toiletry bags as they inevitably open up at some point.</li>
            <li> I tried the Panasonic, but it was much worse than the Norelco it replaced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a great shave, but it eventually removes the two or three day growth.</li>
            <li> In my case it doesn&#x27;t eliminate razor bumps, but it also doesn&#x27;t make my face any worse.  </li>
            <li> but I realize that I was using a poor brand</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my grandpa since his shaver is broken.</li>
            <li> I just hope that is not an indication of poor customer service I may expect to get if I have any issues with the product.</li>
            <li> The trimmer that pops out from the side of the razor seems to be broken.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Frankly, I would not have bought this model had I known about this poor design.  </li>
            <li> My only mistake was not buying the model with a base.</li>
            <li> I honestly hate shaving, putting on the shaving cream, cleaning the razor, and washing off the shaving cream afterwards and such.</li>
            <li> BEWARE, Amazon is using FALSE ADVERTIZING to push this piece of crap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nearly 15 years ago, I had a very bad experience with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> This thing is ridiculous!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i used twice until now, i had to say, that is confortable, dont pull the hair if you use in dry face, using whith foam or gel is terrible, you should use few gel or the Norelco can´t</li>
            <li> it always miss few spots which make my shaving look bad.</li>
            <li> So charge is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;So - worse shave, not impressive battery -</li>
            <li> Typical crap.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I had to go over the same area 5-6 times just to get my peach fuzz off.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> i had to find something wrong</li>
            <li> Will have to work with this till heads fail .</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a battery powered razor, you can&#x27;t really go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I got  a three-foil razor with a pop-up trimmer piece that broke after about a year, making the foils useless.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really sad</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with it</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Very Expensive for the sub par performance and lack of features</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I found that, with my difficult beard, the AT830 was the way to go.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> so I was skeptical</li>
            <li> mediocre quality, not upto expectation.</li>
            <li> The worst once in recent years is the 8171 model with three circular cutters rather than one per blade unit.  </li>
            <li> Unable to shave when electric cable is plugged into electric outlet.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> But I was wrong.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m wondering whether expensive SensoTouch models deliver the goods...</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews here at Amazon, and they did not steer me wrong.  </li>
            <li> Not perfect, but</li>
            <li> My husband dreads shaving unfortunately.</li>
            <li> The battery was unable to hold a lengthy charge.  </li>
            <li> (though I&#x27;ve never used any of the expensive $100+ razors).</li>
            <li> And at $70, it&#x27;s not too expensive either.</li>
            <li> I was not happy to do so; but I was sick and tired of how expensive it was to buy replacement blades for my manual razor.  </li>
            <li> It cut very poor, it was difficult to get a close shave on the neck, it was difficult to do detail work and it irritated my neck</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the trimmer does a very poor job.  </li>
            <li> Very irritating in the neck area.</li>
            <li> I&#x60;m one of those at 55 who still grows very thin patchy hair.</li>
            <li> Very poor and thoughtless design.  </li>
            <li> certainly disappointed in a a failure after 4 months.</li>
            <li> Charging base was not in the order but a phone call and the base appeared just a couple of days later.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this was just a bad set of blades or poor design of the razor.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, it was a disappointing shave.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like the Norelco AT830 razor with the pivoting contour face plate (holds the 3 pivoting heads), but found the 2 degree pivoting plate created awkward crevices inside the unit head that made it difficult in cleaning all the the hair stubble out.</li>
            <li> and I hate how often razors like this are given that annoying square little charging dock thing, so</li>
            <li> With this shaver you may shave without cutting your face.</li>
            <li> Both have articulated cutting heads in 3-head assemblies that are imbedded in shaver bodies rather than in floating holders.</li>
            <li> Premium models have cutting heads mounted in floating holders and come with charging stands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cutting blades in it is&lt;br /&gt;inferior</li>
            <li> I thought that was crazy</li>
            <li> Cons.... pulls the hairs instead of cutting them [with or without gel/lotion] and burns my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Well, I was extreemly wrong!  </li>
            <li> Bough also a gillette shaver with very expensive blades...  </li>
            <li> When my wife gave me a very expensive ($200</li>
            <li> and it was very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it impossible to get a close shave with this razor.  </li>
            <li> You cannot use the razor while it charges, which is idiotic.  </li>
            <li> I could feel it pull at the hairs, but itwasn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> When I use this shaver with cream, it doesn&#x27;t bother my face as bad.  </li>
            <li> This electric shaver really shocked me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed in Norelco.</li>
            <li> you can see why I&#x27;m disappointed...</li>
            <li> But, I am disappointed with it for another reason which is not listed anyplace until after you buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> This razor has disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed the Phillip&#x27;s razors are now made in China instead of the Nederlands.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the performance.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that Norelco no longer made that model</li>
            <li> Very inconvenient to have to stand and shake it to eliminate all water in the unit.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with the Philips Norelco AT830 Power Touch Rechargeable Cordless Razor, Gray/Silver/Black.</li>
            <li> Stupid engineering by norelco.  </li>
            <li> Not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One annoying note.</li>
            <li> but it was somewhat annoying.</li>
            <li> I hate it.  </li>
            <li> Nearly worthless on the neck and chin.  </li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t be an idiot like me sticking with the Panasonic instead of returning it).</li>
            <li> and I hate having to replace the blades so often.</li>
            <li> the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed in Amazon for their blatant deception of the origin of this razor and absolutely HATE this piece of crap!</li>
            <li> The AT830 is  like a hatchet, rips up my neck and it is very painful.  </li>
            <li> Get tis razor and you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Michael, Baton Rouge, LAr and you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and would like to return it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very disappointed as I have never had a Norelco razor that did not perform admirably.</li>
            <li> I have been very disappointed with this razor and wish I had bought a Braun or just kept shaving with a blade</li>
            <li> Since I purchased this shaver to compliment my Panasonic foil 8249S, I have had horrible shaving from this model.  </li>
            <li> I have used plenty of electric shaves and this has got to be one of the worst I have ever used.</li>
            <li> this razor is horrible.</li>
            <li> I figured I would try and see what happened, after all, what&#x27;s the worst that could happen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Worst shave I ever had.  </li>
            <li> I had no idea an electric razor could perform so terribly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hated it!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my second version of the same model (with slight improvements).  When you first use it you may think it&#x27;s not powerful enough because there isn&#x27;t a feel of strong motor rotation of the blades compared to other shavers.  But it does, in fact, give a nice close shave, dry or wet.  I use it everyday. Sometimes, when in the shower, I keep a regular razor set to do some touch up if needed.  It makes the second step (razor) easy because the first pass with the Norelco did such a good job that just a little bath-soap on the face is enough lubrication (if you felt a need to do more).  So I don&#x27;t waste shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, you can also soap up your face in the sink, and use the Norelco shaver.  I run hot water over the shave head&#x27;s blades first, to give it a nice warm and softening effect.</li>
            <li> Poor didn&#x27;t find the address then took to many days</li>
            <li> It gives a nice shave and holds a charge for a long time. It&#x27;s nice to use while traveling for water is not accessible. I do a lot of trekking in the Himalayas. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This is no better than the Norelco I bought 5 years ago for $40+ and actually that razor still out performs this one.  This one is noisy and the aqua benefit really isn&#x27;t.  I wasted $80+ on this razor.  It knocks down the beard but doesn&#x27;t clear the stuble.</li>
            <li> I just retired my Norelco 650tx that I have had for about ten years and bought the sensor touch 2D man talk about a nice razor, I have only shaved with it three times and I love it. It is easy to clean, and a very good close shave. Buy the way my 650 tx still works perfect except I only get two shaves on a charge. Norelco is the king of razors.  UPDATE, Don&#x27;t care for this Razor as much as I thought I did, takes forever to shave unless you shave everyday, Will not get the long ones unless you really work at it. Don&#x27;t care for it at all!!</li>
            <li> Very good shaver. I have used Norelco shavers for years with no problems. This shaver holds a charge for a long time. I usually get about three weeks of use between charges. Best of all it gives you a nice close shave. I will buy this shaver again when this one dies several years from now.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razors since 1976. This one is by far the best. If the battery lasts it will be outstanding.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor, and it works well. Shaving is a lot quicker than with shaving cream, razors, rinse. I can now shave on my 7 minute drive to work, so I can wake up 20mins before I have to get there now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many electric (and analogue) razors in my life. This one is very nice. Best electric razor hands down!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great dry or with water. Very quiet, you may not even think it&#x27;s fully charged, but it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, one charge lasts well over a week of shaving every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it didn&#x27;t come with a carrying case for traveling or storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has greatly simplified my morning routine.</li>
            <li> Great item fast shipping five stars 💫💫💫💫💫</li>
            <li> I love the newly redesigned chafer. It&#x27;s a lot lighter and easy to pack in a toiletry bag for travel. Charges quickly and lasts a long time between charges. The head swivels as well, making for an nice close shave. Easy to rinse out the chopped hairs making cleaning a snap. I drip dry it, and will put blowdryer on high to force any remaining water in the cracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> After reading so many positive reviews (should have paid more attention to the negative ones) and reading the product description I decided to give this electric razor a chance, hoping I would have more success with it than older electric razors I had tried.  Big mistake.  I opened the package with great anticipation that this would be the razor for me that I&#x27;d been waiting on.  I read and followed all directions exactly so I wouldn&#x27;t make any mistakes.  Charged the razor fully before using and then tried it out.  It took forever for me to get even a somewhat decent (definitely not good) shave.  I used the razor, again after reading, according to instructions for how to use on all parts of your face, neck, etc. but it was still pretty sad.  After nearly 20 minutes of trying to get a closer shave I finally gave up and finished the job (easily) with a manual razor.  Charged it again and tried it again the next day - same results.  The razor ran quietly, as many had said, and I never got razor burn or anything like that, but I never got a good shave either.  Packaged this Norelco up and sent it back via UPS today.  I&#x27;m back to my manual razor and won&#x27;t be looking for anything different again.  I definitely would not recommend this razor to anyone unless you are just looking to throw your money away, it just doesn&#x27;t deliver as promised.</li>
            <li> I use this as a dry shaver and it does a quick and thorough job!&lt;br /&gt;My third (in the past 10 yeras) and best ever Norelco.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in October 2012 and have used it daily since then.  It has given me an acceptable shave, not really any better or worse than any other Norelco shaver I have owned in the past.  One thing I did not like was that it would not work from A/C power.  Therefore, if I was using it and the batter ran low, I could not just plug it in and continue shaving.  I had to plug it in, wait for it to charge 10 minutes or so, unplug it, and then continue shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning, I read in an older review that all the Norelco AT models are designed this way, and that if you want to be able to use the shaver on A/C power, the PT models will allow you to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with that being said, the reason I am reviewing this product and only giving it 2 stars is because I discovered this morning that this razor had decided that yesterday was its last day... in less than 9 months!  It was kept clean, used only for dry shaves, charged regularly but not left plugged in all the time, and had not been abused in any way.  I tried fiddling with it, charging it, etc. to no avail.  Therefore, I have ordered the [[ASIN:B006GQYSGO Philips Norelco PT730 Powertouch Electric Razor]] today in hopes of getting better results...  and to take advantage of the fact that it uses the same heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/20/13 - As I was about to throw it away, I dropped it and it started working again.  Don&#x27;t trust it now but at least I have it as a backup.  The PT730 also uses the same A/C adapter.</li>
            <li> works very well. a lot of shaves on a charge. great value for the money. doesn&#x27;t shave as fast as the wet and dry Panasonic, but gives a close shave even though. make sure to dry the charge port before charging, as they all have a problem here.</li>
            <li> shaves good,fast shipping</li>
            <li> Person with slow hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;Owned 2 months now. I&#x27;ve owned better norelco shavers before. After shaving I still have stubbles after shaving!&lt;br /&gt;Plus....I have low hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;For me it ....just ok, next time I would consider a different model.&lt;br /&gt;I will give my warning to everyone....I dosent cut very close.</li>
            <li> awesome shaver, I like its function of 3-minute-charge for one quick shave</li>
            <li> My current razor is the Panasonic ES-LV61, which I admit sets a very high bar for the AT830, but it&#x27;s good to have a high standard of comparison.  The AT-830 is ok.  Here&#x27;s a brief summary of my thoughts.  PROS:  - More subdued matte silver/gray color scheme is unique, nice looking  - Razor feels solid and comfortable to grip  - Comes with cleaning brush, cover  - Equipped with spring-loaded trimmer  - White light colored battery charging display is nice  - Easy to pop open head for cleaning  - Charges quickly, with quick charge feature  CONS:  - No battery life indicator, razor rather button minimalistic  - No travel case  - No charging stand  - Dry shave still causes skin irritation for me, and shave is uneven  The AT830 isn&#x27;t that inexpensive, it&#x27;s nearly $90.  I would expect at least a standard travel case.  My biggest gripe is with shave quality; like other Norelcos that I&#x27;ve owned, it&#x27;s uneven, and tends to shave in patchy sections.  Additionally, the dry shave caused skin irritations, which the Panasonic has managed to avoid.  The wet shave is ok, but again, it doesn&#x27;t shave as smoothly as my Panasonic, and I had to go over the same area several times.  In fact, I would prefer a manual razor to the AT-830 for both a dry and wet shave.  On the other hand, for comparative purposes I also tested the AT830 on someone with thicker facial hair, and it didn&#x27;t cause skin irritation or patchy shaving, so your mileage may vary.  The -830 might be better suited to those with less sensitive faces.</li>
            <li> I would have to say I&#x27;m not a raving fan of this product. I know everyone&#x27;s face and facial hair is different, but I can only review the product based on how it worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spent years using a blade, and while I strongly dislike the cost of the replacement blades, the shave is perfect. I thought I would give this product a try since it is a wet and dry shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is designed well and looks sturdy. I prefer its charging AC adapter to the curly cable on older models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I let it charge fully, I switched it on to have my first shave and allow it the opportunity to impress me. This was my second Philips shaver to try in a month; the previous one was the Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As was my complaint with the 1150x/40, the moment I powered on the AT830 and heard how quiet and slow moving the heads were, I had my doubts about how good the shave would be. Sadly, it was a disappointing shave. I thought I would at least give it a few days to see if anything changed. As of yet, it has not been any different and my satisfaction is pretty low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe my facial hair will learn to be intimidated by the AT830 over time, or as I age the hair won&#x27;t be as big a challenge for the three impeccably designed heads ... we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> The Norelco AT895 brought a closer, more comfortable shave than expected, even though I had used electric razors for years.. Particularly nice were the floating heads, which were considerably improved over my older model Norelco. The blades were sharp enough to not need any additional stubble cleanup with a disposable razor afterwards.  Norelco has a good thing going, and is smart enough to continue to improve it, rather than redesigning something over and over again from scratch.</li>
            <li> ***UPDATE***UPDATE*** I have been shaving with this razor now for about 2 weeks and it delivers a really close shave even with my heavy dark beard, but here&#x27;s a surprise: If you have a Jet Clean for the 8260cc the Power Touch AT830 will work in that Jet Clean. I have used mine in it a couple of times and it didn&#x27;t harm my razor at all! I called Philips Norelco and the Lady who took my call asked one of her product specialist and he said do not use this razor in that Jet Clean. Well, I called back and the Guy that I talked to this time said it was perfectly ok. It seems that the first rep that I talked to just wanted me to buy a Jet Clean for this model. The Power Touch models with Jet Clean arn&#x27;t going to be out til around Father&#x27;s Day, so if you like useing Jet Clean, you can use your Power Touch AT830 in the Jet Clean for 8260cc. I am a collector of Philips Norelco Electric Razors. I have several models including the Spectra 8894XL James Bond Razor which in my opinion is best Norelco has ever made! The Senso Touch 3D left a rash on my neck and a burning sensation on my face. In my opinion this razor shaves better than the Senso Touch 3D. It delivers a close comfortable shave without the razor burn. I got this model because of the aquatec feature meaning you can use it either wet or dry. Pros: easy grip, washable, fast charge,  and comfortable shave / Cons: No travel pouch, and No charging stand. I like to use a little talc or William&#x27;s Lectric Shave which helps the razor deliver a close shave. I have a heavy dark beard and this razor shaves almost as close as a blade! The only reason that I did not rate this razor 5 stars was because it does not come with a travel pouch or charging stand. I use one of my old travel pouches which the razor fits in perfectly and a lid from one of cans of shaving gels which the razor is able to stand upright in. This is a good razor. It is one of the better Norelcoes that I have owned and I enjoy shaving with this razor. Get tis razor and you wont be disappointed! Happy Shaving!, Michael, Baton Rouge, LAr and you wont be disappointed! Happy Shaving!, Michael, Baton Rouge, LA</li>
            <li> This is the fifth Norelco electric razor that I have used and my observations are:  1) This is a very good basic electric razor.  2) The shave is close and much quieter than the electric razors I have had in the past.  At first, I mistakenly felt that since this razor was so quiet that it was not powerful.  I was wrong. I get close shaves with this.  3) The instructions say that you should wash/rinse after each use, but I don&#x27;t feel that&#x27;s necessary.  I rinse mine out after every few days.  4) Again, this is a basic razor. No LED displays, no battery life indicator or minutes left of usage. Only a weak battery indicator.  5) Doesn&#x27;t come with a stand or case.  Again, just basic.  6) Battery life seems fairly good. I have been using this every weekday for about three weeks and I haven&#x27;t needed to charge this.  7) I like the convenience of simply rinsing under hot water. Simple maintenance.  Bottom line: Very good electric razor for the price. You get your money&#x27;s worth.  If you want all the bells and whistles, i.e., LED displays, battery life indicators, stands, etc., you&#x27;ll have to pay more for a higher-end model. If you just want a good basic no-frills razor, go with this one.</li>
            <li> I have used a number of Norelco shavers over the last 40+ years and this one is the best I have ever used. Sure it is still new (only had since Christmas of 2014) and the blade are still at their like new sharpness, but is is so comfortable and gives me such a close shave that I am in love with it.</li>
            <li> My son uses this and he finds it works well.  It feels solid and he finds it comfortable to hold. He doesn&#x27;t have much beard growth but from reading the other postings here it appears to work well with a heavy beard as well. I also like the fact that it can be easily cleaned by running tap water over it. Nice razor.</li>
            <li> Very nice shaver, I have been using a blade raiser for years and now I tried this Norelco AT830/41 shaver and have been using it for close to a month and although the shave does not last as long a  raiser, but pretty close to it. Giving it time to my face to get use to an electric shaver is a must to be able to compare the type of shave that this unit can give. Very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> there isn&#x27;t much that you can change on shavers today, but for what it is - it looks great and works just like the other units i&#x27;ve owned in the past.&lt;br /&gt;the only thing that is missing is the power indicator. it lets you know when it&#x27;s charging and when the power is dead... nothing in between.&lt;br /&gt;so besides gauging for travel, i would have to charge just to make sure since i don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s 80%, 70%, just when it&#x27;s 100% or 15%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if i had to find something wrong, that would be it.&lt;br /&gt;i love the product and plan to purchase this brand again in the future.</li>
            <li> Was a treat for myself and very pleased with construction and performance!</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;new\\&quot; Norelco shavers that use the lithium batteries run at about half the speed (or less) of the original ones that used a pair of rechargeable AA batteries.  But they&#x27;ve kept the same cutter design, so you get a slower, less effective shave -- I&#x27;ve switched to a Panasonic instead -- similar cost but super quality and speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Silver]]</li>
            <li> Great for the price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My husband has a tough fast growing beard. He has used Norelco shavers for years but his one has been the best yet-durable, comfortable with reasonably priced replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift, recipient loves it, that makes me happy,</li>
            <li> My husband never liked electric razors.  He has a very coarse beard and they did not work well on it.  This one he loves!  He says it works good even on his tough beard.  He also likes that he can use it with or without shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Very nice razor for the price.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for a year and is very pleased. Not as close as a razor shave, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> not what I expected.... Just bought a new model</li>
            <li> Love it, its lots more comfortable than the model with the fixed head (tiny difference in design). This is my second one, previous did not support use in shower.  will recommend it. Bough also a gillette shaver with very expensive blades...  did not like it.</li>
            <li> Very happy to be getting a smooth shave again without the irritation from the old Norelco XL____.. :) I went by the reviews here on Amazon, and wanted to try a little better Norelco, and one that that could be used wet/dry, and also easily rinsed and cleaned. I&#x27;m not sure if the pivoting head on the 830 makes a huge difference or not (it only rocks maybe 5-7 degrees... guessing here...), but the heads also do float like on the 810, so glad I paid the little extra in the long run anyway... I do what another reviewer wrote: wet the face; then just a tiny glob of Edge gel to help things glide; and keep wetting the razor head as I go... Haven&#x27;t had this nice a shave for (well... ever I guess... not counting the manual multi-blade razors...).. Very nice razor, nice and quiet, holds a charge well, very slick shave with cream or gel, easy to rinse too, and 2-1/2 year warranty once you register it on-line. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it a 4 or a 5.&lt;br /&gt;This is my 3rd norelco razor and its the best of all.  Each series seems to advance in comfort and smoothness.</li>
            <li> Having using a traditional Mach3 razor since I was 18 (that&#x27;s 10 years.  Yikes!) I was reluctant to make a change to an electric razor.  I&#x27;ve read that the shave isn&#x27;t nearly as close, not to mention the price, while not exorbitant, is still a bit high (and the options for razors can be quite mind-boggling).  Anyway, after getting frustrated with the nicks and razor burn of my razor and, above all, the $13 I was spending on razors every two weeks, I impetuously bought the Norelco...after using this razor for three weeks now, I can say it was worth every cent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As advertised, the razor can work wet or dry, though I do prefer using shaving cream. The shave, while not as close as a fresh blade, performs better than a slightly dull razor...above all, it seems nicks and, for the most part, razor burn are a thing of the past.  I do occasionally get an in-grown hair, but those too have been essentially eliminated.  Another benefit:  Shaving is fast and, doesn&#x27;t require any real patience (e.g., I can shave with the grain, against the grain, in a circular motion...really seems to be fine).  Clean-up is as easy as rinsing the Norelco under warm water...and I only charge the battery about once every five days...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to conclude, if you can bear a shave that isn&#x27;t quite as close in exchange for shaving money in the long-run and much quicker shave, I&#x27;d go for it!</li>
            <li> Shaved with blade razor for years.  This unit is quite good, if not quite as smooth as the razor.  Some parts are plastic but have held up to daily use for the past several months.  No complaints.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a traditional guy who uses shaving cream and a razor.  I&#x27;ve tried this without cream and it works pretty well.  I will have to try in the shower and see how the \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; aspect works.  But overall, I see no issues with this Phillips Norelco PowerTouch cordless razor.</li>
            <li> This was my second Norelco.  I had previously used a similar design model for 2 years that was dry shave only.  There was about a three month span between when that razor broke and when I purchased this model, so my skin had become used to non-electric shaving.  I began using this product with shaving gel and water for the first few days before I went back to a full on dry shave.  Now I dry shave some mornings when I&#x27;m short on time and wet shave with it other mornings.  The thing I&#x27;ve been most impressed with is I have experienced no irritation switching back from non-electric to electric (and I have always had sensitive skin).  When used with care, this model really does get close enough to approach the same results as a non-electric shave.  I like being able to just run it under the tap when I&#x27;m finished to clean it.  The only feature this model doesn&#x27;t have is outlet use.  All that means is, if you run the battery completely out, you will have to wait three minutes when you plug it in before you will be able to shave.</li>
            <li> Be aware that this particular MODEL comes without the Travel Pouch and, most importantly, WITHOUT the Charging Stand.  Therefore, to clear any water from the shaver, after shaving the user must hold it and shake it for a few minutes to get any water out of the unit.  Very inconvenient to have to stand and shake it to eliminate all water in the unit.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Big improvement is I can clean it in the water and not worry about it.  Shaves well and recharged without a problem.  Ihave it for 2 weeks and still have not had to recharge so seems to be holding up well.</li>
            <li> Gift for my husband, He loves the razor. Clean shave, enjoyable to use. Would replace it with the same razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black male that suffers from razor burn and ingrown hair and I&#x27;m constantly on the lookout for products that can help alleviate my shaving problems. Having tried an expensive Panasonic electric that only provided meager results, I decided to give Philips-Norelco  a try and bought this electric razor. While it actually did perform a little better and cut a little closer than my previous more expensive Panasonic, it was still a rather poor 4 week shaving experience. At this point I decided to cut my loses and return the razor through the 45 day money back guarantee... little did I know just what I was getting myself into. I had to call SIX times and wait SIX weeks before I could even get the AUTHORIZATION FORMS to send the razor back and now that I&#x27;ve finally been able to mail the darn thing out, I have to wait another SIX TO EIGHT weeks to recieve my refund. My advice here: save your time and your money and find a different brand razor.</li>
            <li> I was trying to improve the quality of my shave, so I did a little research and digging around.  I&#x27;d used electric rotary razors in the past, mainly because of their convenience rather than their closeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the AT830 a few weeks ago and I used it every day for about a week and a half before it became unbearable to continue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does indeed give you a very close shave - probably the closest I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric - but my face had a very difficult time adjusting to the new style of cutting, since rotary razors \\&quot;lift\\&quot; the hair up, and then cut it, and it falls back under the skin line.  Unfortunately, this led to some severe irritation, and a few days later, some considerable razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a Nivea pre-shave scrub several times a week, and also some Nivea sensitive skin after-shave balm.  While this certainly helped with razor burn and bumps (no matter what method I shaved - electric or cartridge), my skin would still look bright red on my neck area after I&#x27;d finished.  It&#x27;s not a \\&quot;pushing too hard\\&quot; issue - it&#x27;s simply a \\&quot;my face isn&#x27;t compatible\\&quot; issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using this razor both dry, following an application of an electric pre-shave lotion like Lectric Shave; I also used it wet with some Nivea Sensitive shaving gel (which is what I use/used with my cartridges previously).  I had the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a Double-edged Safety Razor, Cartridges ranging from a single-blade to the Hydro-5/ProFusion, and these electrics, and it seems my hair is just too coarse to use this system.  For me personally, I&#x27;m one of those \\&quot;you shave one time, with the grain\\&quot; people, with sensitive skin as well as coarse facial hair.  If I shave in a second direction, such as against or across the grain, I&#x27;ll end up with similar bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to recap, this was a very good razor with great convenience to use it both in-and-out of the shower or with-or-without shaving cream.  Beware if you have coarsehair or sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned this item in accordance with Philips&#x27; 45-day money back guarantee.  Back to my cartridge.</li>
            <li> In reviewing this product, I first provide a caveat - I&#x27;ve never used a cordless razor before as I have partial to the traditional blade and foam. With that being said...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appearance [4/5]: The razor gets a four out of five for appearance because of its smooth sleek no frills look. It&#x27;s a razor and looks just like one. It was a detail trimmer on the back and three rotating blades up front. It&#x27;s texture provides for a good grip (which is great if you use it in the shower) and it appears to be designed with simplicity in mind. The only reason it didn&#x27;t get a five is that it looked a little too simple. For a razor in this price range, I would expect a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features [4/5]: The razor gets a four out of five because I feel it has two major flaws. First, the detail trimmer blade is pretty useless. I&#x27;ve used similar style detail blades before and this one isn&#x27;t nearly as sharp or nearly as power. You kind of have to apply a bit more force or get in closer than you desire - which completely defeats the point of having a detail trimmer as you can essentially ruin the style you are aiming for. Also, the fact that it comes with a charging cable as opposed to a stand was kind of a letdown. I would have expected a cordless razor to be just that. But this isn&#x27;t a real negative, just a personal qualm with it. One of the better features is the quick charge function. If you are in need of a quick shave and have forgotten to charge the unit, a quick five minute charge will give you two to three minutes of use - which is great if you are just touching up or getting rid of some shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use/Functionality [4/5]: This also gets a four. A huge part of this is the fact that its waterproof (as it should be) which allows it to be used in the shower. However (maybe it&#x27;s just because I take showers at near scalding temperatures), blades usually move smoother in warmer environments but this one sometimes sticks to my skin if it&#x27;s too hot. On the other hand,in a completely dry environment, it cuts just as smooth as it would in (non-scalding) water so I guess that makes up for it. The cut is fairly close (depends on how thick your hair is) and I only needed minimal touch ups with a blade after using the shaver. Clean-up is a breeze as you literally flick open the blade assembly, rinse, and close. Battery life is decent (could be longer I think) but then again it does charge fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall [4/5]: Aside from the poor detail trimmer, average battery life, and lack of a charging station this is a pretty solid razor. I would like to see these issues addressed in subsequent models but aside from these annoyances, I find the razor overall to be a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> I have owned a half-dozen or so electric razors including the most expensive German brands.  All the others always left small (and sometimes not so small) hairs on my face after shaving.  I had to go over my face lightly with a blade razor.  Eventually, I gave up on each and returned to shaving in the shower with a blade razor.  I decided to try the Norelco based upon the excellent reviews at Amazon, but I had low expectations given the modest price.  Was I surprised!  The shave is very close without pulling on facial hairs, and the razor does not miss any hairs.  After just a few weeks, I can state that this is the best shave I have ever received with an electric razor.  If the razor is reliable and sturdy, it will be worth 5 stars.</li>
            <li> A few minutes with this razor in the morning and you&#x27;re good to go.  This is an old guy talking, don&#x27;t know how it will work with a young man&#x27;s iron bristles.</li>
            <li> After several months, the shaver works fine and does what it&#x27;s marketed to do.  Don&#x27;t, however, expect a shave anywhere near as close as a blade.  Just shave again in the evening if you have a hot date, then she&#x27;ll be glad you don&#x27;t have the 5:00 shadow that you would have with a morning blade shave.</li>
            <li> This a very nice rechargeable razor. Quiet,sharp and efficient. The trimmers are just ok but overall a nice razor for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Braun Series 3 for a couple of years.  My wife of 53 years examines me Sunday in church where the light is good.  She finds a lot of uncut whiskers and misses a lot of the sermon.  My new Norelco AT830 has solved the problem.  She can now reply \\&quot;Amen\\&quot; instead.  Don&#x27;t dig the razor into your face.  Just glide it gently over the skin and remove all the whiskers.</li>
            <li> The price changed so fast. I just bought one week ago and it reduced around 20 bucks. That really disappoints me. But I still believe the quality of this item even though I haven&#x27;t begun to use it. So I just give 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I have  very light  facial hair &amp; at 64 yrs it ain&#x27;t getting much heavier. Found a little too much time needed to get a somewhat close shave. Probably would opt for a more powerful or thinner shaver heads. Hard to find the right combo with typical manuf. supplied information. Will have to work with this till heads fail .</li>
            <li> This shaver is good, comfortable to use and shave is almost as good as manual razor. But this shaver does not give any indication of battery level, cannot be used when plugged in and does not come with accessories like a bag.</li>
            <li> I bought this to shave my elderly father. It is easy to use, and it can get wet without concern. However, it really does not give a very close shave. I would find it totally unacceptable for my own us, but Dad looks OK when I am finished shaving him with it (you can readily feel that it is not a very close shave).</li>
            <li> I have owned 3 other Norelco razors and have found them to be very durable and they do a good job.  I bought this one to replace one I had for nearly 15 years.  I&#x27;m sure it will be a work horse like the others.</li>
            <li> I definitely think this razor is good but it&#x27;s not the best. I don&#x27;t have much experience with electric razors, but I do know this works better than a manual one. Although I do have to use the regular razor to clean up some areas because no matter how many times I run over something with the Norelco, it still leaves a bunch of hair. I recommend getting the one you can use in the water because if you&#x27;re like me, when you shave it&#x27;s almost impossible to not get the razor wet. It gives a clean shave but not baby butt smooth, at least not for me. I shave at 6 am and I&#x27;ll have stubble by 8 am. The charge stays for a pretty long time. If you&#x27;re looking for a battery powered razor, you can&#x27;t really go wrong with this one. And with Amazon returns are painfully easy so it&#x27;s up to you :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my AT830 for about 6 weeks now. I was a Braun user for years, then for the past 5 years or so, a DE shaver with badger brush and shaving soap. The AT830 is giving me the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had (started shaving in 1962).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technique is key with a Norelco: I picked up some really good tips from [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Start with a freshly-washed face. But wait 10-15 minutes to allow for drydown.&lt;br /&gt;2. Use a circular motion with this rotary shaver.&lt;br /&gt;3. Use a very light touch.&lt;br /&gt;4. Due to the Lift &amp; Cut technology, your face will feel smoother a half hour after your shave. It takes that long for the whiskers that were lifted up to settle down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean my shaver after each use: just open it up and rinse with hot water from the tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Well, it might have something to do with my old (also Phillips) shaver being - oh, around 10 years old - and never having replaced the heads - but I got an excellent shave the first time I used my new AT830..  It&#x27;s still doing fine, and I believe my shaving time is cut down by about a minute.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Quality and shipping as advertised.</li>
            <li> When I was about 18 I got an electric razor from my grandfather.  I used it a few times and I recall it ate my face up, it took forever to charge and it was a pain to clean.  I gave up after a month and went back to the single razor blades that were in back than.  Now that your standard razor comes with 5 blades and razor burn is a thing of the past why would anyone not think that electric razors would not make the same changes as the Mach 5 or Sensors.  The Norelco is leaps and bounds better than my previous experience with electric razors.  It was quite, cut close to the skin, left the clippings in the sink.  I really enjoyed using it on the back of my neck where I could really just go back in forth which is much easier than using my standard disposable razor.  Using shave gel really helped give me a closer shave than shaving dry but I do enjoy the convience of a dry shave.</li>
            <li> I had my husband help me with this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco PowerTouch delivers one of the closest and most comfortable shaves of any shaver in this price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is comfortable even when you don&#x27;t use foam or gel (although it&#x27;s very comfortable with foam). It&#x27;s a very close shave that leaves your skin smooth. (It passed the kiss test with flying colors.) However, my husband prefers shavers that have some sort of charging stand, and this one doesn&#x27;t. You just attach a power cord and plug it into an outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also have the [[ASIN:B003V3476G Philips Norelco 1280X/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System, Black]], and that&#x27;s a much better shaver, but it&#x27;s also a lot pricier. The SensoTouch 3D is the best shaver we&#x27;ve ever had. The PowerTouch isn&#x27;t perfect, but it is very good for a shaver that costs less than $100.</li>
            <li> This razor gets the job done, but pales in comparison to higher priced models. The beard/sideburn trimmer has an especially cheap feel to it, more likely to leave you with razor burn. I&#x27;ve only had it for a short while, but it seems to hold a charge well, no memory effect on the battery yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended only if you can&#x27;t afford the better quality models.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s electric razor finally broke, so I researched the best replacement option, and settled on this one. He&#x27;s had it for less than a week now, but so far, he really likes it. It charges in about an hour, just like the product details say, and while I&#x27;m not sure exactly how long it actually lasts, I&#x27;d be willing to believe the promised 50 minutes, because he&#x27;s used it several days and the power is just as good after that one charge, no decrease in performance as the charge goes down.&lt;br /&gt;It flexes very easily and well, and it trims pretty easily, and he says it&#x27;s comfortable and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin very much at all.&lt;br /&gt;The only con, so far, would be that it does miss hairs when he&#x27;s shaving his \\&quot;neck-beard,\\&quot; which other reviewers have noted. My husband still feels like it&#x27;s quite an upgrade from his last old razor, so, we&#x27;re happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the value, I&#x27;d say we were prepared to spend up to a hundred, and while eighty is a bit much, if it lasts as long as they usually do, and continues to function as well as this one has so far, I feel like that&#x27;s well worth adding a bit of happy convenience to my husband&#x27;s mornings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side-note, I LOVE THE CHARGING CORD and I hate how often razors like this are given that annoying square little charging dock thing, so I&#x27;m thrilled this one doesn&#x27;t have that. All our outlets are old, so few of them can support the weight of the square plug AND the razor, and plenty of outlets don&#x27;t have enough space above them anyway for the full height of the plugged dock and razor, like his old one, and even if there is room, it often blocks the other outlet. This razor has an easy, normal cord, so it&#x27;s much better for plugging in to the bathroom outlet without blocking all the other outlets or making me unplug my blow-dryer, so, I&#x27;m happy too!</li>
            <li> This is my third Norelco tri-head razor. I just like them.</li>
            <li> If you couldn&#x27;t care less where a product is made, don&#x27;t bother to read any further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this razor from Amazon and was surprised to see &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34; on the box. Norelco&#x27;s literature doesn&#x27;t mention where their products are made. Since all of my previous Norelco razors were made in the Netherlands, I mistakenly assumed that this razor was made in the Netherlands too. I called Norelco, and they confirmed that almost all of their low and mid-priced razors are now made in China. Note: As of this date, Norelco still makes their high-end models in the Netherlands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize that a lot of people couldn&#x27;t care less where something is made. However, there are people such as myself that prefer not to support the Chinese economy. I returned the razor to Amazon for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: After I returned this razor I purchased a Norelco model 1250X SensoTouch 3D made in the Netherlands. However, I really don&#x27;t like the design of the 1250X, and I returned it too (you can see my review on the 1250X in a separate review).</li>
            <li> It shaves the same as my 7 year old Norelco 7140XL.  Both have the same HQ8 rotary heads.  New heads cost almost as much as a new razor.  This razor charges much faster than my old one, one hour vs eight hrs.</li>
            <li> Husband very happy with it</li>
            <li> IT WAS A BIT CHALLENGING GETTING THE GIFT, BUT AS USUAL AMAZON GOT IT TO ME JUST IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS. IT WAS DELIVERED TODAY. NOW, I CAN WRAP IT AND HE CAN RECEIVE IT ON CHRISTMAS. ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR GREAT SERVICE. I AM YOUR LOYAL ONLINE BUYER.</li>
            <li> The shaver does not work while it is connected to the power outlet, for safety reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is not reasonable.  I am not stupid.  If I need to shave and I had run out of battery I will safely dry shave.  When I am shaving to go to work I do not have 5 minutes to wait for a quick charge as the manual says (that, if 5 minutes is enough).</li>
            <li> I received the new Norelco about a month ago, had another older one, but this one could be used in the shower and also could be cleaned by running water over the flip open blade housing, making it easy to clean. Other than that it works as well as my old one.&lt;br /&gt;Always have used an Phillips shaver, and have been satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Norelco, so pretty reliable - not great, but this is a average price razor so can&#x27;t expect it to perform like the $150 one - but shaves well, cleans well, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I admit that I set a high standard for razors, since I normally use a [[ASIN:B003V37Z9W Philips Norelco 1250xcc/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver]] unless I am traveling.  This razor, the Philips Norelco AT830 PowerTouch Rechargeable Cordless Razor, charged up nicely, then I put it to the test.  I shaved half my face with my SensoTouch, and the other half with this new razor.  First off, they are both relatively quiet razors, which is nice.  I judge the closeness of the shave to be fairly equal, and since they both have three shaving heads, the coverage seemed similar.  The heads on my SensoTouch are more flexible than this model, but I could live with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model has a much nicer and wider trimmer.  Both can be used when wet.  And the price of this AT830 is much less than my SensoTouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, another nice electric razor from Philips Norelco.</li>
            <li> My husbands razor just stopped working the other day and it was perfect timing in receiving this product to review.  He is a big fan of the Philips brand and was trilled to receive the newest model: AT830.  While it is lightweight, it gave him a very close shave on his very dark, thick stubble.  Big drawback for him was the lack of battery level indicator.  His past shavers had it and gave him a warning as to when it needed to be recharged.  Hasn&#x27;t been very happy when the battery dies mid-shave.  On the flip side, it is very comfortable for him to hold and manuever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for about the last 12 years, as shaving daily has been a requirement for work.  My first Remington electric died after a few years and couldn&#x27;t be recharged.  I got  a three-foil razor with a pop-up trimmer piece that broke after about a year, making the foils useless. I tried a cheap razor with these three circle blades which seemed to eat my face alive. I picked up a Braun that worked for a number of years, and even survived falling out of a car at 25mph. Last week my dog chewed through the cord while I was trying to charge it (I noticed it wasn&#x27;t staying charged very long anymore). Since the blades and foils needed to be replaced anyways, on top of a new cord, I figured I&#x27;d just look for a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at the largest discount retailer in the world doing a school project and found this razor. The price seemed reasonable so I picked it up. As they rang it up, the price showed $30 MORE than the tag in the case. They verified this, but sold it to me for the lower price. I scanned the razor with my iPhone in the parking lot and found these reviews and the Amazon price (which was slightly higher than their MISTAKE price). Since I felt like I got over on the big box retailer I don&#x27;t really care for, I decided to keep the razor that they took a loss on as a trophy. HA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I read some of the reviews and tried that &#x27;lectric shave that one of the reviewers recommended. Awesome! This razor is lightweight, rinses easily and cuts very close to the skin. My face is nice and smooth now, and it&#x27;s only slightly irritated along my neck/under my chin. Shaving was accomplished must faster than with the other style, since I didn&#x27;t have to basically mow my face up and down back and forth repeatedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, good choice for the price listed here (which is MUCH lower than the MSRP/sale price at the discount retailer based in Arkansas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Update] This razor is still going strong. I use it before work everyday and I have no complaints. The battery seems to last me quite a while (weeks). Without the Lectric shave I can still get some irritation but I think that&#x27;s from repeatedly running the metal over my face in the same spot. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s unique to this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco electric shavers since my early 20&#x27;s(about 45 years now) and this one is the best yet.</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco razor person for several years.  My razor was getting a lot of age to it and would not hold a charge. I did some research on the newer type of razors and decided the AT830 was the one I liked.  I have used it for three weeks now and I am very pleased.  It is light weighted, charges up fast and shaves for a long time on a charge. I have only dry shaved with it now but it is very adaptable to wet shaves which I plan on doing.  recommend this model to anyone.</li>
            <li> This razor was to replace my old 25 year old Norelco which I had the batteries replaced 5 times by a local battery repair shop. It is not as good at shaving as my old worn out razor. Takes me much longer to get a close shave than the old Norelco. Probably would not buy it again; just replace the batteries in the old one for less money.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Meets expectations.</li>
            <li> This is a two part review. First, the AT830 Phillips Norelco PowerTouch Rechargeable Cordless Razor features and impressions.  Second, the razor test - which according to the Phillips Norelco User&#x27;s Manual will take 21 days, and if not pleased, you can get your money back!  (I will update this review after the 21 days... I&#x27;m on day 1 now.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Razor:&lt;br /&gt;In comparing it to a recent purchase - [[ASIN:B003V360NY Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue]], I&#x27;m unimpressed.  The AT830 isn&#x27;t as sturdy or well made as the 2D, and it takes longer to charge it (5hrs per the book for a &#x27;complete&#x27; charge) with only a 50 minute charged shave time.  Yes, you can charge it for a quick 1 minute shave in a pinch, but compared to the 2D&#x27;s quick charge and power for days there&#x27;s no real comparison for the same price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial shave is OK, but again the 2D takes it with closeness of the cut. The AT830 is quiet and it doesn&#x27;t tug on your skin.  Can be used wet or dry and is easy to clean.  The shaver head replacement is recommended for once very 12 months for optimum performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a pop-up trimmer on the AT830, but since it&#x27;s otherwise just &#x27;OK&#x27; and costs almost ninety dollars, you may want to continue looking.  There&#x27;s just no Wow-Factor about this one, and at least so far - the shave isn&#x27;t superior to a blade or the SensoTouch 2D.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - this isn&#x27;t worth the high price tag based upon fair build quality, features and performance (charging time vs useage, and shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Test:&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review following a 21 day test run of this razor.  I was given this item via the Amazon Vine Reviewer Program to test and review, and will be using it exclusively on one leg while I stick with my usual Bic razor on the other leg for comparision in shave quality (closeness) over the 21 day period.  I will be using it both wet and dry (in and out of the shower) for this test.  When done  - I&#x27;ll update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI... in the User&#x27;s Manual it is recommended that you DO NOT submerge this razor - despite its ability to be used wet or dry, and the fact that it is recommended that you clean it under running hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/27/12:&lt;br /&gt;Used the razor in the shower today to do my legs and underarms.  Feels good on legs - did a terrible job though. Worked well under my arms until it pinched and left razor burn.  I used a gel shaving cream and circular motion per the directions.  Won&#x27;t try it again on the underarms... might on the legs. Day 2 conclusion: dry skin performance is OK, but &#x27;wet&#x27; is not great. Cleaning is a breeze - just open and rinse under hot water, then air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/11/12:&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen days of using this razor on my legs - no other razor, and I&#x27;m not impressed. Maybe the kicker is that it&#x27;s designed for men&#x27;s faces?  It says nothing in the manual about that, and I do bring my skin taut and use circular motions to get the job done. The razor never seems to cut as closely as a simple [[ASIN:B001ET73CO Schick ST2 Disposable Razor, Sensitive for Men, 12-Count Packages (Pack of 3)]] does. Maybe it will at 21 days... I&#x27;ll keep using it and let you know.  Did I mention I&#x27;ve used other rotary razors on my legs before and liked it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/22/12:&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t suggest paying this much for THIS razor.  Still underwhelmed, but it may work better on a face than it does on legs too.  As a female consumer, I can only speak to my experience, but I really think you&#x27;d be overpaying for a so-so razor with this one when the SensoTouch 2d is so much better and costs about the same.e  - I&#x27;ll update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI... in the User&#x27;s Manual it is recommended that you DO NOT submerge this razor - despite its ability to be used wet or dry, and the fact that it is recommended that you clean it under running hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/27/12:&lt;br /&gt;Used the razor in the shower today to do my legs and underarms.

            <li> Before purchasing this razor the last time I used an electric razor was around 30 years ago. It was like a trip down memory lane in that it was very much the same as the Norelco that I used in my youth. I would have thought that there would have been major changes in technology in a 30 years. In  my opinion it doesn&#x27;t cut as close as a real razor but it does the job. I don&#x27;t think any electric razor will beat a &amp;#34;real razor.&amp;#34; But as I get older it really doesn&#x27;t matter if I have a little stubble, and besides it gives me the&lt;br /&gt;George Clooney look. To quote my wife &amp;#34; only in your dreams.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I like that I can clean it with water instead of just blowing and brushing it every day. The charging indicator could use a little more led exposure. Other than that it works great.</li>
            <li> Love this razor although not as good as a straight edge</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric razor that I have ever owned.  I have only used it as a wet shaver and it performs great.  I have used it everyday for over two weeks now and I have yet to have to recharge it.  It shaves very close.  It is quiet and does the job quickly</li>
            <li> Aquatec technology provides a fast, smooth shave. Battery life is very good also. Cleaning is simple. Very little to compain about.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  I searched the comments and decided that this was a cut above the cheaper models, and was at a good price.  He is able to run it under the water, and it holds a charge.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my brother when I switched machine. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor.  I get a really good clean shave; this is an improviment over my old Norelco which I did nto think was possible.  I use it dry so cannont comment on using it wet.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL!!!  Cuts my tough beard with EASE ... providing a comfortably close shave!  VERY quiet operation.  Easy to clean by rinsing in lukewarm  water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor now for a few weeks. It works great wet or dry...but wet is definitely the best way to use it. Take it in the shower with you....soap your face up and when you&#x27;ve had a great shave just flip the heads open and run it under the water to clean it up. My wife has the same razor and uses it on her legs.....I recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Got it for myself, and I love it. My skin is  smooth and the hair on my chin is cut perfectly without any irritation.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new shaver and is happy with its performance, but says it doesn&#x27;t shave curves and edges of his face and neck as well as a good old-fashioned razor.  Still, for every day shaving, its great.</li>
            <li> This was my bf gift. He loves it. He prefers using shaving cream/gel with it or in the shower. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for awhile now and have had no problems with it. The item works as described as the seller stated.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco electric razor for many years and I like its quality and ease of shaving of Phillips products.</li>
            <li> It is very quiet which is nice, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same power or speed my old Remington did. For daily work-week shaving my shadow starts to come back 2-2:30 so it doesn&#x27;t cut very close. On the flipside, if I skip shaving Sat/Sun, when I shave for Monday morning it does very well. Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I had an electric razor when I was in college and after it broke I just used blades.  I have been having a problem finding time to shave everyday in my morning stupor, which is why I think I get so much razor burn.  Well I decided to try an electric razor so that I could shave everyday in hopes of not having razor burn and also looking respectable.  I must say that this thing gives a nice close shave. I also like that I can use shaving cream with it when I have the time.  Comparing it to my previous Braun razor I like this much better.  It is also very easy to clean which is a plus to.  A simple rinse and its done, add in that it gets a full charge in about an hour I am not sure what else it could offer.</li>
            <li> This sounds like it runs slower, but does the job.  The charge appears to last a very long time.  Never as good as a razor, but incredibly handy.</li>
            <li> After 65 years of using a straight razor, my husband is now using a Philips Norelco.  He needs to take a blood thinner and each time he cuts himself with a straight razor, the bleeding is excessive.  He resisted getting a new electric razor but now he tell me he \\&quot;love it\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Warning! This razor does not work when plugged in to an outlet. So if the battery is low it may stop working while you are still shaving and you will have to wait for it to recharge. If this is an issue for you I highly recommend purchasing the PT730 which does work corded and cordless so when the battery eventually becomes weak or unreliable you will still be able to shave with the PT730 for as long as you need to whereas the AT830 will probably need replacement. I hope this helped with your decision.</li>
            <li> I recently replaced my 12 year old Norelco Razor with this Aquatec. What a nice surprise that this razor is even better than my I old tried and true razor. Faster charging, closer shaving wet or dry and quiet operation. Came home from a 4 day trip without shaving and this baby gave me a blade like shave right through the thick growth no problem. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and I&#x27;m hard to please. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> The shave feels somewhat rough and the shaver is rather noisy.  When you charge the battery, you can&#x27;t tell whether the battery is full or half full or drained although the picture on the box suggests digital display of percentage of charging. In the past one week of our ownership, it performs like a shaver half of its price.  However, the quick-charging system and the aquatic feature are nice.</li>
            <li> After about a year of use, I changed the shaving heads.  It is still working perfectly, gives a good close shave, and I love the short time to fully charge it.  I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these shavers now for nearly 50 years! Each seems to last around seven.&lt;br /&gt;I was tempted to buy the new floating head style, but didn&#x27;t feel the need to change what I already loved.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is smooth and fast, using a pre-shave powder.&lt;br /&gt;It can be cleaned under water once in a while and air dried.&lt;br /&gt;Of course, to cut costs, additions such as charging stands and leather pouches have disappeared, but I have some left from previous shavers.</li>
            <li> I recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable smooth and lives up to hype&lt;br /&gt;Wet feature desirable and  keeps charge for well over two weeks</li>
            <li> This is a very fine shaver. I&#x27;ve been using a electric for over thirty years, but it seemed that the conventional reciprocating microscreen was irritating my face, so I decided to try a rotary. Even though I hadn&#x27;t used a blade in thirty years, it seemed that it took my skin a few days to get used to the rotary heads. Once that happened, I found that this machine shaved very quickly and efficiently, and seldom left any hair behind. As some others have pointed out, the rotary heads have a bit of a problem on the upper lip, however you can get used to this, at which point there really isn&#x27;t much of a problem. I haven&#x27;t used this shaver in the wet mode, as I haven&#x27;t shaved wet in so long. It does a great job dry. I do pop the head open and rinse the entire business end with hot water every day, the let it air dry open until the next morning. The one complaint I have with this shaver is with the pop up trimmer. It isn&#x27;t as good as the ones I&#x27;m used to. The accessory trimmers that are available for the higher end Norelcos may be better, but that&#x27;s a lot of money for an electric shaver. You can buy a darned good Wahl sideburn trimmer for under $20.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver.  Very quiet and effective.  It is especially gentle enough for shaving the head and neck areas.  Also very easy to clean, just ensure to run the blade section though hot water after each use.</li>
            <li> First electric razor ever and it is absolutely amazing. Very close shave whether it is dry shave or wet shave, doesn&#x27;t burn skin or anything. Highly recommended !</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for over 40 years. Over the past 12 years the quality of the Norelco shaves has gone down.  Finally Norelco has introduce a shaver that is reminiscent of the ones I purchased in my 20&#x27;s. I am experiencing the closest shaves that I have had in decades.</li>
            <li> This electric, cordless razor is adequate given that it is not one of Norelco&#x27;s super fancy Sensotouch units. But it does seem overpriced for what it is. You can save money by getting a still-available older model like Norelco&#x27;s 7310 which is a great deal for the cost. I think the 7310 is pretty much a reliable workhorse. The lithium-ion batteries of the newer line, including the AT830, are not as reliable over time. I think that some of these models like the 7310, which can be found for around half the price of the AT830 if you shop around, are really just as good. It depends too on how often you&#x27;re shaving and how heavy of a beard you have. I happen to not have a heavy beard, and using the budget line models is just fine for my purposes. It&#x27;s not that the AT830 isn&#x27;t a pretty decent product in its own right, it is. I really like Norelco in general and would recommend the AT830 to someone looking for a mid-level cordless razor. I just don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything that really sets it apart from the lower price units, especially the older ones that did not use li-ion batteries. I don&#x27;t think you can really go wrong with a Norelco razor, it just comes down to how much you feel like splurging for a few extra bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> My son is always forgetting to shave before going to work. This shaver is perfect for people like him who needs to shave fast but don&#x27;t make time for the old shaving cream and razor approach. He can use it in the car if I drive him. Keeps it in his room charging and it works like a pro. High quality and seems built to last.</li>
            <li> When my wife gave me a very expensive ($200 +) razor with it&#x27;s own cleaning stand etc. I was told I had the best shave in the business.  Not so.  I struggled ten minutes a shave and then noticed I&#x27;d missed whole tufts here and there.  I got so I dreaded the chore of shaving and re-shaving.  This went on for over two years because I&#x27;d been assured there was no better shave to be had.  Finally, I said enough - which temporarily hurt my wife&#x27;s feelings but saved my face.  This new product shaves fast and misses nothing.  My face doesn&#x27;t chafe.  I like to shave.  And each day I can truthfully say I\\&quot;ve never had a better shave!</li>
            <li> Will never replace shaving with barber soap and a good razor. That said it&#x27;s great if I&#x27;m in a big hurry or need to touch up before a late day meeting.</li>
            <li> I purchased the electric shaver for my use.  My husband is handicapped and can no longer shave himself using a regular razor, so I used the Norelco to shave him, while he is in his bath.  I was pleasantly surprised how easy it is to keep him looking neat&lt;br /&gt;  Patti Z</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with the Philips Norelco AT830 Power Touch Rechargeable Cordless Razor, Gray/Silver/Black. This is my second Norelco shaver.  The first one I got as a gift, over 10 years ago worked like a charm from day one. The AT830 is  like a hatchet, rips up my neck and it is very painful.  Fortunately it has a 45 day money back guarantee. They say in the instructions,  that they want me to use it exclusively for 30 days, so I will get use to it. I used it once and I am ready to send it back. There is know way I am going to go to work, with my neck all red after using this chainsaw that they call a razor. I don&#x27;t understand all the good reviews, and wish I read one like this. Don&#x27;t  waste your time with this hunk of junk!  I would give it minus 5 stars if I could!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son, he has never used an electric shaver before now. I read a lot of good reviews and bought this one. Very happy about my purchase.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job of shaving. I replaced this one with a Panasonic that I had. The Panasonic was okay but was a very loud razor and shaved rough. The Norelco was quiet and shaved smoothly.</li>
            <li> the wet shaving is good as i expected.&lt;br /&gt;it good for the skin and at the same time it&#x27;s shaving very clean!!!!&lt;br /&gt;totally what I want!!!&lt;br /&gt;good product!!</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco for 30+ years and they just keep gettin better  The shaving platform moves to follow your face contours and great shave dry or wet.  Easy to wash out too.  No need to pay more than this as anything else is just more of the same at higher price and no better shave.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected! May be its just me! But I went for Philips ys524 model and that really worked well:-)</li>
            <li> The blade has both slots and holes unlike some of the cheaper razor blade assemblies. Clean it every other use as the blades cost as much as the whole razor.</li>
            <li> This honestly cuts the same as my 15 year old norelco and no better or worse...and I&#x27;m really sad considering I&#x27;m using original blades on the two norelco ones ive had---hey--- since 16 and now 33 i&#x27;ve gotten bye fine.  Thought this would make sense---it does----if you probably add up buying the cost of the razors and the chances of a new one being ..better.  But I can&#x27;t take the company away from quality products!  This hasn&#x27;t changed!</li>
            <li> As a Norelco user for over 20 yrs. This shaver provided the closest shave immediately with no nicks or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Norelco has been tops in razors for years.  Last year I bought him another brand and he tried to like it but asked if I&#x27;d mind&lt;br /&gt;his going back to a Norelco.  It gives a close shave for someone with a heavy beard.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with it and it is sturdy&lt;br /&gt;and lasts for years.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth shave used dry. I have not used it wet. No razor burn. Shaves well, even along my squared-off jaw line.</li>
            <li> this was a gift and he was excited to get it. he charged it and then tried to use it and it didn&#x27;t work right. We returned it</li>
            <li> I have a rough and nappy beard like most people of African descent.  I absolutely cannot use a straight razor without bumping up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I splurged and got the Panasonic ES-LV81-K Arc 5 figured that paying three hundred bills that it had to work..but it was too bulky, loud, and still left me with irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned my 300 dollar Panasonic and ordered this model because I wanted to try rotary and I liked how it fits into my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well after 3 weeks. My Lady out of nowhere remarked \\&quot;Wow the irritation on your neck has completely cleared up\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is quiet, easy to maneuver, and leaves no irritation on black skin.  The main difference between this and the Panasonic that I mentioned earlier is that you  don&#x27;t need to do multiple passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got mine from Target because Amazon was back ordered.  You also can buy the Jet Clean base Direct from Phillips, mine is already on its way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Shave with Noxzema and Vinegar.  Hope this helps</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this razor was the grip.  It has a rubber grip that makes it easy to handle, especially when using it while wet, or cleaning it under the faucet.  Out of the box, the initial charge only took a few minutes to get a level that allowed me to take a quick \\&quot;five minute\\&quot; test shave, which, since I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair to begin with, is about all I need anyways.  The full charge took roughly an hour, which provides me about a week of shaving before having to charge it again (again, note that I have a light beard that doesn&#x27;t require a lengthy shave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave was about what I expected from any electric.  I could feel it pull at the hairs, but itwasn&#x27;t too bad.  As the blades wear, it may become more of an issue, but that&#x27;s also to be expected by any electric.  The heads do flex to try andcontour your face, but it really doesn&#x27;t do a lot.  It still seemed to provide a spotty shaveover the jawline and under the neck.  The groomer tool on the back also does a pretty good job, but is nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is a snap.  Literally.  The head pops open easily to remove stuckhair and debris, and then snaps back shut. Simple.  It can also be cleaned furtherunder water, which is a plus.  The headcan also be completely removed from the body of the razor, but I&#x27;m slightly concerned about the durability of the mechanism that attaches the head to the body of the razor, as it&#x27;s a small piece of metal with a ridge that looks like it could possibly wear over time (or maybe even break) if removed/replaced often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this razor provides an average shave that you would expect out of any electric razor, but the aesthetics and features of this razor make it stand out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all these good reviews.  Did I get a defective shaver?  Since I purchased this shaver to compliment my Panasonic foil 8249S, I have had horrible shaving from this model.  My panasonic leaves a few neck hairs and only get 4 shaves per charge.  This norelco leaves hairs all over the place.  I really gave it a chance and used it 8 different ways from dry to wet.  Not smooth at all. Very irritating in the neck area. I cannot recommend this shaver.  I also own the 9160XL, triple blade system and it is a lot better than this one.  My final choice is the panasonic.</li>
            <li> This is my umpteenth Norelco electric &#x27;triple-header&#x27; going back to the 60&#x27;s.  (I think my first one was made of wood and stone!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I purchased the AT830 from Amazon a couple of months ago, I had to be sold on an $80+ unit, and the Amazon reviewers painted a very accurate picture of the shaver&#x27;s pros and cons.  It feels sturdy, and is comfortable to grip.  It charges quickly, and the battery life is reasonable.  It shaves very cleanly, gets into difficult spots around my mouth and the grip permits accurate detailing.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive neck skin when you wet the shaving head and use Alba AIO Gel (per other reviewers&#x27; recommendation).  The fact that it could also be cleaned under tap water was the final selling point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s a Con, I&#x27;m hesitant to put it away wet, so I lay the razor on its side on a washcloth with the head flipped up until it&#x27;s all dried out.  No big thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall result:  highly recommended for convenient electric shaving.</li>
            <li> best razor i have went through 3 to find a good one</li>
            <li> Advantage is you can get this wet and use shave cream.  It is very light-weight, but makes me wonder how durable and long-lasting it will be.  My 17 yr old son uses this regularly with no copmplaint, however.</li>
            <li> Had it about 6 weeks. Using it almost every day, only had to charge it twice so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s quiet and light. I&#x27;d considered the more expensive version with the fancier head, but I couldn&#x27;t see a real benefit to it and the replacement heads for this one are less expensive as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out using it dry, but quickly switched to shaving in the shower with it. I use cheap shaving creme and even hair conditioner a couple times in an emergency and it delivers a smooth shave with no irritation. I&#x27;ve read that electric shaver blades have a &amp;#34;break-in&amp;#34; period and it does seem to be shaving better now than when I first got it, but that may just be me getting used to using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first waterproof electric razor and now that I using it, I wish I&#x27;d made the switch a long time ago. Previously I&#x27;d used a safety razor out of some misguided sense of manliness and couldn&#x27;t seem to go a week without cutting myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily cleaning consists of popping open the head and trimmer and passing it under the showerhead. I do set the unit out of the shower to dry when done using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s likely not any razor that would be the one best choice everyone due to different expectations and varieties of skin and hair. But, this razor is a quality product and a good value and would probably be worth giving a try for most people. Try if for a few weeks and definitely try it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I  would not  want to be without  this razor. I plan on buying several of  these  as  gifts. The best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This product met all my expectations and I would recommend it highly to others.  I especially like the ease of cleaning this razor.  This razor was a Christmas gift and much appreciated by my son who received it.</li>
            <li> With this shaver you may shave without cutting your face. Then you only have to use a straight edge for perilous circumstances, i.e. job interview.</li>
            <li> After a 4 day beard,I used the Philips Norelco AT830 and it didn&#x27;t perform well at all... Thinking about swapping for the one with the individual heads..</li>
            <li> got as a gift at Christmas, grate shaver, very fast shave on smooth results, easy clean out with air can. Would recomend</li>
            <li> I have always liked Norelco razors.  I think this is my third one.  The others have lasted for years.  Have not tried it with foam yet.  I am just used to dry shaving.</li>
            <li> fine shaver for the price, I would recommend this shaver to all...best price, cheap shipping and a close shave. Buy it now!</li>
            <li> I have always had Norelco&#x27;s shavers but this is the best so far. It dose a nice job. I have large hands and feels feel&#x27;s  good in my hand.</li>
            <li> This shaver replaces a previous 3-head Norelco whose battery died. The new shaver appears and sounds cheaper. Mostly, I am disappointed that the new one does not run on AC (plugged in) the way my old one did.</li>
            <li> I have had several Norelco razors before and they worked ok, but I just wasn&#x27;t satisfied.  I tried this one because I could use it in the shower to shave like I did with a safety razor.  It works great.  I read and understood I needed to use it about 3 weeks before it would become a closer shave.  I have used it two weeks and each day it is a little better shave.  I like shaving with it and am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an update after using the razor for 5 weeks.  It shaves closer after 5 weeks and I love using it to shave in the shower.  I don&#x27;t ever want to go back to using the expensive blades in my old triple shaver.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor that I have ever owned. When you read the instructions they advise you to try it for 20+ days before you make a decision because you skin needs to get use to it. If I had not read this and went by the first experience with it, I would have certainly returned it and probably written a not so favorable review. At first my skin would get extremely irritated when I used this, however, now I can use it with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is certainly easier than using traditional razors and the product itself seems to be very well made. I use it wet and dry, and the battery seems to last a very long time. So far no complaints about the product.</li>
            <li> I switched back to an electric razor after many years.  This provides a good shave, it is quick, and the device is comfortable and easy to use.  The battery easily lasts over a week.  It is not as close a shave as with my prior Fusion, but still good.</li>
            <li> I had a series of operations on my hands over the past thirteen years, and my wife bought me a Norelco shaver like this one so I could shave without getting my hands wet.  I loved it.  The shaver&#x27;s NiCad batteries finally died, so I reluctantly bought this one to replace it.  What a good decision.  This AT830 is at least the equal of my old one and probably better.  Fine product.  I&#x27;m glad to see that Norelco is keeping up the quality.  (Oh, and the sideburn trimmer works even better than the old one.)</li>
            <li> Terrific when used wet, say soap or foam.</li>
            <li> Most of the trimmers have difficulty in reaching all the areas. Bottom portion of the chin, moustache hair near to the nose , hairs 2 cmb below the ears.</li>
            <li> I have owned Norelco Razors for many years. This one works fine but no advance warning when you need to recharge, unlike the previous versions. It also doesn&#x27;t feel as durable as the previous razors of past in similar line.</li>
            <li> Overall I found this shaver to be pretty good - does a neat and clean job around the neck (most difficult) and took my skin about a week to get adjusted to.  If this is the first time you are using a electric shaver - be warned - you are not going to like it - use it for about 4-6 weeks and then you will definitely start liking it.  Also, if you are a person who sometimes once in 2 days/3 days - this is not for you - Electric shavers are not very good at handling 2-3 days of accumulated hair.  You need to use your regular razor.  Other points about this shaver    * Pivot head - very good around the neck    * Rechargeable - almost all shavers are, but worth mentioning    * replacement head cost around $25 - typically last around 6-9 months    * No Battery indicator - suggestion: keep it always plugged in    * Quiet and smooth shave</li>
            <li> I shaved with a blade for many years, but have tried several different electrics over the past year because I like the convenience of not having to stand in front of a bathroom mirror to shave. In my quest to find the right razor for me I tried a Norelco SensoTouch 3D, a Braun, and now this Norelco AT830.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AT830 actually gave me a better shave than the fancier and more expensive SensoTouch. The closeness and time shaving were about the same, but I got less irritation with the AT830, particularly in the sensitive area below my chin. One big thing I like about the Norelco rotary razors is the fact that they are really quiet. They&#x27;re also comfortable to hold and lightweight. Thumbs up for ergonomics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like about the AT830 were the lack of features. There is no battery meter, only a light that flashes when the battery is about to run out. A big detractor is the fact that you cannot use this razor plugged in; you have to wait until there is a charge and unplug it before you can use it. If you need to shave and the battery&#x27;s run out, you&#x27;re out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I get a better shave with the Bran--closer, quicker, and with no irritation. However, everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and it&#x27;s worth trying a variety of different razors to find out which works best for your skin. If you are looking to try a rotary razor I would recommend this one over the more expensive SensoTouch.</li>
            <li> Love my razor&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase !!!!</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s service is always excellent.  Shaver was better than expected.  I&#x27;ve used Norelco&#x27;s for years and this is the best one yet.  Very smooth and a very comfortable shave.  Thanks.  Have bought a lot from Amazon and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> The pivot feature of the shaver&#x27;s head is probably more helpful than realized.  While lightweight, it has good power.  The pop-up edger is the same as on more economical models.  It&#x27;s best when charged on a regular schedule as the battery indicator does not indicate when it&#x27;s near empty.  This is important as the shaver cannot be used when plugged in.  The black rubber grip keeps it from slipping out of your hand.</li>
            <li> A very nice shave. I bought this for my blind brother and he gets a great shave every day so it is doing what I wanted. I have to clean it for him weekly but he uses it daily.</li>
            <li> I have been using my new Norelco AT830 for about a month.  I didn&#x27;t realize it when I ordered it, but this is truly a CORDLESS razor.  That is, you charge the battery by plugging the cord into a power outlet -- but it WILL NOT OPERATE with the cord plugged into the outlet.  It operates totally- and ONLY - on battery.  I was concerned about this at first, because unlike a lot of men who can whip thru a shave in 3 - 5 minutes, I seem to take almost twice as long.  I was concerned about having to constantly recharge the battery.  However, I was pleased to find that the first battery charge lasted for 5 or 6 shaves..(..and close to - if not exactly - the 50 minutes specified in the instruction booklet).  The power remained &amp;#34;strong and constant&amp;#34; throughout the entire charge.  I&#x27;m sure it helps me that, being an old retired fellow, I no longer shave every single day.  I suspect, too, that most users would get a lot more than 5 or 6 shaves out of every charge.  So far, I am very satisfied with the performance of this shaver..</li>
            <li> easy to handle a clean shave also easy to clean after you shave</li>
            <li> Replace blades every six months, so not much cheaper than blades. Does a very good job with Lectric shave.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to spend the extra money for the waterproof feature, but it does work very well. The battery life lasts for a very long time and it takes about an hour to get back to a full-charge when the low battery light goes on. It gets a very close shave.</li>
            <li> This items was returned</li>
            <li> VERY QUIET,  RUN FOREVER BEFORE RECHARGE, BUT NOT AS CLOSE A SHAVE AS EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> Great for a begining teen shaver</li>
            <li> Gives me a very smooth shave and lasts almost 2 weeks when I shave 5 Days a week. I even shaved my head with it once.</li>
            <li> the stand to hold it when not in use was missing from packaging.  We kept the shaver as my husband did not want to bother with returning it as he liked the unit itself.  Just part of advertised pkg. was missing.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco AT830 PowerTouch is the best electric razor my husband has ever used.  It actually gives him a shave that is \\&quot;blade close\\&quot;.  He keeps the razor and charger in the car and uses it on the go.  The battery is long lasting and charges up quickly.  The blades, while providing a close shave, are not irritating to the skin, even on the neck area. He highly recommends The Philips Norelco AT830 PowerTouch razor.</li>
            <li> ordered this because have had gr8 luck with norelco electric razors.  Tried using in shower, did ok but prefer to use with electric shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it a 1 star rating because it doesn&#x27;t really work on my face.  It doesn&#x27;t get all of the hairs unless I continuously go over the same spot over &amp; over.  After that it has irritated my skin.  It might be just my type of hair so this rating might not be for everyone.  I am Puerto Rican with a history of ingrown hair problems.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a trihead shaver to replace my old one.  I use electric razors because it&#x27;s faster than a blade, it&#x27;s cheaper, and gets about the same results.  This saver however, does not do well.  When using a new shaving method, it generally takes a week to get use to it.  It took me over three weeks to get use to this shaver.  It glides over my face pretty well, but it some times takes two or three passes to get an area completely shaven.  I need to shave every day, but my face can&#x27;t handle more than two or three days in a row with this shaver before the irritation becomes unbearable.  I would not buy again, nor do I recommend any one else buying this model.  Before this I had a Remington trihead from Walgreens for $40 that was much better than this one.  This shaver can get a pretty close shave, maybe too close.  When I use this shaver with cream, it doesn&#x27;t bother my face as bad.  When using it dry, it leaves my skin really dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros;&lt;br /&gt;-Sleek design&lt;br /&gt;-Nice and heavy feel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons;&lt;br /&gt;-Loud&lt;br /&gt;-Can&#x27;t use while charging&lt;br /&gt;-Irritates skin&lt;br /&gt;-Very Expensive for the sub par performance and lack of features</li>
            <li> I shave in the shower lathering up with bar soap instead of shaving cream.  I love the way my Norelco wet/dry shaver glides across my face when used with soap.  However, this is the third Norelco wet/dry razor I have owned.  The battery dies after about two years without warning.  If you don&#x27;t own a stick razor, you may be going to work unshaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to replacing blades on a stick razor every week, the cost of buying a new electric shaver every two years and replacing the blades once is still less than the cost of a new stick blade every week.  To replace the battery in a Norelco wet/dry shaver requires soldering.  I would rather just replace the razor.  I would like Norelco&#x27;s razors even more if they incorporated a replaceable battery.  I like my Norleco wet/dry shavers very much.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I depend on my shaver to be there for me every morning and there is no warning when it will quit.  It also doesn&#x27;t work while plugged in which would at least get me by until my next shaver purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Close comfortable shave&lt;br /&gt;Ease of use&lt;br /&gt;Cost of ownership&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Battery dies after two years (without warning)</li>
            <li> Great razor better than a blade by far.  Use the Jell type shaving cream.  Use in the shower and every day shave.</li>
            <li> Works about as good as every other shaver i&#x27;ve had. Hopefully the battery lasts longer than the previous ones.</li>
            <li> So far so good, my spouse is African American with a very coarse beard.  He had to switch to a electric shaver per doctor&#x27;s orders due to a medical condition.  In the past I had ordered and returned several shavers due to them not shaving as close as described, even after reading other reviews.  These listed were shavers that I did try but returned.  (Philips Norelco 1150x/40 Shaver 6100; Panasonic ES8103S Arc3 Electric Shaver Wet/Dry; Wahl Professional 8061 5-star Series Rechargeable Shaver ).  So he has had this one for a few weeks and this might be a pretty good selection for anyone with a coarse beard.</li>
            <li> This is the only electric razor that my husband has ever liked.  He tried others, but none gave him the close shave that this razor does.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in October 2012, and it now won&#x27;t turn off. Should have gotten the extended warranty because it is not made to last. Typical crap.</li>
            <li> I boght this product on 1/25.  It was a brand new model so there was a delay, it shipped to me on 2/9.&lt;br /&gt;It works good.&lt;br /&gt;But one morning, it would not turn on.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the charge (I have a backup charger).&lt;br /&gt;Philip&#x27;s warranty website is defective.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m certainly disappointed in a a failure after 4 months.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my future son-in-law.  He has extremely sensitive skin and as such, has problems shaving with a traditional hand-held blade razor.  He LOVES his Norelco.  He uses it every day and is very pleased with it.  Says he gets a close shave with none of the irritation from a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> This razor looks so good and gives a close shave. Haven&#x27;t used it in the shower and may not but good to know I can if I want to.</li>
            <li> Was bought as a gift and the feedback I have is that it works perfect and does a great job and charges up really very fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been partial to a straight blade razor. I always heard how poor electric razors performed. Not any more. This razor has exceeded all my expectations, and my beard isn&#x27;t the easiest in the world to shave. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the razor.  I have had models with a few more features in the past, but this one gives a good shave.  My only problem with Norelco is the batteries stop working after I have had a razor a year or two.</li>
            <li> I wish that this razor had come with a carrying case and a charging stand. the razor is exactly as I expected it. It arrived in fine shape and on time.</li>
            <li> At830 says made in netherlands well I opened it up. Box and shaver says made in china allmy other norelco shavers Netherlands,must  trying toget away cheap product,ask said made in china inferior product and workmanship tp Netherlands made</li>
            <li> Nearly 15 years ago, I had a very bad experience with an electric razor. I have been using regular razors since that time. Nowadays, I decided to give a chance to electric razors again. I have made some researches and found this product. So, I have been using it just for a week and I can easily say that It&#x27;s working like a charm. Frankly, It didn&#x27;t give me the same results like regular razors but it was so close. I have even not expected that. I really like it.</li>
            <li> great shave!!..I have a cheaper Norelco model, and there IS a difference…this one is smoother,better battery life, waterproof (!!)..the whole thing can be rinsed in water…much less irritation than a blade…I&#x27;m never goin&#x27; back to razors!!</li>
            <li> I bought for my husband. It works great.  Nice clean shave.  I had really fast response  .  I would recommend this shaver</li>
            <li> Shaves  as well as my old Norelco shaver, however lacks the most basic features.  No case for traveling, however it fits into my old shavers case.  No indication of battery life remaining and no stand.  Will not operate while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon service was good as always.  Received on time and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> This razor works fairly well. Being able to wash it off saves a ton of effort keeping it clean. I have noticed that it performs better and causes less irritation when wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor to replace a Norelco I have had for a very long time (12 years). That old one still works, but the blades needed to be replaced and the razor costs almost as much as the blades, (I have since found out on youtube how to sharpen them again on an old mirror).&lt;br /&gt;This razor is really quiet compared to the old one. I&#x27;m not afraid of waking the whole house in the morning when using this one. Being new, it cuts effortlessly. I don&#x27;t have thick heavy stubble, so I&#x27;m no sure how well it would work on a thick beard, but for an average shadow it works great. It charges in about an hour, which is a lot less than the old one, and lasts for a few weeks of shaving once a day. There is a battery light that tells you when it is getting low. The trimmer works as expected and is a nice feature to have. The price was average. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best electric razor I have ever owned.  It is very quiet and efficient.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Quite surprised at how quiet it is compared to previous models. Gives a better shave than my older razor did with new blades.I&#x27;ve owned two Norelco razors previously and had the last one twelve years. I needed blades and the battery was not holding a charge on the last one. While I could have repaired it easily I opted for a new razor as I was intrigued with the idea of using it wet and cleaning it with a wash and the total cost for blades and a new battery was approaching the price of this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miss having a travel case. The open plastic cover doesn&#x27;t cut it in a travel bag. Lucky me it&#x27;s the same form as the previous razor so I will continue to use my old cover. Not sure about not having a battery level indicator though it does have a recharge light. We&#x27;ll see what happens if I&#x27;m on a trip and it goes off on the first day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used electric razors my whole life. I&#x27;ve had everything from $39 ones to a $250 self-cleaning system. This 4500 model is the best I&#x27;ve ever owned. It&#x27;s so smooth and conforming without irritation, and gives a remarkably smooth shave. The lithium battery delivers constant power,so shaving efficiency is always there. The price is a true value for this quality of razor and shave.</li>
            <li> A fine replacement for my previous norelco.  Holds its charge for many weeks with normal use.</li>
            <li> Worked for a year or so and the battery died overnight</li>
            <li> Philips models AT830 and 6948XL are among the most useful of current rotary shavers. Both have articulated cutting heads in 3-head assemblies that are imbedded in shaver bodies rather than in floating holders. Both have internal batteries and wide, pop-up trimmers. Neither comes with a charging stand. A battery charge is rated to provide 50 minutes use with model AT830 and 35 minutes use with model 6948XL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intermediate-priced model AT830 has a lithium-ion battery, has cutting heads mounted in a rocking holder and is waterproof, allowing wet shaving. It comes with an external 15 volt, 5 watt AC-to-DC power converter that charges the battery in an hour or less. Indicator lights show when the battery needs charging and when it is fully charged. Model AT830 uses the newer HQ8 heads that provide somewhat closer shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value-priced model 6948XL has a nickel-metal-hydride battery, has cutting heads mounted in a fixed holder and is not waterproof, providing only dry shaving. It connects directly to AC power. Its internal power converter takes a rated 8 hours to charge the battery. There are no battery indicator lights, so users guess when the battery needs charging and time the charges themselves. Model 6948XL uses the older HQ56 heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The newer HQ8 heads each have two segments with fine, circular holes that are positioned toward the inside of a 3-head assembly. They are apparently intended to emulate the performance of foil shavers, handling short whiskers so that they are squarely cut. However, there are only 9 blades on an HQ8 cutter versus 15 blades on an older HQ56 cutter. To compensate, AT-series shavers rotate about 50 percent faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave quality with model AT830 is good, if not quite as close as one gets from skillful use of a straight razor. It takes somewhat longer to get a uniform shave with model AT830 than with model 6948XL. Shave quality with model 6948XL is marginal, although it is better than one got with Norelco rotaries years ago. With either current Philips model, it takes less time to get uniform coverage of difficult neck and chin areas than it usually takes with a foil shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips rotaries have become value leaders among current electric shavers. Performance has improved over the Norelco rotary shavers of years ago--the brand Philips distributed in North America before the early 1980s. Philips currently offers models with good performance at premium, intermediate and value prices. Premium models have cutting heads mounted in floating holders and come with charging stands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using Remington electrics years ago, when they were the most reliable units of the day. In those days Norelco provided a shave with little skin irritation, but it was a fairly coarse shave with poor feel and appearance. Then Braun, while owned by Gillette, introduced titanium foil shavers that combined fairly close shaves with little skin irritation, and I switched to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, foil shavers don&#x27;t cope well with outlying areas of neck and chin, where whiskers tend to bend over and escape being clipped. The Braun triple-track design does better than just a curved foil, but it typically needs many passes to provide a uniform shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With their high speeds, foil shavers don&#x27;t really cut whiskers. They grind whiskers to powder, provided the whiskers can be persuaded through the holes in the surface of a foil. Currently Braun is delivering its best foil technology to the U.S. only at premium prices, encouraging another look at alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rotary shavers provide much of their action around the edges of disk-shaped \\&quot;combs\\&quot; where whiskers can slip through slots. Their low speeds encourage shaving with slower and more strategic motions. Because rotaries are quiet, one easily hears when cutters engage whiskers. Recent Philips models provide thinner combs and more precise mating of cutter blades to combs, as compared with Norelco models of years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning a rotary shaver appears more important than cleaning a foil shaver. Larger whisker fragments put drag on heads and internal parts. Removing head assemblies and brushing while dry has proved most effective, even though model AT830 can be washed with hot water. Philips does not offer cleaning accessories comparable to accessories from Braun. A few premium shavers have cleaning bases that can&#x27;t be bought separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips model AT830 is a good choice for everyday use at home. Overall, it performs as well or better than current foil shavers and provides uniform shaves somewhat faster. However, a little more time will be spent cleaning the shaver. Model 6948XL might be a good choice as a travel shaver. It&#x27;s somewhat more rugged and won&#x27;t cost as much to replace if lost or damaged.</li>
            <li> This is the second norelco I have owneed. The first one lasted many, many years and it was just time to replace it..The AT830 works excellentt. Very close shave. I only use it for dry shaving. I do recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I like Norlec shavers but this one did not shave me as close as I would like. Its OK but nbot like the other 4 Norelco shavers I had.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I&#x27;ve had. Works great in the shower</li>
            <li> Good close shave and nice to be able to use in the shower. I would recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> First of all, if you don&#x27;t want a bunch of details, just scroll down to the IN SUMMARY paragraph at the end!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a longtime Norelco user, and the AT830 is a winner for me.  Although I have a tough beard with hairs growing every which way, I have dealt with sensitive skin ever since I was a teenager. I learned a couple of decades ago that a rotary shaver that&#x27;s made for use in the shower was my salvation.  Thanks to Norelco wet-or-dry razors, I experience far less skin irritation.  For me, having a good rotary shaver in the shower is indispensable.  I know I&#x27;m not the only guy like this, so this is a detailed review for those of you who are considering an 810 or 830 model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was glad to learn of the new Aquatec models, having used the Norelco 6000 and 7000 series Cool Skin razors for many years.  For what it&#x27;s worth, I tried the last wet/dry model (the 8060X) with the fully exposed shaving heads attached to a single stalk.  After using it for a couple of weeks, I found that I couldn&#x27;t get as close a shave as with my old 7735X model with the weakening battery.  Also, the lack of a chamber for the clipped hair was inconvenient, so I returned it and went back to the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon learning of the newer Aquatec models, a friend (who&#x27;s also a Norelco wet/dry fan) and I cooked up a plan.  He also needed a new shaver thanks to a dying battery, so we both decided to buy a new model at the same time.  He bought the slightly less expensive AT810, while I spent the extra 20 bucks for the 830.  The only difference between the two is the \\&quot;Smart Pivot\\&quot; system on the 830, and I&#x27;d read mixed reviews as to whether it really mattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE TEST:&lt;br /&gt;We each used our razors for one week, cleaned them properly with a good blade wash, then traded razors for a second week trial.  We did not compare any notes until after going back to our own new shavers.  I not only compared the new models to each other, but also compared these shaves to those Igot with my 7735X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I tried one extra test once we got our original razors back after week two-  I took my old 7735 out of retirement for one last shave.  Granted, we aren&#x27;t professional testers, but we tried to stay consistent in our testing.  We both shaved just as we always did: in the morning before going to work.  Both of us shave in the shower.  The highly scientific test was for each of us to see how our shaves held up by 10 pm every night.  Before anyone gripes, yes I know that Norelco says you need at least 21 days to try out a new razor.  Well, here&#x27;s what we found when we compared our observations after two weeks and two days.  Your mileage may vary, as they say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS:&lt;br /&gt;We both found that the AT830 gave a closer shave.  No doubt about that; the pivot system did make a difference, since both models use the same HQ8 shaving heads.  To be honest, the difference in closeness was greater for me, but I really do have a tougher beard.  But by 10:00 each night, I noticed that I had a scratchier face of stubble using the 810.  For me, the extra $20 was worth it.  On the other hand, my pal felt that his model was fine for him, and he&#x27;s keeping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And how did my revisit with my old 7735X go after two weeks with the new models?  It gave me a longer lasting shave than the 810 did, but not quite as long as the 830.  If its battery weren&#x27;t on the way out, I&#x27;d keep that one.  However, I really like the fact that, unlike the 7000 series, the new models don&#x27;t require a charging stand.  The stand tips over easily and is an extra requirement to haul around when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who didn&#x27;t want to read my lengthy explanation, I totally understand!  Anyhow, I found that, with my difficult beard, the AT830 was the way to go.  I get a noticeably longer lasting shave than with the 810, and it slightly beats even my trusty old 7735X, which until now, no other razor could do.  The 810, however, might be OK for anyone with a beard that&#x27;s not so fussy.  Either way, you&#x27;ll get the closest, most comfortable shave in the shower with a good, low-foam shaving gel.  I hope this helps someone who really has wanted to know the difference.</li>
            <li> Pretty good but it does not cut as close as a razor.  Does get sideburns.  Odd shape so its somewhat awakard to store.  But it&#x27;s very quick and if you want a fresh shave it&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li> I replaced a Braun 790 series after only 10 months of use.  This razor is giving me a close shave in a short time.  I also can be used in the shower or with shave cream, although the heavier shave gel I tried did not leave a close shave.  I had a Norelco several years ago, but this razor has several configurations of cutting holes and gives a close shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this electric shaver for my partner as a gift. He uses it pretty regularly and I think it has helped him with edging of the goatee that he leaves. He does mention that he still needs to clean up with a regular blade after using but that it is easy to use. This was a plus as it was his first electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure clean hair out regularly as it clogs easily but this may depend on how thick you leave your facial hair grow before shaving. Using it about once per week for about a year, he has only had to charge it twice. He also states that it is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I decided to go cheap and buy this razor.  Big mistake.  First and most importantly the razor will shred your neck.  I do not have sensitive skin and have used electric razors for 20 years. It takes so many passes to get even a somewhat close shave you neck area will be red and raw for hours.  I recommend you spend the extra money on a better razor.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razors my entire life and this one is the best yet.  Extremely easy to clean, just run it under hot water.  Supersharp blades and fast battery recharge.  Could not ask for a better electric razor for the price.</li>
            <li> I have Had three Norelco Razors. This one will not run while plugged in or while charging. Not a good idea in my opinion.I like the way it cuts and feels on my face!!</li>
            <li> Great product, i still using it.  I recommended.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price. Worked as advertized. Gives a clean shave but takes a bit more time compared to a razor blade.</li>
            <li> I bought based on the hype ... the reality is that if you have a marginal beard it will probably work fine for you ... but my beard is very aggressive and rough (shave 2+ times a day depending on humidity etc.)  ... this does not cut it (pun intended) ...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this electric razor because it provides not only a nice close shave, but the skin feels soft and not irritated afterwards.</li>
            <li> I had shoulder surgery on my dominate side and could not shave with a straight razor.  This product was easy to use with my non-dominate arm and gave me a close shave.  It is very easy to clean and I enjoy wet/dry option.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> My first electric razor, was a Norelco, when I entered the Army in 1956. So a very long time, using them.&lt;br /&gt;On my last purchase a few years ago, I made an error, and bought another Brand or razor. Never liked it.&lt;br /&gt;So when it was time to buy a new one, I went back to my favorite brand.&lt;br /&gt;This one tops them all. Very light, quick charging, and a long shaving time. I can barely feel it working, but boy does it ever. Wet and dry, although I haven&#x27;t tried it wet as yet,&lt;br /&gt;Buy this, you won&#x27;t regret it, and I&#x27;m sure, live it as I do.</li>
            <li> My experiences with electric razors has been that they irritated my skin. After getting tired of paying way too much for straight razor blades, I decided to give The Phillips AT830 a try. The reason I decided to try the AT830 is the wet/dry feature, the best shave I&#x27;ve had! Close and smooth!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this model for my husband to try out before (R) rotator cuff surgery as he was trying out (L) handed razor shaving for the ultimate days to come.  He absolutely loves it now he is post op and is doing decently with his left hand all things considered.  Has a tough beard but loves the fact gel can be used as in shaving prior and he does use the balm afterwards.  I can attest his face is smooth.  So whilst not previously sold on electric shavers he&#x27;s a convert now and tells one and all about this model.  A charge seems to last 5 days or more and it&#x27;s an asset to be able to rinse the shaver head.</li>
            <li> This is a real good product, does the job well, gives you a fairly close shave, not for those who want a &amp;#34;baby face&amp;#34; level.</li>
            <li> Should have bought one of these years ago, worth every penny. Close, no irritation, smooth, definatly reccomend. Very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The shaver seemed to be getting dull so I replaced the shaver heads after one year and the new heads are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Shaver works great and holds charge as advertised.  Works much better than my last Norelco which did not even give a week of shaves.</li>
            <li> I really like it! The battery last forever! Incredible! Nice trimmer and great quality product! Donot miss this deal, you will love it</li>
            <li> This razor does a great job of not cutting the hair closely and also being able to burn your neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how the designers were able to get both of those features into such an expensive product, but they succeeded.</li>
            <li> I had been buying the least expensive Norelco model when it went on sale at Target. The blades became too dull to use after only 3 months, and since new blades were almost as expensive as a new shaver, I&#x27;d just get a new shaver. Each $35 purchase seemed inexpensive, but it was costing me $140 on a yearly basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then 16 months ago I found this on an Amazon Gold Box sale @ $40, only $5 more than the base model at Target. I ordered a set of new blades at the same time, since I expected to need them in 3 months. Long story short, not only does this shaver work great, and charge up in a couple of hours instead of 8, but the first set of blades lasted me a whole year. I&#x27;m now 4 months into the new blades, which are still cutting well. Best shaver buy ever.</li>
            <li> So far so good, works better than the one I had and I love the way it works on moist skin</li>
            <li> I have had it now for about 3 years.  It works ok if used daily, but not so well if you let your beard grow for a few days.  I can&#x27;t get used to being able to rinse the shaver to clean it, but is seems to be ok to do that.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;Works in shower, wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;1st electric I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;No more cuts and nicks.</li>
            <li> The shaver shaves as expected but there is no indicator as to how much of a charge is left on the batteries.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razors for a lot of years.  My last one finally died and I bought a replacement.  The new razor arrived in an unbelievably fast time.  If I remember correctly, I got it in two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for many years/ but the AT830 is superior to all of them/ It is my conclusion that it is the best shaver in the world/ Thank you Norelco &amp; Thank you Amazon for providing it on line.</li>
            <li> Replaced an old Norelco electric razor with this one and my husband was thrilled with it! It shaves very nicely and he went for almost a month before it needed recharging. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a love/hate relationship with Norelco shavers since the 1960s. The good news is that every time I buy a new one, it&#x27;s gotten significantly better than the one I owned before. The bad news is that they never last more than a few years, so you&#x27;ll end up buying a lot of them. This is a very good shaver, and priced inexpensively enough so that it isn&#x27;t nearly as painful to buy as some have been. You don&#x27;t need to spend more than this on a shaver -- this one has everything you&#x27;ll need, and at a pretty good price.</li>
            <li> Not a close shave at all .. thought I would save some time and money going to electric... have to clean up with a blade after.. stick with the blades.</li>
            <li> I have used a Norelco razor for 30 or 40 years with complete satisfaction.  It gives me a good shave, does not irritate my skin and is very easy to clean. That is all I expect from a razor.</li>
            <li> How hard can it be?  I know why they onll sell this junk around Christmas.  Always looks good in the commercials.. might as well shave with a sharp rock in realty.</li>
            <li> I read all reviews before i purchase item and ive been using this for more than 6month and i love it.  Working great and it does a great job. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, easy to clean and easy to maintain. New heads are readily available too.charges quickly and quietly with no annoying bright charging lights to disturb you when on the road</li>
            <li> I have owned for approximately one year.  Worked OK at first, but the longer I own it the less effective it becomes.  It now takes WAY too long to shave with this.  Not a good value.</li>
            <li> You can use it in the shower. It seems to have good battery life. The shave is not as great as I hoped it would be. I tend to have to repeat area often to get a clean shave on the neck. Other than that. Not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One annoying note. I purchased this product through the international website, but they don&#x27;t give you the option for different power adapters. It is only the US version.</li>
            <li> This is my second Philips Norelco shaver I bought, I previously had the Philips Norelco PT730 and the Braun Series 7 -790cc. I can say I prefer this shaver over the other shavers because of my sensitive skin. There are some days where I needed to do a wet shave because of how irritating my facial skin was. Another great advantage that the Philps Norelco line provides is mess-free shave. I can shave while at my computer, in the car, watching tv, or in the shower (Depending on the Shaver), which I think is a great perk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver can take a couple of weeks for your facial hair to get use too. It&#x27;s nice on the cheeks, but its unforgiving on the bread part. It can be quite a hassle for shaving around the bread area, so you just need to give it some time. But once everything is in order, it should be quite the smooth experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I gave it a 4/5 , 1 star off the bread cutting experience, but it serves as a daily shaver. I would recommend this as a present or gift to someone also.</li>
            <li> This item was purchased for my father; who recently has been cutting himself with his razor. We received this item on time and packaged well. My father has loved this razor. He enjoys the shave he gets from it, and that there is no more bleeding or sensitive skin issues from it.</li>
            <li> ... but I&#x27;ll not ask for my money back. On days when I haven&#x27;t time to give myself a proper shave, this razor keeps me presentable. It&#x27;s well designed: a comfortably fashioned grip for a surprisingly lightweight unit. Though it still feels odd to rinse an electric appliance immediately after use, such care does keep the blades and the stubble despository clean without electrocuting me. They&#x27;ve so perfected the batteries on these things that you can get over an hour&#x27;s shaving without recharging. When a recharge is necessary, it&#x27;s done very quickly. It&#x27;s a very good electric razor for the money.</li>
            <li> I think this item is overpriced. I had a cheaper electronic razor that shaved just as close. The one good thing about this razor is the battery life.</li>
            <li> Damn good except on the neck.  I use it for my shaved head and to shave my face daily.</li>
            <li> To mow down a 3 or 4 day growth before a real shave with a blade. After a couple years of use it must be getting dull since I can barely tell I have shaved after I use it now.</li>
            <li> It sort of works in a pinch.  It doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave on me, I have a very tough beard though.  It might work on a softer beard.</li>
            <li> For once, my husband read the instructions and obediently stick with it for 3 weeks of continual use. After 2 weeks, he already felt his skin is getting used to the electric razor (he was using blades before) and now after 3 weeks, he is a happy camper! He also commented on how long the battery lasts which is a big plus but of course it&#x27;s still a new machine/battery, so we won&#x27;t know if the performance of the battery will deteriorate over time. Well, we will find out as it is a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (01/10/2014) - Husband wants me to stress that there are 2 things he did that he thought will be useful to share - 1) since he switched from using a razor blade, he said at first your skin will burn and feel uncomfortable after the shave, but don&#x27;t give up, after 2-3 weeks, your skin will get use to it. At least his did. 2) he said he learned not to push the machine against his skin so hard when shaving and that helped too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also worth noting is the battery life remains long lasting. Only charged twice since new and husband has been using it daily.</li>
            <li> After using this AT830 for the first time I must say it works great - a clean, comfortable shave . I used it on my face and head (I&#x27;m bald), and it&#x27;s perfect for both . It took me half the time when compared to using my Gillette fusion proglide, and also much safer. Nice product,  and it took no time for my face to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband for Christmas, &amp; much to my surprise~without any prompting he said to me, &amp;#34;I really like that razor. It cuts good &amp; the contour of it fits my hand great.&amp;#34; &amp;#34;It&#x27;s quiet, too!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;He is normally a man of few words, so I&#x27;d say that this razor is the best! He has always had Norelco&#x27;s &amp; they don&#x27;t wear out very often, so this one replaces a very old one, but it&#x27;s the same style &amp; brand. He had a Braun in between these two Norelco&#x27;s, but was very clear about it not being as good as old his old Norelco. So &amp;#34;we&amp;#34; highly recommend this particular razor.</li>
            <li> Use it every morning as a reservist in Afghanistan. So much easier to dry shave with this then it is to keep it old school with razor and cream. #overrated</li>
            <li> Husband really likes thr razor so it must be good. He has only used the new one since receiving it,  the old one is gone</li>
            <li> I was excited to go back to shaving with an electric (after owning a great remington - years ago) You literally have to push the shaver against your face with the force of a plunger and it will still miss hairs. My face is red after I shave - when you try it with cream it doesn&#x27;t even get 50% of your hairs... Will probably never buy another Norelco shaver.</li>
            <li> Surprised it worked so well.  I have to shave my husband who has dementia and he complained about the old Phillips we had.  I then tried using a safety razor, but this Norelco works out so much better than either of the 2 options.</li>
            <li> I have used electric razors for years and have tried many different brands. This razor is by far the best I have ever tried. It produces a very close shave with no irritation. The floating head adheres to the contours of your face. Another advantage is that it can be cleaned easily just by holding it under the faucet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but doesn&#x27;t get as close of a shave as I would like. I got a closer shave from the $30 Remington shaver I bought from Walmart in college</li>
            <li> This razor does not provide a good shave..I am sorry I purchased it.  I&#x27;ve used Norelco electric razors for many of my 80 years and this model is the worst, notwithstanding its &amp;#34;Powertouch&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Aquatec&amp;#34; features.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. I like how it has the touch up trimmer on the back. I would highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> This has been so far a pretty good razor. It is my first electric so I was skeptical but it holds a charge well, is water-proof so great in the shower. It can get a little patchy at times but that is my only complaint. Also I have found the flip blade works well for body hair as well.</li>
            <li> good razor. had this a year now no probs yet. holds a charge good.</li>
            <li> I got it for a friend and he loves it. Good purchase and I recommend to anyone from any part of the world.</li>
            <li> Cannot use when plugged in to charge. Other than that, just fine.</li>
            <li> Great shaver that provides a close shave every time.</li>
            <li> mediocre quality, not upto expectation.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my husband for Christmas. I  had read the reviews on the least expensive razor by other owners and they had all stated that they would all purchase the more expensive up graded razor. Therefore I spent more and bought this one. He loves it and would not change it. He had previously owned a lower model Norelco and liked it but had to keep buying batteries for it. This one has many new improvements. LOVES IT !!! Shaves very close.</li>
            <li> Great product, my husband does like it very mcuh. I would recmmend it to anyone who would like to have an electric razor. It&#x27;s great and aforable</li>
            <li> Shaves real smooth without the feel of pulling.  I like the rinse and wet cleaning that keeps the blades clean for a better shave.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like is it will not shave plugged in.  Other than that, I am happy with the AT830.</li>
            <li> I have been a used or Norelco shavers for decades.  First it was the Remington as a teenager, then the Norelco with two cutters rather than three, through many other  models for years.  Probably the best of the bunch was Model 6891XL about 15 years ago.  The worst once in recent years is the 8171 model with three circular cutters rather than one per blade unit.  I presume the most expensive model on the market today is like the 8171 which pulls and irritates.  Now I own model AT830 since Christmas. In my opinion this is the second best razor ever made by Norelco. It shaves fast, very close, and works quite well. The charge has held for two an a half weeks and is still going strong.  Note I have not used this product wet or with gels or creme or in the shower.  Only dry,  The only down side is that Phillips has been cheap with the gadgetry. It has a couple of LED type light for charging, etc.  Missing is how much charge is left, a indicator that the shaver needs cleaning an all the other goodies that Model  6891 had.  Nevertheless this one is a solid buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving daily for almost a month now and it&#x27;s still on it&#x27;s first charge.  How long do these lithium batteries go?  Shaving is a pleasure now.  The razor is very quiet and shaves quickly and close.  I also have a deep chin dimple that most razors don&#x27;t handle, but this one does great.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I thought it was a very comfortable shave, and would have given it an excellent rating if the cutters were just a little more effective.  But overall, I do consider it a shaver that anyone who wants a very comfortable shave at a very reasonable price, this is the shaver for you.  And I do prefer a rotary blade electric shaver more than all the other electric shavers due to their overall comfort for shaving and the total ease of cleaning by just putting the open shaver under hot water after each shave.  Now that is electric shaving bliss as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> Very Nice razor so far.  This razor will get the hairs that my other electric razor would not get.  Shaves pretty close.</li>
            <li> I have my own model of this in Europe , so a Phillips product and I bought this for my son in San Diego, so a Norelco product. If his is as good as mine, it is a good shver. Only issue is the charging base which is too light to use easily. My previous razor I had for 15 years and was also a Norelco, but had a better base.</li>
            <li> This shaver works very well and you can bring it in the shower with you.  I have very thick hair so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for getting through a beard or more than 3 days of not shaving but for day to day use it gives a nice shave.  I don&#x27;t get the bumps/razor burn or ingrown hairs that I do from a triple blade razor.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery charge last a lot of time!&lt;br /&gt;Can use it with or without foam, with good results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor to replace one that uses a special shaving lotion by Nivea that can only be bought on-line because the razor is no longer being made.  It also takes eight hours for a 30 minute charge.  This new razor takes just one hour for a 50 minute charge.  It also features a pop-up trimmer and can be used for shaving with shaving cream.  It gives a nice close shave with minimum effort.</li>
            <li> Use this every day and it works great&lt;br /&gt;ease instructions out of the box&lt;br /&gt;has the side trimmer which works well&lt;br /&gt;charges quickly</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband at Christmastime. He likes it and uses it more than he ever used his previous electric razor.</li>
            <li> I give this razor to my grandson on his birthday. He was very happy. It&#x27;s helpful gift for you. It&#x27;s working good. Tank you.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my husband and he loves it.  I like the closeness of the shave myself too!!!  It is easy to keep clean and store.</li>
            <li> I have bought other Norelco shavers before and have had outstanding results with them.&lt;br /&gt;When I recived this one it lived up to it&#x27;s name for about a month then I noticed that the shave&lt;br /&gt;quality droped off very fast. Then that is when I took a close look at the shaver and noticed that&lt;br /&gt;it was made in China...... Yes Norelco has sold us out to China......... The cutting blades in it is&lt;br /&gt;inferior to their products in the past. Now I must go over and over my face five to six times to get&lt;br /&gt;somewhat of a shave. However it is on the same par as the junk that Braun shavers offer as well.&lt;br /&gt;Montey Davis</li>
            <li> Now I remember why I never owned a rotary/Norelco shaver before.  Even after pre-soak and gel lather and after shave my neck is still red, raw and stingling hours later.  Going back to foil and try for a refund on this one, or it&#x27;s going on EBAY.</li>
            <li> Excellent and nice price.&lt;br /&gt;Is working perfect for me and goood  job.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recomend this product for your. tks</li>
            <li> This is the fourth Norelco shaver I&#x27;ve owned in my fifty years of shaving.  I&#x27;ve loved every one and none has ever &amp;#34;quit on me--&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve simply replaced each one when it was ten years old and I wanted something newer.  I guess that says it all.  I&#x27;m totally satisfied with the new shaver.</li>
            <li> I have tried others, and they do not compare to the Philips Norelco AT830.  I think it is the best razor on the market, and very nice&lt;br /&gt;to my skin, lots of power and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;  Wayne C</li>
            <li> Was a present for my father. He likes it.</li>
            <li> My brother really like it a lot, less time in the restroom and I&#x27;m  very happy about that. Plus it make him look very nice and handsome.</li>
            <li> good shave- good price-</li>
            <li> doesnt shave as close as i like but OK</li>
            <li> Okay, but will upgrade later to a better model.</li>
            <li> quiet, close shave, comfortable in hand and on face</li>
            <li> Purchased for my dad for Fathers Day, ease of use, lasting battery life before needs recharged and most important good shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor based on the reviews and I&#x27;ve owned Norelco before.  The pro&#x27;s -- style and weight.  The con&#x27;s - fully charged shave time is about 30 minutes - you cannot use it plugged in (only on battery) - poor cutting ability, you must repeat &amp; repeat. I&#x27;ve tried it dry, with shave cream and with shave gel - the results were all poor.  I would not recommend this product to anyone - in fact I hope it is recyclable or if I could find the receipt it would be returned.  Looks like I must return to blades.</li>
            <li> I know there are extensive reviews on this so if you even need to read this review I will tell you this: I purchased for my husband 17 months ago, it still works,&amp;  he said he&#x27;s got nothing to complain about. There are so many electric razors out now, I know it&#x27;s a tough decision- I&#x27;d say this one is dependable enough to give it a go!</li>
            <li> Shaves as well as my previous Norelco!</li>
            <li> Long extended period of time for recharging. Very good feature for me.&lt;br /&gt; Negative...Unable to shave when electric cable is plugged into electric outlet.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> NO electric is going to rival a close blade-shave, but this unit still provides a nice soft face nonetheless. The articulating heads do not handle the jawline below the ear as well as I had hoped, but other than that, this unit provides a nice, smooth shave at a very reasonable price. Clean-up is a cinch, and this unit has the added bonus of being able to be used in the shower for those days where the alarm just wasn&#x27;t enough to get the day started.</li>
            <li> So far this shaver isn&#x27;t living up to the adverts.  The trimmer is particularly unsatisfactory!</li>
            <li> I purchased this particular razor because it was supposed to be extra good at getting whiskers on my throat.  At least that is what the product info said.  I will say it does give me an excellent shave, but it takes twice as long as my previous razor to get it.  Not impressed.  I will say it is much quieter than any previous razor I have owned and that is nice.  I have had it a few weeks now and am still on my original battey charge.</li>
            <li> It takes 5 times as long as my old norelco to disassemble, clean and put back together.  I&#x27;ll go back to my old plug in model.  Stupid engineering by norelco.  Notice how each series of norelco shavers require a slightly different set of blades.  No convenience in this except for more profits for norelco top execs.  Bah on the whole company. Gary</li>
            <li> Great Product as I have used straight razor blades all my life but I got an infection on my face from one this time. I always clean and change my blades every week so I don&#x27;t know how this happened. I decided to get this because it is wet and dry capable, also can be used in the shower. it gives a close shave with minimal effort and my face has no irritation. I mix my shaving lotion with hibiclens to make sure no more infections on my face for an clean shave.</li>
            <li> The purchase of this Razor was the Best!  I Love it!&lt;br /&gt;  It is very quite, and Blades are Sharp, gives a very Smooth Shave.&lt;br /&gt;  It is very easy to clean. I get several Shaves, between charges.&lt;br /&gt;  This is By Far, the best Electric Razor I have ever Owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Tom Brice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying this shaver. It feels like you&#x27;ve shaved with a razor after you&#x27;re finished shaving. Super easy to clean since it&#x27;s water friendly. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> ..not this time! Best all around shave ever! It is now almost two months and I&#x27;m sold. The aquatic feature allows effective.. cleaning after each shave under a faucet (warm water). Easy grip, air dry, cool feel to the face, 2 1/2 yr. warranty for registering on line, easy recharge, etc.  Not perfect but very near. I don&#x27;t get much use from the awkward to hold  trimmer or close shave under the nose, but an inexpensive trimmer can supplement this otherwise pleasant process.</li>
            <li> Good clean shave that last all day. This is my fourth norelco shaver in past 10 years and it is the best so far</li>
            <li> This is the third electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. The first two I bought were crappy $15-20 razors I got in the bargain bin at Walmart/Kmart. My old one died after many years of service so I thought I&#x27;d go out get something a little nicer this time around. Not only does this razor not hold a candle to those cheapo ones I&#x27;ve had in the past but it barely works at all. I get serious skin irritation, even some blood, and it leaves hairs all over. I always have to get out the Mach3 and finish it up because this thing can&#x27;t get it all, not even close. I&#x27;m so disappointed in Norelco. It&#x27;s unbelievable they would but something so useless on the market.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how ancient my old Norelco electric shaver had become (it&#x27;s probably 20 years old) until I purchased the Norelco AT830 w/Aquatec Electric Razor. It works great. I get a closer, smoother shave. I like that I can clean it out by rinsing it under tap water or with the brush provided in the kit. It fully charges in 1 hour and the charge lasts about a month. Plus, it&#x27;s super quiet. I haven&#x27;t tried the wet-shave capability of the razor but, it has that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listening to and reading all the advertising out there, I thought I&#x27;d have to spend more but, this razor does all I need it to. I&#x27;d recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband, he charged it for 2 days before using it and it was weak.  We had to return it.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with the performance of two higher priced Norelco models with the very narrow neck.  When all else fails, I went back to this updating of their earlier models.  This one removes hairs in places that the narrow neck models could not get to, like right under the nose.  By making sure that only gentle pressure is applied, even shaving the anterior ramus of the mandible [Chin] becomes easy.  And it has a very efficient built in trimmer for those rare occasions when you just can&#x27;t get rid of a hair.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for dad seeing that the one prior is older than I am. He loved it and I think its much easier to clean &amp; maintain.&lt;br /&gt;The battery replacement is a pain *** . It was cheaper to just buy a new one. Still have the old one as a backup in case.</li>
            <li> Works great. Quick to charge and a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t shave close enough</li>
            <li> It works great. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It was delivered just as was promised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several of the Norelco razors over the years.  Always pleased with how well they work.&lt;br /&gt;I tried a Panasonic foil electric and like the Norelco better.  I shave my head and find the three individual rotary cutters conform to the curve of my head better than the flat foil shavers.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Purchased for my father and he has a little trouble with turning it on.&lt;br /&gt;Gives a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> I am not getting as close a shave as I expected.  I plan to return under the 45-day satisfaction guaranteed or return policy.</li>
            <li> Shaves well.  Not a &amp;#34;grooming&amp;#34; shaver. You will get cut.. speaking from experience. ouch.</li>
            <li> Works okay, but it does irritate my face. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Best shave ever.  Replaced a Braun which never gave a good shave.</li>
            <li> very good razor, you can use it to shave both dry and wet (gel foam), it is really nice and quite but have some problems in trimming the neck area but over all it is very impressive razor</li>
            <li> a wonderful value and it works great.  i have had this rzor before and continue to &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; it. i will buy the sae rzor next time.</li>
            <li> I use it to shave my head.  It cuts clean and very close.  The best electric razor I have used.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend, and he loves it.  Direct quote: &amp;#34;It pivots!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Running well after two years daily use. Comfortable close shave. The battery carries many days of charge. I only wish that it would run while charging. Plugging in the charging cord prevents operation. I presume this is to prevent shock in wet areas, such as bathrooms.</li>
            <li> Close shave. Quiet and fast. Read up on shavers before I got this for my husband. Pop up trimmer does an even and easy job. He loves it</li>
            <li> Nice razor. Works well. No travel pouch included as with previous Norelco I&#x27;ve ever used. For price of razor, why not include at least a cheap pouch to pack for travel?</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor because it includes a flip up trimmer on the side.  Unfortunately, the trimmer does a very poor job.  The 3 heads however do a great job.  Based on those 2 factors, I only rate this shaver 3 stars at best.  For the price I paid for it, you&#x27;d expect the trimmer to be top notch.  If you&#x27;re considering this razor for the trimmer, I would suggest buying something else.</li>
            <li> I have used plenty of electric shaves and this has got to be one of the worst I have ever used. After 10 minutes of grinding the top layer of skin off, I stopped and used a normal razor to finish off all the spots this razor would not shave. I don&#x27;t have overly thick facial hair and I shaved with a razor two days prior. This product is complete garbage, save yourself and find something else.</li>
            <li> Product does the job it is supposed to do.Gives a clean shave. Easy to use easy to clean. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Norelco opted for slower motor speeds in its current shaver and it does not give as good or as quick a shave. Maybe they are trying prolong battery life but I&#x27;d rather have the faster speeds.  Also, no longer allowing you to shave when it is plugged in so always have to run on batteries.  If the batteries are dead you cannot run the shaver.  Won&#x27;t buy another.</li>
            <li> I used an electric razor 45 years ago once and I have used a razor for 45 years sine. Bought this Norelco AT830 and I will never go back to a razor blade.</li>
            <li> I really like that I am able to use either wet or dry.  I originally bought this because I was placed on blood-thinners for a 6-month period of time and the nurses told me to get an electric razor and stop using the blades. The manufacturer tells you to give them 21 days and you won&#x27;t know the difference between their product and a razor blade.  This is true with a single-blade razor, but I was using a multi-blade razor - and although I am satisfied, after 21 days I have learned it will never replace my multi-blade razor for closeness of shave.  Nevertheless, the convenience for on-the-go shaves and when you don&#x27;t want to hassle with your normal shaving - it&#x27;s perfect - don&#x27;t get me wrong, you can use this in place of your razor, but you have to be happy with it&#x27;s performance.  If you have a real heavy beard you will most likely have a heavier 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> for a five day beard requires a lot of shaving on the neck.otherwise the waterproofing is great for cleaning and using shave gell..Larger print would help us older guys</li>
            <li> I saw the review of this razor and decided to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It broke after 2 usages. Very disappointed. Going to return it.</li>
            <li> This electric razor does a pretty good job. It took 2-3 weeks for my face to get adjusted an during that time my neck would be rough afterwards. It wouldn&#x27;t last long but it was somewhat annoying. Now my face is adjusted it and it works great. I have pretty sensitive skin so your neck may respond differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge of this thing seems to last for several weeks. I only charge it for 15-20 minute and it seems to last a couple weeks. It hasn&#x27;t ran out of batteries on me yet but I charge it every so often to avoid that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product.</li>
            <li> It does work in the water. I use it for a quick touch up. My preference is a regular safety razor so I don&#x27;t use this daily. It does take some time to get use to an electric razor but over all I would say it is okay.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco Razors for 20 to 30m years. This is absolutely the best yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband.  He told me today that he loves this shaver.  Out of the three prior Norelco shavers he has owned, this is the best.</li>
            <li> Finally a razor I can fall in love with!! I shave face and head Iareally is the best and closest shave ever!! I threw away my Fusion razor and my foil electric razor. I have shaved 3 ways 1. dry 2. with pre shave lotion 3. with shaving cream. Dry was not as close of a shave, pre shave lotion and shaving cream , about the same, shaving cream a bit closer. I prefer shaving cream for the fresh clean feeling after shaving. I am 60 and been shaving since I was 14 and this is the best shaver yet!! 1 hour full recharge, about 3-5 minutes for enouigh charge to do a quick shave...Ilove this baby!! Now quit reading reviews and BUY IT!!</li>
            <li> Nice close shave I have heavy beard tried Panasonic not happy went back to norelco</li>
            <li> Good but not great razor.</li>
            <li> A birthday  gift for my husband.  He loves it!</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Miss the LED charge lights on my previous Norelco, but this one was cheaper to purchase.  Cuts great.</li>
            <li> REPLACED MY 10 YEAR OLD NORELCO - I AM BACK TO A REALLY SMOOTH SHAVE, NO PULL OR ABRASIVENESS.&lt;br /&gt;HAVE NOT USED IT WITH GEL YET - FOUND NO NEED</li>
            <li> My son says that the razor is so much better than the one he had.  I would recommend it to anyone who has a tough beard.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a replacement for an older shaver from the same OEM that the battery had given out on after MANY years of service. When I received this one, I was quite surprised with the ergonomic improvements and the reduced noise level that it operated at. I was at first a little perturbed that they did not send a charging stand for it, but rather only a charging cord. However...I soon learned why this was the case. The thing seems to runs forever between charges! I think I have had to charge mine only three times in several weeks...and one of those was on impulse/out of habit. :-)</li>
            <li> I want to like this razor.. I really do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the ergonomics, the looks, and the fact that it&#x27;s very quiet, but other than that, it sucks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that I had to make SEVERAL passes in order to get every single hair, and to make matters worse, the pop-out trimmer had to be held at just the right angle in order to get short hairs. It was a pain to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, but I got a rash EVERY SINGLE TIME I used this razor. I used it consistently for a good three weeks, and it never changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many things about this razor that I like, but they are mostly things that do with cosmetics -- not functionality. Functionally speaking, I can&#x27;t say a single good thing about this razor. I will probably never buy (or ask for) a rotary-style electric razor again, and will stick with my Remington F4790 for as long as possible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(note - the Remington F4790 is the best electric razor I have ever used)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas to replace the crummy &amp;#34;el-cheapo&amp;#34; shaver he was using and he loves it. He travels a lot for work, so it is also easy to charge up and take with him on the go. The fact that it can be used both wet or dry was a huge selling point, and is probably his favorite thing about it. Cleaning it is also very easy.</li>
            <li> Looks like a good and useful tool. Familiar with this brand.just registered it. Quietness striking. Have not done wet shaving,but I think it will do just fine.</li>
            <li> I hesitated for the longest time to switch from a regular razor to electric. I did some research and I knew that I wanted one that I could use in the shower and with a shave gel. This razor is awesome. I had to use it for two weeks before my face adjusted to the electric. (I only shave twice a week.) I have had it for a couple of months now and the shave is great. I use the Nivea shave gel that I used withe my regular razor and I don&#x27;t get the razor burn or the nicks or cuts on my face and neck. I had a buddy tell me that electric razors do not give as close of shave, but my wife would disagree. She loves my smooth skin after a shave. I would definetly suggest this razor and definetly will buy it again.</li>
            <li> The Powertouch Electric Razor has proven to be an effective tool at daily shaving. Charging is only necessary every few weeks with three to four minutes of daily use. The product has a soft rubber grip, which is easy to hold. It is waterproof, allowing easy shaving in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closeness that the three flexible heads can give your shave is impressive. The only way to get a closer shave is with a multiple bladed razor, hot shaving cream and hot water. This saves both time and money. In the last six months of use, there have been no cuts, unlike my older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, there is no longer an option to insert Nivea shaving gel packets, but the added clippers for trimming more than make up for its loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product more than meets is description and expectations.</li>
            <li> is very Soft, the battery has long duration, fast rechargeable and washable, that was exactly that I looking for me</li>
            <li> Although this electric razor is very good for the face area, I broke out with a really bad skin irritation/rash ALL over my neck.  I returned the item.  I&#x27;ll stick with my Wahl moustache trimmer....I&#x27;ve had one of those for years, and the Wahl seems to do a very adequate job without irritation.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new and see if Norelco had caught up or maybe surpassed Panasonic electric razors. A lot of solid reviews so I gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer is no......this razor is horrible. I have used electric razors the past 20 years. It cut very poor, it was difficult to get a close shave on the neck, it was difficult to do detail work and it irritated my neck like I rubbed sandpaper on it. I gave it two weeks and returned it for a panasonic electric razor. Don&#x27;t waste your time with this or any rotary razor.</li>
            <li> My husband takes blood thinners which make it impossible to use a regular razor.  It was great to find an electric one that shaves him comfortably and closely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doing the Job, although I use it only on dry environment, too scared to try it while having a shower or running water. my only concern about it is. the rechargeable battery fitted, does&#x27;t lost as per the spec. need to be recharged much often.</li>
            <li> Love the wet/dry. I use shaving brush soap chips that can not be used for bathing any longer. I love the wet shave for comfort and closeness. Dry is not  too shabby either</li>
            <li> I had great hopes for this older style Norelco shaver but they were&#x27;t realized.  I found it to be a weak shaver that didn&#x27;t shave as close as my older Panasonic razor.  As a result, I am exercising Norelco&#x27;s 45 day guarantee of satisfaction and am returning it.  I will invest in new blades for my Panasonic and know that I am getting a better shave than Norelco can offer.  Additionally, the trimmer on the Norelco was so-so and the protective plastic cover for the blades was worthless as it wouldn&#x27;t clip on securely.  On the positive side, the battery lasts longer than my Panasonic&#x27;s.  I will live with having to plug the Panasonic in more often!</li>
            <li> This is my third Norelco in the last 35 years and definitely the best of them all.  Handles long whiskers quite well without pulling.  I used to break out the straight razor if I skipped a few days shaving because the electric one could not hack it.  Not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts a long time, the trimmer does its job well, the shaver gives a close shave.  Being able to wash out the head area is a nice feature, too.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Philips Norelco I&#x27;ve purchased over the years. I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other kind. The improvements I found in my latest purchase: (1) Improvement in shape and fits the hand comfortably. (2) Easier to remove head for cleaning, and replacing on grip. I feel like there is an improvement in the movement of the head as it glides over my jaw-line and down on to my neck. I have always liked the way the head can be washed and cleaned. Summary: This is a great electric razor.</li>
            <li> My father in law loves this shaver; he can use it dry or in the shower and it has a trimmer attached too.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it wet yet.</li>
            <li> bought the170 norelco and this one. this one gives a better shave than the more costly one kept this , sent other back save some money buy this one. didn&#x27;t get hardly any neck burn from this one compared to the other</li>
            <li> We love it. Much nicer than older model. Charging base was not in the order but a phone call and the base appeared just a couple of days later. Thanks</li>
            <li> Works well but no better than the last one I had. Wish it would work while plugged in.</li>
            <li> I have always had Norelco razors and in that tradition I like this one as well. Older razor was getting loud and the blades and trimmer were getting very dull.  At the price of this razor it was worth getting rid of the old one and getting a replacement.  Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality razor.  It is very user-friendly as far as it&#x27;s operation, cleaning, understanding how to use it, etc.  As with all Phillips electronics I have purchased, I am not disappointed.  That said, the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I bought this razor to shave my head with, and it performs that task adequately.  However, it leaves just enough of a stubble that it is difficult to pull a shirt over my head.  Also, if you use this razor on soft areas (like your neck) it WILL razorburn you if you put the slightest pressure against your skin.  I thought this would go away after a couple of weeks like the manual said (it takes several weeks for your skin to acclimate to a new razor), however, it has been more than 3 weeks and every time I use this razor on my neck, I look like I caught some sort of infectious disease because my skin gets inflamed and puffy in columnar streaks.  So I use this for my head only now and use a standard Gillette razor for my face and neck.  I do not want to put you off about this razor; it really is a good razor.  Just keep in mind that your skin might need quite a bit more time to adjust than you may be willing to give, so don&#x27;t use this thing for the first time right before an important event (like a job interview, wedding, etc.) because you will show up with red streaks all over your neck.</li>
            <li> The doctor ordered my husband to stop using any type of razor blades due to a medical condition. Since he does not want to grow a moustache/beard, he needed another option.  I ordered this electric razor based on reviews here and he is VERY HAPPY with it.  I guess electric razors have come a long way since he last used one. His experience was that they either pulled on the hair in a painful way or just did not cut them short enough.  Not so with this razor, he says.  He has a nice close shave and doesn&#x27;t have to put his health at risk to do that.</li>
            <li> If your goal is to remove hair...don&#x27;t buy this product!  The only thing that works well is the flip up trimmer.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my father. He was very pleased and felt it was easy to use, even with his significant tremor. Very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The rotaries may be slower than other electric shavers, but it shaves closer and faster than the Braun and Panasonic shavers I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> I hate it.  It quit working for no reason.  It takes 10-15 minutes to get a good shave.  Its weak and a toy.</li>
            <li> Razor works fine but trimmer isn&#x27;t worth a flip (pun intended.)  My previous Phillips Norelco razor, if the blades got dull, you had&lt;br /&gt;to remove and replace the entire razor head.  If the battery went dead, you had to replace the handle assembly. I&#x27;m uncertain what my new razor will require.</li>
            <li> I do like this razor.  I have had a Norelco for the previous ten years and I figured I would splurge and purchase a new one for fathers day.  Shaves are closer than my old one and love that you charge it and forget about it for multiple weeks.  I have only charged mine 3 times since getting it for fathers day.  Thought I wanted one with a charging stand, but I have to charge this so infrequently, that I like that the charger is not on my counter all the time.  I can store the charger in the cabinet and forget about it for weeks.</li>
            <li> does excelent job of shaving my face ,much better than blade type so far great product would recomend tis razor to anybody</li>
            <li> Razor seems to hold a good charge unless you are someone like me that has a thick beard.  Takes me longer to shave so I use more power.  Also the razor doesn&#x27;t shave very close.  Also do to my thick beard I think.  I have always used Remington razors prior to this one and they always gave me a close shave.  When this one dies on me I will be going back to a Remington razor because my thick beard wants a closer faster shave.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a hint to shave more!  No excuses now!  He said he was very happy with the razor and uses it regularly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to replace the one he had that died. He is very happy with it and said it works much better than any he has ever had before.</li>
            <li> Works very well.Only used dry so far,but good shave.</li>
            <li> Amazing cut. I have had other norelcos before even the more expensive ones like the 3ds etc. This is by far the easiest and best shaver.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job well, no complaint, worth the money, especially if it last as long as my last one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the battery life with this razor.  I can go a month between charges with even shaving twice on some days.</li>
            <li> Decent shaver, only downside that doesn&#x27;t make sense is that you can&#x27;t shave while the charger is plugged in. Works well enough for face hair as well as legs, chest, etc.</li>
            <li> I have had Norelco shavers for years now,  and this one is great.</li>
            <li> There are pros and cons to each of the Philips Norelco razors I&#x27;ve gotten through the VINE program. This model&#x27;s big innovation is a nice snap-out trimmer. It has a comfortable ergonomic fit/feel in the hand, shaves closely, and has a neat charging option-- it can charge in about a minute for one shave, although the full charger takes about 5 hours and lasts for about 50 minutes of use.  Overall a very nice option for men with beards/mustaches.  Those who don&#x27;t need the trimmer function might be happier with the 1290, which has a pretty amazing ability to follow the contours of the face and is very, very quiet.</li>
            <li> I got this razor from the Vine Program and my review is based on comments from me and my husband who is the one using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco AT830 Power Touch electric razor arrived well packed with razor, charging cord, head cover, cleaning brush and instruction manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this to be a somewhat better than average mid-range shaver, good, but not on a par with the 1290 I recently reviewed and which my husband loves. The rotating heads are less flexible than the 1290 and it lacks a stand or a case for carrying. Also, the dry shave is slightly less close than the wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does has only a \\&quot;battery charging\\&quot; and low battery indicator, not a gauge for how much charge is there. A full charge takes one hour to fully charge and the charge lasts 50 minutes. You can do a quick charge for three or so minutes that is adequate for a quick shave. Note: if you use the fold-out hair trimmer, the charge will not last a full fifty minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it is listed as a wet and dry shaver, do not immerse it in water-use running water only over the heads and the brush to clean it. It comes with a two-year warranty and a recommendation to replace the heads after one year of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the shaver is comfortable on the skin and in the hand and is a nice addition to Philips Norelco&#x27;s line of superior shavers, just not, in my opinion, equal to the 1290.</li>
            <li> The [[ASIN:B006GQYSGE Philips Norelco AT830 PowerTouch Rechargeable Cordless Razor, Gray/Silver/Black]] is an acceptable value in a cordless razor.  It does not perform much better or much worse than other rechargeable razors I have used.  It provides a slightly better ergonomics than most.  It is simply not as good of a value as either the [[ASIN:B003V360NY Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue]] or the [[ASIN:B006GQYSC8 Philips Norelco AT810 PowerTouch Rechargeable Cordless Razor, Blue/Silver/Black]].  Depending on the features you need and your budget, I would recommend either of those models over this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;++ Good performance for an electric shaver&lt;br /&gt;++ Best for daily shaving of short to medium thickness facial hair&lt;br /&gt;++ More substantial to hold than the SensoTouch series&lt;br /&gt;++ Smooth operation&lt;br /&gt;++ While the heads don&#x27;t rotate in all directions, they have enough inward flex to adjust to your face&lt;br /&gt;++ Can be used for wet or dry shaving, with or without shaving cream or gel&lt;br /&gt;++ Water resistant body allows for easy shower use&lt;br /&gt;++ The shaving heads can be cleaned under water and / or with PN cleaning solution&lt;br /&gt;++ Longer battery life than many SensoTouch models&lt;br /&gt;++ Charging is easy, via a simple AC adapter cord&lt;br /&gt;++ Includes a cover and cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;++ Manual covers usage, maintenance and parts replacement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-- Leaves longer hairs behind when shaving (all the PNs do this)&lt;br /&gt;-- Alternatives like the 1150 offer more value with more features&lt;br /&gt;-- The pop-up trimmer is adequate (similar to the 1250), but the 1150&#x27;s attachment trimmer works better&lt;br /&gt;-- No included travel case (the 1150 does include one)&lt;br /&gt;-- Less flashy and sleek than the SensoTouch models (for those who care about that)&lt;br /&gt;-- Recommended annual blade replacements add significant cost ([[ASIN:B000068PBT Philips Norelco HQ8 Spectra Tripleheader Replacement Heads]])&lt;br /&gt;-- No indicator for blade replacement or cleaning&lt;br /&gt;-- No battery life indicator, as with the SensoTouch models&lt;br /&gt;-- Quick charging is not as quick as other models&lt;br /&gt;-- The battery is not user-replaceable and will limit the unit&#x27;s life&lt;br /&gt;-- Does not include the jet cleaning system&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE ALTERNATIVES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The [[ASIN:B003V360NY Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue]] provides the benefits of a SensoTouch model at a value similar to PowerTouch AT830.  The 1150 operates faster and quieter than the AT830, with a better trimmer than either the AT830 or the higher end [[ASIN:B003V37Z9W Philips Norelco 1250xcc/42 SensoTouch 3d Electric Shaver with Jet Clean System, Black]].  And it&#x27;s great for use during travel.  For those reasons, I think it&#x27;s the best compromise among the various PN razors in this range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who want the Jet Clean system should try the 1250cc, as long as they are willing to pay the premium and don&#x27;t mind the hassle and expense of the cleaning fluid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PowerTouch AT810 offers a good shave at a better value.  The rotary heads don&#x27;t have smart pivot, but they still flex enough to contour to your face.  I actually like the feel of stationary heads, but I have found I have to make multiple passes to get a good shave with all these razors.  It does result in skin irritation at first.  The discomfort subsides with longer term use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of these capture longer hairs well.  That was a complaint I had with several other rechargeable razors.  But if you are a daily shaver, this works well once your skin gets used to it.  I personally prefer a foil shaver like the one on the [[ASIN:B004UKSKCQ Braun Cruzer 5 Face Cruzer, 5 Face Shaver]] or the [[ASIN:B004WIUNCQ Braun Cruzer 6 Face Cruzer, 6 Face Shaver]], but those require even more passes for a complete shave and they can cut the skin more than this rotary shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For most users, models like the AT810 will satisfy them.  If you don&#x27;t think you need the detail trimmer of the 1150, give the PowerTouch units a try first.  This unit performs well enough to be an acceptable value.  I would still recommend the 1150 over this model.  For a reasonable price, you can have most of the benefits of both the SensoTouch and PowerTouch lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.810 will satisfy them.

            <li> I have a higher end Philips Norelco and love it to pieces...have been using it for a year plus and have 0 complaints.  I spent quite a bit on that one and wanted one similar to travel with.  This model fit the bill...its perfect for a quick shave and I use it for all of my trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said - this is great for someone that is starting out with electric razors.  For those that have been using one for a while, this unit will not provide the close shave that you are used to.  It is good for a shave after one days growth and for touch-ups...but not for heavy growth or after a weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I feel it could be priced a little better - but knowing the quality that goes into Philips Norelco products I am not shocked that it is priced as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, EXCELLENT quality.  Go with this if you are starting out and want a dependable product which will last you for a long time to come.  Replacement parts are also easily accessible.</li>
            <li> Husband said the razor doesn&#x27;t work as well as his old one that EXPIRED....But is ok for day to day use.</li>
            <li> not as close as the manual razor but good for travel</li>
            <li> Debated whether to spend the extra to get the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; shaver.  Not even a question now.  YES!  YES!  YES!  Left 30 years of foil shaving and won&#x27;t look back.  I did find that both the foam and gels I tried broke my face out.  I tried foaming hand soap in a pump container and it works fine without any skin reaction.  Some reviewers say it takes a couple of weeks to get used to.  I thought that was crazy but they&#x27;re right.  Either your face or your technique begins to adapt and it gets better after a couple of weeks.  For how long you will use it, spend a little extra and don&#x27;t go dry.</li>
            <li> I like the way it handles, the way it shaves, and that it is waterproof.</li>
            <li> Much better than my old razor. Very comfortable close shave. I&#x27;d recommend this razor to anyone. I use it with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, works great</li>
            <li> Not the closest shave.  Won&#x27;t save you much time shaving.  Will save you money if you are looking to get off razors.    *EDIT.  Had to knock this down from 3 stars to 2.  After a short while I found myself cleaning up after this shaver with a razor.  My face was all patchy and rough after using this.  Will be returning.  It&#x27;s like I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow after shaving.</li>
            <li> I had the Nivea HS420 for  a very long time.  It wore out after 10 years.  This 830 is a blessing.  No burn and very good shave in the shower wet.  I recommend it  with a gel or cream works also.  Buy it</li>
            <li> just what my husband wanted. So nice to see a clean face.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to use and gives a rake shave.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone that has sensitive skin. I even was able to give myself a little line up with the pop out extension.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a great shave and I would have rated it higher if it came with a charging stand.  It&#x27;s also very quiet and for those 2 reasons I decided to keep it.  But I don&#x27;t like the idea of laying it on it&#x27;s side after use.</li>
            <li> My first impression of this shaver was that it didn&#x27;t feel as substantial as my old retired Norelco. And it didn&#x27;t sound like the motor was very powerful because it is so quiet. But I was wrong. My first shave with it was a pleasant surprise. It gave me a very close and comfortable shave. I had been shaving with a Schick Quattro razor since the batteries on my old Norelco died, but the blades were not lasting as long as they used to- I guess that due to the hard water where i now live. I would say that this new shaver works as well as a fresh blade on the Schick razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up date: I grew a beard so I only used this shaver to shave my throat. It would have been three years old in August but it just died. Rest in peace. My old Norelco shavers lasted a lot longer than this one did. Ironically; I just shaved off my beard the day before yesterday. The Norelco wasn&#x27;t having any of that.</li>
            <li> my grandpa loved his gift.</li>
            <li> Works like charm, been using it for over a year, no problems to report. I use it dry and it doesn&#x27;t cause a bunch of irritation like a razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the reviews stated that it gives a perfect shave on sensitive skin.  After a few days of not shaving, it gives a nice close shave leaving a few hairs behind and no irritation.  If I try using this every other day though, my neck actually bruises because I have to press hard against my skin for the shave to be close.  I stopped using this because I often shave every other day.  This product definitely is not for everyone with sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m used to a really close shave with a ProGlide razer and this doesn&#x27;t come remotely close.  Even when it does, I still need to go over my face and neck again with a razer to get the hairs that this missed.</li>
            <li> Reallly was surprised at how easy on face and close shave.  I have essential tremors and sure made shaving a breeze.</li>
            <li> Just received the razor and it works as expected. Also have the AT810 and both seem to work the same.</li>
            <li> This is the third generation we&#x27;ve purchased. My sons liked theirs so much I got one for my husband. He really likes it.</li>
            <li> Cons.... pulls the hairs instead of cutting them [with or without gel/lotion] and burns my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Pros..... lightweight and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I had given up using electric razors.  They didn&#x27;t last and the razor were never quite sharp enough.&lt;br /&gt;So I went back to regular blades.  But I was getting increasingly unsatisfactory shaves even with the&lt;br /&gt;latest multi-blade systems.  I noticed this shaver on sale and the reviews were very positive.  So I ordered&lt;br /&gt;this one.  I have been very pleasantly surprised.  I got close shave right from the start, and it was quick as well.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to clean.  Just flip the head up, and you can simply shake most of the fuzz out.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the lack of a charging stand.  All in all, this is a great shaver.</li>
            <li> My first electric shaver 30 years ago was a Norelco that lasted a long time.  Since then I&#x27;ve used a Braun that also lasted a long time and a Panasonic that I have never really liked.  I&#x27;m sorry that it took so long to switch back to Norelco.</li>
            <li> Light weight, seems to be made cheaply but I guess time will tell how well it holds up.Works well.</li>
            <li> Reasonable shave for price.</li>
            <li> The shaver works perfectly and gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> Broke within a month. Overall the quality of the shave is not that much different than the less expensive versions.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Haven&#x27;t used the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; mode yet but works very well especially on the neck where it is sometimes hard to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Dad as a gift and he really enjoys it.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver. It does everything as well as advertised. My husband is well pleased.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for use by a 90 year-old. He loves the wet/dry feature, and his shaves look good, but he says that it&#x27;s not like a 4-bladed wet razor. (the ones he cut himself with) It&#x27;s rugged and takes a charge quickly, but continues to be a learning situation as his first electric razor.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric shaver I have owned that compares to a razor!When I use it with shaving cream  it feels as close as a blade, but much more comfortable. Quiet, smooth, easy to clean, and fits nice in the hand. Buy it, you\\&quot;ll love it.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing. Works well with wet or dry shave and the charge lasts for about 15 shaves. Charges fully in less than an hour and is easy to clean. Didn&#x27;t come with travel pouch so I called Phillips Norelco and they sent me one at no charge. This razor gives a close shave in half the time of my past Norelco 915x razor. It&#x27;s pivot heads are really as good as the reviews have stated. Will be buying 2 more for shortly.</li>
            <li> Very good on-line buying experience. I have been using Norelco electric shavers for twenty + years without a problem. The AT830/41 is without a doubt a excellent electric shaver and supports my decission to continue to pruchase a Norelco.</li>
            <li> I thought my wife broke my Phillips Norelco 8240XL when it dropped on a tile floor and accidentally threw away a piece of the head, as I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to reassemble it.  I purchased the AT830 as a replacement thinking it was going to be an upgrade.  While both have similar features, this model is louder when shaving, does not feel like it cuts as close, and the trimmer is louder and not as smooth.  This model is also made in CHINA, while my 8240 says it is made in HOLLAND.  Unlike the 8240, if you let the AT830 discharge the battery, you CANNOT shave with it while it is plugged into the wall until the battery charges.  The 8240 will let you shave on a dead battery when it is plugged in.  I was able to get my 8240 back together and will continue to use it.  Im taking the AT830 to work to use as a \\&quot;back-up\\&quot; shaver.</li>
            <li> Context of the review:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this razor for the past month.  As with any new razor you have to utilize it enough for your body to adjust to the new cut.  I came from a three head razor so I felt the adjustment was minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort: This razor utilzes the standard three head design which is traditional of many razors out there.  However, since it is a wet/dry razor, there is more rubber around the front.  I found this to be a nice touch, even in a dry environment.  While I found the shave to be quite close and the razor made quick work of my stubble, I&#x27;m not sure how much of this is due to the fact that the blades were new.  As with any electric razor, you have to replace the blades at some point which will always give you a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quiet: I found this razor much quieter than my previous three head razor (also a philips model) and my wife even noticed a difference.  I get ready in the morning while everyone is asleep and my wife commented on how the previous razor would sometimes wake her in the morning, but this one doesn&#x27;t (brownie points for me!0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wet Dry Feature: I have never been a big fan of a man&#x27;s razor in the shower.  I simply have to have a mirror in front of me to ensure that I get everything.  I did ask (against my better judgement) for my wife to try it out in the shower on her legs (as a one time exception to our no razor sharing rule!).  She was pleasantly surprised that the heads performed flawlessly under the rush of water.  She found it awkward to try and shave in a circular pattern with this razor versus the standard straight pulls of her regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parting thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I felt this razor was a great razor in almost every aspect, I do have a couple of things I wish it had to round it out. I travel a lot and think that a carrying case would have been a nice touch.  I hate putting razors in my toiletry bags as they inevitably open up at some point. Finally, I wish the indicator on the front gave me a battery meter with remaining charge instead of just a flashing light that tells me when the battery is low.</li>
            <li> Is a good product and I&#x27;m sure that I got full value for what I paid.  It can be used wet or dry.  It sometimes seems to work better wet.  It does not shave a close as my old screen razor, especially along the jaw line and on my neck.  Frankly I liked my old razor better but it is several years old and the battery got so it would not hold a full charge.[[ASIN:B007SLMNFY NORELCO AT830/41 POWERTOUCH RECHARGEABLE CORDLESS RAZOR WITH SMARTPIVOT HEADS &amp; AQUATEC TECHNOLOGY -]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco electrics for over 40 years. Its best to use these wet with shaving gel. Less irritation and VERY close.</li>
            <li> I use this for touch ups if I am going out for the evening. In the morning I used a Gillette, which gives a much closer shave than the electrics.</li>
            <li> Husband (for face &amp; neck): Doesn&#x27;t get a very close shave, especially on the neck. Sometimes it even catches and pinches me on the neck. Works great wet &amp; dry. I mostly use it dry. Makes shaving quick and holds a very long charge. I like the pop up trimmer, too. The shave doesn&#x27;t last long, but it makes my mornings a little faster. You&#x27;ve gotta pull your skin pretty tight to get it to work right, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wife (legs, arms &amp; whatnot): Works fine as an arm and leg shaver. If you&#x27;re in a hurry the dry shave is great. I like to shave on the couch before bed when I do my nails and such. It&#x27;s terribly useful for lazy people like me. The Wet shave is just as good as the dry shave, so I don&#x27;t bother with it. It&#x27;s not too close a shave and it doesn&#x27;t last long, but it gets the job done. DO NOT use on armpits, back of knee, or bikini area. It&#x27;ll pop blood vessels. Oh, it hurts very much. Be very meticulous where you let it slide. Needs about 3 circular pass overs to do a spot, but the speed you do it at doesn&#x27;t really matter. I think it&#x27;s much more convenient than a disposable and certainly cheaper over time.</li>
            <li> I got this because I&#x27;m in chemo and wanted to keep my head shaved.  I like that I can use it in the shower, so the shavings don&#x27;t end up all over the place.  Also it&#x27;s quite quiet, so I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;m damaging my ears.  My dad lost his hearing with age, which I attributed to noisy shaver, lawn mower, and snow blower -- so quiet is *really* important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had was when I was shaving near the bottom of my neck I got some abrasions on the sections of my shoulders near my neck.  This was my inexperience in using the product, tho.</li>
            <li> I have used another (more basic) Phillips shaver for 15+ years and recently replaced it by this one.&lt;br /&gt;While the design are similar among the two, the new one certainly do a better job, thanks to the&lt;br /&gt;additional features. Overall I am satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-- Shorter shaving time. Three heads work more efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;-- Touch is softer, and still it shaves better.&lt;br /&gt;-- Waterproof &amp; Aquatec are convenient (for shaving and cleaning).&lt;br /&gt;-- Sturdy design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-- Can not be used without charging. My previous one worked with AC without charging.&lt;br /&gt;-- The usefulness of \\&quot;smart pivot\\&quot; is not clear since it adds only a little flexibility to the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize, I think it&#x27;s worth to buy at least AT810 for better shaving quality,&lt;br /&gt;but I am not sure if it&#x27;s worth to pay additional $9 to get smart pivot (AT830).</li>
            <li> This is a very good electric shaver. I have used Philips before but older technology, it gives me a clean smooth shave wet or dry, I do both, infact I am about to order a second one for my travel bag.</li>
            <li> This razor works great.  It has a nice floating head on it and does what it is supposed to do.  Bought it here on Amazon about 6 months ago and would buy the same thing if needed again.  One thing to note:  Recharge it before it really needs to be charged since this is a model that can be used in water it will not run when the cord is plugged in so you cannot use it while plugged in and charging.  Not a problem at all and a good safety feature but it caught me by surprise the first time I went to plug it in and use it at the same time since it needed a charge boost.</li>
            <li> I have always had good result with norelco rotary razors.  This one has been the best, which one would expect as I keep them for many years and am generations ahead when I buy a new one.  The only issues that I have is that for the price, this should have more features.  My old one (which was a similar price level back then) had:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LED lights that would give you an current status of battery life - this one does not give you an indication until it is about out of juice&lt;br /&gt;A coiled cord which is easier and neater - luckily my old coiled cord worked on the new razor so the one that came with it goes to the back of the cabinet&lt;br /&gt;Capability to shave with the cord plugged in - why not ????&lt;br /&gt;A carrying case so keep your old one - these cases are pretty cheap so for the price it should be included&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaves well, though</li>
            <li> A few days before a trip to Florida my 5 year old Norelco 7140 quit working so had to run to to the local Mart store and pick up a shaver before I left.....as the shelves were nearly bare I purchased a Panasonic ES-RT51-s.  After 5 months of frustration I broke down and bought the AT830.  Smart move on my part....shaves much quicker and closer and I no longer have to run the shaver over my beard multiple times to get a barely acceptable shave as I did with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Been shaving with this razor in the shower for about a week now and it pretty much performs as advertised.  While not \\&quot;as close as a blade\\&quot; as they say, it is certainly close enough considering you won&#x27;t need to drop any money on multi-blade cartridges ever again.  It&#x27;s been quite some time since I tried an electric and the technology has apparently gotten better as this one does the oft-troubling neck pretty well.  Runs nice and quiet and easy to rinse.  Looks pretty cool and feels great in the hand as well.  Worth trying if you want to escape the money pit of replacement blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using Philips shavers for 15 years and this is my 4th unit.&lt;br /&gt;The last one was Coolskin HQ6761 shaver which served me for last ~7 years. I had blades replaced only once few years ago.&lt;br /&gt;So when battery started to feel weak requiring charge every week and blades felt not as sharp as they used to be I thought why to spend 35$ on new blades when I can buy for 70$ the newest and greatest top of the line shaver?&lt;br /&gt;The AT830/41 has good features and supposedly the best blades with \\&quot;Super Lift &amp; Cut\\&quot; and \\&quot;DualPrecision\\&quot; technologies.&lt;br /&gt;Well - this new shaver doesn&#x27;t as good as the old one. Looking at the inside of the blades you can see that the new one has only half of blades comparing to the old one. So I need to work much harder to get a clen shave.&lt;br /&gt;Battery - even it&#x27;s a brand new device and I did the first charge for the whole night - after a week or so I start to feel and hear that motor is losing its guts while shaving hard parts. So charge is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;So - worse shave, not impressive battery - you can see why I&#x27;m disappointed...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m wondering whether expensive SensoTouch models deliver the goods...</li>
            <li> It shaves a little easier than my older Norelco triple header. The Lithium battery easily lasts a week without recharging which makes it easily stored with no cord or convenient for travel not having to take a charger. The waterproof feature is very nice because to clean it all you have to do is open the shaving head and put it under the running water. For charging it doesn&#x27;t come with a stand you set it in like my older model, fortunately the old stand works with this one.</li>
            <li> Does a great job, its easy to clean, light weight and charges quickly. I would recommend Norelco.. Their reputation is a good one.</li>
            <li> I am a newbie to Electric razors and have been considering electric models from $30 to $100 range from all brands..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience from this has been awesome. First use was clean and soft even if you rub against your face in opposite direction of hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;While I did struggle a bit in the neck area, it was due to my fear of getting cut..( nothing happened though).. , this guy eventually won.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;while I write this, I had 3-4 shaves… bit of itching (as expected in the first few times of usage) but works like a charm. The provided clipper does a good job for side burns and trimming around ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its very comfortable to hold. I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor and it is a good one. I still pefer the razor but this is great when I am in a rush.</li>
            <li> It seem to be a good quality razor. It works fine and holds a charge reasonably long. I have no problem there. But, I am disappointed with it for another reason which is not listed anyplace until after you buy it. Every cordless razor I have ever had, when the charge runs out, I could just attach the cord and finish my shave with the cord attached, and then charge it up. Well, not with andy model that starts with &amp;#34;AT&amp;#34;. It ONLY works as a cordless model. When the charge runs out you have to charge it with the cord, and then use it without the cord. Model that start with &amp;#34;AT&amp;#34; can be used it the shower, the tub, etc. For this reason they don;&#x27;t want you to be able to use it with the cord attached for obvious reasons. I didn&#x27;t know this before I bought it. If you want a cordless model that can also be used with the cord attached, get a model that starts with &amp;#34;PT&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Gentile on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have used norelco&#x27;s shavers for several years, but the triple blade head does a closer shave and feels better.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend always said razors bump him up and he used this horrible smelling stuff called magic shave. Needless to say I am glad he loved this shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it impossible to get a close shave with this razor.  No matter how many times I run it over my neck in particular or how hard I press, there is always stubble remaining.</li>
            <li> received my shaver promptly and only had a few good shaves. i clean it after every shave but it seems to me that i might be ready for a new head already. i am disappointed at phillips for discontinuing the rq12 heads as i have two shavers which i liked very much. buy now i cannot get one unless i go to the bank.</li>
            <li> Does not give me a close shave nor cut all the days growth. Multiple passes over same area still leaves stubble.</li>
            <li> It does a reasonable job at shaving.There has always been areas that require multiple passes.The only negative features are the recharge cord and lack of a travel case.The cord is not user friendly for storage.Previous models of Norelco shaver&#x27;s i have had supplied coiled cords which makes them much more easy to store.</li>
            <li> My husband has always used Norelco razors. He did try another brand once...no comparison. This is a great razor for the man in your life, but it seems to need recharged more often than previous Norelcos that I have bought for my husband. Maybe after every 4 shaves.  But it does a good job of shaving. I picked this one because it was the most expensive of this type Nprelco. Thought it would have all the bells and whistles...but holds a seemingly short charge</li>
            <li> I have used a Norelco for 20 years, was very satisfied and needed a new battery which is not available. The new one performs even better, easy to use and I would not be without it.</li>
            <li> Very good razor. Quiet and light weight, but no better than my older Norelco electric razor. Yes, I would rcommend it</li>
            <li> I purchased this upgrade due to reviews and suggestions on the cheaper model. It does not shave that closely as my older obsolete (and 1/2 the price) electric razor. Semi-close dry but is better in the shower with shaving cream. Can cause razor burn if you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor.  What an improvement in closeness of the shave.  My skin appreciates the lack of irritation, too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Dad&#x27;s birthday &amp; he loves it. It doesn&#x27;t pull and gives him a close shave.</li>
            <li> I bought the Philips Norelco Electric Razor for my husband as a Christmas gift.  He wanted another brand.  I read the reviews.  This model seemed to be adequate and good for his needs.  He&#x27;s really happy with it.</li>
            <li> Works great at a great price. Arrived on ahead of schedule. I highly recommend t to anyone in need of a good razor.</li>
            <li> Works like a champ!  Trimmer on the back is nice. Bought the Philips Norelco 1150X/46 SensoTouch 2D Electric Razor first thinking I&#x27;d step up. This is much nicer.  Charges without a stand. Has the trimmer always available. Would give it 5 starts if it came with a travel case.  Fits into one of my old travel cases, so for me that&#x27;s not huge.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly, and was as described. Charged it up overnight. Works much better than the original version of this from 20+ years ago! This was bought as a replacement for an earlier model that &amp;#34;died&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have used foil type electric razors for years, and decided to buy the AT830 based on the reviews that I had read. It was a wise choice! There is nothing that I do not like about this razor. Close shave, quiet, long time between charges, easy to clean, wet or dry,comfortable grip.</li>
            <li> It has been a long time since I bought a new electric, and advancements have been made.  Using shaving gel with this razor is like a weekend treat.  The heads really hug the face and the result is a very close shave with no irritation.  This is a good product.</li>
            <li> Before buying this shaver, I read as many reviews as I could find.  Turns out that this shaver is an excellent buy.  It shaves smoothly, quietly, and \\&quot;gets it all.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good.  I&#x27;m still a little squeamish about cleaning this shaver by letting water run through it. Let&#x27;s hope it maintains its shaving ability  into the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price charged at Amazon was the best I could find.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razors for decades.  this model gives me an adequate shaved, no more. The price appealed to me and the reviews were okay. it does not give a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Have had Norelco razors for many years. This gives a great shave, very easy to clean, and when used with foam it delivers a close and comfortable wet shave. Its&#x27; got to be one of The best Norelco&#x27;s so far.</li>
            <li> Have only used this razor for three weeks. This is the second Norelco I hve owned. The first lasted 5 years.  Hope this one is the same. So far its a smooth running machine.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe the quietness, and closeness of shave. Also so much quicker it is to shave!! Basing all this comparing it with My old (at least 10 yrs.)  old Norelco. A Joy to use!!! First two items I mentioned should be used more in Your promotions of this product! THANKS!</li>
            <li> At first wasn&#x27;t as happy with it as the old one I had for years but after awhile I got used to it</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic ES8109 Shaver &amp; lost it in a hotel room - so I needed another shaver fast, thought I&#x27;d take a chance on going &amp;#34;back to a Norelco after all these years&amp;#34; (I had one 9 years ago) - what a mistake!  This thing is ridiculous!  The Panasonic told me how many minutes of charge I had left - this one just tells me &amp;#34;when I&#x27;m almost out&amp;#34;.  The Panasonic ran about 13,000 cycles per minute; the Norelco runs about 3,000 (?) and basically pulls the hair off my face.  It runs so slow, I thought it was defective!  I thought I&#x27;d give it another try today - I don&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;rough or heavy beard&amp;#34;, really a light beard - i can almost shave every other day - it&#x27;s only 1:30pm and my face is already showing a &amp;#34;5 o&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34; and is irritated.  I&#x27;m hoping I can return it - back to the Panasonic brand!!!</li>
            <li> This is definately a wet shaver rather than dry. The closeness of shave is far better used wet but okay dry if your in a hurry. Good battery life between charges. My second of this type but the first one was a better dry shave.</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a gift for my father.  He says that it works very well.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco AT830 does good on the face and chin but not too well on the uper neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still have to use a razor for the upper neck to get a  clean shove.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a closer shave than any one that I have had before. I strongly suggest it.  The price was excellent.</li>
            <li> My husband goes through shavers like most people go through toilet paper.  LOL  His beard is very rough so he has a hard time buying a shaver that will perform the way he hopes it will.  This shaver was a little more expensive than he usually buys but says it is definitely worth the extra money.  Now he has a close shave and his wife (me) is thrilled.  If your man has a beard that he cannot remove completely, then this shaver is for definitely for him.  Do not be afraid of the extra cost.  It is well worth it in the long run.</li>
            <li> 12/26/12--I have purchased about 10 electric razors over the years. This is the first one to actually work on my neck. Very happy and highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3-31-13-- Have been using razor about 5 days a week and today was the first day I had to recharge. Pretty good getting 3 months of use without recharging.</li>
            <li> After using other electric razors for over 60 years, I found the Norelco to be a wonderful improvement in ease of use, effectiveness in getting the saving job done in a much shorter time and with much improved comfort.  Though it can be used in the shower or with lubricant, I never have bothered to go that extra step.  Wish I had made the switch years ago.  My son was right!</li>
            <li> I had an older, cheap norelco but the price of a new blade was really high so I decided to look for a brand new one that was usable in the shower. It works great, it has a nice feature where you plug it in for 5 minutes and you can complete a shave! The battery lasts a long time and has a very clean cut for an electric razor. The clippers on the back is great for sideburns and thinning out! I recommend for the price!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son.  It is OK for a teenager. But not as good as a Braun twice the price.</li>
            <li> hThThe razor is light weight with a battery that seems to last forever.  The reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that while it shaves well, I can&#x27;t get as close a shave as I get with a razor blade, the shave is adequate.  I went from a reguralar electric razor to the Norelco which gives a decent shave.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for 40 years. They work well.</li>
            <li> A little bit of an older model; however, it is as advertised and is what I am looking for, so I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Battery lasted less than a year before it gave up the ghost. Since it&#x27;s not replaceable, unit went straight in the trash. The quality standards of this company have really gone down. I still have an older Norelco I use for travel that&#x27;s been going strong for more that five years now.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I have ever used</li>
            <li> Works reasonably well. There are no functional problems. I personally have some difficulty getting a close electric shave without irritating my skin. I do skip a few days between shaving which does not keep my skin properly conditioned.</li>
            <li> The product is good and reached on time.The product is good and reached on time.The product is good and reached on time</li>
            <li> I like this razor. I have used Philips for a long time, this is my 4th razor in 20 years, so in my experience they are very good. I like that is quiet, shaves very well. The first week I had some skin irritation but that went away after some time. I do not like that you cannot use it plugged, but the battery lasts more than one week, so it is acceptable for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for over 40 years. This shaver does the job, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any complaints about this product. Does everything I wanted plus surprised me with battery life. Choose this over your more expensive options.</li>
            <li> I have shaved with an electric razor all of my life, and this razor gives me the best and most comfortable shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Met all my expectations. Easy to shave with .. Would recommend this product to anyone.who appreciates a good quality product. Charger for battery.</li>
            <li> I used this shaver exclusively for the three week period in their instructions. It did not even come close to a blade. It did give me a closer shave when I used it with shaving cream. I will work OK for that quick shave when you are on the go and don&#x27;t have time for anything else. On the plus side the battery will last for many shaves before recharging.</li>
            <li> There is no battery meter, only a light that flashes when the battery is about to run out and if it does run out...you cant just plug it in and finish your shave...you have to let it charge up for a while then unplug it before you can finish. My old Norelco Reflex Plus Model 6863 LX that cost me $69 several years ago has: A: 5 level battery life indicator lights and B: If the battery does die while shaving you can just plug it in the wall and finish your shave. This unit which cost $89 in a JOKE! It will be returned tomorrow and for $9 I will buy the *Battery Replacement Kit* which is sold here on Amazon or eBay and fix my old shaver.</li>
            <li> I first bought this in May 2013 and by September 2013 it wouldn&#x27;t charge so Philips replaced the whole unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in Feb 2014 it won&#x27;t stay on! Just contacted Philips and they won&#x27;t replace the whole unit this time, just the handle / body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell how long this one lasts, 3rd time the charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame as other than the reliability, I do like the shaver and the quality of the shave.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for over forty years now and have enjoyed them. I started with the double rotary and then progressed to the triple header and on to the shavers that expel the shave cream. This shaver, the AT830, does not seem to shave as close as the others. I really have to spent more time to get a closer shave and then it is not as close as my past shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews here at Amazon, and they did not steer me wrong.  I had been using an older Norelco XL model, and this new model shaves much closer and faster.  It is easily cleaned with hot running water, and since it can be used in the shower, there are no worries about getting too much water on it like the previous razor.  This is the best electric razor I have ever owned -- highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I had written an earlier review of a Braun foil type razor that I used for three years and disliked because it wouldn&#x27;t cut anything longer than a 1-2 day growth and compared it to an earlier Norelco I had used for about 20 years and which worked very well for me. Perhaps my beard is too coarse for foil type razors as I find the this new Norelco to shave even better than the previous model and is a joy to use. I have always shaved dry with electric razors and still do so with this model, so I can&#x27;t address how well it works wet or with shaving gel. I get a close shave with this model in a single pass and can do a complete shave, around my goatee, in a matter of 10-15 seconds per day. I like the fact that this is a waterproof model as I can open it up every few shaves and flush it out in the sink. I would certainly recommend this model to my friends, especially those having trouble getting a close shave with a foil type razor.</li>
            <li> First I would say I was concerned about buying this shaver because of some of the low ratings.&lt;br /&gt;However, After buying it and using it for about a month, It does shave very good and closer than my older Norelco Spectra 8891XL with new blades so I&#x27;m very pleased about the overall performance. Here are thing I don’t like about the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no shave indicator on it that shows how many shaves you can get before recharging the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;The motor is a lot noisier than my older and still working 8891XL, It just sounds cheap.&lt;br /&gt;The pop up trimmer lever only pops the trimmer up, you cannot pull the lever to close it, you have to push the trimmer down manually, a small thing but makes it feel cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;The overweight feels very cheap, my older 8891XL feels balanced, sturdy and strong, not top heavy, light weight and cheap.&lt;br /&gt;There is no shaver head &amp;#34;Personal Comfort Control” adjustment to adjust the blade conditions against you skin as compared to the older 8891XL.&lt;br /&gt;The shaving dust does not stay contained in the head until you open it to clean it, the shaving dust falls all over the handle and makes it dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another side not is that neither of the razors have replaceable batteries. They are spot welded to the inside terminals so it prevents you from replacing them when it gets older and the batteries wear out. Otherwise, I would just replace the batteries in my 8891Xl and keep going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case Norelco is looking at the reviews, start making them of better quality products and people will buy more of your products.&lt;br /&gt;This might be my last one.</li>
            <li> If you are shopping for a new electric razor for under 100.00 you should go with this one!  A big selling point for this AT830 model is that it is a dry or shaving lotion type razor!  The head of the razor pivots also.  I get the best results getting my face wet in a hot shower,  then applying Barbasol sensitive skin shaving cream,  and using only a little pressure with it as I shave (keeps irritation to a minimum that way).  The rotating blades cut through my super thick 5 o&#x27;clock shadow with ease,  resulting in an almost blade like shave!  In back of the shaver there is a push button trimmer that folds out for trimming sideburns etc.  Another plus is that no expensive cleaning solutions are needed to maintain this model,  just push a button and the head folds open for you to rinse all the gunk and whiskers out!  This razor works so well and conveniently that I gave up using razors all together (I use to use both)!  The only knock I have against this razor is not the shaver itself but the fact that it does NOT come with a charging stand,  so basically you just use the wall charger it comes with and it just kinda sits there.  Overall though this is a highly recommended electric razor if you want a good shave on a budget.  PROS:  -Wet or dry shaver and shaving creams or gels can be used with it. -Pivoting head -Pop out sideburn trimmer -Easy push button cleanup  CONS:  -Does not come with a charging stand to hold shaver between shaves,  just a wall charging power cord.</li>
            <li> I like being able to clean it by washing it with water and getting a good wet shave every day.</li>
            <li> I purchased the razor for my husband. It works great. Gives a nice close shave &amp; it doesn&#x27;t take long. Very easy to clean. He&#x27;s used Norelco for as long as we&#x27;ve been married.</li>
            <li> This shaver replaced an older model with battery charging problem. This shaver is quieter and the charge long lasting. Ability to raise share head a big plus. Shave is much closer than old model.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks of use have to say I am quite pleased with this unit, would recommend it and the price is fair</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this razor.  Easy to use and clean.  It does not cut as close as a conventional razor but is acceptable.</li>
            <li> Shaver does a great job, close shave and doesn&#x27;t pull. Especially like the fact I can use shave gel with it.&lt;br /&gt;Also very easy to clean, just rinse with water and it is done!</li>
            <li> I had been using a Philips Norelco HS8420 (which dispenses Nivea lubricant) and was happy with it until after about a year when the blades started to dull and the shave was less comfortable. I also stopped buying the Nivea lubricant because it was too expensive and shaving cream worked pretty well. Instead of buying replacement blades, I opted for this razor after seeing positive customer feedback. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I had been using a Philips Norelco electric razor it still took about 2 weeks for me to get used to this one, but eventually it does deliver a close and comfortable shave. I find it works best with some shaving cream or gel, and when you have thicker growth (shaving at both morning and night usually leads to stubble and irritation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in a while I have to catch an occasional hair with a safety razor, and I wouldn&#x27;t use this on my wedding day, but for every day use if you just want a quick shave that gets you to work looking clean, this is a solid product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery is very impressive. It charges quickly and holds a charge for a long time. This is perfect if you need to throw it in your bag for a business trip or long weekend and don&#x27;t want to worry about battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the better electric razors but not among the most expensive options, so if you&#x27;re looking to upgrade from a cheaper model or want to try your first electric razor without spending a lot of money (in the long run this is cheaper than high end safety blades like Fusion), this is a good product to consider.</li>
            <li> In the past thirty years I&#x27;ve tried just about every kind of hair removal method there is. Some great others, not so much. What I&#x27;ve yet to find something simple. The Philips Norelco AT830 is.&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s task was not an unusual one, cut my beard as smooth as a blade, all two inches of it. I cheated a little not using a pair of scissors first. After a overnight charge the AT830 plowed through my thick, coarse, dense overgrowth only pausing for an occasional rinse under some warm running water with the lid popped. Surprisingly, it had reduced every hair it touched into mulch.&lt;br /&gt;  After I was satisfied with the smooth treatment the AT830 had given my face I popped up the trim attachment and went to work on my &#x27;stash and side burns. This tool is handy but, for full control I recommend a small comb to tease the hair as you trim.&lt;br /&gt;  The instructions read fifty minutes to a charge. I figured after the grueling forty minute workout I should plug the AT830 over night before use again...not, I used it everyday for 1, 2 almost 3 weeks before the low charge warning light came on. Despite the light the AT830 still gave me a shave. Now I&#x27;m sure I can pack it on an extended getaway sans the extension cord.&lt;br /&gt;  Finally, $25 bucks a year to replace the blades plus the initial investment seem a small price for a shaver that does the job just as well if not better than most electrics and many blades. I&#x27;m looking forward to see if the AT830 still performs as well five years from now.</li>
            <li> Product was as advertised, does a great job.  The \\&quot;full-charge in 1 hour\\&quot; is definitely a big step up from the normal 8 hours charging time of many models, current and past.  I have used may makes of electric razors through the years, but have found that the tripple-head norelco is the best for me.  I have a very heavy and tough beard, but very sensitive skin; which resulted in quickly dulling most electric razor blades and ruining their foils, and causing razor-burns to my skin in order to get a close shave.  This is not the case with the Norelco tripple head shavers.  Some of the cheaper priced Norelco models don&#x27;t give me quite the results I want and need, but this mid-range priced Norelco razor meets all my expectations and requirements.  I would not hesitate to recommend it to a relative or friend.  The razor was shipped very promptly, and delivery time was much quicker than expected.  Amazon is definitely the place to find good deals and review the best ratings on products and sellers (dealers).</li>
            <li> Is been a week and i am still trying it out. It irritates my skin. My previous shaver was the best, it had longer shaving time 130 minutes compared to this one only 50 minutes. It was also better made. I hope this one last as long as the other one 10 years.</li>
            <li> The pivoting head on this razor is superior to the previous Norelco I owned. Very effective in the neck area.  Battery life is great so far. Not much warning when its going to die; if the warning light is on, don&#x27;t start shaving, you won&#x27;t get very far. Great razor all around.</li>
            <li> I have been using this same model (with whatever upgrades) for close to 50 years so I am not surprised it is so good and so reliable!</li>
            <li> Good item&lt;br /&gt;had been using norelco for years&lt;br /&gt;but wanted to give a try on the dry wet version&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;works great than expected&lt;br /&gt;thumbs up  for Philips  for the item&lt;br /&gt;good seller...reasonable pricing</li>
            <li> The little baby-sized lithium ion battery can hardly get the blades to move. Good thing I bought the floating head design because I really have to mash it into my face over and over again to get it to cut my beard. However it is really quiet compared to my old one, and it&#x27;s cool how I can just run hot water over the blades to clean it. No more mess ups.</li>
            <li> I have taken my past Norelco razor over to HongKong, and to Singapore, so I know they work there as well as here. I am just as confident that my new Norelco will perform as well. Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this razor, it is very convenient and shaves pretty close. Will recommend to everybody to buy.</li>
            <li> Same great Norelco shaving capability - a little better than my last one (10years ago).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big upgrade from my last Norelco is the sink cleaning capability - turn the water on hot and hose it out (blade area and cavity).  Related feature is that the back is hinged so I can clean out both areas while holding the razor normally.  I just keep the head open for a couple hours after cleaning to let it dry.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 other Norelco razors for my husband in past years.&lt;br /&gt;He really loves this one and is really pleased with the shave he gets from&lt;br /&gt;it.</li>
            <li> After 40 years of Norelco use, I took a sidestep to Panasonic for a few months of unsatisfying shaves. My previous Norelco had combs that would not cut longer neck hairs. I tried the Panasonic, but it was much worse than the Norelco it replaced. After some online research, I saw that the latest generations of Norelcos have gone back to slotted combs...................Best shaves that I&#x27;ve had in the last 3 years! Thank You Norelco!</li>
            <li> This is my third Philips Norelco shaver in the past 15 years.  Yep, each one lasts about 5 years--actually longer if you&#x27;re not concerned about battery life, i.e. willing to keep it plugged in--and I&#x27;d highly recommend the brand.  This one definitely provides the closest shave as compared to my previous two shavers, so they seem to be improving the technology over time.  It&#x27;s also quicker to complete my shave.  And the price was excellent.  I only use this shaver as a dry shaver--haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower or with gel.  But it works very well--including the tougher spots like on my neck.  It can easily be cleaned after each shave--under the faucet.  It does not have a carrying case, but it seems you can purchase one separately.  Additionally, for those wondering, the charger cord from the generation of Philips Norelco shavers from 5 years ago DOES fit/work on this shaver, including the car charger that I had with that one.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying an electric razor, but I&#x27;ve fallen in love with this one. Not only does it comfortably trim my hair at several lengths, but it also gives a really close shave for an electric razor. Some other awesome things about this razor are that it&#x27;s easy to clean, water proof, and has amazing battery life. The convenience of being able to shave while driving to work is phenomenal too.</li>
            <li> The razor works, kind of. It&#x27;s not a great shave, but it eventually removes the two or three day growth. I&#x27;d find myself needing to go over the same areas repeatedly, but maybe my strong masculine facial features extend to my stubble as well. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but didn&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> The person I bought this for seemed to like it at first (a month or so) then went back to shaving with a razor. I did a lot of research before buying this product, because he has a very heavy beard,  and thought I was purchasing the right electric razor. Because it can be used wet or dry it seemed perfect but some men are just died-in the wool razor users and that&#x27;s what they like. I gave it a 3 star not because it is defective in any way it just wasn&#x27;t right for him.</li>
            <li> Like the fact that it&#x27;s lithium, replaced my old 7140xl series which I used for half a decade without any problems. The only improvement over the old 7140xl is that this have a pivoting front/back motion added to it. Everything else is the same, they use the same shaving head HQ8.</li>
            <li> THE BEST RAZOR I EVER BOUGHT. HO;D A CHARGE FOR A LONG TIME. I HAVE ONLY CHARGED IT ONCE SINCE I BOUGHT IT</li>
            <li> Yes . I bought this one and i was disappointed.so I returned it. hey look. forget all these positive reviews If you are looking for close shave don&#x27;t buy this one or any rotary shaver. get a foil one from Braun or Panasonic . they may make noise more than rotaries but they will give you a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I may be old school, but for $70 to $80 you would think the technology of 2014 would give a better shaving experience. I do not use this razor everyday since I&#x27;m retired and don&#x27;t shave everyday. I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to!! But I still occasionally use a cheap two or three blade throw away razor. It gives me a much closer shave than what I consider an expensive Norelco razor. I just use the Norelco when I need a quick shave before I go out in public to do my grocery shopping, Dr. appointments etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more convenient than the Norelco it replaced (the one with the built in Nivea lotion dispenser) but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as it did. Although this does a superior job on the neck area to the Nivea one. You can use it wet with gel or dry and both give a very good, if not great shave. It&#x27;s very easy to clean under running water and it seems to hold a charge for a long time! The sideburns trimmer really doesn&#x27;t seem to do too much, but that&#x27;s been a common complaint with most of my Norelco razors. If I could I would give it 4 1/2 stars and I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> this is a replacement electric shaver.  It gives a closer shave than the Braun it replaces</li>
            <li> promised&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Norelco/Philips products since I started shaving 30 years ago. This is the worst and most probably the last product of theirs I will ever buy. I spend about fives time as long shaving, and I&#x27;m still covered with hair. They promise &#x27;wet or dry&#x27; but neither work. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed. My old razor with year and a half old blades still does a better job. $90 down the drain.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Norelco razor back in the late &#x27;60&#x27;s. I loved it, still use it, but it wouldn&#x27;t work in the shower. This razor gives the same fabulous shave, but it more versatile. it shave closer than the blade I use in the shower, and it is a lot faster, too! The person that designed this razor did a great job. It fits your hand no matter how you try to hold it. It requires no foam or gel, but tends to glide even smoother with a bit of foam. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this razor.</li>
            <li> I admit that I am not sold on electric shavers (yet).  So this review compares this shaver to one other electric and a cartridge razor.  You can read my previous review of the [[ASIN:B005DKKBP6 Panasonic ES-LV81-K Arc 5 Multi Flex Wet/Dry Nanotech Rechargeable Shaver with Vortex Cleaning System, Black]], which I compared to my humble [[ASIN:B000052YHS Gillette Mach3 Shaving System, 1 System]] that I still use with a mirror in the shower.  In the end, I am still using the cartridge razor because it gives a superior shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, what I do like about this Norelco as compared to the much pricier Panasonic is that it is cheaper, quieter and the maintenance cost is less.  The Norelco has three, round rotary blades that seem to adapt to the contours of my face easier than the flat blades of the Panasonic.  The Norelco should be used in a circular motion across the skin, whereas the Panasonic is used in more of an upstroke/downstroke way.  Both can be used wet, although I don&#x27;t believe the closeness is much different between wet and dry.  In fact, I tried the Norelco with just water and it did not slide very well.  I tried the next day with a thin coat of shaving gel and it was much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my main complaint with electrics is that they just cannot match the closeness of a cartridge razor.  I spent several minutes working the Norelco over my skin, stretching the skin, going &#x27;against the grain&#x27;, circular and straight motions... and I still ended up with some stubble in certain spots, like under the jawline and near &#x27;edges&#x27; like sideburns and mustache.  Also, with the electrics, I cannot get a sharp hairline at sideburns and mustache edges -- the &#x27;burns and &#x27;stache just kind of keep getting wider and wider over time until you have to get the razor or trimmer out and shape them again.  But with a razor, I don&#x27;t have that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if I had to pick one, I would choose the cheaper, rotary head electric for it&#x27;s cost, quietness and comparable performance.  But as long as they sell the Mach3 cartridges, I will stick with the shave in the shower for the convenience and closeness.they sell the Mach3 cartridges, I will stick with the shave in the shower for the convenience and closeness.</li>
            <li> I have hardly any beard to cut. I&#x60;m one of those at 55 who still grows very thin patchy hair. No way would a razor have to work hard to give me a close shave . I was very disappointed when I had to go over the same area 5-6 times just to get my peach fuzz off. This was my experience with this item. Sadly my 10 year old razor with original blades that was less expensive cuts the same as my new one.</li>
            <li> The 800 series is the most feature rich of Norelco&#x27;s Mid-tier. This is the series I would most recommend for the value to performance. Much of what you would get in the higher end series is the design and LCD display vs. an actual better shave. It seems like Norelco has moved away in 2012 from multiple concentric rings of cutting edges and has just focused on the outer ring. This seems reasonable given that the outer edge would have the highest rotation speed.  Pros:  - Appropriately sealed containment space  - Small charging plug  - Good weight balance  - Large trimming surface  - LION battery  - 2 year warantee</li>
            <li> About 18 months ago I reviewed a [[ASIN:B003V360NY Philips Norelco 1150x/40 SensoTouch 2d Electric Shaver, Metallic Blue]] from Norelco&#x27;s Senseo line, which is nominally a higher end product than this razor&#x27;s pedigree.  Even though I liked that razor a lot, I like this razor even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, somehow this thing just chows on neck hair.  I&#x27;ve never used an electric razor that does a truly great job on my neck - this one does.  Seriously.  Second, it has an integrated beard trimmer - super handy for trimming up the goatee - the Senseo has a separate trimmer head - requiring you to remove the shaving head, locate the trimmer head, etc.  Third, it has an easy button to flip up and open the shaving screen - super nice.  The Senseo always gave me a little trouble with getting the shaving head open for cleaning.  Fourth, the rubber grip is great if you are a shower shaver.  I&#x27;ve used this razor on a variety on lengths - daily stubble, over-weekend beardiness, etc. and it has done a great job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good shaver but the shave isn&#x27;t as close as some of the other Norelco shaves I&#x27;ve owned. It charges well and it&#x27;s easy to clean. It&#x27;s comfortable and light weight and stores easily. All-in-all, I&#x27;d say this is just average given that the shave quality isn&#x27;t quite what I had expected.</li>
            <li> This is the best shave that I have received from an electric shaver. Being able to use it in a wet environment is an excellent advantage.</li>
            <li> I used to use 2 electric razors to shave with, a Norelco Triple Header for my heavy beard and a Braun after I get my heavy beard down.  Now with this razor I only need one and I love the fact of being able to use a gel.  It gives me even more of a close shave than the two others did!</li>
            <li> Norelco shavers used to be built like a tank, to last, quality, thought involved in the creation of each shaver so that it did the job and usually with aplomb. Even the cheapest shavers could be counted on to be plugged in and work. Not so with this cheap piece of @#$#!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you look at small letters on the box, very closely, you&#x27;ll discover as I did (after purchase and use) that this shaver is not meant to be used plugged in. Yes, you heard right - it won&#x27;t work if it&#x27;s plugged into a wall socket. You have to wait until it&#x27;s charged up enough in order to shave, which is more than 5 minutes I assure you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you really need to know more? This POS $90 shaver comes with NO accessories. Philips has stripped this baby even of the cheapo case for traveling, which will prevent this shaver from opening up and spilling hair out of the chamber into your travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost everything I have seen Philips touch has gone to cheap garbage. But a great brand, cut corners and costs and sell it pretending it to be the same thing. Suffice it to say that this shaver and its very slow motor (despite the claims) is really no more effective than the models at half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it does work... but I was foolish enough to believe these five star claims by either fake reviewers or those with very low expectations. Is one star harsh? Perhaps. But at least it slaps you across the face to read this review and become aware of how low end this supposedly higher end shaver is. I&#x27;ll probably toss this dying sounding shaver when I need to change blades.</li>
            <li> It was easy to order, and arrived in a short amount of time.  Really like the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like the Norelco AT830 razor with the pivoting contour face plate (holds the 3 pivoting heads), but found the 2 degree pivoting plate created awkward crevices inside the unit head that made it difficult in cleaning all the the hair stubble out. I found the less expensive Norelco AT810 to give a closer and easier shave. Kudos to Amazon on the 830 return and quick 810 shipping of now my current daily shaving buddy!</li>
            <li> I ordered with question mark but am very happy as it is the best razor I have ever used.  I do use us soap or shaving cream but it is smooth--quick and very easy on my face.  Good  value  Also like fast delivery</li>
            <li> My first electric razor was a Braun and so far this razor is far superior. The design fits into contours of my face better, it runs at a much lower RPM, you can use it with shaving gel, and it is super easy to clean as you can just flip open the blade chassis while it is still running and run it under hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly of all is the shaving result and this shaver, which uses the &amp;#34;lift and cut&amp;#34; design, produces a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> This razor lives up to it&#x27;s billing. The opportunity to use the shaver while charging is a definite plus, enhancing convenience.</li>
            <li> Does not shave as close as I expected. WiLl probably seek a new electric shaver .</li>
            <li> I had my doubts, but that disappeared the first time I used it. Does a great job. I didn&#x27;t even need a break in period.</li>
            <li> This razor has disappointed me. I was going to order the exact same model my husband uses because I like how well his shaves. However when I went to order it, Amazon showed me this &amp;#34;newer&amp;#34; model that&#x27;s supposed to be better and replaces the model my husband uses. It doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as nice as his and it feels a bit rougher against my sensitive skin. I&#x27;m disappointed but will keep using it as I know they&#x27;re supposed to get better with time.</li>
            <li> PERFECT..NO MORE CUTS..SMOOTH , QUIET, QUALITY PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Arrived in a short time by USPS standards after after ordering priotity shipping which with the USPS I do not consider priority shipping. The tilt razor head is a plus. However the unit did not come with a travel bag or case. I was disappointed the Phillip&#x27;s razors are now made in China instead of the Nederlands. I have had previous dissapointments with electronic items made in China AKA THe Peoples Republic of China not the Tiawann China.</li>
            <li> Pivoting head allows for close shave and lasts a long time on a single charge, design makes for easly cleaning.</li>
            <li> I have had many, many Norelco razors. This is the best. I wanted to have it for wet/dry use so I really explored the various choices, and have bought other brands. It is very close to being as good as a safety razor. Previously, I thought the Norelco 2D would be the answer, so I purchased it. It was not. Perhaps if I had sprung for the healthy priced 3D it would have. However, I am so impressed with this, at this price, I highly recommend it. One more thing. If you listen to the radio or music while showering you will love this one. It is verrrrry quiet.</li>
            <li> Tried for four weeks --wet--dry--with lather--with gel--never got a close shave! I&#x27;ve tried all the advice from other reviews and this thing is junk--and I do not have a heavy beard!</li>
            <li> I have used a Norelco electric razor for many years.  This unit compares well with others I have had for comfort and shave closeness. The battery provides enough juice for about 2 to 3 weeks of shaves for me.  The shivel head is a plus for comfort. When I clean the unit with water the water seems to find places to hide and will run down my hand while shaving even though I have allowed it to dry for 24 hours.  If you order from Amazon pay for the shipping.  I didn&#x27;t and it took a long time before they shipped it to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of electric razors over the years (mostly Norelco). I had been sold on the ones that took gel/creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor works great with a gel (Nivea). I&#x27;m getting great shaves and it&#x27;s lasting a long time between battery charges.</li>
            <li> Quiero comentarles que le compre esta afeitadora a mi esposo y quedo encantado con ella, se la entregue ayer y la empezo a utilizar de inmediato,dice que es muy buena y se puede usar con crema y sola, dice que es muy buena afeitadora, me siento bien porque elegi un buen producto  como regalo, ademas que necesita quedar bien afeitado le sale mucha barba diaria y en unos minutos queda bello, se le ve la cara super lisa, tambien les comento que la entrega desde que la solicite hasta que llego a venezuela solo duro siete (7) dias, me parece una bendicion!!!, les recomiendo el producto y el mecanismo de entrega</li>
            <li> After having a Norelco CoolSkin razor for so many years, it was a little weird at first to go back to an electric shaver without a lotion dispenser (although you CAN use shaving cream or lotion with this razor, in fact, it&#x27;s encouraged) but I quickly got used to it. I&#x27;ve used this razor with and without shaving lotion and am still very satisfied.  The razor&#x27;s quietness was also suprising at first but very much appreciated.  But the best thing by far is the razor&#x27;s ability to shave under my jawline: it&#x27;s always been a problem with my previous razors, but this gives me my cleanest shave yet.  It&#x27;s definitely worth it to get AT830 and pay a little more since I&#x27;m not sure the AT730 works the jawline that closely.  It doesn&#x27;t come with a stand or anything but that&#x27;s a minor concern: it&#x27;s easy to clean, the charge lasts a long time, and you get a warning light when the charge is low.</li>
            <li> He loves that this can be used both wet and dry, and it gives a very close shave, WAY better than the Braun Pulsonic shaver, and it keeps everything pretty neat. It is a nice looking razor and easy to recharge.</li>
            <li> I have purposely waited nearly a month before writing this review so I could give this razor a good trial, and I&#x27;ve been very satisfied with it from the very first shave.  As a black man with Pseudofolliculitis Barbae, I&#x27;m very cautious about any shaving product and over the years everything I&#x27;ve used causes those painful bumps more or less.  Normally I avoid Norelco because of their lift &amp; cut system and fears it would generate more razor bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product after comparing a competing product being used by black men and choose this one for its reliability after some reviews reported the competing product wore out after a year.  From the first shave I made an effort to follow the instructions and do some experimentation and recommend other black men to do the same.  Dry shaving doesn&#x27;t work for me but the Aquatec feature allows me to use a small amount of shaving cream when I shave.  I do have to rinse the trimmer heads with hot water when I shave, and I remove them to let them dry when I&#x27;m finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past month I discovered that getting the best shave from this product was about technique as much as it was about the product.  I now shave every two and never more than three days, whereas before I could only manage to shave once a week. The floating heads of the Norelco allow me to painless shave over any razor bumps after I&#x27;ve lifted out any subcutaneous hairs.  What I have found is that hair on my beard is normally straight out on day two, resulting in a nice close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after nearly a month of using this product, I highly recommend it for any other black man who likes a close shave.  In my case it doesn&#x27;t eliminate razor bumps, but it also doesn&#x27;t make my face any worse.  In case it helps someone else here&#x27;s my shaving process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Buff an exfoliation pad to remove dry skin and lift some hairs.&lt;br /&gt;2. Using a sterilized safety pin, lift ingrown hairs out of the skin. Only pulling loose hairs with tweezers.  If a hair is lose it slides right out by the way.&lt;br /&gt;3. Wet my face and apply a thin film of shaving cream to serve as a skin lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;4. Shave by letting the razor glide over the skin, making circular motions, and avoid pushing the razor against the skin.&lt;br /&gt;5. Rinse the heads often with hot water and rinse clean when done, removing the head assembly so it will completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;6. Wash face and apply a shaving lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above steps are what works for me so I don&#x27;t expect it to work for everyone.  I do encourage you to give this product a serious try, especially if you are a professional black man.tweezers.  If a hair is lose it slides right out by the way.&lt;br /&gt;3.

            <li> I bought this electric razor for my husband as a Christmas gift and he loves it.  It is almost as smooth as a razor.  He says the more you use it the better it works, as it kinda conforms to your face.  I would recommend buying the stand for it because it is not included in the box.</li>
            <li> This razor does a close cut.  It does not pull a tough beard as some cheap dull bladed razors do.  It charged quickly the first times I used it. Was a close shave, short shave time-wise,  and not too noisy.Does not have the overall quality as the Norelco&#x27;s made in the Netherlands but for the money does quite well.</li>
            <li> Nice, pretty sharp - be careful</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few months now and I am happy with the product.  I always shave wet and this gives me what I need to get the job done quickly and without being cut up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t see the charge light until the very end is my only issue.  I wish I could see the constant battery life.  But it will give you one more shave or so at the point so it is ok unless you are out traveling.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about this purchase, but after trying it out &#x27;dry&#x27; shaving, I was pleasantly surprised.  Didn&#x27;t work that well in the shower , though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an electric (Norelco/Braun) user for 20+ years.  My 5841 XL just died after seven years of service.  Purchased the AT830 to replace it.  Love the Dual/Precision heads.  It gives a really close shave for an electric.  I shave dry.  Only thing I wish was better is the motor.  Seemed like it took many passes to do the job.  I think the electric razors of 15-20 years ago were better.  More metal, less plastic, and beefier motors.  Yes, less features. But it&#x27;s all about the shaving experience isn&#x27;t it??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have owned Norelcos for years so when my old one finally gave up the ghost, I went shopping for a new one. I much prefer the dual operation models (those that can run on either/both AC or battery power) as AC power gives the razor more juice but there are times and places where I need the cordless feature.  That said, the AT830 has a wonderful feature set and seemed to fit my requirements (the product description says &amp;#34;cord/cordless operation&amp;#34;) and the price was about what I have paid before for a high end model.  The unit came quickly, was packaged well and seemed to be a sturdy model.  The AT830 works well, however I quickly discovered it is only a CORDLESS model - in other words the AC cord that comes with it is only for recharging the battery, it will not power the razor.  In retrospect, I should have noticed that this is touted as being able to be used in the shower - you couldn&#x27;t do that with a model that is capable of AC operation.  After confirming via phone with Norelco that I indeed had a purely cordless model, I contacted Amazon and arranged for a return/refund.  Again, this is a decent razor but not if you want AC capability.  For those of you like me, I would recommend the PT 730 - essentially the same razor, but it can work on AC power - it just does not work with a wet shave (while using gel or foam) and you can not use it in the shower.  The PT730 is also much cheaper but looks and feel s the same.  I would recommend the AT830 for those of you looking for a wet/dry razor or if you want a strictly cordless unit - as I said, it is feature packed and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> For decades I was a Remington man, using my Remington electric about every other day, alternating with \\&quot;real\\&quot; shaves.  Some 30 years ago I tried a Norelco, and it just didn&#x27;t give me a close enough shave.  I tried a Braun, and it took off half of my face along with the whiskers.  My latest Remington got so it only lasted 3 shaves between charges after only 3 years of life.&lt;br /&gt;Then they ran a special on this AT830.  My first shave was closer than a \\&quot;real\\&quot; shave, with no discomfort and VERY quiet.  It holds its charge for over 3 weeks of daily shaves, can be used wet or dry, but shaving so close dry, why put up with the extra mess of a wet shave?&lt;br /&gt;Now I use this Norelco over 90% of the time, using a \\&quot;real\\&quot; razor only occasionally to touch up my sideburns.  NB--the Norelco does have a sideburn trimmer also.  Shake hands with the newest Norelco convert!</li>
            <li> I always used a Norelco, but my last rechargeable would only go 3 shaves at best. This one goes over a dozen. The shave is excellent and it only takes an hour to charge. What else do you want out of a shaver?</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband for Christmas because his old Norelco just didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cut it&amp;#34; any more.  He is very happy with this shaver. He wasn&#x27;t sure if he wanted a cordless-he thought it might not be as powerful as the corded one.  It gives him a very close shave, it&#x27;s quiet, and recharges quickly.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> I had been a Norelco user for many years but decided to try another brand, Remington, as a sale opportunity and in the belief that there was not a lot of difference in shavers in similar price ranges.  Well, I was extreemly wrong!  The Remington shaver was OK but it did not deliver a very confortable or efficient shave.  I decided I needed better and read through all the reviews for the different types of shavers.  This is one type of product that one type does not fit all so reviews can cloud the selection process as much as help. I was not a stright line shaver and never had a good experience with razor blades so I stayed with the rotary and decided against the foil razors.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy I decided on this razor and anyone that likes their rotary shaver now would love this one even more.  The noise level is a wisper, the shave is extreemly comfortable and the efficiency of the shave is fantastic. Compared to what I had before it is a &#x27;WOW&#x27; factor but I realize that I was using a poor brand so realistically I would say this is extreemly good.  If you use a rotary and like that type of shave experience then you will like this shaver even more! May not work for others as we are all different but this is the top shaver in my book!</li>
            <li> bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he loves it. it came on time and he always uses it so i guess he loves it haha would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I went for for months trying to decide which electric Razor to buy. When I finally decided the Philips Norelco was best for the Money I had another decision to make, which model? I finally selected the AT830. That was a good choice. It is the best electric Razor I have ever used. I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> this razor has a wonderful close shave and is easy to use. My husband loves it! And, of course , i do too since I&#x27;m not having his whiskers scrape me anymore!</li>
            <li> I bought Philips Norelco AT830 for my husband and he LOVES it so much! It leaves his face so nice and smooth.  Everytime he uses it he thanks me.  The delivery was on time, as promised, and in great condition.  Totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor.  Very close shave, water proof, lasts a long time on a single charge.  Very impressed.</li>
            <li> works well  I am a repeat customer with norelco shavers tried remmington  went  back  great shave  will buy another when needed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 Philips Norelco electric cordless razors during the last 14 months. Each of them worked for 6-8 months, then stopped working. These things should last for years, not months. Philips has been good about honoring their warranty, as they will now send me my 2nd free replacement. As far as the quality of the shave, it&#x27;s fairly good for me, as I have a thin beard. You still have to move it around a good bit to get all the hairs. Forget trying to use it on a sweaty face, as it sticks too much for that. Gotta be bone-dry skin (or a wet-type shave, like in the shower). Still, it&#x27;s nice to have a quick shave, tho it&#x27;s not quite as close as a modern safety razor with shaving cream. If my 3rd Philips Norelco breaks too, I&#x27;ll try another manufacturer next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  My third Philips Norelco Aquatec razor has now joined the first two among the ranks of the non-functioning. Now, when I press the \\&quot;On\\&quot; button, it runs for 1/2 a second, then stops. Doesn&#x27;t matter if I hold the button down or not. I tried recharging it, but that didn&#x27;t help. After 21 months, I&#x27;ve had 3 of these razors stop working on me. So, users can expect about 7 months of working before failure. I won&#x27;t bother contacting the manufacturer for a fourth one. It&#x27;s back to shaving cream and a blade for me. Sigh...</li>
            <li> This is a powerful and smooth razor. Great for the price especially. This should be able to cut any beard wet or dry.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razors for years. They always meet my expectations. xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx</li>
            <li> Does not trim as close as expected.  Would not recommend at this time.  Woould th;ink it would cut alot closer</li>
            <li> Ordered for my father to replace a very old Norelco Razor that needed new blades.  This upgraded him to a razor that can be cleaned under the bathroom faucet and also it has new blades so he now is getting a nice clean cut.</li>
            <li> My husband said this is the best electric shaver that I have ever gotten him (and I have bought several over the last 10 years.) After reading the other reviews, I have seen what a close shave this provides my husband, 0 pain or tugs and has a great battery life after charge. Would definitely recommend. (Also a great price)</li>
            <li> A washable electric razor, who would&#x27;ve thought! Needed it to replace a 10 or 15 year old Norelco on its last legs that I dropped.and came a-part. Review of features found this to be the most affordable model with a trimmer attached. Did not want to keep track of a separate trimmer and have to change it out with shaver blade. Shaves great, its a Norelco, duh! haven&#x27;t used anything else regularly for the 50 years I&#x27;ve been shaving.</li>
            <li> not what i EXPECTED DOES does not give a clean shave does leaves face with facial hairs and rough face</li>
            <li> Very pleased with it&#x27;s performance. Easy to maintain and use. I like the shape and the grip. I use it more than my manual razor.</li>
            <li> I think the price was very reasonable and it works great! what I like the most is that I can clean this with water so it is very easy to keep clean</li>
            <li> works a whole lot better than my old one.  For the price it is a good razor.  I enjoy its shave so far</li>
            <li> Never had an electric razor before. Do not mind shaving anymore. Shave more often. Takes minutes to shave. Will recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is good. It´s water resistant, quiet and it does what is supposed to do. But I miss my old Phillips which was loud, not recharchable, not resistant to water, but it was really fast shaving. I give 5 stars but they need to improve in the speed department.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband as a gift as he really wanted to try a wet/dry shaver in the shower.  It works wet or dry and holds a charge well, but the shave is not as close as he would like and has to go over the neck area with a regular shaver.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased this razor based on the reviews listed on this site. Shaver arrived as advertised and there were no surprises in packaging or shipping. After reading the directions, I charged the razor for the first time. After it was charged, I tried the razor and found that the motor turns very slowly. The razor was comfortable in my hand but I found it irritated my face quite a bit. I gave it 3 weeks but I continued to get road rash. I am very disappointed and would like to return it but the 30 day return policy has expired. I would not recommend this razor to anyone else.</li>
            <li> This shaver gets NO STARS, but I was forced to put something on the rating by Amazon! This was my first, and last rotary shaver. I&#x27;d been using Panasonic foil shavers for many years, never, ever had a problem with irritation. It was time for new blades on my old Panasonic, so I decided to shop for a new shaver and try this Norelco rotary shaver, what a mistake! After three different days of shaving with this my face was all beat up with severe irritation and even bleeding. My skin is sensitive, but I&#x27;d never experienced any problems using the Panasonic foil shavers. I returned this immediately and bought a new Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV Wet/Dry Shaver.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor and that the blades can be rinsed off even though it is an electric razor. Great birthday gift for him!</li>
            <li> The best razor, is among the top 5 in the world for sure. Beautiful unit, fast and meets expectations. Great !</li>
            <li> Norelco makes a top quality product and this is one of them.  It is a replacement for another Norelco razor that I have worn out. It shave great.</li>
            <li> Shaver works fine, I would however,  liked to have the option of a stand. Or at least be able to buy one.</li>
            <li> The razor shaves fairly decently.  I bought it for the purpose that it would be faster than with a normal razor.  This did not turn out to be true as it takes a fair bit longer to make sure I get all the hair with this razor.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver, giving the best shave I have ever experienced, wet or dry!  I have been shaving daily for over 50 yrs, wet and dry, electric and manual. It is comfortable, efficient, quick and quiet.  For the endlessly annoying neck stubble it is are-you-kidding-me amazing.</li>
            <li> The shaver is lightweight and very quiet.  It shaves fairly closely and though it left a rash the first few times I used it, my skin is growing accustomed to the blades so there now is very little irratation.  It cleans up easily and holds a charge for many uses.  I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> First one came missing the charge cord, Amazon replaced it within two days! I had an old Philips/Norelco for about 20 years and it finally gave out. This new model is wonderful, cuts well, cleans easy. I haven&#x27;t tried it for wet shaving and may never.</li>
            <li> Love the short charging time and the long lasting battery power. It does exactly what it says. Just a note : while using it wet , it would take me longer to shave rather than shaving with it dry. It is a very convinient  and effective product. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Where Amazon promotes this as Origin: Netherlands, the truth is this is NOT from the Netherlands, it&#x27;s a piece of MADE IN CHINA JUNK! The packaging doesn&#x27;t mention it, but get the razor out of the plastic and written right on the back is MADE IN CHINA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So BEWARE, Amazon is using FALSE ADVERTIZING to push this piece of crap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ever owned a REAL Norelco that was made in the Netherlands, after 10 seconds with this piece of crap and you will know the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed in Amazon for their blatant deception of the origin of this razor and absolutely HATE this piece of crap!</li>
            <li> Wanted shaver that was good for a black man. Didn&#x27;t work too well. Still had to use a razor to shave after using the shaver.</li>
            <li> So far it has been a great razor. Enjoy the shave. Easy to clean. Looking forward to it lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift so I only have their input: &amp;#34;I love It. It is much better than my old one.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing high end three head rotary electrics for over 20 years now, and this one has been by far, the best of the lot. Very gentle. I&#x27;ve used it for over a month now, and it just glides quietly and smoothly, never any razor burn, no matter how hard i grind, or how many passes I&#x27;ve made. I like my face to be as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt, and this is probably the closest I&#x27;ve ever got to that with any electric that I&#x27;ve ever owned..</li>
            <li> This is my 5th or 6th Norelco &amp; by far the best. Rinsing it out after use is much better than my last one that had to be cleaned manually. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I used a rotary razor many years ago but have been using a foil type razor for the past 30 years. I was not satisfied with my last razor, because it would always leave a few hairs uncut, and if I hadn&#x27;t shaved in a few days it would take me a long time to shave. So I thought I&#x27;d try a rotary razor again and bought the Norelco AT830. However, after using the razor I noticed that I had irritation marks on my neck. Plus, I still had trouble getting a close shave. It seemed that the foil shaver, even a cheap one, cuts closer and with less irritation than a rotary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since stopped using the Norelco AT830 and have just bought another foil type razor.</li>
            <li> Good, not great.  As with most razors it just does not do a good job on my neck.  I do like that you can clean with water.</li>
            <li> This the 3rd Norelco I have owned,  It works as expected.  The reason I only gave it three stars is because the other two Norelco razors came with a travel case and charging stand.  If I would have notice that it did not come with a travel case or charging stand, I would not have purchased it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco triple head shavers now for many years but this one gives me the closest and most comfortable shave of any of them (at least wet). The dry shave is about as good as my previous models but where this model really excels is in the shower with some shave gel/foam. It&#x27;s much more comfortable, near zero razor burn and is probably about as close as you can get (no pun intended) to a good blade setup. Cleanup is a breeze just push the button to flip open the top and rinse under running water, done. No more fiddling with little brushes and whisker dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads have both the traditional slots that Norelco has been using forever and also a section with little holes. I assume this is to mimick a foil shaver, perhaps give the best of both worlds. Quick charges in 1 hour, a nice feature over the traditional 8 hour charge cycles but one that is mandatory I think for a razor that can&#x27;t be used when plugged in (see comments below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LED indicators are an essential addition IMO for battery and charge status. It&#x27;s nice Norelco brought this back for their lower priced line as in previous product generations only the most high end shavers costing hundreds included indicator lights. And I&#x27;m glad they finally have moved their battery chemistry into the modern age of lipo batteries. So no more memory issues with NiCad or NiMh and lipo has better performance than either of those two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this razor is it can&#x27;t be used when plugged in for safety reasons I presume since it can be used in the shower. While I have no desire to be electrocuted, it means that once the batteries die in this unit you&#x27;ll either have to buy another shaver, or try to replace the batteries yourself which is a daunting task requiring disassembly, working with really small parts, soldering skills and breaking the water seal but it can be done. But with a 2-1/2 year warranty you should be covered and after that it&#x27;s probably time for a new one anyway.e anyway.</li>
            <li> Great product and very useful!!!</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he really likes it. He&#x27;s never been one to shave regularly with a regular razor, so his skin is not used to it and when he does it gets really irritated from it. So he would just trim it with with electric trimmers and never had a clean shave. This razor is perfect because it gives him the clean shave without all the irritation and inconvenience. He likes that it can be used with or without shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Works perfect, no complaints from me.  I use it to shave my head and face and I&#x27;ve had no troubles at all.</li>
            <li> The AT830 can be  as effective as a razor, with added benefit of no nicks; but it can&#x27;t be treated as if it was a razor: Men who might not feel they need to shave every day should do so anyway; short hair shave off more efficiently, (tho it does quite well with longer hair), &amp; forms somewhat of a powder that falls out of the shaver with a slight tap. Shaving every day is a much different situation with an electric: With no accumulative stress to the skin, no danger of cuts, no soap and water required, (often no mirror required), &amp; all the hairs going into the shaver, you can  shave while multi-tasking  or on the run. There&#x27;s simply no reason to  avoid shaving, even as often as twice a day. After all is said &amp; done, you&#x27;ll be clean-shaven more often than you&#x27;ve ever been before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a highly rated Panasonic triple blade foil razor the last five or so years, and I don&#x27;t remember it ever working as well as this. The AT830 is far quieter and more comfortable and I think does a better job than the foil razor ever did, either new or after replacing the foil and blades.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure this razor will be cheaper on replacement heads too, in that for the at830 they are 25-30 dollars, I think the replacements for the Panasonic were pretty close to 50, maybe 40.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty unhappy that none of the higher rated razors allow the use of the cord when shaving or are sold as corded only. I&#x27;m old enough to have owned corded razors when battery operated were rare, and it was a bit of a pain to keep them plugged in while shaving, but my experience with battery razors has been that they grow so weak they become almost unusable, and you have to buy a new entire razor when only blade replacement should be required.</li>
            <li> I have a son on chemo who has lost his hair and this razor has been a blessing both physically and emotionally. It&#x27;s smooth and quiet.</li>
            <li> Long battery life. Great build quality. Does not pull hairs like the remington I tried. Thought I would miss not having a charging stand, but the battery life is so long, that it does not matter.  Even though 1150X/46 is similar,  the AT830 feels better in the hand , has longer battery life, has a pop up trimmer and has room to be made with quality parts. (The drive parts on 1150X/46 are very small)</li>
            <li> I have used this series of Norelco shavers for more than a decade (or perhaps two or three).  I have also considered these shavers to be one of the best designed products I have seen--completely functional, reliable, and extraordinarily clean ergonomic design..........a design good enough to be in New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art product design collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only disappointment I had with my previous 3-5 year old Norelco was that I needed to replace the sealed shaver not because the rechargeable battery was getting tired but rather that the on/off switch became erratic sometimes working, other times not....and even turning itself on once or twice.</li>
            <li> Been using almost a year now.&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco shaver holds a charge well, and provides a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Works great in the shower. I suggest using shaving cream, makes shave much smoother. Very easy to clean and very quite.</li>
            <li> I have used Philips for over 45 years and will not change for any other brand&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for asking my opinion&lt;br /&gt;Roberto Mattatia&lt;br /&gt;Caracas&lt;br /&gt;Venezuela</li>
            <li> I have had several Norelco shavers over the years. The last one, eight years old, still works but the battery just does not last as long as it use to. I really liked my last one, an purchased this model. Not much difference between the two, accept fof the head design to pick up longer hair. It seems to me, I have to work a little more to get a closer shave with the new head design, but over all it will give years of service, and a close shave with a little bit more skin stretching.</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver for my husband, and of course, he decided to grow a beard.  However, he does use it for under the chin area, and is pleased with the performance.  Not much else to say, it is a man&#x27;s shaver, so has long as husband is happy with it, then I am happy.  Now if he would actually start shaving his entire face, this would make me even happier.</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift for my brother and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new rechargeable razor. If he needed to, he would definitely purchase this razor again.  We order so many things from Amazon that I would just like to tell them \\&quot;thank you!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I purchased the Norelco AT830 about a week ago.  I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet.  I have used both Braun and Noreclo products since I started shaving as blades cut me and caused skin irritation.  This shaver is excellent.  I&#x27;ve only used it in dry mode and find it to be fast, comfortable and incredibly close.  It&#x27;s also easy to hold.  Try it and you&#x27;ll see it provides a great shave day in and day out and the cost over time[[ASIN:B006GQYSGE Philips Norelco AT830 PowerTouch Rechargeable Cordless Razor, Gray/Silver/Black]] is minimal. Also, I ordered from Amazon and got free shipping with shaver deleivered in two work days.  Amazon had best price and I trust them!</li>
            <li> Very quiet yet amazingly efficient at shaving my beard.  Only issue is that the transformer is not in the shaver itself but part of the cord that has to be carried with you if you leave on a long trip.  Great piece of toiletry for anyone, man or women.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a  timely manner and work perfectly. Just a described and a great deal.</li>
            <li> I have one, and bought one for a xmas gift.  Love the product and would recommend.</li>
            <li> Shaves nice and close.Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> The razor does not give a close shave.  I  get a razor burn on my throat.  Many times  I have to follow; up my shave with a conventional soap and razor bladed utensil</li>
            <li> The old Norelco razor he had was about 30 years old! Love the Norelco products! Glad I decided to get it for him this year for Christmas!</li>
            <li> smooth shave, easy to clean, great price</li>
            <li> This razor exceeds my expectant results.  I have used battery powered and electric razors off and on for the last 50 years and at LONG last I find one that works right for me!  I have tried it with and without jell, wet or dry.  It even gets the ear, nose hair, and the hair just above the ears.  When I shave I shave my face and head.  It gets as close as one of the new blade types.</li>
            <li> to be truthful I had one a really long time ago pack it away when I found it. It would not hold a charge and it would not shave very good so I bough a new one and I really like it. For the life of me I do not know way I put up with shaving. When this stops I will get another one.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this razor so far.  This razor shaves very close and is comparable to a straight edge shave....left my face very smooth.  I just bought it so we will so how long it lasts until I have to replace the blades, but very satisfied for now.</li>
            <li> Razor works fine and is much lighter and quieter than the one it replaced.  So as far as functionality goes it would rate a 5.  Wish it had a more robust charging indicator (waits till only 5 minutes left before notifying) and came with a stand.  Wound up using the plastic one from my old Norelco - not a perfect fit though. C&#x27;mon Norelco - it can&#x27;t cost more than a few pennies.  Hence the 4.</li>
            <li> Tiring of the blade, I purchased this razor a few months ago and am glad I did. I have used Norelcos at various times over the years, and this one did not disappoint. No, it&#x27;s not as close for me as using a blade (which I did for the last 10-12 years). But it&#x27;s much quicker and comparatively hassle-free, not to mention nick-free. I frequently skip a day and even with a two-day beard, this Norelco does the job. I especially like the fact that it is water proof and I usually use a gel on my wet face before shaving... then just rinse the Norelco clean. Battery life is good; I usually charge it once a week. It&#x27;s fairly quiet and fits well in the hand. My skin adjusted to the Norelco very quickly; no rashes, bumps or red spots. My only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; if you will is it is very light which gives the impression that it is cheap. It certainly isn&#x27;t as heavy or \\&quot;solid\\&quot; feeling as my previous Norelcos. But it does the job and if I get a couple years&#x27; use out of it, I&#x27;ll be happy. BTW, I purchased Eltron Shaver Cleaner [[ASIN:B0025ILLXA Eltron (Parks) Shaver Cleaner for all Electric Shavers]] and it&#x27;s an excellent product. For the best shave and system longevity, gotta keep those blades clean and lubricated!</li>
            <li> Produces more heat. Not sure if its a defect of this item. Anybody encountered same issues?&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item brand new and found that it creates more heat in few minutes of it use.</li>
            <li> I have always used Norelco shavers. I just prefer rotary shavers, mainly because they are quieter than foil shavers. I once actually cut myself with a Panasonic foil shaver!  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This AT830 is similar to previous generations of Norelcos, but is better in some ways. It&#x27;s even quieter than they used to be, is lighter, and is narrower and fits better in your hand. It also has the newer kind of battery which doesn&#x27;t require an initial 12 hour charge, and I think can be charged before it&#x27;s fully discharged without harming it. Cleanup is a quick and simple rinse under hot water, no fussing with cumbersome cleaners and expensive cleaning solution refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself is smooth and even, although not as close as a blade of course. I haven&#x27;t had it that long, so durability of the motor, battery, etc. is still an unknown. But given that it is comfortable, quiet, pleasant to use, simple to clean, reasonably inexpensive, and gives a quick and decent shave, I would say that this is a good shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the \\&quot;Philips Norelco AT830\\&quot; for a few months, and it was purchased as a replacement for an earlier model which I thoroughly enjoyed using. It&#x27;s exactly what I expected and I&#x27;ve had no issues with this model that would cause me to replace it. I find the cost reasonable as it&#x27;s predecessor lasted a long while and I&#x27;ve every reason to expect the same from this unit. It keeps a charge for a reasonable amount of time and after having dropped it, obviously accidentally, from a height of about 4 ft. it was unscathed. I&#x27;ve two reasons for having given 4 stars rather than 5, though, and they&#x27;re the same as I had with the earlier model: I find replacement heads are expensive and even though I&#x27;ve a light beard I sometimes do have to go over a spot repeatedly. All told though I&#x27;m happy with this particular razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my grandpa since his shaver is broken. He likes it very much and the shaver is really a decent one. It is comfortable and cool, battery last really long. Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Hubby has had a Norelco Razor for many years.  I think this is his 4th Norelco.  He wanted one that was fast charging and he likes the shave he gets.. I took his old one which still works perfectly to shave my legs... and ladies..you should give it a try..&lt;br /&gt;cordless and nick free is better than in the shower, not QUITE as close a shave as the Venus ladies razor but good enough and a lot faster.. Now I will have to order another set of the Norelco razor heads to use in the old Razor for myself..  Goobye Epilady !!</li>
            <li> I have had other Norelco shavers in the past and they all were very good.  This model has the heads that adjust better to follow the curves of my face.  It is very comfortable to use .  It seems to hold a charge longer than my past models and charges fairly quickly.  The only drawback was that it did not come with any type of storage case.  I can only imagine that Norelco is trying to hold down the price, but an extra couple of dollars for a case would be nice.  Other that that, I would by another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gene</li>
            <li> great product, great price, on-time delivery, would recommend this to anyone. bought it for a gift and it was a hit. sleek design, lightweight, no clunky charging stand to clutter the bathroom, just a plug.</li>
            <li> this is a 4th Norelco triple head shaver. the old ones never died i just wanted new ones. but this new shaver is the best so far! it gives me the closest shave of any of others.</li>
            <li> The only down side of this shaver is that it cannot be used while being charged  ie  plugged in.  The tilting head is very nice though for around the neck.</li>
            <li> In some respects, the more Norelco shavers change, the more they stay the same. They all still use the same basic rotary blade sets...because they work really well. What has changed is:&lt;br /&gt;1. How they get power (a battery).&lt;br /&gt;2. What else you can do with them (shave in the shower and/or with shaving gel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery power is a great convenience, but only if the battery lasts a long time and is easy to charge. I bought this model because it strikes the best balance of shaving/charging time to price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco charges in less than an hour and the charge goes for two weeks, at least when the shaver is new. The other feature that I like, but haven&#x27;t been able to confirm from the manual, is that the razor seems to cut off charging automatically when its fully charged. If you don&#x27;t overcharge the battery it lasts longer and you&#x27;ll be happier. Automatic shut-off is one more thing in life that you don&#x27;t have to pay attention to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this model because I was intrigued by the tilting shave head. I&#x27;m not convinced it was worth the additional $10 over the next lower model. Both have the same battery and the same shave/charge characteristiscs that are most important to me. The tilting head might help, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that it gives me a better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco wants you to replace the rotary blade sets every year. In my experience, that&#x27;s not necessary. Rinse the head from the inside out a couple times a week. Take the rotary cutters out of the head a couple times a year, soak them in alcohol, then put them back in, making sure that you put the cutters back in the same screens. You&#x27;ll get a good shave for three years or more. The battery will wear out before the blades do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet shaving? Gel? Why? If I wanted a wet shave, I&#x27;d use a blade. But it is nice to have a water-resistant shaver that you can wash vigorously without having to worry about drowning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note about all types of shavers and razors.Every time you switch from one to another, it takes a week or two for your skin to adjust. Use face cream until you break in your face. Yeah, that&#x27;s what I meant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for years. They just work.</li>
            <li> My prior norelcos were whisper quiet. This one does the job well, and the battery lasts quite a while, but it is relatively noisy.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with this razor. It takes twice as long to shave than with a standard razor, I have to constantly go back over areas due to missed facial hair, and ...at least to me the shave isn&#x27;t that close. If I could do it over again, I&#x27;d probably look at other razors.</li>
            <li> Shaves well and extremely smoothly.  The battery takes several hours to charge but is worth the time because they last forever.</li>
            <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t cut hair in a timely fashion.  You have to keep moving the razor over the skin surface many, many times before the hair probably just gives up and falls off.  I&#x27;ve been using electrical razors for over 30 years and have never had one with such poor cutting capability.  I don&#x27;t know if this was just a bad set of blades or poor design of the razor.  I tried the razor on dry skin, wet skin, skin with gel, skin with soap and the cutting experience never improved.  I&#x27;ve had the razor for over 4 months and the blades have not improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed as I have never had a Norelco razor that did not perform admirably.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good shaver, I love the way it cuts my face hair and even is perfect to shave head, but  if you want razor last for a very long time be careful to don&#x27;t use it at shower time because even the manufacturer say that razor is perfectly sealed and ready to use it in contact with the shower water it will got filtration&#x27;s inside the circuits and will fail due to short circuit.  Mine stop working and refuses to charge and when I open it found water inside. I do never submerge it under water, I do always use the shower to rinse it with the necessary amount of water to clean it. The fact is that water always find a way to get into, so is better to be careful with it.</li>
            <li> Good shave.  Runs quiet and stays charged for a long time; maybe a month.  Can shave wet, dry, with lotion or in the shower.  Super convenient.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor. It works great only takes me a couple on minutes to shave. It pay for itself by not have to keep buying razor blades that are not cheap. I would recommend people that are thinking about one. Very Satisfied with the purchase</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews, good and bad, I went against my better judgement and placed an order for this razor. After turning it on, I knew right away that it was not going to be powerful enough based on the sound the blades were making. They sounded like they were not spinning fast enough for a proper shave. I figured I would try and see what happened, after all, what&#x27;s the worst that could happen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after putting on shaving cream, I went at it. I tried the recommended circular motions. Round and round I went, with little to no hairs actually being removed from skin. After about 10 minutes the face was done, and then I started on the neck. Another 10 minutes, and there were still hairs that would just not come off. I had to switch back to my old razor to finish the job. Afterwards, my whole neck was sore and raw from razor burn, and there were bumps everywhere. Seriously, for a company that makes electric razors, they sure do a piss poor job of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m convince most of the positive reviews are fake, because there is no way most people could possibly be happy with this razor. Needless to say, this is going back to Amazon for a refund. I will buy what I should have bought in the first place, the Braun Series 7.</li>
            <li> My husband was very pleased with this gift.  He says it is smooth and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went with the AT830 instead of the AT810 as someone else had suggested and am glad I did as this seems to be a great razor according to my husband.</li>
            <li> Smooth and easy / holds a charge for a long time.  Mine is about a year old and no complaints.</li>
            <li> After reading a few good and bad reviews I ended selecting this for a Christmas gift and now I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;I had an older norelco shaver so this wasn&#x27;t a total ly new experience.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver works real well for me, although I do end having to go over the same area more than once.&lt;br /&gt;I shave without wetting my face or using any cream.&lt;br /&gt;The fit is right and normal as far as it goes.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is smooth and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I love it that I can clean it pretty much right away. Although I&#x27;m still fighting the release button from time to time.&lt;br /&gt;The charge doesn&#x27;t last all that more than the older one I had -from specs it needs to be recharged for every hour of use or so. I&#x27;m ok with that.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it cuts as efficiently as it should but am not sure if it&#x27;s the way I use it or the way it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a decent shaver and as far as I&#x27;m concerned, easy to get used to if you have used one before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased enough with it that I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely LOVES this shaver! Came in right in time for Father&#x27;s Day and he used it that morning.. he usually had to shave every day with his old shaver, but for this one, he&#x27;s been able to go up to 2-3 days before even looking like he had a 5&#x27;oclock shadow. He felt it was ergonomically easier to hold and the close shave is super nice! We hope this lasts him a while, so stick around for a 2nd review to see how it performs later :)</li>
            <li> The razor is very good, but don&#x27;t bother replying to the email you will get from Philips Norelco asking you to review the razor on their website after you register it. I spent a fair amount of time writing a very complimentary review and had it rejected by them for no apparent reason. I just hope that is not an indication of poor customer service I may expect to get if I have any issues with the product.</li>
            <li> My first electric razor.  Disappointed in the performance.  Any sort of a heavy bead it slows way down.  That forever to get smooth face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for decades and have a number of older models in a drawer in the bathroom. I&#x27;ve noted a steady decline in the quality and closeness of the shave delivered by newer models but, nevertheless, decided to try the AT830 and wet shaving. When I received the shaver, I was initially pleased with the closeness of the shave that could be achieved using it with gel.  Unfortunately, the shaver ceased working 64 days later, conveniently outside of the 45 day money-back guarantee period. Despite having been a loyal customer in the past, my perception is the Philips Norelco are no longer producing a quality product. I will be looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Great razor, great price, I have used norelco for 30 years. Had a speed xl but broke it when I dropped it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he has very sensitive skin and he loves it. He can finally get the close shave he wants AND stay on top of it without getting a rash. :)</li>
            <li> It left a lot of hairs not shaved and still gave me razor burn. So, for me at least, it did not work well. I&#x27;d rather use a regular razor that cuts all the hair with the same amount of razor burn.</li>
            <li> I have been using Philips electric shavers for ages now. I finally decided to get rid of my old one (approximately 18 years old and still working flawlessly as the first day) and go for Norelco Powertouch.&lt;br /&gt;What a revelation!&lt;br /&gt;Philips company made huge steps forward. Although the design is somewhat unchanged the most important thing that saw real progress is the shaving heads. The machine is really quiet and produces close shave without irritation of skin. My neck skin is really sensitive but with this electric razor I have no problems what so ever. Be warned that you cannot use it for shaving while plugged in. This is for security reasons as you can use it while taking a shower too.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for a great price. Recommend it!</li>
            <li> This electric shaver really shocked me. I&#x27;ve never had an electric shaver that gives as close a shave as this one. Its comfortable, ergonomically and on your skin. In the past I&#x27;ve always had to shave with an electric, then clean up the stray hairs with a razor. I&#x27;m happy to say for the first time I haven&#x27;t had to do that with this product. I&#x27;m a guy that grows a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow in about 24 hours, so shaving is a must for me. Would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> It to hard to clean.  You must take apart to clean and it is way to hard to put back together.  Running water over the heads will not do it.</li>
            <li> a very nice close cut and no pulling.  Easy to use; easy to clean; and quiet.  I have not used this with shave cream yet.  Just as a dry razor.  I would not want anything else.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase. There is a significant technological leap from my latest shaver. Very quiet and shaves very well.</li>
            <li> I bought it mainly for the sideburn trimer, and that works reasonably well.  I have a full beard, so I only shave with the shaver on the sides of my cheeks to get rid of the few straggler hairs outside of the main beard.  It does that just fine.  It is amazingly quiet, and I can hardly tell it is working, as there is no effect at all on my skin, but like magic the beard hairs are gone after a swipe or two with the shaver.  So far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband. He is very particular, and really love this razor. He would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband,Jay, Won&#x27;t quit raving about the Phillips AT830--It shaves so quickly and smoothly. It is so easy to keep clean</li>
            <li> Great first couple shaves, not sure if worth the money over the model below it but the pivots on each head are nice for around the neck. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like a foil shaver did, it shaves close but not too close.&lt;br /&gt;I have curly hair so rottery is the only way to go to avoid ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> My 18 year old twin boys LOVE their new razors!!! They picked these particular models, they researched multiple brands and picked these!</li>
            <li> Wished it came with a holder to keep the head down after u rinse it.&lt;br /&gt;Does a good job in the shower.</li>
            <li> After using this razor for two months I have concluded that it does not cut hair well. There is long stubble all over my face. Older Norelco razors worked better.</li>
            <li> In the short time that I have been using this product, I find it to be almost as close a shave as a straight razor.  I am quite satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I have used Remington electric razor my whole life and thought they were good but was fed up with the last one so I tried this Norelco AT830 and was amazed. It shaves just as close as a blade, no joke. The wet shave feature is great. works like a razor should. smooth, clean non iritating shaves.</li>
            <li> This is a good, solid razor that gives a good shave. It feels a bit bulky when I use it, especially compared to the top-of-the-line Norelco model that we also have. So this is more a middle-range, workhouse model without the elegance and style of the other razor. Still, it works fine. The actual shave seems just as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One complaint. The trimmer that pops out from the side of the razor seems to be broken. While I can see the parts moving, they do not trim. That&#x27;s a shame, because the trimmer helps in shaving under my nose and in a couple of other areas where the normal heads will not reach. It was handy to have.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco AT830/41 PowerTouch con Aquatec Eléctrico Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much, for this product, I am very gladd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God Bless you</li>
            <li> First impression was light and cheap.. &amp;#34;not like they used to be&amp;#34;. But it works great. Don&#x27;t worry about the need to clean manually. It&#x27;s very easy..flip open top and rinse. Looks like a nice water tight mechanism, without the possibility of little hairs getting EVERYWHERE on the inside (as happened in my Remington with a cleaning base)</li>
            <li> This is an OK razor.  It gives a pretty close shave and has a functional sideburn trimmer.  My main beef against this unit is the power cord.  The plug on this beast has a big assembly around it so that for closely spaced electrical sockets it blocks the sockets on either side.  Very poor and thoughtless design.  My earlier model Norelco did not do this and instead had only a normal electrical plug, which fact I very much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other significant design flaws.  You cannot use the razor while it charges, which is idiotic.  Further, the on-off switch is positioned such that there is a tendency to turn the razor off while holding and using it.  Other Norelcos that I have owned did not have any of these significant design flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor does not come with any kind of little carrying case for trips.  Cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, I would not have bought this model had I known about this poor design.  Not recommended.  RJB.</li>
            <li> Replaced my old (really old, about 25 years) Norelco with the Philips Norelco Powertouch with Aquatec Electric Razor AT830/41. Decided on it over the more expensive models based on some poor reviews on the others. The AT830 got really good reviews about reliability over the newer, more expensive Norelco models so I hope they prove  true in the long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I made the switch because the AT830 is proving to be a great investment.  Really quiet and smooth shaving (almost needed earplugs with the 25 year old Norelco). I like the fact that the AT830 is water resistant so I can rinse it clean without a problem.  So far the shaves have been fast, quiet and smooth and the clean-up of the razor a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price at Amazon was the best found after considerable effort shopping around.  As usual, Amazon service was flawless and I&#x27;d recommend you check them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll get another 25 years out of the AT830 but for now it&#x27;s my shaving choice for sure.</li>
            <li> This razor gives me a nice, close shave without any skin irritation, and did so right out of the box.  It performs as advertised, in my opinion, both dry and wet.  It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to clean, pretty quiet, and I haven&#x27;t noticed the whisker pull that a few guys have mentioned.  The battery seems to charge quickly, and although I haven&#x27;t tried to see how many shaves I can get out of one charge, I generally shave 4-6 times before I put it back on the charger and haven&#x27;t noticed any drop-off in motor speed or cutting performance toward the fifth or sixth use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it ends up lasting as long as other Norelco&#x27;s I&#x27;ve owned, it&#x27;s definitely a bargain at this price.</li>
            <li> The razor will work fine, and you will be pleased, UNTIL tha battery dies. When this happens (always after the warranty), you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REPLACE THE RECHARGABLE BATTERY. They make it virtually impossible to open, don&#x27;t give any discription of it&#x27;s power or type, and must be broken from the soldered one, and the new one resoldered in. Repair places are far and few between, and even if you do find one, it&#x27;s almost as much to \\&quot;repair\\&quot; as purchasinga new unit. Phillips does this on their Sonic toothbrushes as well, so just devide your cost of so many uses by the cost of the unit and you will find it an extremely overpriced way to shave. The whole razor is dependent on the battery, which is worth about $18. How do they manage to get away with this, without even a label on the package telling people that batteries aren&#x27;t really replaceable amazes me.</li>
            <li> I haved used Norelco Electric Shavers for about fifteen years. I purchase a new unit about every two years. The shave has always been a comprise when compared to a blade, to my suprise not any more. This is the first Aquatec I ever purchased. I used a small amount of Edge Gel, flip open top, wet cutters with warm water and you will get a smooth close shave, when gel or face begins to dry, just flip open top and wet cutters again. I rinse unit and leave top open so it can dry faster. Apply a face lotion for a blade shave feel. I purchased another unit for my son.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mid range price and this is my third Norelco razor in 30 years.  Yes they last a long time, cut your beard short and tight and clean up with water.  Being able to wash the whiskers off with water allows for a very clean razor when you shave the next day.  This razor charges in about 1 hour and you can partially charge it, say for 10 minutes and have several minutes of shave time.  A full charge allows 50 minutes of shaving time or about 10 shaves.  You could charge it fully and take it on a week long trip without the charger to save weight, though the charger is very small.</li>
            <li> Yeah, i need some heads but great shaver. :)</li>
            <li> I use it every day, but there are so many models, it&#x27;s hard to choose one.  I&#x27;m getting a good shave without lots of extras.</li>
            <li> Ease of use, good.  Keeps a charge for a long time.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as good as they used to.</li>
            <li> I gave this razor to my husband and am very pleased with the results.  After years and years of using a straight edge razor, shaving cream etc. he skin was getting too sensitive and easily cut....so we opted to try this.  No more cuts for him and his skin is so soft after a shave.</li>
            <li> I got this thinking it would save me time in the morning.  I used it in the shower and it actually takes me more time to use this than a regular razor.  I stuck with it for 3 months before going back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this several years and it works well. Just replaced the blades after several years - shaves like new again.</li>
            <li> this razor was just what I wanted. I did some research before buying this particular model and it works fine</li>
            <li> B ought this as a birthday gift for our son. He said it tore up his face, he gave his away, 8</li>
            <li> Been using aquatic type shaver for years always like it , I use it with electric shave ,gel or foam it&#x27;s good .</li>
            <li> Works well. Not perfect, but well. Might need to get used to it, I have to go several times on same spot at some parts.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but it seems to take me longer to shave. It does not feel like it has the power of the razor I had a few years ago. That was Norelco also and lasted 20 years, but it was not a 3 headed one like this. My previous one from a year ago (Not Norelco) lasted less than a year.</li>
            <li> I used Norelco&#x27;s cheapest model for several years using the same blades and I shave everyday. Last Christmas I thought I&#x27;d splurge and get a &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; one that would work in the water. I live in a hot climate and shaving when you&#x27;re sweaty or wet is difficult. I thought this would help. It didn&#x27;t. In fact, even when my face is dry and I&#x27;m in a cool place, my old cheap Norelco did a better shave than this one. I have to go over the same spot more often with this one. I&#x27;m not sure why but when this one wears out I&#x27;ll definitely go back to buying a cheapo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all of that, the battery life on this thing is fantastic.</li>
            <li> When my old Norelco was put to rest, I bought this newer model. The closeness of shave was like a new day in the life of my stubble. Easy, smooth, fast shave. No longer needing to shave daily, I get away easily with charging it about once a week, or less.</li>
            <li> I have lost count on how many Norelco shavers I have owned over the last 30+ years.&lt;br /&gt;This one is the best yet!  Now if I could only purchase a charging stand and a travel case, it would be a PERFECT shaver.</li>
            <li> Works like it said it would. I&#x27;m happy/ I use it every day. It was as good as it was promised</li>
            <li> Was purchased as a gift; recipient was very satisfied with product. Based on that I ordered another as a gift.</li>
            <li> Shaves as well as the much moe expensive 1290X/46 that I recently purchased.  This one is MUCH easier to clean.</li>
            <li> I can;t shave while it&#x27;s plugged in.</li>
            <li> It performs as expected for an electric razor. The price was fair and delivery was great.  I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Bought a couple of months ago.  Religiously followed all instructions.  Kept charged, cleaned every day, shaved in exactly in the manner as told to in the instructions.  Gave it 6 weeks to &amp;#34;get used to&amp;#34; my beard.  Worst shave I ever had.  Nearly worthless on the neck and chin.  I you are already a Norelco user and that brand works for you, fine.  If you are used to a foil type shaver you may not care for this at all.  Just my personal opinion.  Bought a Panasonic foil.  No comparison as to shave quality.  This Norelco will sit in the back of a medicine cabinet until I need it in an emergency.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice shaver. Had an older model and needed a new one.  Shaves great!</li>
            <li> IT shaves really close which is wonderful and my face is fantastically smooth, I gave it a four star rating though because had no stand in it so have to lay it down on my soap dish, and it has left some razor burn that has been unpleasant, but I think that&#x27;s partly my learning curve with it.  Overall I highly recomend.</li>
            <li> If the shaver is plugged in it will not work. It took me 5 minutes to figure out why they spent extra money to cripple their own product: When the battery (which you cannot replace) stops holding a charge, you cannot continue to use the shaver by keeping it plugged in. You MUST buy a whole new unit.&lt;br /&gt;Sly!  Planned obsolescence is one thing, sabotage is another.&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy another Norelco product.  They got me once, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Razor gives a great, smooth shave.  It is very easy to clean.  Great feature.  Best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly.  The battery charge seems to last forever.  My only mistake was not buying the model with a base.</li>
            <li> The noise from motor is ok to use. I don&#x27;t have to care about the water when using it. The build is solid and fit, no water can go through it. Nice to have.</li>
            <li> The Norelco AT830 works fine. Getting a close shave. When I received it, the &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; for the razor was not included and had to devise something to have the razor remain in the proper position. I contacted their customer service department and was told I should receive it in 7-10 days. I consider this unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, their &amp;#34;instructions&amp;#34; were overly complicated and way too detailed.I wrote specifications for nuclear power plants and they were easier to understand than the AT830 instructions!</li>
            <li> Ordered item on Saturday 9PM and received it on Monday 10AM. Looks like Santa&#x27;s elves are working weekends.&lt;br /&gt;Replaced a 8 year old Norelco 7885XL and this model works great. Very quiet and provides a quick shave. Looking forward to using both wet and drive shaving.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I miss is the digital display on the older model. I would definitely recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Came super fast! My boyfriend loves it, works great. I am very pleased with this product. Everything is just as advertised</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my old Norelco  razor that was not holding its charge. Shaves just as good. A little quieter and I love the long lasting Li-Ion battery that does not fade like the old Nicad battery. The smart pivot feature is ok, but not worth the extra cost. Being able to rinse the head after shaving is very nice feature, keeping the razor always clean.</li>
            <li> This would be my Christmas gift for my husband, it does arrive on time, but it was total wrong item. My electric razor become two LED spotlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you imagine the feeling when my husband opens the package. It total ruins our Friday evening!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so upset with this and with amazon!!!!!!!!! And it is not the first time I had such an unpleasant experience with Amazon!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Thought it would work better, name brand and the cost of it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my boyfriend. This is exactly the one he wanted. I will have to wait till after Christmas to see how he likes using the electric razor. But as far as delivery and packaging, everything was perfect.</li>
            <li> The razor really rates a five.  I downgraded the razor to a four because the razor should have come with a container of some sorts that would allow it to travel in a shaving kit without the heads becoming exposed to damage.  As it is, the removable head cover comes off the heads too easily exposing the heads to rub against other objects in a shaving kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The processing and delivery of the order rates a five.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for an earlier model that I left in a motel room, and the old model didn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;tilting&amp;#34; face.  Have only used this new one for a couple of days, but the quality still seems to be there, I swear by Norelco.  (I currently have a beard, so I use it for trimming, for getting cheeks and neck areas clean, and touching up here and there the errant whisker that&#x27;s sticking out.  This and the scissors make beard maintenance easy.</li>
            <li> Much approved over my last Norelco electric razor which did an adequate job.  This razor gives me a closer, smoother shave.  I have sensitive skin and I dry shave.  It takes a good electric razor to do the job without causing skin problems.  This razor does the job and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Did not come with a stand and the charger cord is not the coiled variety.  I expected more from Norelco.  Razor is OK but not the quality of my old one.</li>
            <li> He loves it, especially the fact that it can be rinsed out and that it charges so easily and quickly.</li>
            <li> My husband replaced his old Norelco that he had for 10 years with this model.  He is very happy with it so far.  He said the way it pivots on his face is a big improvement over his old razor.</li>
            <li> Great Razor, finally after buying 2 prior to this one,  I got a thumbs up.  I bought it for my son and he loves it.  Gives him a nice clean shave and he likes the fact that he can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> The only reason I replaced my old Norelco was because I had to recharge the battery everyday. It still delivered a great shave and had been trouble free from the start. I don&#x27;t know how old the shaver was but it worked flawlessly for many years. I got the AT830 as a Xmas gift from my wife and was real excited until after the first shave. It did not shave as close as I like and when I pushed harder it irritated my skin. My wife said to give it a chance, so for a week I did. No change, same results. I guess if you&#x27;ve  never had an electric that delivered a close shave year after year then the AT830 would be acceptable. I just expected better.</li>
            <li> Norelco is a reliable company that always comes through with great producst.  I have no complaints with this one either.</li>
            <li> My husband was very pleased with his new razor for Christmas.  He has used Phillips Norelco Razors for a long time.  In fact he has gone through about 5 of the onver the years and he said he thinks this is the best one yet.</li>
            <li> The Norelco gives a better shave than the Braun hands down. I would give this 5  stars. However the blades need replacement&lt;br /&gt;much sooner than recommended by the manufacturer. They state yearly, but its more like quarterly.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a few months now. Gives me a smooth shave every morning. Charge has lasted me about 10 -12 days. Wish it came with a travel case.</li>
            <li> All of the other material that I purchased was as good as any I could purchase in a local store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill Blanton</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Phillips Norelco for a month now. It replaced the more expensive Phillips Norelco that had just quit one morning after 2 years. I am very happy with this model as it leaves a very smooth skin, is light weight, and fits the hand like an old friend. I would highly recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> After suffering for 4 years with a Philips Norelco Arcitec (where you had to clean the heads with a pair of tweasers until you finally just bought an expensive head-replacement), I researched online until i found this one.  It works like a charm, and you can take apart the heads to clean them when you need to.</li>
            <li> I have owned a Norelco before but went to blades years ago.  I wanted this product to supplement a razor shave on days when a close shave is not real critical.  It works well for a cordless but it will never shave as close as a blade.  It&#x27;s great for days when I just want a quick shave and closeness is not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I replaced an older version of this shaver.  It&#x27;s OK, but not as good as I thought it would be.  I figured there had to be some advances in the last few years, but there don&#x27;t seem to be many.  The razor is somewhat noisier than my old one.  Might be due to what seems to be a more powerful motor.  The shave is relatively smooth, but not as smooth as a foil shaver.  As far as the price point, I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> After using Norelco razors in the past I decided to stay with Norelco when purchasing a new razor August 31,2012.  I have been very disappointed with this razor and wish I had bought a Braun or just kept shaving with a blade razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Norelco doesn&#x27;t cut the mustard (or whiskers) like my previous Norelco&#x27;s did.  I have waited at least 7 weeks for my whiskers to adjust to an electric razor again but it still will not give a close shave.  I have used it with Williams Electric Shave, shaving cream (what a mess), and nothing at all and had the same results-a not close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what Phillips did after they bought out Norelco but they need to make some changes to get this razor up to the old Norelco standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this razor to anyone.</li>
            <li> The best shaver I&#x27;ve owned to date. I owned a Braun series 5 that shaved close, but the shave was not comfortable. This is very comfortable on your face, and no more clean and renew solution to buy, this cleans up under the fawcet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I love me new razor. No more buying replacement blades every 2 months. This has give me a much closer shave versus my Fusion razor. I love it because I may use it with shaving cream or dry. It gives me a great shave either way. I&#x27;m African-American and I&#x27;ve had problems with shaving bumps. This has helped me bumps tremendously.</li>
            <li> Quite satisfactory but not quite as good as a sharp razor blade though far less chance of drawing blood.</li>
            <li> I can best answer this when I have had more time to use and read. I have not been able to use them to a great extent</li>
            <li> I wanted a new Norelco that didn&#x27;t break the bank and still gave me a close shave.  This one fit the bill very nicely.  I also love that I can use it in the shower and my wife loves how my face feels when I use it.  Clean up is easy and I was glad that this model also had the trimmer on it...</li>
            <li> i have purchased about a year ago a Phillips Norelco shaver that you could wash under the faucet, but you were not suppossed to actually shave in the shower, it did a good job, but i still wanted to be able to shave under the shower, after that i bought a panasonic triple head shaver (non rotary) wet/dry type, and gave the other one away to a neighbor, and regreted it a lot!! the panasonic one was uncomfortable, it became hot after a minute of use (because of the friction) and the shaving wasnt even that good, recently I decided to buy yet another one, and since I missed the norelco so badly, i decided to get another onbe, this time a really wet/dry type, it was even better that the first norelco, smooth shave, almost razor-like, very low noise (i cant stand noise in the morning), better wet than dry but both VERY good... I will update later, since i just used it today.. but totally recommended!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:9 months later.. still awesome.. stop reading and get this now!</li>
            <li> Nope. He didn&#x27;t like it. My husband dreads shaving unfortunately. He says the razor tugs at every hair as it shaves and it actually hurts! Not sure how that works, but it&#x27;s a bummer!</li>
            <li> Exceeded all expectations.  Heavy and durable, not like some of the cheap lightweight shavers that I&#x27;ve bought before.  Great shave, no skin irritation, easy clean up.</li>
            <li> Works great, easy clean. Does my head too as I am sporting a bald head by choice due to cancer. I have light hair and light whiskers. Shaves to face, conforms to face easily.</li>
            <li> This is the third Norelco I&#x27;ve owned.  I&#x27;ve been more than satisfied with all of them.  Good value for the money.  Reliable and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> Very confortable machine, is light and practical..also I like that the fact that includes rechargable batteries so you dont have to replace them for a while</li>
            <li> It was intended as a present and worked well to the purpose.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find if this shave inthe shower or not.</li>
            <li> Good and practical.  Thank you.  Klara</li>
            <li> In a nutshell, I love this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been shaving with Norelcos for over 30 years.  I bought this unit to replace my 10-year-old plus Norelco 5825 XL rotary shaver that FINALLY started petering out.  Why did I wait so long?  This new razor shave so close and so effortlessly.  It took some getting used to rinsing it out in hot water after every shave (leave it open, on a towel after you shake most of the water out), but this keeps the blades and their housings clean, and ready for the next shave.  I finally took it apart after two months of use, and the blades/housings were like new, and had no buildup of hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and battery life?  I can&#x27;t say.  I charged it when I bought it almost two months ago, and it is still running strong on that charge.  Granted I have a goatee, so I&#x27;m shaving less real estate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get this shaver!</li>
            <li> He loves this!  Replacing his Norelco of 40 years!</li>
            <li> Works great, close shave. Battery life is awesome. Love that I can rinse it under water... easy clean.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I thought, and the old one works better/</li>
            <li> This shaver shaves as good as a blade.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I wanted a decent mid line razor. The price and quality are comparable.    Pros:    Cordless  Fast charging (After initial charge of course)  Sharp blades.  Decent price    Cons:    Chamber that houses hair trimming is somewhat small.  Small parts and no clear directions on reassembling shaving head after cleaning.    I found instructions online for proper care and cleaning here:  [...]    and additional info here:  [...]    Overall: Good price and after 2 months going strong. Proper care will ensure this razor remains in top care for quite a while.</li>
            <li> With no adjustments you get a good but never close shave.  Charges fast and keeps the charge for several shaves.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for a few months now, and I like it a lot. I use it dry every other day and it does a nice job, not as close as a regular razor, but still pretty close. That being said, I also have light colored hair. Someone with black or dark colored hair may need to shave every day, and/or with shaving cream.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with irritation wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wet/dry ability of this razor is a nice feature because it does give you a closer shave when wet.  It&#x27;s also pretty easy to clean, just pop it open and rise it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rotating heads also allow you to more easily shave the neck and adam&#x27;s apple area, so I recommend this unit because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is also very good, I can go a few weeks at a time with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this shaver, it does a nice job and saves me some time in the mornings.</li>
            <li> This is cordless and waterproof, which I like.  I originally had a norelco over 20 years ago, didn&#x27;t use it much cause I got much better shave with a razor.  This one is much closer and I use this razor all the time.</li>
            <li> My reason for buying this was to see if it shaves as close as a safety razor and it doesn&#x27;t ! Not even close so it sits in a drawer in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I have had several Norelco razors in the past and all of them afforded a good shave. The AT830 is a piece of junk. Not only does it not produce a reasonably close shave but produces irritation and rash even after several weeks of use. I have tried several electric preshave lotions without benefit. Also I have tried three different shaving gels (for sensitive skin), none of which helped or improved closeness or rash development. Send to back to China.</li>
            <li> This is a good razor for the value! Wish it came with a recharging stand! It gives a good close shave.</li>
            <li> I have owned several razors over the and in general always had problems getting a lasting close shave.  Norelco has by far been the best of the bunch .</li>
            <li> If you honestly want to buy this, here is how to save money on your frustration:  buy me a round trip plane ticket, I will take one step off the plane, kick you in the balls as hard as I can and fly back home.  You will come out ahead.  The pain I cause you is nothing compared to this thing...that is when it wants to work.  Do not shave with it wet or you will have to dismantle the thing and use some home made gadgets to clean it out.  If you shave dry with it, every few times it will just hum and do nothing but make you choke the life out of the inanimate object.</li>
            <li> Overall good quality easy to use and close enough shave easy to care for and like the fact you can use it wet or dry</li>
            <li> I replaced an older Norelco shaver that was similar to this - this one seems to shave a little closer and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try an electric razor out and after a lot of research and reading all the positive reviews here decided on this one. I think these other reviewers must be suffering from buyer&#x27;s remorse / confirmation bias and leaving good reviews because they expected it to be good. In retrospect, I should have paid more heed to the negative reviews which I largely agree with after using this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the trimmer has hardly any power and I would have to go over areas multiple times for it to cut anything, while other trimmers work the first time. As for the shaving aspect which I purchased it for, it completely and utterly fails. I scoured my face with this thing (wet or dry, didn&#x27;t matter) and it literally would not cut the hairs at all. The first time I tried it I gave up after a few minutes and went back to a manual razor. I gave it another shot and spent a good 20 minutes (yes, 20) trying to get it to cut something; after I finished it looked like I hadn&#x27;t even shaved (yet my skin was extremely irritated) so I promptly returned it to Amazon and went back to my manual.  The company claims you need to use it for 2 weeks for your skin to get used to electric razors or whatever, but there is no way I&#x27;m going to walk around with 5 o&#x27;clock shadow for 2 weeks just to find out if it performs its purpose-built function. I had no idea an electric razor could perform so terribly.</li>
            <li> It has been several years since I needed to purchase a new Razor and since I have had great success with Philips Norelco, I thought I would try this one. The shave is great because of the quietness of the motor, the triple head configuration of the blades and the easy way to clean it to make every shave just like your first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A previous Norelco had an issue with its trimmer, but there is no problem whatsoever with this one! It can trim hairs very well, shapes your beard and is really almost worth getting this razor for on its own! A vast improvement over earlier models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to edit this to say that the motor on this razor gave out after the warranty expired. What happened was the on/off button wouldn&#x27;t work and sometimes the razor would turn on by itself and run the battery out and sometimes the motor would seize and shut off, right in the middle of a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, unfortunately, I have to give this razor a thumbs down overall.</li>
            <li> I used to use electric shavers for years now and I used to have an old model of philips then ordered this one. been 4 months now but it did not give me close shaving it always miss few spots which make my shaving look bad. I got skin irritation too !!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I tried to get close shaving I get even more irritation. I dont recommend this model in fact I wont buy philips again will try Braun next.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge a long time and works fine.  I haven&#x27;t used it wet, but the shave is pretty good dry.  I had an old Norelco which seems to me was more powerful and shaved more closely; but I also think that these blades have to take some time to break in.  I would certainly recommend this product to anyone based on performance, ease of use, and price.  My last shaver lasted a LONG, LONG time, over 15 years.</li>
            <li> Excellent, close,, light o the skin shave.&lt;br /&gt; Using recommended circular hand motion works.&lt;br /&gt;Charging stand should be heavier to keep from tipping.</li>
            <li> The shaver was fine, The problem was, it irrItated my skin. I have since returned it via UPS, per your instructions</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very happy with this unit.  It holds a charge for weeks if you use it as infrequently as I do.  So far I have charged it only once since it arrived and I just used it again yesterday.  It&#x27;s about due for a charge, but I&#x27;ve shaved with it at least half a dozen times for 2-3 minutes without having to recharge yet.  It&#x27;s nice to be able to rinse it off without worries about getting the wrong part wet.  It shaves sufficiently close for my liking, although a guy with a lot of thick facial hair might always prefer a straight razor unless he&#x27;s willing to use an electric twice a day to keep up with his growth rate.  I suspect that is true for any electric razor though.  I&#x27;m not super hairy so I can usually get away with skipping a day, maybe even two if I don&#x27;t mind that slightly scruffy look.  I am curious about it&#x27;s overall lifespan.  They say you can&#x27;t replace the battery so the unit is disposable once the battery wears out.  You CANNOT run it while plugged into the wall.  My dad bought me a corded Norelco 750RL in about 1992 and I&#x27;m still happily using it since it doesn&#x27;t have a battery.  It&#x27;s a little dinged up but it still shaves my face.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS MODEL FOR 3 YEARS AND AM HAPPY WITH THE PERFORMANCE.  IT&#x27;S REASONABLY PRICED AND THE PERFORMANCE IS GREAT&lt;br /&gt;bOB m</li>
            <li> Eazy to use.  Comfortable to hold.  Close shave.</li>
            <li> I am used to the older models of Norelco. They functioned well and lasted a long time but, were heavy and noisy. This product is lightweight and quiet. It is comfortable to use and shaves well leaving my face smooth. The ability to use it wet is a nice touch. It is exactly what Norelco Should have evolved into given their previous line  of product.&lt;br /&gt;  The only thing I consider a negative is that it will not work when plugged in. Which means you are always depending on the batteries. This is not sufficient reason however not to buy as the shave is outstanding.</li>
            <li> The shaver is very comfortable in use and very convenient.  It gives a great shave. I have been shaving for 55 years and this is the best shave I have ever had with the possible exception of a barber shaver.</li>
            <li> My Philips razor had seen better days.  The battery was unable to hold a lengthy charge.  So, I opted for this model as a &amp;#34;kind of middle-of-the-road&amp;#34; experiment to keep from paying $150 or so for another Norelco.  This razor will work for a week or 10 days, but it demands repetitive strokes to get a passable shave.  I&#x27;ve tried every method possible to help it along in its shaving, but one must go over and over the same areas. It is quiet and runs smoothly, but lacks a charge indicator.  In short, it is a fair shaver if you want to save a few dollars.  Frankly, I wish I had purchased a top-of-the-line for more money.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my father.  He really loves it.  It seems very quiet, which is a good thing.  My parents have a dog who hates the sound of his old electric razor, but this one does not seem to bother him.  It arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Bought this for someone as a Christmas gift and he really liked it, unless he was just being nice to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Norelco shaver for about a month.  I like its ergonomic design which makes it easy to hold.  I also appreciate the low noise level.  I&#x27;ve only had Braun shavers to this point in my life and all of them were very loud.  Perhaps the best thing about this shaver is that I can rinse it under the faucet when I&#x27;m finished with it--and use it in the shower (which I haven&#x27;t tried yet).  Rinsing it under the faucet makes it really easy to clean and saves time in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco recommends trying the razor for a period of weeks in order to get used to it.  That&#x27;s a good suggestion.  Still, after four weeks, what I don&#x27;t like about it is that it is still not getting all the whiskers on my neck and is leaving minor rashes there.  I don&#x27;t want to use shaving cream, but I might need to try it to see if it makes a difference.  I&#x27;ve always shaved dry because I travel a lot and shaving cream is one less thing to take along.</li>
            <li> I use this when I&#x27;m in a rush and need a quick shave. Need to get to a meeting and haven&#x27;t shaven - take this with me and can shave and walk! Shave and shower too! It works in water. This is a wonder device. I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so rough on my skin. I use a nice lotion after to help my skin afterwards and I try not to press too hard while shaving.</li>
            <li> I just started using this but I love it so far.  It gives a good close shave quicker than the old razor that it replaced.  And I like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to mess with a cord while shaving.  And when you are done you can quickly clean it by opening it up and dumping the hair in the garbage followed by rinsing the entire head area.</li>
            <li> I got this to be able to use in the shower and it works fine.  Not as close shave as razor, but pretty close and comfortable.</li>
            <li> This changed the way I shaved and left a good clean feel.</li>
            <li> Very good razor. Only dislike and it&#x27;s minor is the power button is lack and hard to find if you&#x27;re used to other Norelco razors. Good battery life and smooth cut.</li>
            <li> I like the smooth shave I get with this razor and the fact that you can use it in the shower.  The only complaint I&#x27;d have is that the blades don&#x27;t come anywhere close to lasting a year--try 3-4 months,</li>
            <li> I hate shaving, this shaver does better than most. It is also waterproof, so using it in the shower, or dry is an advantage. I have yet to find a shaver that cuts as well as a blade, however this one is getting closer than any other electric razor I have found. It is also easy to clean, and charges fast.</li>
            <li> The Norelco AT830 Powertouch gives you a great and close shave.  You can use it wet or dry, I use mine in the shower and it works perfectly.  Just rinse it to clean it.  The pivot heads conforms to your face and skin to give you that close shave.  I also like the quick charge feature.  I can&#x27;t say anything negative about this razor.  Overall I definitely would recommend the Norelco AT830 Powertouch Razor.</li>
            <li> Good but not good for neck</li>
            <li> ...he wanted this one which is one upgrade from his previous one. He loved the first one so much he wanted the same kind again. The upgrade was not because the first one was inferior but the upgrade had just a little more power and since he also uses it shave his head he opted for more power.</li>
            <li> I confess that I have been quite pleased with the closeness of shave I have been getting thus far, but only when using shave cream and water. When using the AT830 dry it is what I would expect of an electric razor - not nearly as close as my old faithful Gillette Mach 3. Though the Norelco is said to hold a charge for 50 minutes I have yet to recharge it after 26 days of use. Perhaps new batteries on their first charge last longer. It is also pleasantly quiet. I give it 4 stars. When they come up with an electric that shaves closer than a razor without &amp;#34;razor burn&amp;#34; I would be willing to give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Came just in time for birthday giving, my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.it arrived sooner than expected and was well packaged.it was exactly as advertised. I have used Norelco razors for 60 years ,and have never had any problems with them.thanks to amazon and Phillips for a great product. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> This AT830 replaces an older Norelco that would no longer take a charge.  I like the wet/dry feature which allows the option to use shaving gel.  Being new, it gives a good shave either way. The older Norelco came with a hard travel case that won&#x27;t fit the AT830 and I have not been able to find if there is a hard case for it.  Same for a car cord adapter.</li>
            <li> Highly impressed with this razor, give a good clean shave and no worries about it and holds a charge all week</li>
            <li> Shaver works great for the price. Easy to clean and a battery charge last for weeks. I only wish it came with a case for travel.</li>
            <li> My husband needed a new razor.  We looked at several and he chose this one. He gets a very smooth shave and his skin feels soft.  I love the way his face feels after he shaves and he&#x27;s very happy with this razor.</li>
            <li> 3-5 minutes and ready. Battery duration is very long. Saving time in morning. Exactamente lo que esperaba. Recomendado cuando se tiene poco tiempo en las mañanas.</li>
            <li> Husband is generally a blade man, but after a bit of getting used to it, he loves this Phillips Electric.  As his wife, I love it because it is faster, and I am not left waiting at the front door.</li>
            <li> The razor works well, and shaves the best of all the electric razors I&#x27;ve used (though I&#x27;ve never used any of the expensive $100+ razors). Quite quiet for an electric razor as well, and the ability to use it wet as well as dry is a nice touch. And at $70, it&#x27;s not too expensive either.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband for Christmas as he was always complaining about the other cheaper shavers. I tell you now, you get what you pay for. It took him time to get use to how to use it but now he really really loves it and his face is so smoooooth.</li>
            <li> My son absolutely loves this razor and it is the first electric razor he has owned, he said he will never go back to a regular razor again.</li>
            <li> Great razor, quiet, easy to hold and use, does a fine job on your beard, easy to clean.  I am pleased.</li>
            <li> excellent for my legs. Quiet. Easy to handle. Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I tried it for my underarms that usually get waxed each summer&#x3D;big mistake- took about a week to heal-poor things.</li>
            <li> Charged up good and fast, works great, easy to clean.  The only negative I have is that it should come with a case for traveling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m graduating from my old [[ASIN:B002TQ4AO0 Braun Mobile Shaver - M90 1 Count]] so this was very exciting as I have used my braun razor for over 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, as everyone else has mentioned it takes a few runs to get all the whiskers cut.  The shave isn&#x27;t as close as a manual razor but does a good enough job where I feel I am respectable in appearance.  The smart pivot does the job around my neck and jaw area but as I said before it takes a few runs.  Sometimes I use the pop up trimmer first for a quick run then the actual razor to finish it off to get those longer hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did few some irritation with initial use but my skin got used to it. I found it better to shave dry than wet but that&#x27;s a personal thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The popup trimmer is really great for my sideburns as they grow pretty quickly and need a trim at least once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life lasts pretty long before a charge so I am pretty happy about that.  Especially for trips so that is one less power cord to bring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to pop it up and clean out all the hair in the razor, at least every other shave, as it does accumulate and get disgusting inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall I am happy as it definitely better than my braun razor.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this Philips Norelco 830/ 41 Aquatic Power Touch Electric Razor I was not happy to do so; but I was sick and tired of how expensive it was to buy replacement blades for my manual razor.  For $25.00 I could get 5 razor blades and that was if they were on sale. I figured that if I spent what I would normally spend on blade in a year and bought an electric razor I would spend a lot less money. Now ten months after my purchase I have come to realize that it was money well spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered my electric razor and tried it for the first time I was not happy with it at all! I thought that I was careful with my decision making process and read several reviews before deciding on which electric razor to purchase. I was just a stone&#x27;s throw away from sending it back before I had a moment of clarity. I had not owned an electric razor in over 20 years and in that time the technology had changed and I should take some time to learn to use my new electric razor before I passed judgment so I kept it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During that time I kept using it and with experience I kept getting better shaves. One of the things that I enjoy about this razor is that you can use it dry or use it wet (with shaving cream). In the end I figured out that I prefer a dry shave. Up until a month or so ago I did not realize how much I had come to like my Philips Norelco 830/ 41 Aquatic Power Touch Electric Razor until I had occasion to be without it. I had taken my family out of town for a vacation and I did not bring my electric razor because it didn&#x27;t come with a carrying case and I was trying to travel light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used my manual razor I absolutely hated it!!! Even with the shaving cream I felt like I was scraping a chunk of metal across my face and it was very uncomfortable. There was a lot of tug &amp; pull and when I finished the shave I could not believe how much I used to pay for blades for this thing!!! When I got into the shower afterword and the hot water hit my face it actually burned where I had shaved.  I was not going to do this again so for the rest of the week I did not shave and I when I got home I got rid of that old manual razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good razor. I have enjoyed using it. I enjoy the quality of shave that I get and with the money that I have NOT spent on blades it has already paid for itself! This razor is worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above portion was written in June of 2013 I had purchased this razor around October of 2012. I am writing this final portion of my review on December 31, 2013. It has been over a year my Philips Norelco 830/41 Electric Razor is still performing well. I use an electric pre-shave now that that stands my beard up and allows me to get an even better shave. I used to shave six days a week now I only need to shave 5 days a week. I had to replace the blades in November of this year so the original set of blades have lasted well over a year and the replacements were about $25.00. I have absolutely no complaints with this razor and would highly recommended it. I have no desire to go back to my manual razor. I am still of the opinion that this is well worth the money if you do get it please take some time to get used to using it. It makes all the difference.my face it actually burned where I had shaved.

            <li> Good razor, shaves well and fits hand well.  Charging system is questionable, cord doesn&#x27;t fit well and charging lights ar eratic.</li>
            <li> I really like it because it gives me a close shave without pinching my lip and it it is sturdy. A big setback is that it doesn&#x27;t have a charging stand.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. I never had a razor that I could use in the shower before and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really like the quick-charge feature. When the battery runs out just plug it in for a couple minutes and it&#x27;s good to go for another shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We live overseas and it charges on both 110 and 220 volt. I&#x27;m buying a second one to keep in the States.</li>
            <li> My last Phillips was a 8870 and was the bees knees till it packed in after at least eight years of. dedicated service.I purched this to replace it and its not in the same league.It does the job but not as smooth or as quick as my 8870 .When the time comes to change again it will still be a Phillips but I will take more care in my choice,and try further up the range !!</li>
            <li> Shaver works very well, as expected. This is my third Norelco, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever switch. However, I am not very happy that this model did not come with a travel case, as my others have. There is no way to protect the heads in a travel bag, short of duct taping the cap over the heads.</li>
            <li> This shaver is great.  I&#x27;ve had to start using an electric shaver, because of some neck surgery and this one works very well.  I use to the old 25-30 year models, but this one really works well.  Not exactly like a blade but very acceptable.  Also, I can flip open head and wash out.  Don&#x27;t buy one that can&#x27;t be rinsed out.  This one is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new electric shaver without the unnecessary additions more commonly seen in the new brands. I got what i was looking for and love it</li>
            <li> My husband had not used an electric razor in 30 years but decided to try one. He uses it everyday and thinks it is great and a time saver.</li>
            <li> This razor was different than what I was used to in a Norelco product, but once I got used to the differences in the shaving head I like it every bit as much as the older ones, if not more. I shave &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is working very well.  My old Norelco&#x27;s battery was fading - had to start recharging once a week and it took about seven hours.  This new one charges fully in an hour.  You supposedly get 50 minutes of shaving from one charge, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m getting more.  You can&#x27;t beat this for an electric shaver.  There&#x27;s the model that&#x27;s considerably more expensive, but this one works fine for me.</li>
            <li> seems to be an improvement over my last electric  shaver.  hope it maintains its action.</li>
            <li> g&lt;br /&gt;Good price - good tool. Meets all expectations............</li>
            <li> It is quiet and gives a good shave.  Only problem is the recharge plug falls out too easily and razor can&#x27;t be run on wall current - when the battery eventually goes, then so does the whole razor.</li>
            <li> this is my second norelco shaver. it gives me a very close shave , my only complaint i could not get the 50 minutes of shave time as promised</li>
            <li> This Shaver really does a good job than other shaver I have tried especially in wet shave area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it leaves some hair back in areas around chin , neck. ( very few ) and  I still need to use blade / hand razor in second round to get finer shaver, the second round becomes piece of cake walk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THis happens because first round of electric shave makes your skin so smooth that you don&#x27;t feel an even liitle effort in your second round.&lt;br /&gt;Great product !! I would certainly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift. For the first couple of weeks, maybe the first month,  it was the best electric shaver I&#x27;d ever had. But, as usual with electric razors, the quality of the shave gradually declined. And cleaning the razor isn&#x27;t quite as easy as it had been with prior wet/dry razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And after 6 months, it stopped taking a charge. There were signs of corrosion where the cord plugged in, so maybe it&#x27;s not quite water-proof enough. I&#x27;ve had Panasonic wet/dry razors that have lasted for more than 5 years, so that was pretty disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much as I liked the initial shave, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying another -- just not durable enough for me.</li>
            <li> I wish it had more visible power. Seems weak but it does the job well. The trimmer portion is very-low power. Love the 3 rotating heads, very close shave. Easy to clean. Cheap replacement heads.</li>
            <li> hubby loves this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco products for over 35 years and this is the best one yet. Shaves closer, easier to clean. Downside? Once the battery is worn out, you have to purchase a new razor. Another example of planned obsolescence, plus is was made in china, not the U.S.</li>
            <li> Great electric razor waterproof works as expected on face works better on scalp bought this razor to shave my head and it works great for that</li>
            <li> No complaints about this unit,  has treated me well for a couple years now!</li>
            <li> close shave, long battery life</li>
            <li> The battery could last longer according to my husband, the user of this product. He feels he gets a nice close shave with it and that makes it 4 stars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two Norelcos in my life time. This one I&#x27;ve had for 15 years, I just buy new blades when needed. My grandson, who is in college now came to visit and didn&#x27;t have his razor so he used mine and loved it, so we had one sent to him and he is a happy guy now! He had never used an electric razor, he thought they all pulled to much. He had to have one after he used his grandfathers. I wouldn&#x27;t own anything else.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to replace his old Norelco razor. This razor doesn&#x27;t have a closeness setting and doesn&#x27;t come with a case or stand, all features his old Norelco had. Considering the price paid, it is just a basic razor. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I switched from a blade to this and I am very pleased with the results. I have a heavy beard and this works as well as a blade with no hassle. Nice smooth shave easy to clean and pretty much the same results wet or dry. I use a little soap in the shower and get very good results. It did take a couple of weeks for my skin to get used to the blades but other than that nothing to complain about. Very pleaseed with the charge it lasts about 5 weeks shaving once a day.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very happy with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;After my old 7310XL stopped giving me a good shave even after replacing the blades I decided to step it up and go for this model. I&#x27;m getting a fast very close dry shave, haven&#x27;t tried it wet yet.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I went with the AT830/41 with the pivoting heads because it gets the hard to shave spots very nicely.</li>
            <li> I have used a Norelco shaver for decades ! They have all given me great shaves , are reliable and a pleasure to use . I prefer the &amp;#34;cordless&amp;#34; models ; the long battery life between &amp;#34;charges&amp;#34; adds to the convenience of going &amp;#34;cordless&amp;#34; . When the time comes to replace one , I do not consider a change from Norelco&#x27;s product line ! I usually have a set of replacement heads on hand ; replacing the heads on a yearly basis provides tip top performance ! I rely on Amazon for a wide range of Norelco&#x27;s shavers as well as replacement heads .</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I actually love this shaver. The only reason I give it four stars is that the first one I purchased broke after about four uses; however, amazon replaced it and sent a new one to me very quickly, so there was no loss to me. The functionality of this razor is incredible, if you use it in the shower it will give you a shave that rivals most manual blades without the risk of cutting yourself. In addition it is very easy to clean as you can run the blades under water. Overall this is a great product that is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors for years but this is the 1st rotary shaver I tried. A world of difference. I have a tough beard (Mediterranean) and this Norelco tames it at least as well as any other electric I&#x27;ve had. I really like the wet/dry functionality, I use that in the shower to finish up on any missed spots after my initial morning shave (like I said, tough beard). Only complaint is the pop-up trimmer doesn&#x27;t really lock into place, so it&#x27;s a bit unstable when you need to do a lot of touch-up grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this Norelco for nearly 2 years, no performance problems. Lasts a long time (about 2 weeks) between charges with daily use.</li>
            <li> I honestly hate shaving, putting on the shaving cream, cleaning the razor, and washing off the shaving cream afterwards and such. Sure for some people it has become second nature so it doesn&#x27;t even bother them, but I wait til my facial hair grows out really long and then shave it all at once (yes I&#x27;m lazy). This razor is amazing for the simple reason that I can be watching something on the laptop and just be shaving without even putting on shaving cream. It is a really close shave and it does not irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not use to razors like this, like me, be patient with it. It was the first time for me using an electric shaver, but wow the time it saves and how good of a shave it does.</li>
            <li> I  have a beard and was looking for a shaver to shave my neck.  At the cost of razor blades shaving every 2 days, this shaver paid for itself rather quickly.  The grip on it is great and the pivoting heads are very nice to shave the curves of your neck and face.  My only slight negative would be I need to go over some of the areas multiple times before it shaves everything perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li> Bought for hubby.  He&#x27;s used Norelco Shavers for over 35 years.  This one is a little light and really isn&#x27;t as good as the last one as you have to go over areas to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> This was a birthday gift for my hubby, it arrived earlier than expected, in great shape and he loves using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco shavers for 20+ years. This shaver is not as well built and doesn&#x27;t stay charged as long as the one that I was using preveously. I will continue to use it, but would not reccomend it with enthusiasm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers since the 70&#x27;s and have had probably a half-dozen models through the years.  I believe that the AT830 is the best yet.  I shave in the shower using Truefitt and Hill Ultimate Comfort Shaving Cream.  This Norelco gives me an incredibly close shave with absolutely no irritation.  Battery life is amazing and ergonomics are good.  All I can say is WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer -- every guy&#x27;s beard is different.  Some men prefer a foil shaver, some a rotary.  Last February I decided to try a Panasonic and it was like taking a sander to my face (I stuck with it for 10 months, but it never got any better).  With the Norelco, my beard was acclimated to the rotary blades in less than a week.  This is why most shaver manufacturers give you a 30 or 45 day trial period.  Try the AT830 -- if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, get your money back (don&#x27;t be an idiot like me sticking with the Panasonic instead of returning it).</li>
            <li> A great electric razor. It gives me a fast, close shave. I also use it on my head (bald) and most people think I use a blade. I have used Norelco shavers for years. I like this one the best. If you can get it for a good price, buy it!</li>
            <li> I have had razors like this one before and it does take some time for your beard to adjust to your face and razor.The last one I had was adjustable in that maybe you just didn&#x27;t want that close of a shave you could back it off to make it more comfortable for yourself instead of that freshly scraped feeling you get when it&#x27;s just a little too close I&#x27;ll miss that now.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get fine hairs on my neck. Otherwise good.</li>
            <li> Never used it in the shower, but i really like how it feels to my face and head. Its a lot faster shave than my old dead electric shaver and feels good.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric razor I have used that does not break my face out in a rash.  This is because I can use shaving cream; makes all the difference in the world.</li>
            <li> this is my second electrical shaver, my older was a chinesse bad quality brand called &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34;, that mi wife gave me four years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided bought this for the price, cheaper than the cheapest panasonic shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i used twice until now, i had to say, that is confortable, dont pull the hair if you use in dry face, using whith foam or gel is terrible, you should use few gel or the Norelco can´t do the job very well, with to much gel the Norelco dont work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drying after shave could be dificult, dont specified if you can let it wet after putting under hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for now is good for me, i  used to use razor blades to finish the job, monday and friday, wenesday just the Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking about head speed, if feel very slow, but do the job, maybe this kind of Shaver dont need to much speed to cut the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe in a couple of years i will buy a panasonic to compare...</li>
            <li> For me the best shave of any electric razor i have ever owned. Gvies a really close shave with no irratation</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my husband Christmas 2014 and is still working great.  Gives him a close shave without skin irritation.  I also ordered a replacement head which has not as yet been needed.  He was always a blade and shaving creme user, but needed to switch to an electric razor due to failing eyesight.  This shaver has made the transition to electric very smooth.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  A good replacement for a similar shaver.  Quick delivery.  Good transaction.</li>
            <li> This razor isn&#x27;t to bad when your face is completely dry. However when ever my face was moist like when,I get out of the shower it leaves cuts and scratches all over my face. Really embarrassing. I also tried using gel with razor cause its supposed to be wet/dry all it did was leave my face red irritated and scratched.</li>
            <li> My husband vowed he would shave everyday if he had a rotary shaver. I got one, and I&#x27;m so impressed by what a close shave it is. I never liked seeing him cut up by the regular razors. Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Got this as a Christmas present. A few months later I asked him to tell me what he thinks of it and se says it dosen&#x27;t take care of the neck hairs like he likes but he still likes the razor. He is satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> It was almost twenty dollars cheaper then at Wal-Mart, that was a plus.  I have had it for about three weeks and so far I love it.  Gives a great shave, is quiet and so simple to clean.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Thank you. Larry Cooley</li>
            <li> I purchased this product new in package from a local vendor. I had a Norelco Wet/Dry about 6 years ago and really liked it. I don&#x27;t remember what model it was but it was the one  with the built in lotion dispenser. I was disappointed that Norelco no longer made that model but I bought this one based on the reviews. I used it for about 3 months and the shave was decent. Not as good as my old shaver but I didn&#x27;t have any irritation and it didn&#x27;t leave many long hairs. I shave in the shower after washing my face and letting by beard soak for about 5 minutes. I use an exfoliating face wash for lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model lasted only three months before it wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore! i opened up the battery case and it was completely ruined with water damage. Keep in mind this razor was never dropped/submerged in water and I always dried it off and stored it in my medicine cabinet when I was done. I&#x27;m lucky this sucker didn&#x27;t explode on me. I don&#x27;t know what happened to Norelco after Philips took over but I&#x27;ll never buy one of their electric razors ever again.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was tired of  cleaning my non-aquatec electric shaver ~ tapping it out, cleaning it with a brush then once a month taking out the quirky little spinning hair guillotines and trying to make them fit back in. My thinking is that hot soap and water wouldn&#x27;t just soften my beard but clean the darn thing out too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it cleans the machine easily but doesn&#x27;t give me a close shave. Most electrics say not to push too hard but pushing a little harder on the AT830 produces a slightly better shave - on my skull.&lt;br /&gt;I still use a blade to get a close shave on my face!</li>
            <li> The cost is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;I would give it a 4 if it could be used when plugged in. I&#x27;ve had rechargeable shavers in the past that lost their ability to hold a charge but they were still usable as long as it was plugged in. This one doesn&#x27;t seem to have that capability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the ability to use it in the shower or with shaving cream. I think it gives a more comfortable and closer shave when used that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I had owned a Norelco before, many years ago. It was okay, it delivered a shave that was close enough to be presentable, but not anywhere near as good as a blade. This razor is several generations later, and I was surprised that the shave had actually improved quite a lot. It&#x27;s quiet, and although still not as close as a blade, it is better than I expected. It is quiet, and I have had no skin irritation using it.</li>
            <li> A great shaver for my travel bag.  Works well with my heavy beard.  No separate charger to carry along taking up space in my carry-on bag</li>
            <li> I bought this because I hate shaving with a manual razor (and shaving in general). It&#x27;s too time consuming and I hate having to replace the blades so often. This electric razor solved both problems for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my face feeling pretty smooth and does a good job of not missing any hairs with only a few passes. Getting my neck is a bit more difficult and occasionally leaves it feeling a bit irritated. I don&#x27;t think this is a short-coming of this razor before since that tended to happen with manual razors and a foil electric shaver that I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it; it saves me time and frustration.</li>
            <li> The razor is well-built.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is not the best.&lt;br /&gt;The razor has reduced the amount of redness I normally experience, but the shave is not that close, as compared to my 10 year old Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> I have owned SEVERAL electric razors over the years. I have a thick black beard that grows quickly and in every direction possible. I enjoy a clean shave and use a 5-blade razor and a straight razor. Both of these take some time and money to keep up... especially changing the heads on the 5-blade. I enjoy shaving in the shower as it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One major problem I have always had is that electric razors have never given me a close enough shave and I had to go back and touch them up with a razor. Not with this Norelco! It is almost as clean as a razor cut and doesn&#x27;t pull. I use it in and out of the shower and have been floored with the results of this razor. If you&#x27;ve been searching for a good electric razor... stop; go buy this razor, and enjoy a great product at a great price.</li>
