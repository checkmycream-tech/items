            <li>(This takes a fair amount of product.)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t make this my primary styler because you do have to use some tension when applying the product to get the best curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Nice smell to it.</li>
            <li>This is my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>My hair was so shiny and my curls were so poppin&#x27; that I was accused of having a wig on or having hair blended into my own.  </li>
            <li>Nice gel consistency.  </li>
            <li>The best part, the ingredients are all natural, which is what I look for, which are a hit or miss with this brand.  </li>

            <li>So, I&#x27;m happy to be the first.</li>
            <li>Excellent production search local markets on pricing..</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>to the hair, but I love the way this item smells.</li>
            <li>My style lasts me 5 days with spritzing for refreshing.</li>
            <li>Love this product also.  </li>
            <li>once I found my staples, I have no desire to go hunting for more.  </li>
            <li>I believe I&#x27;m more in the 3C category ...</li>
            <li>I will be buying this a million times again love it.</li>
            <li>works better that the stretching cream</li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>This product performs for me better than Kinky Curly Curling Custard (KKCC), which is now my backup product.  </li>
            <li>It seems to promote clumping of curls better than KKCC.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the product and will continue to use.</li>
            <li>It really leave your curls frizz free!!!</li>
            <li>I have had varying results with these products and would say they are all pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The price point is pretty good for what you get and how the product performs (note:</li>
            <li>Works best when hair is not as wet</li>
            <li>Light gels like Shea moisture Gel Soufflé are a joke to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooth product through hair like Deva Curl</li>
            <li>So it is important to recognize that the state of the health of your hair may affect the way a product performs.</li>

            <li>I use One &#x27;n Only Keratin Curl Remover to smooth out the kink in my hair, and that effort combined with this amazing product, I have a beautiful light natural curl.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m a bit limited on what I can do w/o stressing my hair out, but was so happy I found this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, cannot put into words how much I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This custard moisturizes, gives a light hold and really makes your curls pop!  </li>
            <li>It smells great and keep my edges down.</li>
            <li>I applied the Design Essentials Natural Almond and Avacado leave-in, which is designed to work with their custard, and have gotten even better results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money if your hair loves it</li>
            <li>As of right now it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my 4a-4c hair</li>
            <li>Thing - I have tried some products that just did not seem right for my hair and wondered what all of the hype was about.  </li>
            <li>Thing - I have tried some products that just did not seem right for my hair and wondered what all of the hype was about.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is that I always like to have a backup product in case something I love gets discontinued.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly wat it says.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use much at all!  </li>
            <li>in the first few times with good results.  </li>
            <li>Hair was definitely softer and curls more defined.</li>
            <li>However, as time went on and my hair became healthier I had a much more positive experience with the same products.</li>
            <li>However, as time went on and my hair became healthier I had a much more positive experience with the same products.</li>
            <li>What I love about this product is that it isn&#x27;t slimy, it is pliable, it seriously moisturizes my hair without leaving a &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; cast on the hair and most of all my hair is very shiny and touchable when it dries.  </li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling hard or stringy, it&#x27;s just so good...</li>
            <li>I really did not want to give it any stars.</li>
            <li>and you really have to work it through the hair to bring out the curls.</li>
            <li>My hair really loves it.</li>
            <li>And, if my hair really loves something, I&#x27;m going to pay the price for it ...</li>
            <li>Very light/non greasy.  </li>
            <li>Wish you could get a larger jar as it goes pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>this particular one.</li>
            <li>But this right here, is totally worth every single penny!  </li>
            <li>I certainly have in the Design Essentials Natural Honey</li>
            <li>I certainly have in the Design Essentials Natural Honey CurlForming Custard.</li>
            <li>I like this product but have purchased others that curled better with a little more&lt;br /&gt;body</li>
            <li>I say &amp;#34;accused&amp;#34; because the woman literally did not believe my hair was natural no matter how much i protested.  </li>
            <li>No hard shrinked up hair like I get from gel.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend for women w/ natural hair, just make sure you&#x27;re not applying it to dry hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m natural and this products makes my curls POP like WHAT!  </li>
            <li>I then just spray some water on it (not more custard) and fluff out w/ my fingers and looks good as new.</li>
            <li>Finish drying with a large barrel diffuser on low heat</li>
            <li>Nine year natural</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft too.</li>
            <li>even the ones that are not all natural.  </li>
            <li>I used it so far for wash and go&#x27;s and a twist out.</li>
            <li>This item is a must have with the Design Essentials natural line.</li>
            <li>Apply leave-in liberally section by section divided into 4-6 sections (Design Essentials Natural Almond and Avacado  or KCKT).&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I apply the product on freshly washed soaking wet hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it on wet hair in sections and smooth it through w/ my fingers then fluff.</li>
            <li>I used to use the Design Essentials Crème Gel, and I thought that was a fantastic product, but it will flake a bit if you don&#x27;t wash it out after a couple of days, and it is similar to a gel in that your hair will stick together if you don&#x27;t fluff it enough, and when you fluff it some of the curl definition is lost.  </li>
            <li>and my hair looks a hot mess when I wake up.</li>
            <li>Many gels (including this one) leave my hair hard if I apply too heavily, so to remedy this</li>

            <li> I go for the natural fluffy curl look, and in order to achieve that I have tried Jam Gel, Argon Oil, Shea Moisture products, Curls Unleashed, Mixed Chicks -- you name it, and nothing works like this stuff.  </li>

            <li> DO NOT TOUCH UNTIL HAIR IS FULLY DRY</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that singular characteristic that helps my 4c coils to clump.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m military and work out a lot</li>
            <li> For specs: I&#x27;m black, with coarse hair, medium to thick density and low porosity.  </li>
            <li> This product is not good for the natural hair.</li>
            <li> With other curl-defining products, this hair might clump, but I don&#x27;t see a defined curl pattern.</li>
            <li> they all foam and leave a flaking haze on my hair during gel application due to my hairs&#x27; kinkiness.  </li>
            <li> I diffuse for a few minutes then allow it to air dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small container, but just a dollop will go a long way.  </li>
            <li> I am half Filipino and black.</li>
            <li> Left twisted for only 1 day.</li>
            <li> My hair is a tight kinky coil texture.</li>
            <li> This product does contain glycerin, which my hair is a little iffy about at times.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of this product.</li>
            <li> No more banding is needed when I use this for my tightly coiled 3c/4a hair.  </li>
            <li> Looks like I&#x27;ve set it w/ some small spiral rods all throughout my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After washing and detangling my hair, I comb through a small amount of oil as a leave in.</li>
            <li> My hair is normally dry and unable to achieve any sheen.</li>
            <li> like this gel because it&#x27;s thick and slimy.  </li>
            <li> a lot of products I have tried in the past haven&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Wasted money!!</li>
            <li> Dont want to rate unfairly.</li>
            <li> I am afraid to use any of their products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in the product.</li>

            <li> Works perfectly on my type of hair.</li>
            <li> The product itself works great without drying out my hair.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great moisturizer</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. It didn&#x27;t curl my hair at all. I&#x27;ll stick with Kinky Curly for now.</li>
            <li> Allergic reaction . My hair came off. I am afraid to use any of their products.</li>
            <li> This product is not good for the natural hair. I really did not want to give it any stars. And I talked to the company myself. I&#x27;m very disappointed in the product. It does nothing that it claims to do. But it will dry your hair out.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me.</li>
            <li> As of right now it doesn&#x27;t do anything for my 4a-4c hair but I didn&#x27;t order with the leave in that was recommended so maybe that is the problem</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of this product. The hold is nice, but it can get flaky. Smells good to me. I like other DE natural products, just not this particular one.</li>
            <li> I like this product but have purchased others that curled better with a little more&lt;br /&gt;body to the hair, but I love the way this item smells.</li>
            <li> I have type 3 curly hair and this stuff has worked in ways a lot of products I have tried in the past haven&#x27;t! It smells great and keeps my hair in place all day...which is something us curly haired folks struggle with on the daily!</li>
            <li> I am half Filipino and black. My hair texture is wavy curls... Type 3a/3b I believe. I have tried so MANY products and this by far is the best!!!! I do mix kinky curly custard with it too. It gives me defined curls without drying out my hair. Highly recommend, cannot put into words how much I love this stuff. Great for wash and goes.</li>
            <li> Nine year natural &amp; I&#x27;ve never had a product define my curls like this does! I had tears in my eyes as hair that required Pre-Con gel &amp; a toothbrush in the 90s formed tiny spirals. With other curl-defining products, this hair might clump, but I don&#x27;t see a defined curl pattern. Kinky-Curly Curling Custard has been dethroned! Works best when hair is not as wet and you really have to work it through the hair to bring out the curls. (This takes a fair amount of product.) I can&#x27;t make this my primary styler because you do have to use some tension when applying the product to get the best curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell. It doesn&#x27;t flake. Doesn&#x27;t stand up to shower frizz, but if you dampen your hair, you can reset your curls without additional product. Excellent anti-shrinkage. My hair seems shinier. No silicone, parabens, paraffin, petroleum or mineral oil. Does have glycerin.</li>
            <li> I have type 4B hair and I&#x27;m natural and this products makes my curls POP like WHAT!  I use it on wet hair in sections and smooth it through w/ my fingers then fluff. By the end of the day, it&#x27;s dry and I go to sleep and my hair looks a hot mess when I wake up. I then just spray some water on it (not more custard) and fluff out w/ my fingers and looks good as new. Looks like I&#x27;ve set it w/ some small spiral rods all throughout my hair.  I&#x27;m military and work out a lot so I&#x27;m a bit limited on what I can do w/o stressing my hair out, but was so happy I found this product. Even family members and co works are wondering how is it my kinky hair now has defined spirals. It&#x27;s cheaper here on amazon (Sally&#x27;s price is about $16.50.  I definitely recommend for women w/ natural hair, just make sure you&#x27;re not applying it to dry hair. Also, I&#x27;ve notice if I try to use it w/anything other than water, it may turns that section into a white residue.  Great ingredients too - no parabens, petroleum, sulfates, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Had to stop using as it permanently stained my clothes</li>
            <li> It smells great and keep my edges down. It makes my hair soft too.</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars because of the reliability and the hold it provides my 4c coils.  I have 4c (L-O cottony) strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this gel because it&#x27;s thick and slimy.  Yes, some have said it wasn&#x27;t slimy but I find it is.  It&#x27;s that singular characteristic that helps my 4c coils to clump.  Light gels like Shea moisture Gel Soufflé are a joke to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing and detangling my hair, I comb through a small amount of oil as a leave in. I don&#x27;t use leave in conditioners because  they all foam and leave a flaking haze on my hair during gel application due to my hairs&#x27; kinkiness.  This does not need a leave in!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I part my hair into sections and finger shingle then comb the gel through 1/4 inch partings till clumps/coils form and drop from the comb&#x27;s teeth.  I&#x27;m still using my Tool Structure Tortoise Backcomber to style my coils.  I diffuse for a few minutes then allow it to air dry. DO NOT TOUCH UNTIL HAIR IS FULLY DRY OR YOUR STYLE WILL FRIZZ AND POOF. Many gels (including this one) leave my hair hard if I apply too heavily, so to remedy this I spritz in the am with a moisturizing spray (containing glycerin).  My style lasts me 5 days with spritzing for refreshing.</li>
            <li> Love this product also.  Does wonders for my hair and I will continue to use this as well.  Nice smell to it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a review on this anywhere. So, I&#x27;m happy to be the first. I didn&#x27;t buy from Amazon, but at my local Walgreens.  I&#x27;m on my second jar!  Yes!  Even though it&#x27;s a bit pricey, I decided to give it a try.  Stop the presses!  Halt everything!  I finally feel like I found the product my hair loves.  My hair hates everything coconut oil, aloe vera ... anything with protein.  This product does contain glycerin, which my hair is a little iffy about at times. This custard moisturizes, gives a light hold and really makes your curls pop!  The best part, the ingredients are all natural, which is what I look for, which are a hit or miss with this brand.  No shade to Design Essentials.  I just have a preference with ingredients. I know their products are good ... even the ones that are not all natural.  But this right here, is totally worth every single penny!  My hair really loves it. And, if my hair really loves something, I&#x27;m going to pay the price for it ... it&#x27;s too hard finding things that really work my tempermental head. I was only a product junkie until I found the products that work for me ... once I found my staples, I have no desire to go hunting for more.  The only thing is that I always like to have a backup product in case something I love gets discontinued. (Which is always the case, no!?) For specs: I&#x27;m black, with coarse hair, medium to thick density and low porosity.  For people who go by the hair typing thing ... I believe I&#x27;m more in the 3C category ... with some 4A.  Hope this review helps someone.  This is my honest opinion.  I&#x27;m not affiliated with this brand in any way.</li>
            <li> Only used once. Dont want to rate unfairly.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly wat it says. I can&#x27;t believe how well it works. It elongated my curls and defines them at the same time. No hard shrinked up hair like I get from gel. No more banding is needed when I use this for my tightly coiled 3c/4a hair.  I used it so far for wash and go&#x27;s and a twist out. Came out perfect.  Only con is I wish it came in a larger container 4 the price.  So happy I found my perfect product.  I will be buying this a million times again love it.</li>
            <li> The name speaks for itself.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product. It does wonders for my combo type 4b/c hair. My hair feels moisturized all day.  Wish you could get a larger jar as it goes pretty quickly.  Also, a tad pricey</li>
            <li> AMAZING product! Definitely defined my curls and provided elongation all day! This item is a must have with the Design Essentials natural line.</li>
            <li> Awesome... It really leave your curls frizz free!!!</li>
            <li> Really loved it, wished the sold it here in Germany and I didn&#x27;t have to import it.</li>
            <li> works better that the stretching cream</li>
            <li> This is maybe my second review ever on Amazon, and I have been shopping this site for years.  I am in LOOOOVE with this product. I go for the natural fluffy curl look, and in order to achieve that I have tried Jam Gel, Argon Oil, Shea Moisture products, Curls Unleashed, Mixed Chicks -- you name it, and nothing works like this stuff.  I use One &#x27;n Only Keratin Curl Remover to smooth out the kink in my hair, and that effort combined with this amazing product, I have a beautiful light natural curl.  I used to use the Design Essentials Crème Gel, and I thought that was a fantastic product, but it will flake a bit if you don&#x27;t wash it out after a couple of days, and it is similar to a gel in that your hair will stick together if you don&#x27;t fluff it enough, and when you fluff it some of the curl definition is lost.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling hard or stringy, it&#x27;s just so good...and you don&#x27;t have to use much at all!  It&#x27;s a small container, but just a dollop will go a long way.  I just love it.</li>
            <li> When it comes to curl defining products, I have tried them all - just about.  Kinky Curly, Shea Moisture, Hair Rules, Deva Curl, the list goes on.  I have had varying results with these products and would say they are all pretty good.  I have a mixture of 3c and 4a type curls.  What I love about this product is that it isn&#x27;t slimy, it is pliable, it seriously moisturizes my hair without leaving a &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; cast on the hair and most of all my hair is very shiny and touchable when it dries.  This product performs for me better than Kinky Curly Curling Custard (KKCC), which is now my backup product.  It seems to promote clumping of curls better than KKCC.  I have used this product about six times and have been very happy wit the results.  I used it with the Kinky Curly Knot Today (KKKT) leave-in the first few times with good results.  The last time I washed my hair I applied the Design Essentials Natural Almond and Avacado leave-in, which is designed to work with their custard, and have gotten even better results.  My hair was so shiny and my curls were so poppin&#x27; that I was accused of having a wig on or having hair blended into my own.  I say &amp;#34;accused&amp;#34; because the woman literally did not believe my hair was natural no matter how much i protested.  The price point is pretty good for what you get and how the product performs (note: it is only $12.99 at Sally where i purchased).  I can get three  to four days of really defined curls using this product and go as long as seven if I want a fluffy semi-frizzy curly fro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I apply the product on freshly washed soaking wet hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Apply leave-in liberally section by section divided into 4-6 sections (Design Essentials Natural Almond and Avacado  or KCKT).&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply Design Essentials Custard section by section divided into 4-6 sections.  Smooth product through hair like Deva Curl instructs.&lt;br /&gt;3. Sit under hooded dryer until hair is 85% -90% dry.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Finish drying with a large barrel diffuser on low heat setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last Thing - I have tried some products that just did not seem right for my hair and wondered what all of the hype was about.  However, as time went on and my hair became healthier I had a much more positive experience with the same products. So it is important to recognize that the state of the health of your hair may affect the way a product performs. Don&#x27;t give up because you too will find something that your hair loves.  I certainly have in the Design Essentials Natural Honey CurlForming Custard.barrel diffuser on low heat setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last Thing - I have tried some products that just did not seem right for my hair and wondered what all of the hype was about.

            <li> I am not impress. Wasted money!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at Sally&#x27;s along with the leave in conditioner suggested. I just sprayed my hair so it would be damp. Left twisted for only 1 day. Hair was definitely softer and curls more defined. My hair is a tight kinky coil texture. The smell was not over powering. I am satisfied with the product and will continue to use. Hopefully I can get a couple days without having to twist again. Also there was a shine. My hair is normally dry and unable to achieve any sheen. It&#x27;s worth the money if your hair loves it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for my hair</li>
            <li> Nice gel consistency.  Very light/non greasy.  Perfect for two strand twists,  twist outs,  my edges,  and managing the baby hairs at my edges.  Pleasant scent!</li>
            <li> I like the product it&#x27;s easy to use and it smells great.</li>
