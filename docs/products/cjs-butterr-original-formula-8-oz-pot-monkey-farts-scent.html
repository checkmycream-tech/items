            <li>And really, it smells SO GOOD!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is my most favorite diaper cream ever.</li>
            <li>but once the eczema appeared, I had to find something even more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>but those didn&#x27;t hold a candle to CJ&#x27;s Butter, and it also smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I also observed on myself how the redness began to diminish gradually and by that night was looking much better.</li>
            <li>We love CJ&#x27;s BUTTer for our daughter, since we cloth diaper.</li>
            <li>It works wonders and has helped with his eczema tremendously!</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous.</li>
            <li>smooth and rash free.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find the scent, a soft blend of bananas and vanilla, very pleasant, and it was a hit with the whole family, including my nephew.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it for him because of the great reviews and, as he is a 9 year old boy, I knew he would think that the name of the scent, Monkey Farts, was hilarious.  </li>
            <li>I will update this review as to how fast it clears up my baby&#x27;s skin!!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $.</li>
            <li>My baby&#x27;s bottom is completely rash free!  </li>
            <li>Love it and my old kid like to tease the boy</li>
            <li>I started using CJ&#x27;s Butter when my son was first born and have bought it ever since.</li>
            <li>The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the pot crystallized pretty soon after we got it.</li>
            <li>The one that I bought on amazon was liquidy and very grainy.</li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t really had any issues whatsoever with diaper rashes since.</li>
            <li>Great diapercream for the boy and his cloth diapered behind.</li>
            <li>I thought this harsh winter would exacerbate it again like it does with mines, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I had heard good things about this product, especially from other cloth diapering mothers</li>
            <li>he has pretty sensitive skin, including eczema.</li>
            <li>The Dr&#x27;s advice was to not use soap, no matter how gentle on a daily basis but rather every other day or two even and just bathe them in warm water in between.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I use it for pretty much anything skin and even hair related.  </li>
            <li>Bonus that it also works to clear up baby neck roll rash!</li>
            <li>I bought this online, and another jar from a Natural Baby store.</li>
            <li>The jar that I bought at the Natural Baby store, was soft and creamy.</li>
            <li>I use this stuff after baths, on my hair, on my feet, on my 3 yr old toddler who is prone to eczema, on my lips.</li>
            <li>Right after their bath I still put Earth Mama Angel Baby Lotion on them since it&#x27;s aloe leaf juice based (also soothing for dry skin) and essentially seal the moisture in their skin using this product.  </li>
            <li>;) We&#x27;ve been cloth diapering for about a year and a half now and started using it then.</li>
            <li>but my husband keeps demanding the Monkey Farts for our 2 year old son.</li>
            <li>It is thick and creamy and super moisturizing.</li>

            <li> ;) We&#x27;ve been cloth diapering for about a year and a half now and started using it then.</li>
            <li> but my husband keeps demanding the Monkey Farts for our 2 year old son.</li>
            <li> It is thick and creamy and super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> We use nothing but CJ&#x27;s Monkey Farts.</li>
            <li> I got the monkey farts scent.</li>
            <li> that monkey farton him all the time.</li>
            <li> One of them is no longer showing any signs of eczema &amp; the other one&#x27;s large patches on his body have decreased in size, almost unnoticeable any longer and his face cleared up completely.  </li>
            <li> I cloth diaper, and this stuff has been invaluable for treating diaper rash, and even dry skin and exema.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll help heal my babies bum from diaper rash and help with her dry skin though.</li>
            <li> It helps clear up any small redness and hasn&#x27;t seemed to cause any residue.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so this jar is going to last me a while.</li>
            <li> I have to say it has done wonders for their dry scaly skin!</li>
            <li> I use it every single day!</li>
            <li> This skin butter works extremely well on my nephew&#x27;s eczema and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> The one that I bought in person works EXTREMELY WELL.</li>
            <li> I like the other scents</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t happened to any of our previous pots, and while it can be fixed with a quick reheat, it&#x27;s just a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> Anytime my boy has some coloration in his diaper area, this knocks it out in less than an hour.</li>
            <li> Compared to other products that are usually 3.50 out 4 per oz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a softer scent unlike some products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> My twins both had bad eczema from about 4 months old.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Love this stuff. I use it as diaper cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this online, and another jar from a Natural Baby store. The one that I bought on amazon was liquidy and very grainy. The jar that I bought at the Natural Baby store, was soft and creamy. I will not be buying this online again. The one that I bought in person works EXTREMELY WELL. I cloth diaper, and this stuff has been invaluable for treating diaper rash, and even dry skin and exema.</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite diaper cream ever. Anytime my boy has some coloration in his diaper area, this knocks it out in less than an hour. My boy gets red whenever he pees and this helps. I use it every diaper change!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine told me to use this on my newborn&#x27;s acne on his face and neck so i ordered it and received it just now... I have to say I already love it for the smell alone!! I will update this review as to how fast it clears up my baby&#x27;s skin!!</li>
            <li> We use nothing but CJ&#x27;s Monkey Farts. I like the other scents but my husband keeps demanding the Monkey Farts for our 2 year old son. ;) We&#x27;ve been cloth diapering for about a year and a half now and started using it then. We haven&#x27;t really had any issues whatsoever with diaper rashes since.</li>
            <li> My twins both had bad eczema from about 4 months old.  I was using Earth Mama Angel Baby and California Baby products only for their skin but once the eczema appeared, I had to find something even more moisturizing.  The Dr&#x27;s advice was to not use soap, no matter how gentle on a daily basis but rather every other day or two even and just bathe them in warm water in between.  I had heard good things about this product, especially from other cloth diapering mothers so I ordered it.  I have to say it has done wonders for their dry scaly skin! Right after their bath I still put Earth Mama Angel Baby Lotion on them since it&#x27;s aloe leaf juice based (also soothing for dry skin) and essentially seal the moisture in their skin using this product.  I had tried this before with baby oil and even cocoa butter but those didn&#x27;t hold a candle to CJ&#x27;s Butter, and it also smells fantastic! One of them is no longer showing any signs of eczema &amp; the other one&#x27;s large patches on his body have decreased in size, almost unnoticeable any longer and his face cleared up completely.  I thought this harsh winter would exacerbate it again like it does with mines, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous. Nice scent and leaves my sons tushie smooth and rash free. Been using it for a year now. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff! I am going to buy some for a friend that is expecting. I got the monkey farts scent. I love it. Smells like bananas and bubblegum. A little bit goes a long way, so this jar is going to last me a while. I put it on my baby&#x27;s bottom with almost every diaper change. Will buy more when this is gone!</li>
            <li> Received it and it was grainy....</li>
            <li> I bought this after it was recommended to be by another mother who cloth diapers and this is wonderful. After one use my son&#x27;s redness and irritation was dramatically improved. I&#x27;m so happy!  And the smell is nice. It&#x27;s a softer scent unlike some products I have used in the past. Reminds me of banana smoothies (which I love).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tested this on myself for a sunburn (remembered sunscreen fit the kids and forgot my own lol). Figured if there were going to be issues with burning or oily reside I&#x27;d see it on me. A little goes a long way but it is soothing. I also observed on myself how the redness began to diminish gradually and by that night was looking much better. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and if price is an issue, do the math. 20/8 is about 2.50 per oz. Compared to other products that are usually 3.50 out 4 per oz.</li>
            <li> greasy....does nothing for diaper rash</li>
            <li> Smells like bubblegum or cotton candy.  A bit fragrant for my liking.  I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll help heal my babies bum from diaper rash and help with her dry skin though.</li>
            <li> Light, effective, and smells amazing! Definitely worth the $. We don&#x27;t even use cloth diapers.</li>
            <li> I started using CJ&#x27;s Butter when my son was first born and have bought it ever since. he has pretty sensitive skin, including eczema. I used CJ&#x27;s butter as a diaper ointment, lotion, and face cream. It works wonders and has helped with his eczema tremendously!</li>
            <li> Smells great! The texture is awesome, goes on babies bottom easy! As of yet no opinion on effectiveness on bottom rash.</li>
            <li> We picked up CJ&#x27;s BUTTer after using California Baby cream for a while. When my son started teething (and drooling) heavily, he became really rashy. After one diaper change with CJ&#x27;s the rash is noticeably lighter. It also washes out of our cloth diapers with no staining or repelling. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is a very simple product that I could probably make yourself, but I would rather not. lol The smell is AWESOME! I use this stuff after baths, on my hair, on my feet, on my 3 yr old toddler who is prone to eczema, on my lips. I use it every single day! Will def buy again!</li>
            <li> We love CJ&#x27;s BUTTer for our daughter, since we cloth diaper. It helps clear up any small redness and hasn&#x27;t seemed to cause any residue. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the pot crystallized pretty soon after we got it. This hasn&#x27;t happened to any of our previous pots, and while it can be fixed with a quick reheat, it&#x27;s just a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> Does not affect absorbability of cloth diapers while providing a sweet-smelling barrier against diaper rashes.  And really, it smells SO GOOD!</li>
            <li> My baby&#x27;s bottom is completely rash free!  I use it for pretty much anything skin and even hair related.  Smell is great too, cant wait to try more sents.</li>
            <li> This skin butter works extremely well on my nephew&#x27;s eczema and dry skin.  It is thick and creamy and super moisturizing. I purchased it for him because of the great reviews and, as he is a 9 year old boy, I knew he would think that the name of the scent, Monkey Farts, was hilarious.  I was surprised to find the scent, a soft blend of bananas and vanilla, very pleasant, and it was a hit with the whole family, including my nephew.  I highly recommend the product and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Great diapercream for the boy and his cloth diapered behind. Does not stain or ruin absorbancy of the diapers. Bonus that it also works to clear up baby neck roll rash! Love it and my old kid like to tease the boy that monkey farton him all the time.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It has helped cleared up my daughter&#x27;s rash (and keep it at bay!) very nicely. We will definitely continue using it in the future.</li>
