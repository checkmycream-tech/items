            <li>I love the size.</li>
            <li>I love the powder puff...</li>
            <li>Love it for applying powder though</li>
            <li>and then if you purchased more than one the shipping price was doubled and then tripled and so on for each puff purchased.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s washable.  </li>
            <li>I thought it&#x27;d be more substantial</li>
            <li>The Victoria Vougue Loose Powder Puff is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>I got what I paid for - a cheap powder puff.</li>
            <li>in my 3&amp;#34; compact, from the looks of it, i thought it would fit, but its a &amp;#34;big&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This powder puff is great for loose makeup powder.  </li>
            <li>Great Quality, just what I expected</li>
            <li>My husband uses this to put powder on, like in the summer when he gets super hot in areas, the size is great, there is a little &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; you can use to help you smooth over body.</li>
            <li>Good size, collects enough powder to be useful, soft.</li>
            <li>The loose powder is easy to apply with the puff and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>The first one I purchased was in some store, but when I went looking to purchase another, I couldn&#x27;t find a store that carried this brand or size.</li>
            <li>I will definitely make this purchase again; however, I purchased 4 just to play it safe.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted-</li>
            <li>A first quality product.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>yet i was charged a large shipihng and handling</li>
            <li>I love this &amp;#34;old time&amp;#34; velvet powder puff for loose powder application.  </li>
            <li>This Victoria Vogue powder puff is of very high quality material.  </li>
            <li>I like the size of it, because it just makes quick face blotting that much quicker and more discreet, but as I mentioned, the larger size does require some ingenuity for storage/use with your smaller compacts.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of the puff.  </li>
            <li>Cosmetic Solutions made the&lt;br /&gt;puchase for postage reasonable and the package was received very promptly.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Cosmetic Solutions.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Funny thing - a young girl who answered the phone at one of the stores</li>
            <li>I have not been able to locate powder puffs in local stores for several years.</li>
            <li>but I was hoping they were just a tad larger like the ones you get for bath dusting powder, but they are adequate.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I would highly recommend the purchase of this powder puff.  </li>
            <li>; but I wanted one a little more plush.</li>
            <li>Very obsorbant and soft, and</li>
            <li>could not find anything in the stores where i live.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t dare do it before getting a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has however worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;Since these are hard to obtain here, I am enjoying the ease of applying body powder without decorating everything else.</li>
            <li>The powder puff is exactly what I wanted - big and puffy.  </li>
            <li>These are not so easy to find at low prices and not at all in town... makes dusting yourself with powders, either frangrant or medicated much more controled so you waste less.</li>
            <li>Ribbon is too large to hold my hand properly.</li>
            <li>it has a soft feel and yet holds it&#x27;s shape, will order again.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S SO SOFT &amp; SMOOTHS</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s a little too big for my loose powder container, I kind of bunch it up</li>
            <li>Some of the other puffs were a little larger but the cost of shipping was all most as much as the cost of the puff</li>
            <li>I ordered some dark blue towels from Amazon, and they shed so much that my old powder puff was covered in blue lint.  </li>
            <li>I only wish that it were a little thicker, it doesn&#x27;t hold very much powder</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Ribbon is too large to hold my hand properly. Hard to hold properly.</li>
            <li> My 84-year-old mother could not find any powder puffs in our town.  So I called around to make sure.  Funny thing - a young girl who answered the phone at one of the stores said, \\&quot; What?  What are powder puffs?\\&quot;  Thank you for your product!</li>
            <li> This powder puff is great for loose makeup powder.  When they quit selling them in my local drug store, I decided to look on Amazon. Thank goodness I found them!</li>
            <li> produt ok  a power puff weighs almost nothing  yet i was charged a large shipihng and handling</li>
            <li> The Victoria Vougue Loose Powder Puff is wonderful!  I love the size. However, I use it to apply my press powder as well. The coverage is wonderful!! Thank you Amazon for making this purchase possible. The first one I purchased was in some store, but when I went looking to purchase another, I couldn&#x27;t find a store that carried this brand or size. I will definitely make this purchase again; however, I purchased 4 just to play it safe.</li>
            <li> I love the powder puff...it has a soft feel and yet holds it&#x27;s shape, will order again. Just ordered another one as an extra.  AAA+++</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking all over Phoenix for these puffs and my daughter told me to check Amazon----lo and behold there they were. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted- a larger puff (approx. 3 in.- maybe a smidge bigger). The material holds the powder well and distributes evenly on my face. Bonus- you can hand wash the puff over and over and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> could not find anything in the stores where i live.  knew i could find it online and I did!!!!!!  Just what i wanted.</li>
            <li> After a few washes of the powder puff, it loses its softness (which is expected). Love it for applying powder though</li>

            <li> This Victoria Vogue powder puff is of very high quality material.  I really like the feel of the puff.  Therefore, I would highly recommend the purchase of this powder puff.  DAME HILDA VAN WINKLE</li>
            <li> I got what I paid for - a cheap powder puff. It has held up for a while, so no complaints. I only wish that it were a little thicker, it doesn&#x27;t hold very much powder and I use it for setting my makeup.</li>
            <li> I have been everywhere to try and get this item. Should have known fromthestart to go to Amazon!&lt;br /&gt; I orderd 2 and they are just what I wanted. Needed them for use with  my Gold Bond!</li>
            <li> Bought this to go with Coty Powder, also purchased through Amazon, as a 94th birthday gift for a friend&#x27;s mother.  She was thrilled!  And so was I.</li>
            <li> It is great!  I ordered some dark blue towels from Amazon, and they shed so much that my old powder puff was covered in blue lint.  I needed to replace it, and the last time I washed one, it fell apart, so I didn&#x27;t dare do it before getting a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one was just as expected, I think I can even wash it!  Good size, collects enough powder to be useful, soft. Great!</li>
            <li> Fair quality and overpriced.</li>
            <li> I love using talc powder and these are perfect for the application.  Would order again. Good product and good quality.</li>
            <li> I GAVE PUFF THE BEST RATING BECAUSE IT DESERVED IT.  I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE THAT USES LOOSE POWDER. IT&#x27;S SO SOFT &amp; SMOOTHS ON POWDER FLAWLESSLY. I&#x27;VE LOOKED A LONG TIME FOR  A PUFF OF THIS QUALITY.</li>
            <li> very soft, perfect size.</li>
            <li> When I received this package I was delighted. I have not been able to locate powder puffs in local stores for several years. The puffs were a very nice size.

Some of the other puffs were a little larger but the cost of shipping was all most as much as the cost of the puff and then if you purchased more than one the shipping price was doubled and then tripled and so on for each puff purchased. Cosmetic Solutions made the&lt;br /&gt;puchase for postage reasonable and the package was received very promptly. Thank you so much Cosmetic Solutions.</li>
            <li> was not as big as i thought it would be..it works</li>
            <li> Good quality. Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love this puff!  Even though it&#x27;s a little too big for my loose powder container, I kind of bunch it up and it fits.  When I go to use it, I just give it a quick shake, and it fluffs out perfectly.  Very obsorbant and soft, and I love that it&#x27;s washable.  I like the size of it, because it just makes quick face blotting that much quicker and more discreet, but as I mentioned, the larger size does require some ingenuity for storage/use with your smaller compacts. Over all, I like this product.</li>
            <li> wish the size of the puff was listed on package, its about 3 3/4&amp;#34; around and too big to&lt;br /&gt;stay in my 3&amp;#34; compact, from the looks of it, i thought it would fit, but its a &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; powder&lt;br /&gt;puff, be warned!</li>
            <li> Smooths out your makeup for flawless skin.</li>
            <li> I thought it&#x27;d be more substantial</li>
            <li> Nice; but I wanted one a little more plush.</li>
            <li> The powder puff is exactly what I wanted - big and puffy.  The loose powder is easy to apply with the puff and goes on smoothly.  Great product!  I would order it again.</li>
            <li> These powder puffs were good but I was hoping they were just a tad larger like the ones you get for bath dusting powder, but they are adequate.</li>
            <li> i do not want this item and it totally was not what i was expencting&lt;br /&gt;i am trying to figure out how to return it</li>
            <li> Great Quality, just what I expected</li>
            <li> I love this &amp;#34;old time&amp;#34; velvet powder puff for loose powder application.  I have tried several brushes and always end up with powder all over my clothes.  This is perfect and reminds me of the ones my mom used when I was a girl.</li>
            <li> These are not so easy to find at low prices and not at all in town... makes dusting yourself with powders, either frangrant or medicated much more controled so you waste less.</li>
