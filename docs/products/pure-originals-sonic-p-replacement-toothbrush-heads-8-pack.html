            <li>and I love them!</li>
            <li>These are a cheap and great alternative to buying the name brand heads.</li>
            <li>thats amazing and at this price.</li>
            <li>Amazing value.</li>
            <li>After using three brushes, each on a four-month cycle, I deem them as good or better than the originals:  </li>
            <li>Nice items...will be handy</li>
            <li>good quality would buy again for sure</li>
            <li>Bought the real deal replacements and they work great!</li>
            <li>Good to start, but the cleaning after 2 weeks is not as good as the original that has been in use for 4 months.</li>
            <li>These fit almost perfect and clean well.</li>
            <li>The heads do clean well, so I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>excellent purchase-much more reasonable price than ones in store..</li>
            <li>Very well, the service is very good also</li>
            <li>Thrilled I found more affordable replacements for my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Work just as good at the original for me.</li>
            <li>Good product; good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>At any rate, once the first couple days&#x27; use are over they feel great and the price point is waaaay easier to stomach.</li>
            <li>Good quality and fabulous value, these heads fit perfectly and are completely functional.</li>
            <li>Better than the name brand.  </li>
            <li>This fit on flawlessly and seem to perform nearly as well as the stock head the brush came with.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure which model I had, but it fits...</li>
            <li>What more could you ask?</li>
            <li>These sure helped reduce the cost to replace the sonic toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>All the better to scrape&#x27;um plaque</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll use them until they are gone and then decide if i want to order more or not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and so glad I ordered them.</li>
            <li>great buy on these, fit fine and worth the cost for sure</li>
            <li>Ok for the price, 1 out of 8 doesnt fit perfect, ok no big deal.</li>
            <li>They stand up pretty good to time.</li>
            <li>Teeth are sooo clean!</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t fit the toothbrush head as snug as the originals therefore vibrate more and can cause toothpaste to get into the electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>I have the Easy Clean Sonicare, and i was worried these wouldn&#x27;t work, but they do!</li>
            <li>Other than that they are perfect!</li>
            <li>Bristles come out easily.  </li>
            <li>no these are not as good as the sonicare  brand but for the price so far them seem ok.  </li>
            <li>These brush heads fit my Sonicare perfectly well, but they are noticeably harder than the Philips-made brushes.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are fine, but these heads vibrate a lot compared to the heads that my Sonicare came with.</li>
            <li>They are fine with mine.</li>
            <li>I will never pay full price for Sonic Toothbrush Heads ever, 2nd time ordering these brushes and great on the budget :)</li>
            <li>so the 1st and 2nd brushes stayed on fine and worked great.</li>
            <li>This is a great value and I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>Ended up breaking my sonicare while attempting to press on these cheap imitations...</li>
            <li>The bristles are perfect, but the connector does not hold firm.  </li>
            <li>They fit well</li>
            <li>The cost is great compared to 1-3 for same price-</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re a fantastic value.</li>
            <li>Been using these for about 2 months now and they have held up well vs the original ones.</li>
            <li>super cheap.</li>
            <li>These are super cheaply made.</li>
            <li>But they are also super cheap so don&#x27;t be expecting sonicare quality.</li>
            <li>It might not be 100% as good, but it&#x27;s at least 90% as good-- and for that you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>China is amazing how the 1st gen people had issues and all have been fixed</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with my purchase and will buy again in the future.  </li>
            <li>In fact, they look exactly like the original heads except for not having the Sonicare name stamped on them.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely no problems with these generic replacement heads, an excellent value.</li>
            <li>It looks a little silly in the mirror (unless you play woodwind instruments) but 2 minutes of silliness a day is worth 24 hours of great looking teeth, at a very good price.</li>
            <li>I use the sonicare healthy white model.</li>
            <li>and what i love about it is it brings the rings underneath in different colors</li>
            <li>The package was well wrapped in bubble wrap and the two packages of heads were exactly as shown in the photos.  </li>
            <li>These heads are working very well and were offered at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give these generic tooth brush heads 1 star, is because I was ultimately able to get them to fit on my name brand Phillips SonicCare toothbrush</li>
            <li>Amazing just like the original the old version of this was too soft the new ones are the same as the originals</li>
            <li>I certainly won&#x27;t purchase them again.</li>
            <li>Certainly acceptable shipping time.  </li>
            <li>These fit much better/sturdier than the last knock-offs I purchased.</li>
            <li>For starters, these didn&#x27;t easily fit on the toothbrush, and there is quite the discernible gap between the toothbrush head and where it should sit on the toothbrush that is not present with the name brand heads (see picture).</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have as much support at the connection between the toothbrush and the handle.</li>
            <li>For a family of 5 $90-100 is too much every 6 mths for brush heads.  </li>
            <li>but much rather buy these than the overpriced name brand.</li>
            <li>They look like the real deal</li>
            <li>Look cheap..... use it for a short time</li>
            <li>I will seek the genuine replacements by the manufacturer in the future.</li>
            <li>Really, they cost nothing</li>
            <li>Worked very well.</li>
            <li>They fit tightly, just like the original heads.  </li>
            <li>had one shed a few bristles but clean teeth just fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are sold as a fit for my particular Sonicare model, so I tried 3 different brush heads and</li>
            <li>The extreme pitch of the bristle indents is notable.  </li>
            <li>Only problem I have with them is they are a bit too soft and don&#x27;t fit on the peg in my sterilizer compartment.</li>
            <li>They are nice and soft and they last just as long as the legit ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As if the fit wasn&#x27;t enough of a reason for me to be less than satisfied with this purchase, the bristles were somehow too rough and scratchy (for lack of better phrasing) against my gums, and too fragile and soft for my teeth at the same time (soft in the sense that they are less secure and more mobile - not delicate on my gums).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I love a bargain, I strongly recommend going with the name-brand on this particular item, and needless to say, I will not be re-purchasing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, dont want to just throw away the rest if I can &amp;#34;make&amp;#34; them fit good enough to use, but I dont think ill be buying these again.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I&#x27;ll stick with the generic, but they are plenty good in the meantime.</li>
            <li>(2)Like the originals, they seem to not loose stiffness, or bristles, by the end of the cycles (their &amp;#34;wear indicators&amp;#34; are phony, rather than just deceptive, such as those on the original brushes.)</li>
            <li>Fortunately the elastic sleeve around the pin should prevent any toothpaste or other debris from entering the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I can live with that.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that given the price I could live with these...</li>
            <li>Toothbrush meets Saturday Night Live skit...</li>
            <li>By using very little pressure, one helps the brush&#x27;s gripping mechanism keep the brush on the pin, while not affecting the vibration modes to any noticeable extent.  </li>
            <li>and I would return them if they weren&#x27;t so cheap and are not worth it.</li>
            <li>At first I thought the grooves cut into the lengh of the brush head were just cut too deep.  </li>
            <li>the grooves were pretty the same for both brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Save yourself a lot of money, same thing as much higher priced brands.</li>
            <li>These are the exact same brushes as the ones that are 2 for $26.00.</li>
            <li>Since its been a while since I purchased these and cannot return them, I think I may try dropping in a little drop of super glue inside the hole and letting it dry to help create a &amp;#34;tighter&amp;#34; fit when it goes on the handle</li>
            <li>used once, seem fine, but a little softer than sonicare refills.</li>
            <li>Fits perfectly fine maybe a little gap but doesnt affect the effectivness of the sonic vibrations.</li>
            <li>A little softer than name brand but fit and work</li>
            <li>These a slightly stiffer than the original replacements.</li>
            <li>Slightly softer than the original brand name.</li>
            <li>I have been using one for about a week and a half, and so far it works as well as the original ProResults brush head.  </li>
            <li>I buy soft tooth brushes.  </li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t completely fall apart</li>
            <li>no problems so far.  </li>
            <li>Really like that it has the different color bands on the bottom of the brush head.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised--</li>
            <li>They fit my toothbrush with no problem and feel the same in my mouth as their much more expensive cousins.  </li>
            <li>They might be a tiny bit softer than the original, but certainly not much.  </li>
            <li>does not fit quite as snug as the original</li>
            <li>only drawback that I could see was that the internal gripping mechanism that is supposed to keep the brush on the holding pin would break in a couple of weeks without a little effort on the user&#x27;s part.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s really not too much to say here!</li>
            <li>now otherwise I would try the rest of the package, but my advice is if you buy these, try all 8 in the first few days and make sure they stay on when in use otherwise its a waste when only 1 or 2 out of the while package work.</li>
            <li>However I compared it to the last new Walmart replacement brush that I had and</li>
            <li>The first few times I used a new one it was almost like brushing with steel cabling.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are super stiff which causes them to just BOUNCE around your teeth.  </li>
            <li>But these are so soft, it doesnt feel like you brushed your teeth..</li>
            <li>Does not fit securely however keeping index finger slightly touching base works to keep head from slipping off during use for the price better then returning.</li>
            <li>Great alternative to the expensive replacement heads!!</li>
            <li>I took scissors and cut the high bristles down somewhat to minimize the bouncing agaist my teeth.  </li>

            <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase and will buy again in the future.  </li>
            <li> In fact, they look exactly like the original heads except for not having the Sonicare name stamped on them.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no problems with these generic replacement heads, an excellent value.</li>
            <li> It looks a little silly in the mirror (unless you play woodwind instruments) but 2 minutes of silliness a day is worth 24 hours of great looking teeth, at a very good price.</li>
            <li> I use the sonicare healthy white model.</li>
            <li> and what i love about it is it brings the rings underneath in different colors</li>
            <li> The package was well wrapped in bubble wrap and the two packages of heads were exactly as shown in the photos.  </li>
            <li> These heads are working very well and were offered at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give these generic tooth brush heads 1 star, is because I was ultimately able to get them to fit on my name brand Phillips SonicCare toothbrush</li>
            <li> Amazing just like the original the old version of this was too soft the new ones are the same as the originals</li>
            <li> I certainly won&#x27;t purchase them again.</li>
            <li> Certainly acceptable shipping time.  </li>
            <li> These fit much better/sturdier than the last knock-offs I purchased.</li>
            <li> For starters, these didn&#x27;t easily fit on the toothbrush, and there is quite the discernible gap between the toothbrush head and where it should sit on the toothbrush that is not present with the name brand heads (see picture).</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have as much support at the connection between the toothbrush and the handle.</li>
            <li> For a family of 5 $90-100 is too much every 6 mths for brush heads.  </li>
            <li> but much rather buy these than the overpriced name brand.</li>
            <li> They look like the real deal</li>
            <li> Look cheap..... use it for a short time</li>
            <li> I will seek the genuine replacements by the manufacturer in the future.</li>
            <li> Really, they cost nothing</li>
            <li> Worked very well.</li>
            <li> They fit tightly, just like the original heads.  </li>
            <li> had one shed a few bristles but clean teeth just fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are sold as a fit for my particular Sonicare model, so I tried 3 different brush heads and</li>
            <li> The extreme pitch of the bristle indents is notable.  </li>
            <li> Only problem I have with them is they are a bit too soft and don&#x27;t fit on the peg in my sterilizer compartment.</li>
            <li> They are nice and soft and they last just as long as the legit ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As if the fit wasn&#x27;t enough of a reason for me to be less than satisfied with this purchase, the bristles were somehow too rough and scratchy (for lack of better phrasing) against my gums, and too fragile and soft for my teeth at the same time (soft in the sense that they are less secure and more mobile - not delicate on my gums).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I love a bargain, I strongly recommend going with the name-brand on this particular item, and needless to say, I will not be re-purchasing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , dont want to just throw away the rest if I can &amp;#34;make&amp;#34; them fit good enough to use, but I dont think ill be buying these again.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll stick with the generic, but they are plenty good in the meantime.</li>
            <li> (2)Like the originals, they seem to not loose stiffness, or bristles, by the end of the cycles (their &amp;#34;wear indicators&amp;#34; are phony, rather than just deceptive, such as those on the original brushes.)</li>
            <li> Fortunately the elastic sleeve around the pin should prevent any toothpaste or other debris from entering the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that given the price I could live with these...</li>
            <li> Toothbrush meets Saturday Night Live skit...</li>
            <li> By using very little pressure, one helps the brush&#x27;s gripping mechanism keep the brush on the pin, while not affecting the vibration modes to any noticeable extent.  </li>
            <li> and I would return them if they weren&#x27;t so cheap and are not worth it.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the grooves cut into the lengh of the brush head were just cut too deep.  </li>
            <li> the grooves were pretty the same for both brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Save yourself a lot of money, same thing as much higher priced brands.</li>
            <li> These are the exact same brushes as the ones that are 2 for $26.00.</li>
            <li> Since its been a while since I purchased these and cannot return them, I think I may try dropping in a little drop of super glue inside the hole and letting it dry to help create a &amp;#34;tighter&amp;#34; fit when it goes on the handle</li>
            <li> used once, seem fine, but a little softer than sonicare refills.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly fine maybe a little gap but doesnt affect the effectivness of the sonic vibrations.</li>
            <li> A little softer than name brand but fit and work</li>
            <li> These a slightly stiffer than the original replacements.</li>
            <li> Slightly softer than the original brand name.</li>
            <li> I have been using one for about a week and a half, and so far it works as well as the original ProResults brush head.  </li>
            <li> I buy soft tooth brushes.  </li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t completely fall apart</li>
            <li> no problems so far.  </li>
            <li> Really like that it has the different color bands on the bottom of the brush head.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised--</li>
            <li> They fit my toothbrush with no problem and feel the same in my mouth as their much more expensive cousins.  </li>
            <li> They might be a tiny bit softer than the original, but certainly not much.  </li>
            <li> does not fit quite as snug as the original</li>
            <li> only drawback that I could see was that the internal gripping mechanism that is supposed to keep the brush on the holding pin would break in a couple of weeks without a little effort on the user&#x27;s part.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really not too much to say here!</li>
            <li> now otherwise I would try the rest of the package, but my advice is if you buy these, try all 8 in the first few days and make sure they stay on when in use otherwise its a waste when only 1 or 2 out of the while package work.</li>
            <li> However I compared it to the last new Walmart replacement brush that I had and</li>
            <li> The first few times I used a new one it was almost like brushing with steel cabling.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are super stiff which causes them to just BOUNCE around your teeth.  </li>
            <li> But these are so soft, it doesnt feel like you brushed your teeth..</li>
            <li> Does not fit securely however keeping index finger slightly touching base works to keep head from slipping off during use for the price better then returning.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to the expensive replacement heads!!</li>
            <li> I took scissors and cut the high bristles down somewhat to minimize the bouncing agaist my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Each head has a different color band at its base which is good for multiple users.  </li>
            <li> No lost bristles so far, and staying tightly packed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The gap between them and the handle is a little excessive, but it discourages trying to get a too tight a fit, which stifles the vibration of the brush, and could cause the holding pin to be loosened.</li>
            <li> they feel a little different then the originals heads, but with the amount you are getting with the price, i wouldn&#x27;t mind having a different feeling.</li>
            <li> Mine don&#x27;t have the reinforcing metal band where they attach to the handle so before long they break and fall off, especially if you remove the brush from the handle a few times.  </li>
            <li> 3rd wouldnt stay on the handle when turned on - seemed a little bit loose.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t fit the Sonicare UV sanitizer station (others noted this as well) which makes it awkward to use (have to shove in and close the door</li>
            <li> Furthermore, these simply did not fit in the attached UV sanitizer slot (see picture with Phillips brand head for comparison).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rough, Scratchy, Soft/Fragile Bristles.</li>
            <li> They are too rough on my teeth and the bristles come off.  </li>
            <li> They do the job minimally</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;little effort&amp;#34; required, I&#x27;ve found, was simply putting the tip of the index finger of the hand not holding the brush on top of the base of the brush while brushing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was skeptical about how these would work but have been pleasantly surprised so far.</li>
            <li> Not as stiff (your Dentist will recommend this) and last longer.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical given some of the reviews and the price but took a chance anyway as I don&#x27;t believe they should charge as much as they do for the regular priced replacements.</li>
            <li> (may need to push down a little harder to get them on snug) and I haven&#x27;t had any of the issues other reviewers mention.</li>
            <li> Certainly however for the price you cannot go wrong with these in comparison to the Sonicare in my opinion, as long as you can look past the issues.</li>
            <li> Sometimes cheaper is just that......cheaper but not useful.  </li>
            <li> They might be good for cleaning the grout between tile for those of us stuck with a bad purchase!!!!</li>
            <li> (1)They do not need to be forced on so they less likely to pull the holding pin out of the handle when removed.</li>
            <li> There is a slight gap where the head attaches but it does not effect the end result.</li>
            <li> Still half the cost of buying in a grocery store</li>
            <li> , they feel slightly softer than the sonicare ones.</li>
            <li> For the price I could care less.</li>
            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> However they are firm and $25 less than the name brand.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit tightly down on the sonic base.  </li>
            <li> not worth it!</li>
            <li> They seem to wear out a little faster than the Sonic brand, but they work well.</li>
            <li> They do not really fit and are noisy and bulky</li>
            <li> Does not fit the toothbrush well</li>
            <li> Does not fit in the attached UV sanitizer</li>
            <li> It does not fit well as stated by the seller, and they break when you pull them off the handle.</li>
            <li> Does not fit Phillips sonicare</li>
            <li> A waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Yes they are a but stiff but seem to loosen up a bit after some use.  </li>
            <li> They slightly buzz if you brush a little too hard.</li>
            <li> Purchased these as a more cost efficient replacement of Sonicare heads which have gotten crazy expensive ($39.99 for 6 and thats with a discount and from a discount warehouse !)</li>
            <li> Not sure if the picture showed that band or not when I bought mine.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable price.</li>
            <li> Fits like a glove for 3/4 less of the cost!!</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks they almost immediately vibrate off, and I find them uncomfortable due to their stiff bristles.  </li>
            <li> My gums don&#x27;t bleed because the brissels aren&#x27;t too hard.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it probably costs them about $0.10 to make one of these things.</li>
            <li> but alas, they are not good.  </li>
            <li> but Ill buy again.</li>
            <li> Like others I purchased these brushes as replacements instead of the overly expensive &amp;#34;sonic brand&amp;#34; replacement brushes and the moderately expensive &amp;</li>
            <li> I hope it is something I am doing wrong.  </li>
            <li> They make my wife&#x27;s gums bleed and hurt really bad to the point where she cant use it.</li>
            <li> To put it mildly, I hate these brushes.  </li>
            <li> One brush did tend to separate at the base though and got thrown away.</li>
            <li> They do not look like the picture at the base.  </li>
            <li> Tend to fall apart at the base</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> terrible knock off!</li>
            <li> Awful,,,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying but the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Better than the name brand.  Not as stiff (your Dentist will recommend this) and last longer.  Great buy and I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> This fit on flawlessly and seem to perform nearly as well as the stock head the brush came with. It might not be 100% as good, but it&#x27;s at least 90% as good-- and for that you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Good fit and function great on the ultrasonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These work great with my Sonicare HealthyWhite electric toothbrush HX6711/02. There is a slight gap where the head attaches but it does not effect the end result. This is a great value and I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Just received, but UPS left in unclosed plastic bag in the pouring rain/snow.&lt;br /&gt;Only used once, seem fine, but a little softer than sonicare refills.</li>
            <li> terrible knock off! not worth it! waist of money.</li>
            <li> super cheap. fits perfectly. does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Very well, the service is very good also</li>
            <li> Ended up breaking my sonicare while attempting to press on these cheap imitations...</li>
            <li> Good product; good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are not as good as the one that came with the Sonic itself.  The bristles divide and cut into the gums.  I&#x27;ll use them but I will replace them with something else.  (My dental hygienist recommends the round-bristle heads.)</li>
            <li> The bristles are fine, but these heads vibrate a lot compared to the heads that my Sonicare came with.</li>
            <li> After using three brushes, each on a four-month cycle, I deem them as good or better than the originals:  (1)They do not need to be forced on so they less likely to pull the holding pin out of the handle when removed. (2)Like the originals, they seem to not loose stiffness, or bristles, by the end of the cycles (their &amp;#34;wear indicators&amp;#34; are phony, rather than just deceptive, such as those on the original brushes.) (3) The gap between them and the handle is a little excessive, but it discourages trying to get a too tight a fit, which stifles the vibration of the brush, and could cause the holding pin to be loosened. Fortunately the elastic sleeve around the pin should prevent any toothpaste or other debris from entering the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback that I could see was that the internal gripping mechanism that is supposed to keep the brush on the holding pin would break in a couple of weeks without a little effort on the user&#x27;s part.  The &amp;#34;little effort&amp;#34; required, I&#x27;ve found, was simply putting the tip of the index finger of the hand not holding the brush on top of the base of the brush while brushing.  By using very little pressure, one helps the brush&#x27;s gripping mechanism keep the brush on the pin, while not affecting the vibration modes to any noticeable extent.  It looks a little silly in the mirror (unless you play woodwind instruments) but 2 minutes of silliness a day is worth 24 hours of great looking teeth, at a very good price.</li>
            <li> I do not like them and I would return them if they weren&#x27;t so cheap and are not worth it. They do not really fit and are noisy and bulky</li>
            <li> Nice items...will be handy</li>
            <li> Does not fit securely however keeping index finger slightly touching base works to keep head from slipping off during use for the price better then returning.</li>
            <li> I have the Easy Clean Sonicare, and i was worried these wouldn&#x27;t work, but they do! they feel a little different then the originals heads, but with the amount you are getting with the price, i wouldn&#x27;t mind having a different feeling.</li>
            <li> I have a sonic care toothbrush &amp; this is the perfect size for it. My gums don&#x27;t bleed because the brissels aren&#x27;t too hard.</li>
            <li> They make my wife&#x27;s gums bleed and hurt really bad to the point where she cant use it. They are fine with mine.</li>
            <li> Work great.  Great price.  I paid $6.09.</li>
            <li> I buy soft tooth brushes.  But these are so soft, it doesnt feel like you brushed your teeth.. This is one of those, you get what you pay for.. Awful,,,</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit tightly down on the sonic base.  I certainly won&#x27;t purchase them again.</li>
            <li> Leaves a gap between the head and toothbrush and you can feel the lower quality of the bristles. However they are firm and $25 less than the name brand. Not sure if I&#x27;ll stick with the generic, but they are plenty good in the meantime.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give these generic tooth brush heads 1 star, is because I was ultimately able to get them to fit on my name brand Phillips SonicCare toothbrush well *enough* to get them to work, and they didn&#x27;t completely fall apart *yet*. For starters, these didn&#x27;t easily fit on the toothbrush, and there is quite the discernible gap between the toothbrush head and where it should sit on the toothbrush that is not present with the name brand heads (see picture). Furthermore, these simply did not fit in the attached UV sanitizer slot (see picture with Phillips brand head for comparison).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if the fit wasn&#x27;t enough of a reason for me to be less than satisfied with this purchase, the bristles were somehow too rough and scratchy (for lack of better phrasing) against my gums, and too fragile and soft for my teeth at the same time (soft in the sense that they are less secure and more mobile - not delicate on my gums).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I love a bargain, I strongly recommend going with the name-brand on this particular item, and needless to say, I will not be re-purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Fits the name brand toothbrush (sort of)&lt;br /&gt;-Excellent Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Does not fit the toothbrush well (gap)&lt;br /&gt;- Does not fit in the attached UV sanitizer&lt;br /&gt;- Rough, Scratchy, Soft/Fragile Bristles.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. These a slightly stiffer than the original replacements. They stand up pretty good to time. But they are not made the same. They slightly buzz if you brush a little too hard. They don&#x27;t have as much support at the connection between the toothbrush and the handle. By you can&#x27;t beat the price. I will use them. My wife probably won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> no these are not as good as the sonicare  brand but for the price so far them seem ok.  Yes they are a but stiff but seem to loosen up a bit after some use.  For a family of 5 $90-100 is too much every 6 mths for brush heads.  but Ill buy again.</li>
            <li> It does not fit well as stated by the seller, and they break when you pull them off the handle.</li>
            <li> these worked perfectly on my sonic toothbrush good quality would buy again for sure I recommend this product to purchase</li>
            <li> Mine don&#x27;t have the reinforcing metal band where they attach to the handle so before long they break and fall off, especially if you remove the brush from the handle a few times.  The current picture appears to show a metal band.  Not sure if the picture showed that band or not when I bought mine.  If you buy them and they don&#x27;t have that metal band, return them.</li>
            <li> excellent purchase-much more reasonable price than ones in store..</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase and will buy again in the future.  Will recomend this place to anyone.</li>
            <li> A little softer than name brand but fit and work well.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;Only had one shed a few bristles but clean teeth just fine.</li>
            <li> I like these heads, they fit my sonic perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great price. Quite a bit softer than the name brand. Fit and work perfectly. Will definitely purchase again. Thrilled I found more affordable replacements for my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Works great for me! 8 for $6!!!! What a steal! Works just like the phillips replacement except 80% cheaper. I like how they are different colors as well since my husband and I use the same unit. Fits perfectly fine maybe a little gap but doesnt affect the effectivness of the sonic vibrations. I use the sonicare healthy white model.</li>
            <li> They are not the OEM quality and they start to wiggle and will fall out after a month or two.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure which model I had, but it fits...</li>
            <li> Like others I purchased these brushes as replacements instead of the overly expensive &amp;#34;sonic brand&amp;#34; replacement brushes and the moderately expensive &amp;#34;WalMart brand&amp;#34; replacement brushes.  To put it mildly, I hate these brushes.  The bristles are super stiff which causes them to just BOUNCE around your teeth.  At first I thought the grooves cut into the lengh of the brush head were just cut too deep.  However I compared it to the last new Walmart replacement brush that I had and the grooves were pretty the same for both brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I took scissors and cut the high bristles down somewhat to minimize the bouncing agaist my teeth.  That didn&#x27;t improve the situation enough for me to want to continue using the brushes.  Sometimes cheaper is just that......cheaper but not useful.  I would NOT recommend these replacement brushes to anyone.  They might be good for cleaning the grout between tile for those of us stuck with a bad purchase!!!!</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and they work. What more could you ask?</li>
            <li> Slightly softer than the original brand name.</li>
            <li> I believe I was brushing my teeth and the end heated and hurt my fingers before.</li>
            <li> These sure helped reduce the cost to replace the sonic toothbrush heads. One brush did tend to separate at the base though and got thrown away. If they fix that, I would give 5 stars. They work well.</li>
            <li> These heads are working very well and were offered at a very reasonable price.  I would definitely purchase them again.</li>
            <li> Bristles come out easily.  Product fits my Sonic brush well, but not flush.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really not too much to say here! I&#x27;ve been using these for a month and they&#x27;re just what I needed. These are a cheap and great alternative to buying the name brand heads. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again when I run out of the current ones.</li>
            <li> Work just as good at the original for me.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable price. Not as good quality as name brand but much rather buy these than the overpriced name brand. Only problem I have with them is they are a bit too soft and don&#x27;t fit on the peg in my sterilizer compartment. With that being said, I still plan to purchase again when I need more.m</li>
            <li> Great for the price but over time while brushing they tend to vibrate off my handle. It&#x27;s annoying but the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> They look like the real deal but sometimes you just don&#x27;t get what you pay for. After about a week or so they started falling off in the middle of my brushing. Not cool. Bought the real deal replacements and they work great! Avoid the discount this time.</li>
            <li> Look cheap..... use it for a short time</li>
            <li> no problems so far.  does not fit quite as snug as the original but this does not seem to effect preformance.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied and will return to reorder.  Still half the cost of buying in a grocery store w/a $4.00 off coupon.</li>
            <li> Amazing just like the original the old version of this was too soft the new ones are the same as the originals and what i love about it is it brings the rings underneath in different colors so tell them apart. Don&#x27;t wast your money on originals. China is amazing how the 1st gen people had issues and all have been fixed thats amazing and at this price.</li>
            <li> These fit much better/sturdier than the last knock-offs I purchased. Really like that it has the different color bands on the bottom of the brush head. They are softer than the name brand but I can live with that. I will definitely re-purchase.</li>
            <li> Amazing value. I don&#x27;t know why anyone would buy the Sonicare brand heads for 200 times (exaggeration) the price. They are nice and soft and they last just as long as the legit ones.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was dubious as the price was so low but they are a perfect fit and the quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> Does not fit Phillips sonicare</li>
            <li> These brush heads fit my Sonicare perfectly well, but they are noticeably harder than the Philips-made brushes.  The first few times I used a new one it was almost like brushing with steel cabling.  All the better to scrape&#x27;um plaque, I suppose...  At any rate, once the first couple days&#x27; use are over they feel great and the price point is waaaay easier to stomach.</li>
            <li> The bristles are perfect, but the connector does not hold firm.  They do not look like the picture at the base.  I will seek the genuine replacements by the manufacturer in the future.</li>
            <li> Good to start, but the cleaning after 2 weeks is not as good as the original that has been in use for 4 months.</li>
            <li> Save yourself a lot of money, same thing as much higher priced brands.</li>
            <li> Unbeatable price and very solid attachments. Save yourself some money - you don&#x27;t need the sonic care name to have a good toothbrush head replacement</li>
            <li> I did not like these.  They are too rough on my teeth and the bristles come off.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical given some of the reviews and the price but took a chance anyway as I don&#x27;t believe they should charge as much as they do for the regular priced replacements. Seriously, it probably costs them about $0.10 to make one of these things. Bottom line is that these work. They fit well (may need to push down a little harder to get them on snug) and I haven&#x27;t had any of the issues other reviewers mention. At the price, you may as well give them a try. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the originals and so inexpensive!</li>
            <li> Good quality and fabulous value, these heads fit perfectly and are completely functional. The only thing different about them is they don&#x27;t have the Philips name on them. Apart from that, they are identical in performance and life.</li>
            <li> Tend to fall apart at the base</li>
            <li> The quality isn&#x27;t as good as the name brand and it doesn&#x27;t have caps.</li>
            <li> Work just like the more expensive name brand brushes.</li>
            <li> on time and as described</li>
            <li> I will never pay full price for Sonic Toothbrush Heads ever, 2nd time ordering these brushes and great on the budget :)</li>
            <li> They work, but bristles do come out. And you could choke or gag yourself on the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use them until they are gone and then decide if i want to order more or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they feel slightly softer than the sonicare ones.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to the expensive replacement heads!!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised-- they are every bit as good as the pricey brand-name products!</li>
            <li> I was hoping that given the price I could live with these... but alas, they are not good.  After 2 weeks they almost immediately vibrate off, and I find them uncomfortable due to their stiff bristles.  I am going to go back to overpaying for the Phillips brushes, seeing as I only have one set of gums..</li>
            <li> Almost as good as the brand name!1 out of 3 of these heads came off during use. For the price I could care less.</li>
            <li> This is GREAT deal in place of name brand product. The cost is great compared to 1-3 for same price- and they arrived in timely manner as well.</li>
            <li> I felt the bristles were perfect and I love them!</li>
            <li> Been using these for about 2 months now and they have held up well vs the original ones. Great product and saved me a nice chunk of cash vs buying the retail ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT -  2016/08/11&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so the 1st and 2nd brushes stayed on fine and worked great. 3rd wouldnt stay on the handle when turned on - seemed a little bit loose. Ok for the price, 1 out of 8 doesnt fit perfect, ok no big deal. So I grab another one and same result as the 3rd, just wont stay on when in use. Im at work now otherwise I would try the rest of the package, but my advice is if you buy these, try all 8 in the first few days and make sure they stay on when in use otherwise its a waste when only 1 or 2 out of the while package work. Since its been a while since I purchased these and cannot return them, I think I may try dropping in a little drop of super glue inside the hole and letting it dry to help create a &amp;#34;tighter&amp;#34; fit when it goes on the handle and hopefully it will stay on when in use, dont want to just throw away the rest if I can &amp;#34;make&amp;#34; them fit good enough to use, but I dont think ill be buying these again.</li>
            <li> I ordered these on a Friday night from The Beauty Store and received them eight days later on Saturday.  Certainly acceptable shipping time.  The package was well wrapped in bubble wrap and the two packages of heads were exactly as shown in the photos.  I have been using one for about a week and a half, and so far it works as well as the original ProResults brush head.  They might be a tiny bit softer than the original, but certainly not much.  No lost bristles so far, and staying tightly packed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using them on an EasyClean model.  They fit tightly, just like the original heads.  In fact, they look exactly like the original heads except for not having the Sonicare name stamped on them.  I will definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> The extreme pitch of the bristle indents is notable.  I can imagine this being an issue for some users. The heads do clean well, so I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Purchased these as a more cost efficient replacement of Sonicare heads which have gotten crazy expensive ($39.99 for 6 and thats with a discount and from a discount warehouse !).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was skeptical about how these would work but have been pleasantly surprised so far. You do feel a quality difference between these and the Sonicare (these feel cheaper) and can feel the individual bristles while in use. Having said that, they still do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said there are 2 issues I have with these 1) they don&#x27;t fit the toothbrush head as snug as the originals therefore vibrate more and can cause toothpaste to get into the electric toothbrush handle 2) they don&#x27;t fit the Sonicare UV sanitizer station (others noted this as well) which makes it awkward to use (have to shove in and close the door quick).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to these I am scoring a 3 for now and will see how they last. Certainly however for the price you cannot go wrong with these in comparison to the Sonicare in my opinion, as long as you can look past the issues.</li>
            <li> These are super cheaply made. But they are also super cheap so don&#x27;t be expecting sonicare quality. They do the job minimally but I would not purchase them again. There is a difference.</li>
            <li> I cannot get these to stay on my toothbrush.  They pop off of the slot.  I hope it is something I am doing wrong.  I just hold the unit where they connect and brush that way.  Really, they cost nothing so I feel I shouldn&#x27;t complain!  I will use them until they are gone but will probably not buy again unless I find that it is my faulty installation.</li>
            <li> great buy on these, fit fine and worth the cost for sure</li>
            <li> They seem to wear out a little faster than the Sonic brand, but they work well.</li>
            <li> Worked very well. Great price! I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads work just as well as the much more expensive Sonic brand toothbrush heads at a fraction of the price. Each head has a different color band at its base which is good for multiple users.  The only thing they don&#x27;t have is the head covers.  Other than that they are perfect!</li>
            <li> Fits like a glove for 3/4 less of the cost!! Lovin IT! Teeth are sooo clean!</li>
            <li> These are the exact same brushes as the ones that are 2 for $26.00. They fit my toothbrush with no problem and feel the same in my mouth as their much more expensive cousins.  They are wonderful and so glad I ordered them.</li>
            <li> This has got to be one of my best purchases. I can&#x27;t tell you how satisfied I am  and the price was GREAT. I wish every body gets these cause they&#x27;re a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush meets Saturday Night Live skit... The toothbrush heads do not actually stay on my brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are sold as a fit for my particular Sonicare model, so I tried 3 different brush heads and&lt;br /&gt;they all did the same thing. A waste of money and time. VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no problems with these generic replacement heads, an excellent value.</li>
            <li> These fit almost perfect and clean well. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
