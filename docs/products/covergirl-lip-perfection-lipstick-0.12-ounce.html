            <li>love the shape of the containers, as they&#x27;re easy to find when I&#x27;m digging around in my bag without looking.</li>
            <li>I love that the colors are easy to see without opening</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so strong</li>
            <li>It stays much longer than I had hoped, and I&#x27;m very pleased that I don&#x27;t have to continue reapplying it.</li>
            <li>I bought Hot 305 and in the pictures shown it was kind of a salmon color.</li>
            <li>Perfect for a glamour look with black winged liner.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s so light and susceptible, that I just add a bit of my faithful 305 to get a muffled red that I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li>I specifically ordered a lighter color because I have a light skin tone</li>
            <li>The way this color filled in the cracks of my lips it looked</li>

            <li>I bought this lipstick because I ran out of my red lipstick I originally bought in England and when I tested it, it was that bright red</li>
            <li>It is a nice shade of red, and it really does leave your lips softer after you&#x27;re done wearing it.</li>

            <li> too artificial --which was the opposite of what I was expecting for a more natural hue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a long last lipstick that does not dry your lips.  </li>
            <li> It is a flat color but all you need to do is add lip gloss.</li>
            <li> only complaint was when I received it the lipstick was melted completely out of it&#x27;s shape, it was a puddle of red goop.</li>
            <li> I have been using covergirl for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> so i have to be careful not to get red all over!)</li>
            <li> And it willl last all day if you are careful.</li>
            <li> Stays on a long time and doesn&#x27;t smear .</li>
            <li> It lasts so long.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes and does wear off if you eat (not as much as a I expected, which is definitely a plus).</li>
            <li> Unlike so many other lipsticks I&#x27;ve used, it doesn&#x27;t feel tacky on my lips, which causes me to bite my lips - a bad habit which I need to break.  </li>
            <li> It appeared to be slightly orange making it look very strange on my face.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only complaint.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the color is too much intense.</li>
            <li> color does not look like picture  too dark for me</li>
            <li> after I used it a few times, I noticed that it had a strange plasticky smell, and when I would go to take my make up off for the night , the lipstick would harshly stain my lips, leaving a faint red rim around my mouth for the next day</li>
            <li> But if I put just a little bit, it is alright.</li>
            <li> You will usually need to touch it up every few hours but not unreasonably so.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how well the product works, because the color was all wrong for me.  </li>
            <li> BUT it stains like crazy.</li>
            <li> Both times the colors were a disappointment.</li>
            <li> i would be afraid it was contaminated.  </li>
            <li> yes, that bad.  </li>
            <li> but I am disappointed.</li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of difference.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is the epitome of red hot. Its not too drying and it goes on very smoothly. BUT it stains like crazy. Wear it for a night and itll be there in the morning even after some intense scrubbing.</li>
            <li> I bought this lipstick in this color at cvs and I loved it. It&#x27;s a bright red long last.  It&#x27;s a long last lipstick that does not dry your lips.  I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try the lip perfection in the Hot Passion color!  Talk about Lip Perfection!! I looked and felt hot!  My friends even told me I looked like a celebrity!  This is a must try for anyone who needs a change and who want to feel great!</li>
            <li> I have been using covergirl for as long as I can remember. This is the only brand that works for me. It actually stays on throughout the day. I can&#x27;t go anywhere without my lipstick on and I really on this a lot. This is a perfect color and really makes my lips stand out. Its a good price for a perfect product.</li>
            <li> i love this lipstick can&#x27;t wait to order more of it.the color is so lovely best lipstick i ever had.</li>
            <li> I bought this lipstick because I ran out of my red lipstick I originally bought in England and when I tested it, it was that bright red I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;But after I used it a few times, I noticed that it had a strange plasticky smell, and when I would go to take my make up off for the night , the lipstick would harshly stain my lips, leaving a faint red rim around my mouth for the next day ( if I didn&#x27;t wear any lipstick)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it two stars because it is a beautiful pigmented color , and it goes on rather nicely, but the smell and the staining I think is not worth the trouble</li>
            <li> The lipstick looks nothing like the color pictured. I thought it was a warm coral/peach shade. NO, it&#x27;s fire engine red. This is the second and last time that I will order Lipperfection. Both times the colors were a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how well the product works, because the color was all wrong for me.  I ended up giving it to my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> This lip color is lovely! It is a nice shade of red, and it really does leave your lips softer after you&#x27;re done wearing it. The only bad thing it that it comes off pretty easy (which is also a good thing, I guess. I just don&#x27;t wear a lot of lipstick so i have to be careful not to get red all over!) NIce classic color (I bought HOT) And it willl last all day if you are careful.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend because she never cam home with (the right red)...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty close to my ideal red, it goes on smooth, stays on a good while and looks great&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint was when I received it the lipstick was melted completely out of it&#x27;s shape, it was a puddle of red goop. Rather than deal with the seller over the 5 or so dollar item I bought her a much needed lip brush and she just used it that way</li>
            <li> This is such a great red color and it stays on your lips through the whole day. This is great color for the summer</li>
            <li> my everyday lipstick stays on for a very long time never have to reaplicate it during my work shift goes on smoothly for the perfect red lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a Mary Kay kinda gal, so going with Covergirl was my attempt to find a cheaper lipstick that stayed. This is was by far, the best choice.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Hot&amp;#34; is the color of Taylor Swift&#x27;s signature look, so I purchased this, and I&#x27;m very pleased. Really smooth, and the color is really pretty. Dries my lips out in the tiniest bit, but can be fixed with a bit of chapstick. The color BARELY fades at all. I&#x27;m so pleased with that. It stays on my lips for the whole day without needing a touch up.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was really nice as well. I&#x27;m pleased. :)</li>
            <li> My wife just loves the color. Hot &amp; beautiful.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is great.  It stays on and the color doesn&#x27;t fade.  However, it does get on the teeth, which it says it doesn&#x27;t.  That&#x27;s my only complaint.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a great lipstick.</li>
            <li> I bought Hot 305 and in the pictures shown it was kind of a salmon color. When I received my lip stick it was called Hot Passion 305 and was a dark red. I specifically ordered a lighter color because I have a light skin tone and I don&#x27;t want my lip color to pop too much. It&#x27;s still a pretty color but I am disappointed. I guess if I don&#x27;t like it I could give it to a family member.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color! I&#x27;ve been looking for it everywhere and I&#x27;m glad I found it here!!! Stays on a long time and doesn&#x27;t smear .</li>
            <li> It lasts so long. Unfortunately, the color is too much intense. But if I put just a little bit, it is alright.</li>
            <li> The color lasts a good while. I don&#x27;t have to reapply as often. It is a lovely color. It is a flat color but all you need to do is add lip gloss.</li>
            <li> Love the color it works for me :)</li>
            <li> Let me start this by saying I&#x27;m not someone who likes most lipstick and therefore I don&#x27;t venture out and try many brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a sucker for bright red lips (for the right occasion, or when I want to feel sexy) so when I saw [[ASIN:B0043TXHYK Covergirl Lip Perfection Lipstick Hot 305, 0.12-Ounce]] in person, I had to try it. Despite how the picture shows it, this lipstick IS NOT sparkly. (I am thankful for that!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lipstick is bright, smooth and easy to apply. It stays much longer than I had hoped, and I&#x27;m very pleased that I don&#x27;t have to continue reapplying it. This isn&#x27;t one of those lip stains that dries your lips, it&#x27;s a lipstick. It moisturizes and does wear off if you eat (not as much as a I expected, which is definitely a plus). If I go to wipe it off, my lips stay a little red, which I consider a good thing. If you&#x27;re looking for a bright red, summery lipstick I highly recommend 305.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently saw  [[ASIN:B0043TZTOQ Covergirl Lip Perfection Lipstick Delish 255, 0.12-Ounce]] in person, and decided to give the natural tone a try. I know that colors look different on everyone, but for me this one is a disaster. The way this color filled in the cracks of my lips it looked too artificial --which was the opposite of what I was expecting for a more natural hue. It appeared to be slightly orange making it look very strange on my face. However, it&#x27;s so light and susceptible, that I just add a bit of my faithful 305 to get a muffled red that I&#x27;m happy with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the shape of the containers, as they&#x27;re easy to find when I&#x27;m digging around in my bag without looking. I love that the colors are easy to see without opening (the bottom of the container shows you the color clearly). Overall, I am happy with this brand and plan on purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> This is the official lipstick that Taylor Swift uses! As seen on her newest Red album! This is a must buy for anyone who is a Taylor Swift Fan. The color she uses is called &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I have never said that about a lipstick but it&#x27;s so strong I can&#x27;t wear it.  It was sealed properly when I purchased otherwise i would be afraid it was contaminated.  yes, that bad.  cannot recommend even though color is nice</li>
            <li> Love the color, just what I wanted. And it stays on along time, which I love.  All in all I will buy again.</li>
            <li> love this product... works for pink &amp; yellow undertones. Perfect for a glamour look with black winged liner. Have fun trying different looks!</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick. It competes very well with my holy grail [[ASIN:B001BKPK3K Estee Lauder Estee Lauder Signature Hydra Lustre Lipstick - Black Cherry]](I love the full line not just the one color given in the link) though with a much smaller price tag. Kiss and Temptation are my two favorite shades but as I am now enrolled in a makeup school I have 13 different shades and they are amazing. I plan to buy the others shades and fill up my lipstick palette soon. They really add moisture to the lips and last a very long time. You will usually need to touch it up every few hours but not unreasonably so. The colors are gorgeous and I have not noticed any bleeding. Love them!</li>
            <li> I just purchased this lipstick because a friend was wearing it and the color looked so good on her.  I also noticed that after having lunch, there was still color on her lips!!!!  This is a beautiful shade.  On me it looks like a rosy coral shade - perfect for my fair skin and blonde hair. I think it brightens my face which I  needed.  Unlike so many other lipsticks I&#x27;ve used, it doesn&#x27;t feel tacky on my lips, which causes me to bite my lips - a bad habit which I need to break.  This lipstick feels like I have nothing on.  So far, it&#x27;s seems long lasting. I can&#x27;t wait until the 7 days are up to see if my lips are better.  That would be a big plus.[[ASIN:B0043U1Y6M Covergirl Lip Perfection Lipstick Precious 315, 0.12-Ounce]] I wish there were testers since it&#x27;s risky trying to buy a shade based on the plastic color on the bottom of the tube. I probably wouldn&#x27;t have picked this color if I hadn&#x27;t seen it on my friend.</li>
            <li> color does not look like picture  too dark for me</li>
            <li> My wife looks pretty hot in this. I&#x27;m not posting pictures, if you want, look up taylor swift.</li>
            <li> It definitely did reach my expectations it is long lasting and the color is absolutely fab and rich, totally brings out and outfit.</li>
