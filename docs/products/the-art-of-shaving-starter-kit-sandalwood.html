            <li>I am very pleased with the performance of this kit.</li>
            <li>Great for getting into a better shave but keep in mind</li>
            <li>its an ok product!</li>
            <li>For travel, its a nice indulgence.</li>
            <li>This is a nice kit to see if you want to get into that world.</li>
            <li>The sandalwood scent is nice too.</li>
            <li>The products are effective at preventing razor burn and making the shave easier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice you can feel it working the lather into your hair</li>
            <li>Cream is really nice.</li>
            <li>Macho kind of smell.</li>
            <li>If you are wanting to try a new scent this is a great way to test it out without spending a fortune!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m returning this and getting a better quality brush with a tub of nice shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Sandalwood is a masculine scent and was the perfect gift for my husband who was wanting to try this.</li>
            <li>Someone I know had tried this, and fell in love with the end results, so I thought it would be a nice gift to get him started.</li>
            <li>I like that the scent is very light, just a hint, and not flowery or perfume-like.  </li>
            <li>The hubs seems to enjoy a luxury shaving kit, and I love the smell!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it many times but all it does is clog the razor, does not add protection or comfort.</li>
            <li>Ok for starter.</li>
            <li>I got lavender for myself and sandalwood for my Dad and we both enjoyed using the foam brushes.</li>
            <li>OK for beginners though.    </li>
            <li>I got this for travel purposes and love the set.</li>
            <li>and I love the sandalwood smell too.</li>
            <li>I love that I can pick from my kids Amazon wish list</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars,  because it&#x27;s smells wonderful, but the package was totally damaged.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll get you on track for a better shave.</li>
            <li>Great products and fast service</li>
            <li>Will def be purchasing more of this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried the \\&quot;starter</li>
            <li>The kit is more of a travel size.</li>
            <li>and I still have more remaining.</li>
            <li>After shave is ok.</li>
            <li>and they all lather better than Art of Shaving).</li>
            <li>Make sure you view a demo on use.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this kit.  </li>
            <li>There are better out there.</li>
            <li>Most of the items are pretty good, but the after shave tube never opened correctly and ended up breaking.</li>
            <li>It makes for a great shave...better than my normal shave.</li>
            <li>The shaving foam that is included is also pretty good.</li>
            <li>; pleasant smell that girls really like.</li>
            <li>That said, it wasn&#x27;t so great that I am willing to spend the $180 on a full size set of each piece, that you get in this sample.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect to see if it&#x27;s something you might want to use before spending the big $$$ on the full size option.</li>
            <li>The brush is cheaply made with flimsy, light-weight plastic handle and shedding bristles.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>The kit is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Overall, great set.  </li>
            <li>I do really enjoy the brush.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t in good faith give this as a gift when the brush included was of far inferior quality to what used to be included.    </li>
            <li>My dad and boyfriend love The Art of Shaving products, so the products, though very small, are very good quality.</li>
            <li>You get more product and a heftier brush, but for $25 to $40, you can get everything you need for a good shavethat will last much, much longer.    </li>
            <li>Overall it was a good experience.    </li>
            <li>The Emjor electric is cheaper, faster, and gives a much more uniform and much closer shave.  </li>
            <li>But the brush is good and the pre-shave oil should last a while.</li>
            <li>Sharp looking package and will make a great gift Just what our son wanted</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband as a birthday gift, just to try out a new scent, it was amazing and now will be a larger size of this kind.</li>
            <li>Bought for travel which i luckily don&#x27;t do often.</li>
            <li>It went on fine but getting the oil residue off your hands is a real pain.</li>
            <li>Yes, I am spoiled and this whole thing is as advertised... turning shaving into an art that you will actually enjoy.</li>
            <li>, is that it turned an irritating, time consuming, thing-I-have-to-do-before-I-rush-out-the-door morning nuisance into a wonderful calming time ritual.</li>
            <li>Worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>The portions are small but if you look at the price of the full size kit it is a great deal.</li>
            <li>and it comes right to my door.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably spend a little more, but I&#x27;ll get a much better value.</li>
            <li>FIRST NOTE:</li>
            <li>Thought that this kit would be FULL SIZE for price (can find in Nordstrom for $100), only to discover that it is just the \\&quot;TRIAL SIZE\\&quot; available for $25.00.</li>
            <li>This is my first time to use a luxury shaving product like this.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>&quot; first and the company gets my praises for offering a trail size.</li>
            <li>this is the first encounter my husband has had with preshave oil</li>
            <li>In short, it is superior to your store brand products but not enough to justify the astronomical cost, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It quickly clogged the razor (as would soft cream cheese!)</li>
            <li>It really does give a first rate shave, and my sister bought this kit for me about two years ago for Christmas.</li>
            <li>However, the one I got seems more than adequate and I can really lather up my whole face with it, hitting every spot, even though this took some practice and some experimenting with just the right amount of water (just a little dab) to get it all</li>
            <li>Though the brush is pretty cheap, I still use it because I don&#x27;t want to bring my actual one.  </li>
            <li>I really like Art of Shaving stuff.  </li>
            <li>You can get a kit with the brush pictured, but you&#x27;ll spend two or three times as much on it.</li>
            <li>The oil is very smoothing.</li>
            <li>and the after shave really helps soothing my skin after the shave.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m bummed because I really wanted to give this to my hubby in his stocking.</li>
            <li>and I thought this would really help.</li>
            <li>The shave lotion really foams up then.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t bring much to the party except smell.</li>
            <li>The brush isn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li>At least with a good quality brush, one can give it away if they decide using it</li>
            <li>Make sure to use a clean sharp blade with a freshly clean &amp; steamed face, because its an extremely close shave.</li>
            <li>I used an old pill case it is just the right size.</li>
            <li>This is something I had intended to put in my regular rotation of gifts for men on special occasions.</li>
            <li>So I am young and this is my first &amp;#34;Fancy Shaving&amp;#34; stuff and as a starter to see if I like the smell and the feel of it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any experience with the brush, so I felt like it was a nice touch, but pointless.</li>
            <li>easy ordering, fast shipping and price comparable to other online retailers.</li>
            <li>Nice but smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>I recommend the kit highly.</li>
            <li>Products are high quality but size is</li>
            <li>I work at a high end mall</li>
            <li>With that being said it is a real badger and soft.</li>
            <li>nice it was available in smaller size in case recipient was not happy with the sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li>It takes longer to apply the pre-shave and shaving cream, but again, I think it is worth taking the extra time.</li>
            <li>You get a brush that is half the size of the one that originally shipped that isn&#x27;t of very high quality.    </li>
            <li>okay, but no better than anything you could buy off shelf for $3.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I agree with some of the other reviews about the brush size, although I haven&#x27;t had more than three or four bristles fall out in three weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li>It was a huge mess  </li>
            <li>I ever had since my young days</li>
            <li>Unless you want to smell like an old man.  </li>
            <li>A really old man.</li>
            <li>My husband has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I very much like the scent of the shave cream, it is subtle and clean, but for me the after shave balm is too overpowering.</li>
            <li>The silver lining is I spent only $25 on the kit rather than $100s on full size items.</li>
            <li>small china bowl filled with water for dipping the razor, and kit.</li>
            <li>You can build a pretty simple shave kit from here and buying a safety razor, shave soap/cream, proper brush, and such.</li>
            <li>Apparently, since The Art of Shaving was bought out by Procter and Gamble -- the folks who bring you Gillette shaving products -- the kit has changed.</li>
            <li>Not awful, just not great.</li>
            <li>If you are ready to step into the straight shaving world be sure to get this:  [...]</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t overbearing, is manly and a little musky, we really like it.</li>

            <li> I do really enjoy the brush.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t in good faith give this as a gift when the brush included was of far inferior quality to what used to be included.    </li>

            <li> , is that it turned an irritating, time consuming, thing-I-have-to-do-before-I-rush-out-the-door morning nuisance into a wonderful calming time ritual.</li>
            <li> Worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> The portions are small but if you look at the price of the full size kit it is a great deal.</li>
            <li> and it comes right to my door.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably spend a little more, but I&#x27;ll get a much better value.</li>
            <li> FIRST NOTE:</li>
            <li> Thought that this kit would be FULL SIZE for price (can find in Nordstrom for $100), only to discover that it is just the \\&quot;TRIAL SIZE\\&quot; available for $25.00.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to use a luxury shaving product like this.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> &quot; first and the company gets my praises for offering a trail size.</li>
            <li> this is the first encounter my husband has had with preshave oil</li>
            <li> In short, it is superior to your store brand products but not enough to justify the astronomical cost, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It quickly clogged the razor (as would soft cream cheese!)</li>
            <li> It really does give a first rate shave, and my sister bought this kit for me about two years ago for Christmas.</li>
            <li> However, the one I got seems more than adequate and I can really lather up my whole face with it, hitting every spot, even though this took some practice and some experimenting with just the right amount of water (just a little dab) to get it all</li>
            <li> Though the brush is pretty cheap, I still use it because I don&#x27;t want to bring my actual one.  </li>
            <li> I really like Art of Shaving stuff.  </li>
            <li> You can get a kit with the brush pictured, but you&#x27;ll spend two or three times as much on it.</li>
            <li> The oil is very smoothing.</li>
            <li> and the after shave really helps soothing my skin after the shave.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m bummed because I really wanted to give this to my hubby in his stocking.</li>
            <li> and I thought this would really help.</li>
            <li> The shave lotion really foams up then.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t bring much to the party except smell.</li>
            <li> The brush isn&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li> At least with a good quality brush, one can give it away if they decide using it</li>
            <li> Make sure to use a clean sharp blade with a freshly clean &amp; steamed face, because its an extremely close shave.</li>
            <li> I used an old pill case it is just the right size.</li>
            <li> This is something I had intended to put in my regular rotation of gifts for men on special occasions.</li>
            <li> So I am young and this is my first &amp;#34;Fancy Shaving&amp;#34; stuff and as a starter to see if I like the smell and the feel of it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any experience with the brush, so I felt like it was a nice touch, but pointless.</li>
            <li> easy ordering, fast shipping and price comparable to other online retailers.</li>
            <li> Nice but smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> I recommend the kit highly.</li>
            <li> Products are high quality but size is</li>
            <li> I work at a high end mall</li>
            <li> With that being said it is a real badger and soft.</li>
            <li> nice it was available in smaller size in case recipient was not happy with the sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li> It takes longer to apply the pre-shave and shaving cream, but again, I think it is worth taking the extra time.</li>
            <li> You get a brush that is half the size of the one that originally shipped that isn&#x27;t of very high quality.    </li>
            <li> okay, but no better than anything you could buy off shelf for $3.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviews about the brush size, although I haven&#x27;t had more than three or four bristles fall out in three weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> It was a huge mess  </li>
            <li> I ever had since my young days</li>
            <li> Unless you want to smell like an old man.  </li>
            <li> A really old man.</li>
            <li> My husband has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I very much like the scent of the shave cream, it is subtle and clean, but for me the after shave balm is too overpowering.</li>
            <li> The silver lining is I spent only $25 on the kit rather than $100s on full size items.</li>
            <li> small china bowl filled with water for dipping the razor, and kit.</li>
            <li> You can build a pretty simple shave kit from here and buying a safety razor, shave soap/cream, proper brush, and such.</li>
            <li> Apparently, since The Art of Shaving was bought out by Procter and Gamble -- the folks who bring you Gillette shaving products -- the kit has changed.</li>
            <li> Not awful, just not great.</li>
            <li> If you are ready to step into the straight shaving world be sure to get this:  [...]</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t overbearing, is manly and a little musky, we really like it.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin like me, use it ever other day or just on date night with a two day beard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about half the size, a different design and far inferior to the brush pictured.</li>
            <li> it is smaller, and not high quality but again....</li>
            <li> You only need minimal cream.</li>
            <li> Based on the use of the products I am not impressed enough to buy these again in full size, so the kit saved my from that mistake.</li>
            <li> this is very small bottles, and tiny sampler and for the price it seems high.</li>
            <li> Brush too small and too soft to be used as a shaving brush.</li>
            <li> With the shaving cream I was not able to whip it into a lather and it went on like soft cream cheese.</li>
            <li> I even find myself setting my alarm clock a little early and looking forward to my shaving time, when I sit down in front of my shaving mirror,</li>
            <li> but I wish they were a little bit larger.  </li>
            <li> The shaving cream didn&#x27;t lather like I expected, but it didn&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li> and then get the brush really wet.  </li>
            <li> I had been using another brand (1/2 the price) a couple of weeks before vacation, so I knew how to wet shave.</li>
            <li> There really is no need to use the oil</li>
            <li> In order to dry it is recommended to hang upside down</li>
            <li> Not good for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> You get no better shave than using regular shaving</li>
            <li> The brush is pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> It makes me want to try their other stuff.</li>
            <li> , I got just a close of a shave using other brands without shave oil.</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t forget these items are small and last for about a little over a month for someone who shaves 2 or 3 times a week)</li>
            <li> But, there are several other less expensive options that deliver similar results.</li>
            <li> The brush is very low quality and very small.</li>
            <li> Literally watery; like they formulated it and then cut the recipe in half with water.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Half of the bottle of oil was empty.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Seems a little watered down vs what is in the store.  </li>
            <li> The brush was not as bad as other reviews, will be useful for traveling.</li>
            <li> I cut it with a little unscented face lotion to reduce the potency.</li>
            <li> Just put on a little bit (dime size)</li>
            <li> The first use produced an awful smell, thought it was the brush, so I washed it with gentle shampoo a few times.</li>
            <li> waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t make this stuff my everyday choice...</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, which had quite a few things that ordered inside,  I immediately smelled the the shaving products.  </li>
            <li> The picture does not accurately represent what is in this package.</li>
            <li> The shave cream does not lather up as well as other less expensive brands (tried 5 other brands</li>
            <li> The shave cream works up into a thick lather with a little whipping with the brush.</li>
            <li> way to small.  </li>
            <li> These are REALLY small sizes.</li>
            <li> Whatever is in it is so slick when the razor touches the skin it glides effortlessly.</li>
            <li> It has a really small handle and doesn&#x27;t have a thick knot.</li>
            <li> that was the only disappointment.</li>
            <li> Oil is thick.</li>
            <li> Extremely expensive and not worth the cost at all.</li>
            <li> Items were very small and had to be returned because they leaked.</li>
            <li> The bottles are very small</li>
            <li> Items were very small</li>
            <li> Look elsewhere if you&#x27;re considering a gift for someone who&#x27;s seriously considering wetshaving, or someone who doesn&#x27;t know about it yet.</li>
            <li> so it is a little expensive.</li>
            <li> When the package arrived, the other products were of the same size, but I was very disappointed in the brush.</li>
            <li> People are just rude in the stores and parking lots!</li>
            <li> Not great quality nor quantity.</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift to someone and it turned out it was a bad gift that they were not able to use.</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive- don&#x27;t kid yourself.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not the brush that ships with this package anymore.    </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with this set for the price</li>
            <li> a bit expensive for the amount of product and the applicator brush was very poor quality</li>
            <li> disappointed in the poor quality of the items.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible product, irritated my skin, smelled bad, the brush fell apart after one use, and the stuff clogged my pores and was hard to get off my face after shaving.</li>
            <li> So disappointed, misleading description.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on the edge BUY IT, you won&#x27;t be disappointed and</li>
            <li> I truely hate Christmas shopping at that time of year.</li>
            <li> The awful smell continued; it was the shave cream!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best shaving cream and brush I ever had since my young days.........that is I have been shaving from last 45 years.</li>
            <li> I really like Art of Shaving stuff.  But, stick with the unscented products.  Unless you want to smell like an old man.  A really old man.</li>
            <li> My three guys loved this gift!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and it smells divine! He enjoys it as well!</li>
            <li> I will have to get used to the sandelwood scent but I received a close, quality shave using the product.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome kit to have to travel with.  Though the brush is pretty cheap, I still use it because I don&#x27;t want to bring my actual one.  Also, I don&#x27;t use the oil.  I&#x27;ve tried it many times but all it does is clog the razor, does not add protection or comfort.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son as a Christmas gift. He said it the best shave he has had in years.</li>
            <li> Nice but smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> waste of money.  way to small.  should return.</li>
            <li> Great shaves using for years.</li>
            <li> Based on the use of the products I am not impressed enough to buy these again in full size, so the kit saved my from that mistake.</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive- don&#x27;t kid yourself. For travel, its a nice indulgence. I wouldn&#x27;t make this stuff my everyday choice...unless I had cash to burn. It makes for a great shave...better than my normal shave. That said, it wasn&#x27;t so great that I am willing to spend the $180 on a full size set of each piece, that you get in this sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall- like the product, and its great for travel bags. Its an indulgence, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money on it for daily use.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a Christmas gift &amp; it was a hit!!</li>
            <li> ADDENDUM: Amazon has been contacted a number of times to correct the image on this product, each time responding they&#x27;re not going to change the image. What you see above is not what ships. Read for details below. (Aug. 30, 2011)    FIRST NOTE: The picture on this page as of June 22, 2011, is inaccurate. The brush is completely different. It&#x27;s about half the size, a different design and far inferior to the brush pictured. If this has been changed, I&#x27;ll be happy to amend this review. As of Aug. 24, the image has been reported as inaccurate, but Amazon.com said in an email they see no need to change the image.    Now, to the meat and potatoes...    This is something I had intended to put in my regular rotation of gifts for men on special occasions. It really does give a first rate shave, and my sister bought this kit for me about two years ago for Christmas. I&#x27;ve been using that brush since. The brush I&#x27;m referring to is the one pictured on this page.     Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not the brush that ships with this package anymore.    Apparently, since The Art of Shaving was bought out by Procter and Gamble -- the folks who bring you Gillette shaving products -- the kit has changed. You get a brush that is half the size of the one that originally shipped that isn&#x27;t of very high quality.    When the package arrived, the other products were of the same size, but I was very disappointed in the brush. I couldn&#x27;t in good faith give this as a gift when the brush included was of far inferior quality to what used to be included.    I&#x27;m returning this and getting a better quality brush with a tub of nice shaving cream. I&#x27;ll probably spend a little more, but I&#x27;ll get a much better value. The cream will last for several months and the brush will surely last longer than this toy.    You can get a kit with the brush pictured, but you&#x27;ll spend two or three times as much on it. You get more product and a heftier brush, but for $25 to $40, you can get everything you need for a good shavethat will last much, much longer.    Look elsewhere if you&#x27;re considering a gift for someone who&#x27;s seriously considering wetshaving, or someone who doesn&#x27;t know about it yet. At least with a good quality brush, one can give it away if they decide using it just isn&#x27;t for them.</li>
            <li> Ok for starter. Not great quality nor quantity. Like a gift set you would buy on clerance after the holidays at Wal-Mart or something. Not awful, just not great.</li>
            <li> I sent this to the father of my daughter. My ex loved it! He loved the scent and the quality. This product makes an excellent gift!! I will buy him the lavender scent for Father&#x27;s Day!!!</li>
            <li> I got lavender for myself and sandalwood for my Dad and we both enjoyed using the foam brushes. The shaving foam that is included is also pretty good. The oil is very smoothing. Overall it was a good experience.    The brush itself was obviously not meant to last longer than the products in the package. It will get you through the included foam, but is definitely not a quality brush.  The bristles will fall out. OK for beginners though.    If you are ready to step into the straight shaving world be sure to get this:  [...]</li>
            <li> The gel is excellent, but who needs the brush and who needs a blade razor?  The Emjor electric is cheaper, faster, and gives a much more uniform and much closer shave.  And nobody has heard of it.</li>
            <li> I got this for travel purposes and love the set. The only downfall is that there is no protector or holder for the brush. In order to dry it is recommended to hang upside down so you have to get cleaver in the hotel room to accomplish this. Also with no case you run the risk of bending the bristles - to get around this I used an old pill case it is just the right size.</li>
            <li> Thought that this kit would be FULL SIZE for price (can find in Nordstrom for $100), only to discover that it is just the \\&quot;TRIAL SIZE\\&quot; available for $25.00. So disappointed, misleading description.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to use a luxury shaving product like this. I am very pleased with the performance of this kit.I am hooked! and I love the sandalwood smell too.</li>
            <li> Extremely expensive and not worth the cost at all. You get no better shave than using regular shaving items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The brush is cheaply made with flimsy, light-weight plastic handle and shedding bristles.&lt;br /&gt;2. The pre-shave oil does not improve the closeness of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;3. The aftershave is watery. Literally watery; like they formulated it and then cut the recipe in half with water.&lt;br /&gt;4. Shaving cream okay, but no better than anything you could buy off shelf for $3.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in the poor quality of the items.  The silver lining is I spent only $25 on the kit rather than $100s on full size items.</li>
            <li> I love that I can pick from my kids Amazon wish list and it comes right to my door. I truely hate Christmas shopping at that time of year. People are just rude in the stores and parking lots!</li>
            <li> So I am young and this is my first &amp;#34;Fancy Shaving&amp;#34; stuff and as a starter to see if I like the smell and the feel of it and I was happy with what I got. The cream was good from what I know (don&#x27;t forget these items are small and last for about a little over a month for someone who shaves 2 or 3 times a week) but it is a starter kit thats why i like it. The oil and after shave cream are great, not going to lie i dont know how well the pre shave oil is but I think it works well and the after shave really helps soothing my skin after the shave. and the brush.... dont forget you are paying like $25 while it is a good brush and does everything you want it to do it is smaller, and not high quality but again.... its a starter kit so thats okay. But if you are starting out with shaving with &amp;#34;Fancy Things&amp;#34; do get this and you can change up the smells you get so you dont have to spend like $50 on a big one and find out you don&#x27;t like it. but it worked for me and I have been using this stuff ever since</li>
            <li> Seems a little watered down vs what is in the store.  The brush is pretty much useless. Bought for travel which i luckily don&#x27;t do often. Shaving Creme will not foam up with this brush included at all.</li>
            <li> These are REALLY small sizes. But the brush is good and the pre-shave oil should last a while. Just got into shaving with a safety (Double-edge) razor. This is a nice kit to see if you want to get into that world. I&#x27;ve since bought another shaving cream.. Proraso. But I&#x27;m still using this oil &amp; lotion until it runs out..</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars,  because it&#x27;s smells wonderful, but the package was totally damaged.  When I opened the box, which had quite a few things that ordered inside,  I immediately smelled the the shaving products.  Somewhere along the shipping route the bottle of oil leaked out all over everything. Half of the bottle of oil was empty.&lt;br /&gt; I can&#x27;t return it without a printer,  also it was too close to Christmas to ship it back and get another one. There should be lids on the oil. It was a huge mess  and I&#x27;m bummed because I really wanted to give this to my hubby in his stocking.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend &amp; he loved it! Almost a year later, he&#x27;s still using it! The product definitely lasts long.&lt;br /&gt;It also smells so good every time I kiss him after he shaves. ;)</li>
            <li> Great for getting into a better shave but keep in mind this is a starter set and you&#x27;ll move on from here. You can build a pretty simple shave kit from here and buying a safety razor, shave soap/cream, proper brush, and such. If you&#x27;re on the edge BUY IT, you won&#x27;t be disappointed and it&#x27;ll get you on track for a better shave. I will add I don&#x27;t use their products now, they&#x27;re just spendy.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit from a local store but now that I see it here on Amazon I&#x27;m going to buy refills here. The kit is fabulous. Yes, as another reviewer said, the brush is not quite the one you get. However, the one I got seems more than adequate and I can really lather up my whole face with it, hitting every spot, even though this took some practice and some experimenting with just the right amount of water (just a little dab) to get it all right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this kit and I cannot overstate this, is that it turned an irritating, time consuming, thing-I-have-to-do-before-I-rush-out-the-door morning nuisance into a wonderful calming time ritual. I even find myself setting my alarm clock a little early and looking forward to my shaving time, when I sit down in front of my shaving mirror, small china bowl filled with water for dipping the razor, and kit. Yes, I am spoiled and this whole thing is as advertised... turning shaving into an art that you will actually enjoy. The sandalwood scent is nice too. I recommend the kit highly.</li>
            <li> its an ok product! the shipping took forever. a bit expensive for the amount of product and the applicator brush was very poor quality but it smells great</li>
            <li> I like that the scent is very light, just a hint, and not flowery or perfume-like.  The products are effective at preventing razor burn and making the shave easier.</li>
            <li> My husband has sensitive skin and I thought this would really help. The only thing he did not like was the aftershave.  Whatever is in it burnt his skin for over an hour, then it was a deep red in color for about another hour because of an allergic reaction.  Not good for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I like the product. But it was smaller then it was pictured. that was the only disappointment.</li>
            <li> The shaving cream didn&#x27;t lather like I expected, but it didn&#x27;t need to. Whatever is in it is so slick when the razor touches the skin it glides effortlessly. I don&#x27;t have any experience with the brush, so I felt like it was a nice touch, but pointless. Overall, great set.  It makes me want to try their other stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a good set to get you started.  If you are just starting to shave with a safety razor, or just want to try different scents.  You won&#x27;t go wrong with this set for the price</li>
            <li> Great products and fast service</li>
            <li> Sandalwood is a masculine scent and was the perfect gift for my husband who was wanting to try this. Will def be purchasing more of this product.</li>
            <li> After reading lots of reviews praising this brand, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.   In short, it is superior to your store brand products but not enough to justify the astronomical cost, in my opinion. I&#x27;m glad I tried the \\&quot;starter kit\\&quot; first and the company gets my praises for offering a trail size. But, there are several other less expensive options that deliver similar results. American Crew is one for example. I will give the sandalwood +1 on the scent though. It does smell very nice!</li>
            <li> a christmas gift. nice it was available in smaller size in case recipient was not happy with the sandalwood scent. easy ordering, fast shipping and price comparable to other online retailers.</li>
            <li> The hubs seems to enjoy a luxury shaving kit, and I love the smell!</li>
            <li> Someone I know had tried this, and fell in love with the end results, so I thought it would be a nice gift to get him started.</li>
            <li> Sharp looking package and will make a great gift Just what our son wanted</li>
            <li> The kit is more of a travel size. Photo is misleading.</li>
            <li> The picture does not accurately represent what is in this package. The brush is very low quality and very small. My dad and boyfriend love The Art of Shaving products, so the products, though very small, are very good quality.</li>
            <li> Brush too small and too soft to be used as a shaving brush. Gave it as a gift to someone and it turned out it was a bad gift that they were not able to use.</li>
            <li> this is the first encounter my husband has had with preshave oil and he said he&#x27;s never going without again.</li>
            <li> I got this for about $25. I agree with some of the other reviews about the brush size, although I haven&#x27;t had more than three or four bristles fall out in three weeks of daily use. All of the products are trial size, including the brush, but it works just as well. The shave cream works up into a thick lather with a little whipping with the brush. I very much like the scent of the shave cream, it is subtle and clean, but for me the after shave balm is too overpowering. I cut it with a little unscented face lotion to reduce the potency.</li>
            <li> great for a gift. Shaving set works well</li>
            <li> Items were very small and had to be returned because they leaked.</li>
            <li> Good introduction to the product. Great value for the money. Prompt shipment.</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas gift thus I&#x27;m not a verified purchaser. I started with the pre-shave oil. It went on fine but getting the oil residue off your hands is a real pain. With the shaving cream I was not able to whip it into a lather and it went on like soft cream cheese. It quickly clogged the razor (as would soft cream cheese!) and cleaning the razor doubled the time it took to shave. The after shave balm is very nice. With the exception of the after shave balm the rest of the art of shaving has now disappeared below my sink.</li>
            <li> Great for a starter kit.</li>
            <li> Art of Shaving products are more expensive than off-the-shelve products; however, I have seen improvement in the appearance of my skin. It takes longer to apply the pre-shave and shaving cream, but again, I think it is worth taking the extra time. The starter kit is great way to trial Art of Shaving products. I&#x27;ve been using the trial kit for about 5 weeks and I still have more remaining. Bottom line: I&#x27;ll continue to use this product in the future.</li>
            <li> Great starter set to see if you like it.  Don&#x27;t over use the shave lotion.  Just put on a little bit (dime size) and then get the brush really wet.  The shave lotion really foams up then.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible product, irritated my skin, smelled bad, the brush fell apart after one use, and the stuff clogged my pores and was hard to get off my face after shaving. This stuff is a joke!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a birthday gift, just to try out a new scent, it was amazing and now will be a larger size of this kind. If you are wanting to try a new scent this is a great way to test it out without spending a fortune!!!</li>
            <li> I still think the products are pricey for what your getting.  I do really enjoy the brush.  It&#x27;s nice you can feel it working the lather into your hair so you get a very nice coating.</li>
            <li> The smell is the best sandalwood out there. Cream is really nice. Oil is thick. After shave is ok. Doesn&#x27;t bring much to the party except smell. The brush isn&#x27;t much. It has a really small handle and doesn&#x27;t have a thick knot. Also needs a lot of breaking in to get the badger smell out. With that being said it is a real badger and soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this starter kit to give Art of Shaving a try while on vacation. I had been using another brand (1/2 the price) a couple of weeks before vacation, so I knew how to wet shave. The first use produced an awful smell, thought it was the brush, so I washed it with gentle shampoo a few times. The awful smell continued; it was the shave cream!  The shave cream does not lather up as well as other less expensive brands (tried 5 other brands and they all lather better than Art of Shaving). There really is no need to use the oil, I got just a close of a shave using other brands without shave oil. The brush was not as bad as other reviews, will be useful for traveling. The balm did a good job.  I would not recommend Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li> Products are high quality but size is sample sized not even travel  to pricey for no product volume</li>
            <li> Get rid of razor bumps and burn!  A must for every man!  Worth the investment.  Make sure you view a demo on use.  You only need minimal cream.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband as a stocking stuffer Christmas gift. He loves it! The portions are small but if you look at the price of the full size kit it is a great deal. Perfect to see if it&#x27;s something you might want to use before spending the big $$$ on the full size option. The scent isn&#x27;t overbearing, is manly and a little musky, we really like it.</li>
            <li> Very nice products but I wish they were a little bit larger.  The bottles are very small so it is a little expensive.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this kit.  It is perfect for traveling. I always use art of shaving products from now on.</li>
            <li> this is very small bottles, and tiny sampler and for the price it seems high. I bought it as a gift for a son in law.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my son and he absolutely loved the product.  Has already used it and will be a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li> Items were very small</li>
            <li> Definitely a premium shave. You get what you pay for. I work at a high end mall and they have the art of shaving store, but I can&#x27;t afford their prices. Amazon is the best deal. Very nice shave; pleasant smell that girls really like. Macho kind of smell. Make sure to use a clean sharp blade with a freshly clean &amp; steamed face, because its an extremely close shave. If you have sensitive skin like me, use it ever other day or just on date night with a two day beard.</li>
            <li> If you want to experiment with this brand before moving on to bigger and more expensive items, this is just the thing. Sandalwood is a great scent as well.</li>
            <li> Most of the items are pretty good, but the after shave tube never opened correctly and ended up breaking. Pricey for a flimsy product. There are better out there.</li>
