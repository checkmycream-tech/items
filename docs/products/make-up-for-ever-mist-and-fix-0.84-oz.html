            <li>I love make up forever</li>
            <li>I bought mine from Sephora (better price).</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>My face sets, I look matte (which I love) &amp; don&#x27;t have the \\&quot;shiny\\</li>
            <li>it was a lot of help and I was able to fix things without messing anything up and really helped make my makeup look amazing!</li>
            <li>Works great for a girl&#x27;s night out, WEDDINGS, or just a normal rainy day that you don&#x27;t want ruining your makeup.</li>
            <li>So I was so excited for this product I really thought it was going to be great</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product from Sephora.</li>
            <li>worth the buy!</li>
            <li>and you have your foiled eyeshadow or more intense color, depends what your going for.</li>
            <li>It made my face feel dewey for a few minutes (good!)</li>
            <li>However, upon spraying I quickly realized that this product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>For only $10, this is such a great product!</li>
            <li>My bareminerals makeup came off quicker than normal with this product over the top.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t cause any peeling or smudges even out in the hot sun!</li>
            <li>so I think I picked the right size especially since I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it.</li>
            <li>I feel as if I could get a better, longer lasting result from a can of hairspray.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what it felt like on my face.</li>
            <li>it was the first mist and fix by make up forever.</li>
            <li>Whoever is selling this product and posting the photographs please make sure to specify this is the new mist and fix my make up forever not the old one because the formula has changed</li>
            <li>I use this product for very important events I need to attend and don&#x27;t want to worry about my make up messing up or long</li>
            <li>I really recommend this item.</li>
            <li>buy some oil absorbing sheets and keep them in your purse just in case you need one.</li>
            <li>I sprayed it from varying distances, on my hand and my face; my makeup still wiped off with a gentle swipe of a tissue.</li>
            <li>The thing I really didn&#x27;t care for was that I could not re-apply my makeup to fix the way it looked without taking it all off.</li>
            <li>I saw this on TV and wondered if it would really work.  </li>
            <li>Every woman who spends time putting on makeup wants it to stay on; so do yourself a favor and buy this product</li>
            <li>Not only does it set your makeup and keep it looking fresh all day, but it really helps to control oil.</li>
            <li>It makes skin not only glow, but look fresh and hydrated.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the new one</li>
            <li>Maybe will try it again later on down the line, but was not really  all that happy with it.</li>
            <li>it really hold my make up for a long day and night it really works!</li>
            <li>I was pretty regularly blotting my face at work with tissue throughout the day to get rid of excess oil (</li>
            <li>This worked well for one day, was very excited, but then it interfered with the color and texture of my original application, so it actually made it a bit worse as the day wore on.</li>
            <li>Had such high hopes for the product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s no good and makes you even more oily.</li>
            <li>It adds moisure without too much liquid and it will air dry in seconds.</li>
            <li>It comes out very wet, but dries very fast.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in the spray bottle</li>
            <li>I use it everyday over my makeup and by the time I get home from work (630 am to 530 pm), my makeup still looks fresh and my face is not overally shiny like it was.</li>

            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I bought this product, For all I knew it could be water and soap. However, upon spraying I quickly realized that this product exceeded my expectations. It makes skin not only glow, but look fresh and hydrated. I absolutely love this product. It allows make-up to stay in place for hours. And best of all it makes skin look healthy and young. I really recommend this item. It&#x27;s truly an exeptional product.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it leaves my make up fresh-looking and it doesn&#x27;t cause any peeling or smudges even out in the hot sun! I use this product for very important events I need to attend and don&#x27;t want to worry about my make up messing up or long flights cross-country that I&#x27;m always tired in! Great product the only problem I have with it is that it makes my skin oily! I&#x27;m proned to oily skin so this doesn&#x27;t help me a lot in that department. Like I said, love the product but leaves causes oily skin. I&#x27;d still recommend it though! If you&#x27;re prone to oily skin like me buy some oil absorbing sheets and keep them in your purse just in case you need one.</li>
            <li> So I was so excited for this product I really thought it was going to be great cuz I use these type of things all the time .... When I got this product it smelt really weird and when I sprayed it on my face I wanted to vomit... This isn&#x27;t a good product and I ended up throwing it away ... This isn&#x27;t a good product don&#x27;t waist your money just go to M.A.C and get the studio fix for 10 it&#x27;s a cute travel size and lasts forever !!!!!</li>
            <li> Had such high hopes for the product. I feel as if I could get a better, longer lasting result from a can of hairspray. This is exactly what it felt like on my face. Sticky! I would not purchase this again!! IF your really looking for a good setting spray try Model in a Bottle!</li>
            <li> this is really good. it was a lot of help and I was able to fix things without messing anything up and really helped make my makeup look amazing! worth the buy! i wish i would have gotten the bigger one now!!</li>
            <li> It did not do as it said.  My makeup lasted no longer than it usually does.  AND now I am dealing with a bit of a rash on my cheeks and forehead.  I&#x27;ve never been sensitive or broken out before.  Booo.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product from Sephora. It was disappointing. It made my face feel dewey for a few minutes (good!)... but it had no holding power whatsoever. My bareminerals makeup came off quicker than normal with this product over the top. Not a fan! I would never buy this product.</li>
            <li> For only $10, this is such a great product! I was pretty regularly blotting my face at work with tissue throughout the day to get rid of excess oil (etc.)&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I started using this, I haven&#x27;t done that once! Not only does it set your makeup and keep it looking fresh all day, but it really helps to control oil. If you have any of those concerns, this product is for you! :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a foundation setting spray and this one was rated second to the MAC spray. I actually order both hoping that at least one would work. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the MAC spray, it&#x27;s very oily and doesn&#x27;t set anything, neither does this spray. I sprayed it from varying distances, on my hand and my face; my makeup still wiped off with a gentle swipe of a tissue. I just ordered the Ben Nye setting spray. I&#x27;ll be sure to write a review. I&#x27;m so tired of getting ripped off.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this instead of the MAC fix plus. From what I can tell they do the same thing. Spray on a makeup brush loaded with shadow and you have your foiled eyeshadow or more intense color, depends what your going for. I haven&#x27;t tried it as a makeup setting spray but when the weatner warms up I will and update. All in all a great product. I like most makeup forever products!</li>
            <li> This worked well for one day, was very excited, but then it interfered with the color and texture of my original application, so it actually made it a bit worse as the day wore on. The thing I really didn&#x27;t care for was that I could not re-apply my makeup to fix the way it looked without taking it all off. Maybe will try it again later on down the line, but was not really  all that happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love make up forever I ordered this thinking it was the first mist and fix by make up forever. Come to find out it&#x27;s the new one it&#x27;s 2.0 which is terrible if you have oily skin it&#x27;s no good and makes you even more oily. Whoever is selling this product and posting the photographs please make sure to specify this is the new mist and fix my make up forever not the old one because the formula has changed</li>
            <li> Very disappointed ! You would think it would be larger,and when it came it was so tiny ! And it does nothing! Totally not worth the money.</li>
            <li> this is an amazing product! after finishing my make-up I just spray this a couple of times and my make-up stays all day long..</li>
            <li> I saw this on TV and wondered if it would really work.  I find that it does and without being sticky or tacky on the skin.  Every woman who spends time putting on makeup wants it to stay on; so do yourself a favor and buy this product and you&#x27;ve got your wish.</li>
            <li> This mist is perfect to freshen up makup during the workday. It adds moisure without too much liquid and it will air dry in seconds.</li>
            <li> Works great for a girl&#x27;s night out, WEDDINGS, or just a normal rainy day that you don&#x27;t want ruining your makeup.</li>
            <li> I use this over my powder foundation, it makes my face look dewy instead of powdery or dry. It doesn&#x27;t make my makeup last any longer then with out it</li>
            <li> it really hold my make up for a long day and night it really works! it last a long time!</li>
            <li> I was searching for something that would hold my makeup in place and help with the oil/shine control. This product is a little pricey, but I figured I would give it a try. I bought mine from Sephora (better price). I bought the 1.01 fl ounce bottle, which seems small and looks small in person, but a little of this product goes a long way. I have been using it about 3 weeks now and I love it. I use it everyday over my makeup and by the time I get home from work (630 am to 530 pm), my makeup still looks fresh and my face is not overally shiny like it was. The consistency when you spray this product on your face is odd. It comes out very wet, but dries very fast. I spray about two sprays on my face (different areas) to cover it all, and that lasts for me. After 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in the spray bottle so I think I picked the right size especially since I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like it.</li>
            <li> I like how it makes my makeup stay for hours. My trick is while my face is drying (a lil damp) I take my kabuki brush and blend everything in one last time. My face sets, I look matte (which I love) &amp; don&#x27;t have the \\&quot;shiny\\&quot; look at all.</li>
