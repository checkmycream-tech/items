            <li>Love Andrea ModLash!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice to purchase them in a quantity of 3 or 4, so i know I always have a spare pair.  </li>
            <li>These were easy to purchase, and looked cute online, however they aren&#x27;t great quality.  </li>
            <li>As a makeup artist, I&#x27;m glad to have found a staple for my kit.</li>
            <li>I love these things.</li>
            <li>So glad I enrolled in Prime.</li>
            <li>SHE LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li>I was not blessed with great natural lashes and can&#x27;t always afford the extensions.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t super obvious, they fit perfectly and after watching a youtube video on how to apply them more easily with tweezers, I use them about once a week or so.  </li>
            <li>I find them easy to blend with mascara</li>
            <li>Great eyelashes for three to four daily uses.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really quite beautiful and natural looking.</li>
            <li>The lashes that came were in the right packaging, but were way longer than the original!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I found this on Amazon thinking I no longer have to go out and figure out what store has these in stock.</li>
            <li>I am a makeup artist and these are always a client favorite for lashes that look natural but give more volume.</li>
            <li>Price is great, so you can buy a bunch and toss them away after each use, although you can get a few uses out of them, I just think after putting glue and mascara on them that tossing them is more sanitary.</li>
            <li>These come in a pack of 4, so I bought 3 packages of 4, so I don&#x27;t have to keep buying the whole rack of 53&#x27;s from the grocery store any more.  </li>
            <li>i love these lashes they look natural for everyday use and the pack of 4 is a great deal compared to individuals at store</li>
            <li>Cheaper than MAC lashes and more natural.</li>
            <li>People are allways asking me what kind of mascara i use, just make sure you trim them if you have small eyes</li>
            <li>easy to apply and look very natural.</li>
            <li>They are the perfect lashes for a natural look and as clients are usually frightened of fake lashes, these are the perfect ones.</li>
            <li>Even when professionally applied, they didn&#x27;t stay well and fell off easily.</li>
            <li>These are light weight and very natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li>Number 53 is a really nice option for a more natural, everyday look.</li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t use mascara and treat them gently you can even reuse them!</li>
            <li>Much better price than I can buy locally.  </li>
            <li>Ive being buying these exact lashes for sometime now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found them on Amazon especially since they are about $4-$5 at the store</li>
            <li>They are not to long and very light feeling.</li>
            <li>Best natural looking false eyelashes on the market.</li>
            <li>The lashes are more uniform in shape and longer, when the older #53 was more subtle.</li>
            <li>They really are nice and if you peel the glue off after each use, you can use them a few times.</li>
            <li>I bought countless pairs of falsies but they always looked too fake but these really are perfect.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found it makes them look more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and slightly less &amp;#34;doll-like.&amp;#34; Like I said, these things are a-MA-zing.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the \\&quot;53\\</li>
            <li>I LOVE these eyelashes because they are not too short or too long.</li>
            <li>They also look very natural.</li>
            <li>Only 1 set out of the 4 that came was the same original length.</li>
            <li>The listing clearly states these are in packs of 4, however they were not.</li>
            <li>I frequently receive woring item.</li>
            <li>I was buying these at the grocery store, 5 packages at a time, when I checked out Amazon to see if I could buy them in bulk at a reduced price and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>They look natural and are easier to put on</li>
            <li>These eyelashes will look extremely natural on you which is what I prefer but not too natural that it doesn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
            <li>They are the only lashes that I wear, and always get compliments about my pretty, long lashes.  </li>
            <li>Gives you a natural look of long lashes.</li>

            <li> Perfect length for all eye shapes. They also look very natural. As a makeup artist, I&#x27;m glad to have found a staple for my kit.</li>
            <li> My wife uses these daily and loves them.</li>
            <li> These have changed over the years. The lashes are more uniform in shape and longer, when the older #53 was more subtle.</li>
            <li> It is not product itself.  I frequently receive woring item. For exmaaple, I always order BLACK, but you send me BROWN.Please be careful when you pack the item. It is because it cause time and effor to send the worng item back.</li>
            <li> I was buying these at the grocery store, 5 packages at a time, when I checked out Amazon to see if I could buy them in bulk at a reduced price and was pleasantly surprised.  I particularly like the \\&quot;53\\&quot;&#x27;s because whereas they enhance my lashes, they aren&#x27;t so outrageously long that they LOOK fake.  And you can wear them more than once!  These come in a pack of 4, so I bought 3 packages of 4, so I don&#x27;t have to keep buying the whole rack of 53&#x27;s from the grocery store any more.  Great buy!  What was odd, though, was that of the multiple packages I bought all at one time, they came in both black and brown.  I thought, since they didn&#x27;t ask, that they&#x27;d all be the same color.</li>
            <li> I love these things. I buy them constantly. They&#x27;re really quite beautiful and natural looking. I find them easy to blend with mascara and if you don&#x27;t use mascara and treat them gently you can even reuse them! After one or two wears they get a few flaws but I&#x27;ve found it makes them look more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and slightly less &amp;#34;doll-like.&amp;#34; Like I said, these things are a-MA-zing.</li>
            <li> Much better price than I can buy locally.  Same style I have been wearing for years. So glad I enrolled in Prime.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and these are always a client favorite for lashes that look natural but give more volume. They are not to long and very light feeling.</li>
            <li> These are the best lashes ever BUT AMAZON only sent one set to me.  The listing is for a PACK OF FOUR.  There is no way to get a message to Amazon but to return it?  Please change your customer service, this is not the fault of the customer,</li>
            <li> These are my favorite false eyelashes!  They aren&#x27;t super obvious, they fit perfectly and after watching a youtube video on how to apply them more easily with tweezers, I use them about once a week or so.  They really are nice and if you peel the glue off after each use, you can use them a few times.</li>
            <li> These were easy to purchase, and looked cute online, however they aren&#x27;t great quality.  Even when professionally applied, they didn&#x27;t stay well and fell off easily.</li>
            <li> Best natural looking false eyelashes on the market. I wear them everyday and couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product</li>
            <li> i love these lashes they look natural for everyday use and the pack of 4 is a great deal compared to individuals at store</li>
            <li> These lashes allways look great! easy to apply and look very natural. No one ever believes me that they are not mine. People are allways asking me what kind of mascara i use, just make sure you trim them if you have small eyes or they may end up looking cartoony.</li>
            <li> These are light weight and very natural looking lashes. Price is great, so you can buy a bunch and toss them away after each use, although you can get a few uses out of them, I just think after putting glue and mascara on them that tossing them is more sanitary.</li>
            <li> I ordered and paid for the 4 pack of lashes.  I ONLY RECEIVED ONE.</li>
            <li> Ive being buying these exact lashes for sometime now. They are the perfect lashes for a natural look and as clients are usually frightened of fake lashes, these are the perfect ones.</li>
            <li> The listing clearly states these are in packs of 4, however they were not. I ordered 4 packs of 4 and only received 4 total eyelashes - not the 8 that should have arrived. Very disappointed with this order.</li>
            <li> I have used these lashes for years....it&#x27;s nice to purchase them in a quantity of 3 or 4, so i know I always have a spare pair.  They are the only lashes that I wear, and always get compliments about my pretty, long lashes.  ~wink, wink~</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I found this on Amazon thinking I no longer have to go out and figure out what store has these in stock. Once they arrived, I was so disappointed. The lashes that came were in the right packaging, but were way longer than the original! Only 1 set out of the 4 that came was the same original length.</li>
            <li> Great eyelashes for three to four daily uses. They look way better than eyelash extensions!</li>
            <li> GOT THEM FOR THE WIFE SHE LOVE THEM. THE ONLY BRAND SHE&#x27;LL WEAR A A A A A A A A A</li>
            <li> I was not blessed with great natural lashes and can&#x27;t always afford the extensions. I bought countless pairs of falsies but they always looked too fake but these really are perfect. They look natural and are easier to put on so they are the only style I wear now. I&#x27;m so glad I found them on Amazon especially since they are about $4-$5 at the store so I am saving money!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these eyelashes because they are not too short or too long. These eyelashes will look extremely natural on you which is what I prefer but not too natural that it doesn&#x27;t make a difference. I will keep buying these eyelashes for a long time!</li>
            <li> Love Andrea ModLash! They are beautiful quality and easy to apply. Number 53 is a really nice option for a more natural, everyday look.</li>
            <li> I get the best compliments when I wear these.  I use them several times before I have to toss them.  Cheaper than MAC lashes and more natural.</li>
            <li> #53 are the best! Gives you a natural look of long lashes. Not spider eyes!</li>
