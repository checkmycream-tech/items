            <li>AND MY HAIR FEELS AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It makes hair look more healthy and prevents fly aways.  </li>
            <li>I began with the OGX coconut milk shampoo and conditioner combo and then purchased this handy product</li>
            <li>makes hair smooth and smells soooo good.</li>
            <li>The Organix Coconut line works best for me, my hair is actually soft since I&#x27;ve switched to the Organix hair line.</li>
            <li>love love love love love love it!!</li>
            <li>However, I let a friend use it once who has very fine hair</li>
            <li>I love this product it makes my hair look amazing and healthy, I have recomended it to all my friends.</li>
            <li>the end of the day, the product did what it said it would, and has been the first to give me great results; hence I like this product despite those reservations.</li>
            <li>makes hair very smooth.</li>
            <li>And I can&#x27;t tell you how good it works because I don&#x27;t really see any difference to be honest</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser is always amazed at how healthy my hair is when I come in.</li>
            <li>thanks again for the great product</li>
            <li>I love the bottle and how the product comes out.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell.</li>
            <li>I mix it together with it and it makes the product work better at keeping my hair softer longer.</li>
            <li>smells heavenlyyy! :)</li>
            <li>, it made my hair even frizzier and it tangled more than before.</li>
            <li>I ordered 6 bottles and I am going to order about 20 bottles more.  </li>
            <li>It works better then</li>
            <li>My hair feels softer and is much more manageable after 7 consecutive days of use.</li>
            <li>and I think it smells lovely.  </li>
            <li>my hair had to be more powerfull</li>
            <li>so i love</li>
            <li>One of my favorite products made by OGX.  </li>
            <li>Not saying it was stinky before just saying I love the scent of coconut.</li>
            <li>I decided to go brunette again and noticed that my hair isn&#x27;t exactly healthy by any means</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t been getting as many since I started using this.</li>
            <li>I thought this stuff would be okay, but nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using this for a week, I noticed my hair became softer, shinier, and it looks healthy.</li>
            <li>Maybe this product is better for someone with thinner hair then?</li>
            <li>LOVE MY SPLIT ENDS MENDER &amp;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the coconut scent.</li>
            <li>so I came to Amazon to buy more.</li>
            <li>Okay so I bought it</li>
            <li>Love this, it has a very clean smell and seems to be working on my split</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!!!!</li>
            <li>(brown hair really shows spilt-ends!!!!)</li>
            <li>The only good thing is it smells good.  </li>
            <li>Smells great &amp; leaves your hair really soft !</li>
            <li>i think when you use the complete line of organix coconut milk products your hair will look really great.</li>
            <li>good product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>good deal and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells awesome and has worked very well for me so far.</li>
            <li>It was easy to order and arrived on time.  </li>
            <li>Pure magic!</li>
            <li>I have fine colored hair.</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s super soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>I like it, I was expecting it to be sulfate free</li>
            <li>The smell is kind of strong and obnoxious, so I don&#x27;t really like the smell of my hair right after I use it.</li>
            <li>This leaves my ends REALLY soft and looking very healthy.</li>
            <li>My hair pretty much does it&#x27;s own thing</li>
            <li>products smells just like real coconuts, probably better, but it dries out my hair which makes my hair brittle.</li>
            <li>but i didn&#x27;t use it too much time to rate it , but until now it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I have super curly, frizzy hair, so whenever I want it straightened I have to go all out on it.</li>
            <li>it seriously made my hair look wonderful and freshly trimmed.</li>
            <li>it worked fine, her hair was soft and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>this product works really well before you blow dry your hair and it smells really great.</li>
            <li>makes my hair feel soft and curls it will buy more</li>
            <li>my hair is healthy and soft again.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice enough a product.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>so I probably used a bit more at a time than what most other people would need.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands of comparable price range after running out of this, and they don&#x27;t do nearly as good of job as organix.  </li>
            <li>The Coconut Milk leaves your hair feeling soft and strong, it does not leave a residue at all</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s better to stick with regular or organic coconut oil.</li>
            <li>i love the entire organix line of coconut milk!</li>
            <li>exactly what my daughter wanted</li>
            <li>Have been using this for years, keeps my hair healthy without leaving any gross residue.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>This product really does work!</li>
            <li>I got this product to help me out in between and I must admit, it really works!</li>
            <li>First i loveee the smell .</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I liked it and made a habit to put it in my hair every day, but I&#x27;ve learned that a simple detangler/leave in conditioner and regular trims does a far better job keeping the spit ends away.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, been using this for very long time.  </li>
            <li>My hair used to look dry and brittle but it now looks healthy and nourished.</li>
            <li>It certainly \\&quot;mended\\&quot; my hair by making it sticky.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t help much but smells like yummy coconut</li>
            <li>I really like this split ends mender.</li>
            <li>and it has really strengthened my hair.</li>
            <li>but it seems to really like this product.</li>
            <li>I actually really like a tropical scent, so</li>
            <li>and because I color my hair so often, I have some intense split ends.</li>
            <li>i use it on my whole head not just my ends.</li>
            <li>: I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my split ends</li>
            <li>However, even since using this product my scalp has had so much dandruff.</li>
            <li>The spray is much thinner-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used different brands and products to help make my hair soft and healthy but nothing worked.</li>
            <li>For its stated purpose of mending split ends, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve gotten any good results (at least not noticeably so).</li>
            <li>i would recommend this product to my friends and i can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I love the coconut scent, and my hair feels a lot healthier and less snarly and tangled, but it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or coated.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s a decent price, too.</li>
            <li>Dont use this if you have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair, this coconut line of hair care products from Organix are much better suited for dry, processed, curly coarse hair.</li>
            <li>If you use too much or if your hair is not wet enough, it will leave your hair sticky, but here&#x27;s how I use it: I very lightly towel dry my hair after a shower, then spray in a leave-in conditioner (i use the hask placenta spray).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of OGX products, and this was better than expected.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh down or make my fine hair greasy.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting smell and super moisture!</li>
            <li>I straighten my hair every day, and have naturally curly hair, and this product helps prevent some of the damage from the heat.</li>
            <li>I am African-American with natural C4/C3 hair.</li>
            <li>It really will stop you from getting split ends and it will stop your hair from breaking especially if it is damaged from bleach, dryness, and stress.  </li>
            <li>testure is fine/ fragrance is wow cool/</li>
            <li>my hair feel soft</li>
            <li>Years of bleaching and using heat products completely damaged my hair and this solved all my problems.</li>
            <li>This Organix Split Ends mender completely surprised me~ does what it says it is going to do</li>
            <li>Makes my curls soft without the frizz.</li>
            <li>and I feel it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well on keeping my long very curly hair hydrated.</li>
            <li>Maybe the purchase of several more bottle (since they are so small) will produce the result I am looking for.</li>
            <li>Then I comb my hair out, and this leaves the ends pretty wet.</li>
            <li>Instead it made my hair feel dry and looked very frizzy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m naturally a brunette and for about 10 years I have been highlighting my hair and flat ironing it about 4-5 times a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American with natural hair</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel hard and crispy and full of tangles.</li>
            <li>But stupid Walmart has decided that nobody cares about beautiful hair in my town and surrounding towns and has stopped carrying it...</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry part of the U.S. in the winter, and it performs fantastically.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why some other reviews have said this product made their hair more tangled and/or sticky--the only thing I can think of is that it was applied to dry hair--which should not be done.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> LOVE MY SPLIT ENDS MENDER &amp;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the coconut scent.</li>
            <li> so I came to Amazon to buy more.</li>
            <li> Okay so I bought it</li>
            <li> Love this, it has a very clean smell and seems to be working on my split</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!!!</li>
            <li> (brown hair really shows spilt-ends!!!!)</li>
            <li> The only good thing is it smells good.  </li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; leaves your hair really soft !</li>
            <li> i think when you use the complete line of organix coconut milk products your hair will look really great.</li>
            <li> good product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> good deal and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awesome and has worked very well for me so far.</li>
            <li> It was easy to order and arrived on time.  </li>
            <li> Pure magic!</li>
            <li> I have fine colored hair.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s super soft and smells great.</li>
            <li> I like it, I was expecting it to be sulfate free</li>
            <li> The smell is kind of strong and obnoxious, so I don&#x27;t really like the smell of my hair right after I use it.</li>
            <li> This leaves my ends REALLY soft and looking very healthy.</li>
            <li> My hair pretty much does it&#x27;s own thing</li>
            <li> products smells just like real coconuts, probably better, but it dries out my hair which makes my hair brittle.</li>
            <li> but i didn&#x27;t use it too much time to rate it , but until now it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I have super curly, frizzy hair, so whenever I want it straightened I have to go all out on it.</li>
            <li> it seriously made my hair look wonderful and freshly trimmed.</li>
            <li> it worked fine, her hair was soft and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> this product works really well before you blow dry your hair and it smells really great.</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel soft and curls it will buy more</li>
            <li> my hair is healthy and soft again.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice enough a product.</li>
            <li> definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li> so I probably used a bit more at a time than what most other people would need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of comparable price range after running out of this, and they don&#x27;t do nearly as good of job as organix.  </li>
            <li> The Coconut Milk leaves your hair feeling soft and strong, it does not leave a residue at all</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s better to stick with regular or organic coconut oil.</li>
            <li> i love the entire organix line of coconut milk!</li>
            <li> exactly what my daughter wanted</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years, keeps my hair healthy without leaving any gross residue.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This product really does work!</li>
            <li> I got this product to help me out in between and I must admit, it really works!</li>
            <li> First i loveee the smell .</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I liked it and made a habit to put it in my hair every day, but I&#x27;ve learned that a simple detangler/leave in conditioner and regular trims does a far better job keeping the spit ends away.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, been using this for very long time.  </li>
            <li> My hair used to look dry and brittle but it now looks healthy and nourished.</li>
            <li> It certainly \\&quot;mended\\&quot; my hair by making it sticky.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help much but smells like yummy coconut</li>
            <li> I really like this split ends mender.</li>
            <li> and it has really strengthened my hair.</li>
            <li> but it seems to really like this product.</li>
            <li> I actually really like a tropical scent, so</li>
            <li> and because I color my hair so often, I have some intense split ends.</li>
            <li> i use it on my whole head not just my ends.</li>
            <li> : I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my split ends</li>
            <li> However, even since using this product my scalp has had so much dandruff.</li>
            <li> The spray is much thinner-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used different brands and products to help make my hair soft and healthy but nothing worked.</li>
            <li> For its stated purpose of mending split ends, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve gotten any good results (at least not noticeably so).</li>
            <li> i would recommend this product to my friends and i can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I love the coconut scent, and my hair feels a lot healthier and less snarly and tangled, but it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or coated.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s a decent price, too.</li>
            <li> Dont use this if you have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair, this coconut line of hair care products from Organix are much better suited for dry, processed, curly coarse hair.</li>
            <li> If you use too much or if your hair is not wet enough, it will leave your hair sticky, but here&#x27;s how I use it: I very lightly towel dry my hair after a shower, then spray in a leave-in conditioner (i use the hask placenta spray).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of OGX products, and this was better than expected.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down or make my fine hair greasy.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting smell and super moisture!</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair every day, and have naturally curly hair, and this product helps prevent some of the damage from the heat.</li>
            <li> I am African-American with natural C4/C3 hair.</li>
            <li> It really will stop you from getting split ends and it will stop your hair from breaking especially if it is damaged from bleach, dryness, and stress.  </li>
            <li> testure is fine/ fragrance is wow cool/</li>
            <li> my hair feel soft</li>
            <li> Years of bleaching and using heat products completely damaged my hair and this solved all my problems.</li>
            <li> This Organix Split Ends mender completely surprised me~ does what it says it is going to do</li>
            <li> Makes my curls soft without the frizz.</li>
            <li> and I feel it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well on keeping my long very curly hair hydrated.</li>
            <li> Maybe the purchase of several more bottle (since they are so small) will produce the result I am looking for.</li>
            <li> Then I comb my hair out, and this leaves the ends pretty wet.</li>
            <li> Instead it made my hair feel dry and looked very frizzy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally a brunette and for about 10 years I have been highlighting my hair and flat ironing it about 4-5 times a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with natural hair</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel hard and crispy and full of tangles.</li>
            <li> But stupid Walmart has decided that nobody cares about beautiful hair in my town and surrounding towns and has stopped carrying it...</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry part of the U.S. in the winter, and it performs fantastically.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some other reviews have said this product made their hair more tangled and/or sticky--the only thing I can think of is that it was applied to dry hair--which should not be done.  </li>
            <li> Has actually made it possible for my hair to grow much longer than it usually does and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m much happier with this than more expensive products I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li> I have very long blonde hair</li>
            <li> left my head really dry ...</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff for my very long, curly, dry, and somewhat coarse hair (that is damaged).</li>
            <li> I decided to try it for my crazy split ends, and I&#x27;ve noticed they become more noticable whenever I do use this product; no need to comb through my hair looking for split ends.</li>
            <li> When I put it in my towel dried curly hair it immediately made my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> I put about a quarter size of this product through the ends of my hair and then blow dry and straighten.</li>
            <li> my hair is really dry</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with curly dry hair like mine or just someone with dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is normally really dry and frizzy</li>
            <li> it is going to dry your hair too ..</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair which frizzes when dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thin.</li>
            <li> Leaving the ends wet like this, I use a dime-size amount of this mixed with a little OGX argan oil and apply just to the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness it works like a charm and a little goes a long, long way!  </li>
            <li> This product did not help with my split ends at all and left my hair limp.</li>
            <li> This product (like the coconut milk shampoo) don&#x27;t work as well as I expected on my hair.</li>
            <li> This kept it looking wet WITHOUT the crusty &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I am an AA female with thick, coarse, dense, wiry kinky 4b hair.</li>
            <li> A small amount of cream brings life back to my dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It does get split ends rather quickly after cutting or any type of treatments, so I thought I would try a few split ends menders and such.</li>
            <li> Later on in the day my hair did dry a little and became less soft but not so much to give this product a bad review.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I come from a tropical country, so coconuts are nothing new to me, but this smell is overpowering - even having a weird scent of hemp at times as a relative told me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> My hair was extremely damaged from bleaching, stress, dryness</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;never causes any itchiness on my scalp as some other gel do</li>
            <li> so it does not make your hair oily as quickly as other serums.</li>
            <li> and I blow dry it everyday.</li>
            <li> --I should have just thrown my money down the drain with all those other endless bottles because I have used them once</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that i have used that doesnt leave a nasty film on my hair and leaves it feeling soft, and i have used many products even high end that will make my hair feel dirty.</li>
            <li> I also use the Oils on my daughter&#x27;s very thick long blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried alot of expensive conditioners, leave in treatment, gentle shampoos, curl hydrators.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair</li>
            <li> I was using redken extreme, but at around $16 it was getting a little to pricy to continue to buy.</li>
            <li> i usually let air dry and my hair feels weightless.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think you should put a lot of your ends because it may weigh your hair down and give less flow.</li>
            <li> It did get a little crunchy if I let it get too thick at the ends, or waited too long to brush it, but other than that</li>
            <li> It also made my split ends less noticeable</li>
            <li> Less frazzled and frizzy looking.</li>
            <li> I used almost half the bottle already.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading a non-Amazon review on a black hair website.</li>
            <li> after putting bleach in my hair for a year and a half, the ends were pretty damaged and it was driving me crazy.</li>
            <li> Besides the little bit I already mentioned, I saw no change/difference/improvement/anything with my hair.</li>
            <li> This product actually made it worse.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your hair hydrated and its not too heavy</li>
            <li> If this is applied on damp, towel dried hair ~it will make your split end look *</li>
            <li> It does not make hair feel stiff or greasy.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair very hard, dry, brittle and sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li> I have terrible dry frizzzy curly split end full hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves it a little hard</li>
            <li> My hair has been dried, fried and frizzy lately, so I picked up a bottle of this at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> In fact, before using this product, an alarming amount of broken hairs would litter my floor bathroom leaving me</li>
            <li> This product works., but it makes really hard when it dries.</li>
            <li> I have coily hair and sometimes it&#x27;s really hard to find products that my hair agrees with.</li>
            <li> If you have thin/fine hair, you hardly need any of this.</li>
            <li> I have thick, brown hair that is prone to drying out and frizzing.  </li>
            <li> Works as well as Carol&#x27;s Daughter, but significantly less expensive.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my hair smell and its really subtle.</li>
            <li> I have thick (very thick) hair, and</li>
            <li> very thick to</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll see what I mean!</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m obsessed with my hair!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Boy, was I wrong!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed!</li>
            <li> but i am just disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product it makes my hair look amazing and healthy, I have recomended it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> It smells divine. And I can&#x27;t tell you how good it works because I don&#x27;t really see any difference to be honest but i will also say I don&#x27;t use it regularly to test. I don&#x27;t think  I am going to buy this again, It&#x27;s better to stick with regular or organic coconut oil.</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel soft and curls it will buy more</li>
            <li> I love this product. I was using redken extreme, but at around $16 it was getting a little to pricy to continue to buy. So I decided to try this organix product.  I have very long blonde hair and I blow dry it everyday. I put about a quarter size of this product through the ends of my hair and then blow dry and straighten. It makes hair look more healthy and prevents fly aways.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> For the price, this product is amazing! I&#x27;ve tried other brands of comparable price range after running out of this, and they don&#x27;t do nearly as good of job as organix.  I live in a very dry part of the U.S. in the winter, and it performs fantastically. Has actually made it possible for my hair to grow much longer than it usually does and no split ends! But stupid Walmart has decided that nobody cares about beautiful hair in my town and surrounding towns and has stopped carrying it...ugggh...that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here!</li>
            <li> i love the entire organix line of coconut milk! this product works really well before you blow dry your hair and it smells really great. my hair is really dry and i would even describe it as brittle. i think when you use the complete line of organix coconut milk products your hair will look really great. and i&#x27;m obsessed with my hair! i sometimes mix this with organix coconut milk serum. this product helps my hair feel silky and smooth and leaves it smelling great. i would recommend this product to my friends and i can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I am an AA female with thick, coarse, dense, wiry kinky 4b hair. I used this stuff on my ends and noticed that it made my ends feel like butter. I thought to myself, what would happen if I just put it all over? Pure magic! My hair is the softest its ever been and I don&#x27;t have frizz! This is truly amazing. No frizz and my ends feel so good. This is great for sealing ends and it smells divine.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help much but smells like yummy coconut</li>
            <li> I love this product. My hair is healthy and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this product I have noticed that I no longer have split ends. My hair used to look dry and brittle but it now looks healthy and nourished.</li>
            <li> exactly what my daughter wanted</li>
            <li> Everything OGX makes is good. Although I like the smell of this split end cream, a summery coconut scent, I prefer their kukui oil de-frizz.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00HVKBDB2/ I&#x27;ll probably go back to that after this one runs out.</li>
            <li> This is great.  Works as well as Carol&#x27;s Daughter, but significantly less expensive.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years, keeps my hair healthy without leaving any gross residue. I straighten my hair every day, and have naturally curly hair, and this product helps prevent some of the damage from the heat. My hair dresser is always amazed at how healthy my hair is when I come in. I was buying this in stores but then they mysteriously stopped selling it. thank heavens for Amazon! Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> good product and fast shipping. makes hair smooth and smells soooo good. will be a returning customer. thanks again for the great product</li>
            <li> This is one of my go-to products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is super great for my frizzy, unmanageable hair!</li>
            <li> this is the furst time i used this brand of product, but it might be my ladt. products smells just like real coconuts, probably better, but it dries out my hair which makes my hair brittle. it doesnt work well for me. trying to save my hair not break it off. i dont recommend this product</li>
            <li> I really like this split ends mender. I love the bottle and how the product comes out. I also love the smell. When I put it in my towel dried curly hair it immediately made my hair soft and moisturized. It also made my split ends less noticeable but they were still there. Later on in the day my hair did dry a little and became less soft but not so much to give this product a bad review. I like using this with the coconut anti-breakage serum from the same line. I mix it together with it and it makes the product work better at keeping my hair softer longer. I would recommend this to anyone with curly dry hair like mine or just someone with dry hair. All in all a good leave in.</li>
            <li> this is awesome! I have terrible dry frizzzy curly split end full hair. This makes my hair look so lovely! Pls dont stop making this! smells heavenlyyy! :)</li>
            <li> Smells nice and works good!</li>
            <li> I have thick, brown hair that is prone to drying out and frizzing.  This product actually made it worse.  It certainly \\&quot;mended\\&quot; my hair by making it sticky.  The only good thing is it smells good.  Other than that, it made my hair even frizzier and it tangled more than before.</li>
            <li> Dont use this if you have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair, this coconut line of hair care products from Organix are much better suited for dry, processed, curly coarse hair. Mine is all of those, have always had coarse curly hair but now that I have to color it, it is double damaged. I have tried alot of expensive conditioners, leave in treatment, gentle shampoos, curl hydrators. The Organix Coconut line works best for me, my hair is actually soft since I&#x27;ve switched to the Organix hair line. Less frazzled and frizzy looking. I don&#x27;t use anything else anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff for my very long, curly, dry, and somewhat coarse hair (that is damaged). I decided to try it for my crazy split ends, and I&#x27;ve noticed they become more noticable whenever I do use this product; no need to comb through my hair looking for split ends. The smell is kind of strong and obnoxious, so I don&#x27;t really like the smell of my hair right after I use it. Besides the little bit I already mentioned, I saw no change/difference/improvement/anything with my hair. It was only an \\&quot;okay\\&quot; product and I don&#x27;t plan on purchasing it again or even recommending it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  I have been using it with my daughters for the last 3 years.  It does not make hair feel stiff or greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair has been dried, fried and frizzy lately, so I picked up a bottle of this at the drugstore. For extra conditioning, I slathered it on and tied my hair in a ponytail and gave it an hour to soak in. After I washed and conditioned my hair, I applied some of this and I have to say it feels awesome. I love the coconut scent, and my hair feels a lot healthier and less snarly and tangled, but it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or coated. Plus it&#x27;s a decent price, too. I&#x27;m much happier with this than more expensive products I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!!! I ordered 6 bottles and I am going to order about 20 bottles more.  I am African-American with natural C4/C3 hair. My hair was extremely damaged from bleaching, stress, dryness and it was literally falling out when I would run my fingers through it.  In addition to using this product I also clipped my ends, had a deep conditioning, and stared a vitamin regimen and it has stopped my hair from breaking.  The Coconut Milk leaves your hair feeling soft and strong, it does not leave a residue at all and it has really strengthened my hair. I recommend it. It works better then all products I have used in my hair combined.  It really will stop you from getting split ends and it will stop your hair from breaking especially if it is damaged from bleach, dryness, and stress.  BUY THIS PRODUCT YOU WON&#x27;T REGRET IT!!</li>
            <li> good deal and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This product did not help with my split ends at all and left my hair limp.</li>
            <li> Does leave your hair a bit sticky</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Oh my goodness it works like a charm and a little goes a long, long way!  My hair feels softer and is much more manageable after 7 consecutive days of use. It&#x27;s a truly wonderful product.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and I think it smells lovely.  It didn&#x27;t make my hair sticky or tangled at all.  Just follow the bottles instructions and you&#x27;ll see what I mean! ;)</li>
            <li> testure is fine/ fragrance is wow cool/my hair had to be more powerfull so i love it/ that &#x27;s all</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products made by OGX.  Long lasting smell and super moisture! Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of OGX products, and this was better than expected. after putting bleach in my hair for a year and a half, the ends were pretty damaged and it was driving me crazy. with the help of this product along with moisture masks and refraining from bleach highlights (now doing darker tones of blonde in lolwlights) my hair is healthy and soft again. get it!!</li>
            <li> This product works., but it makes really hard when it dries. I had to wash my hair., because I couldn&#x27;t comb through it after using it.</li>
            <li> My hair is normally really dry and frizzy but now it&#x27;s super soft and smells great. Not saying it was stinky before just saying I love the scent of coconut. I have coily hair and sometimes it&#x27;s really hard to find products that my hair agrees with. My hair pretty much does it&#x27;s own thing but it seems to really like this product.</li>
            <li> I like this brand. The smell is amazing. Makes my hair smell good. It also conditions we&#x27;ll. very thick to</li>
            <li> This product really does work! I&#x27;m naturally a brunette and for about 10 years I have been highlighting my hair and flat ironing it about 4-5 times a week. I decided to go brunette again and noticed that my hair isn&#x27;t exactly healthy by any means (brown hair really shows spilt-ends!!!!) While I know the only solution for split-ends is a trim. I got this product to help me out in between and I must admit, it really works! It somehow masks the look of my split ends and I haven&#x27;t been getting as many since I started using this. I actually really like a tropical scent, so I like the way it makes my hair smell and its really subtle.</li>
            <li> I have super curly, frizzy hair, so whenever I want it straightened I have to go all out on it. Because of this and because I color my hair so often, I have some intense split ends. I thought this stuff would be okay, but nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I wrong! This was the bomb..it seriously made my hair look wonderful and freshly trimmed. I&#x27;m obsessed!</li>
            <li> Great stuff and a better price than at the drugstores.</li>
            <li> this is sticky, I prefer the Argan Oil and the Keratin Oil sprays.  I have fine colored hair. I also use the Oils on my daughter&#x27;s very thick long blonde hair.</li>
            <li> not a fan of this product. At all. It makes my hair feel hard and crispy and full of tangles.</li>
            <li> smells so good and my hair was like silky butter. love love love love love love it!!</li>
            <li> It helps me to control frizz on my hair after bath&lt;br /&gt;makes my hair feel soft&lt;br /&gt;it smells great&lt;br /&gt;never causes any itchiness on my scalp as some other gel do</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple months and i love it! it smells amazing and it detangles your hair while helping it. This is the ONLY product that i have used that doesnt leave a nasty film on my hair and leaves it feeling soft, and i have used many products even high end that will make my hair feel dirty.</li>
            <li> This product (like the coconut milk shampoo) don&#x27;t work as well as I expected on my hair. It leaves it a little hard (I have curly hair medium thickness) but I used it on my daughter and on her (she has curls buy softer than mine) it worked fine, her hair was soft and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> My sister loves it says it takes a lot of the frizz from her permed hair</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thin. It does get split ends rather quickly after cutting or any type of treatments, so I thought I would try a few split ends menders and such. This has a pleasant smell and isn&#x27;t gooey or sticky. It seemed to have stopped the ends from splitting further, but as for &amp;#34;mending&amp;#34;, I didn&#x27;t see any of that. It did get a little crunchy if I let it get too thick at the ends, or waited too long to brush it, but other than that, it was very nice.</li>
            <li> The older I&#x27;ve become, the less silky my hair has been.  My 20 something daughter told me she was using this and noticed a big difference in her hair so I tried it.  Now I can&#x27;t find it in stores so I found it online and stocked up.  Been using for about a year now</li>
            <li> I love all OGX products I have tried! This stuff smells awesome and has worked very well for me so far. If you have thin/fine hair, you hardly need any of this. If you use too much or if your hair is not wet enough, it will leave your hair sticky, but here&#x27;s how I use it: I very lightly towel dry my hair after a shower, then spray in a leave-in conditioner (i use the hask placenta spray). Then I comb my hair out, and this leaves the ends pretty wet. Leaving the ends wet like this, I use a dime-size amount of this mixed with a little OGX argan oil and apply just to the ends of my hair. This leaves my ends REALLY soft and looking very healthy. This is another great OGX product :)</li>
            <li> First i loveee the smell . I used almost half the bottle already. I use this for deep treatmeants cus my hair my hair is damaged .</li>
            <li> OGX&lt;br /&gt;Split Ends Mender works great.  It was easy to order and arrived on time.  I had been out of it for awhile and am so happy to have it again.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair hydrated and its not too heavy so it does not make your hair oily as quickly as other serums. I am happy with the purchase. Havent seen an effect on the spilt ends of my hair yet.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair very hard, dry, brittle and sticky feeling.  I had to re wash my hair after using this.</li>
            <li> It WORKS!!! A little goes a long way and I don&#x27;t think you should put a lot of your ends because it may weigh your hair down and give less flow.</li>
            <li> Years of bleaching and using heat products completely damaged my hair and this solved all my problems. I&#x27;ve used different brands and products to help make my hair soft and healthy but nothing worked. After using this for a week, I noticed my hair became softer, shinier, and it looks healthy. Using this from now on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some other reviews have said this product made their hair more tangled and/or sticky--the only thing I can think of is that it was applied to dry hair--which should not be done.  If this is applied on damp, towel dried hair ~it will make your split end look *A-MAZE*!  My hair is *FRIED* at the ends and I have countless potions and lotions I have tried that claim to help this issue--I should have just thrown my money down the drain with all those other endless bottles because I have used them once and they go into the ever growing stack under my sink of things I will never use again.  This Organix Split Ends mender completely surprised me~ does what it says it is going to do and you cannot beat the price! And it smells *divine*!</li>
            <li> i use this after every hair wash. i use it on my whole head not just my ends. makes hair very smooth. i usually let air dry and my hair feels weightless. not greasy at all and i have grease prone hair.&lt;br /&gt; ---josh&#x27;s wifey</li>
            <li> I liked it and made a habit to put it in my hair every day, but I&#x27;ve learned that a simple detangler/leave in conditioner and regular trims does a far better job keeping the spit ends away.</li>
            <li> great smell and works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty impressed with this product!  It doesn&#x27;t weigh down or make my fine hair greasy.  It has made it softer and easier to manage, especially on humid days.  It also helps conceal the split ends I have.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and feel that it helps protect my hair against heat products, too.  I would purchase this again!</li>
            <li> Love this, it has a very clean smell and seems to be working on my split ends fairly well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with natural hair have been using this for a couple of weeks and I can tell the difference already. The shedding i had has stopped and the breakage is gone. Love it! Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Great product to use on damaged hair. My hair was relaxed and dye and the product helped the hair not to break</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a long time.It truly makes a difference in my hair. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, been using this for very long time.  I have no spilt ends and my hair is below shoulder length.</li>
            <li> Pros: Smells great and isn&#x27;t too sticky&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my split ends&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: It&#x27;s a relatively affordable hair product. I have thick (very thick) hair, and so I probably used a bit more at a time than what most other people would need. For its stated purpose of mending split ends, I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve gotten any good results (at least not noticeably so). However, I let a friend use it once who has very fine hair and she stated that using this hair serum after a shower was perfect for increasing her styling ease. Maybe this product is better for someone with thinner hair then?</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading a non-Amazon review on a black hair website. This stuff works. My split ends were drastically reduced within three days, and my hair breakage is no longer a nightmare. In fact, before using this product, an alarming amount of broken hairs would litter my floor bathroom leaving me horrified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, it works. However, even since using this product my scalp has had so much dandruff. Perhaps it is my chemistry in relation to that of the mender. All I know is that my hair has been a winter wonderland since using this. Also, like others have mentioned, the mending process does seem to clump your hair together, making it looks unwashed like the greasy haired rebel smoking at the gas station. Another low of this product, is its smell. I come from a tropical country, so coconuts are nothing new to me, but this smell is overpowering - even having a weird scent of hemp at times as a relative told me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, the product did what it said it would, and has been the first to give me great results; hence I like this product despite those reservations.</li>
            <li> I like it, I was expecting it to be sulfate free and it wasn&#x27;t but it&#x27;s nice enough a product.</li>
            <li> LOVE MY SPLIT ENDS MENDER &amp;&lt;br /&gt;NOW I CAN GET IT AT QUANTITY THAT LASTS!! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I love the coconut scent. A small amount of cream brings life back to my dry frizzy hair. Makes my curls soft without the frizz.</li>
            <li> It is amazing ! I wanna let my hair grow out so I don&#x27;t wanna cut it but I had allot of split ends ! This for rid of most of them ! Smells great &amp; leaves your hair really soft ! I recommend it !</li>
            <li> This is amazing will order again</li>
            <li> What I received is NOT what is pictured. I&#x27;ve bought the cream before (like what is pictured) and loved it so I came to Amazon to buy more. What I received is a spray. The spray is much thinner- obviously and I feel it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well on keeping my long very curly hair hydrated.</li>
            <li> left my head really dry ... i have used their entire set.. but i am just disappointed. it is going to dry your hair too ..</li>
            <li> I like it ..  but i didn&#x27;t use it too much time to rate it , but until now it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Works great on ur split ends</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair which frizzes when dry. This kept it looking wet WITHOUT the crusty &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34;. I applied a lot; it neither slowed nor sped the drying time. I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> I began a hair reparation process about 2 months ago. I began with the OGX coconut milk shampoo and conditioner combo and then purchased this handy product and I must say, this has worked wonders on my ends!! definitely worth the price.  I purchased another combo (Biotin and Collagen) OGX has and works just as well with the mender to help keep my hair flawless!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Says it&#x27;s supposed to nourish your hair. Instead it made my hair feel dry and looked very frizzy</li>
            <li> Okay so I bought it and I thought it would just like make my hair healither or something I bought it just Wishing, hoping it would help my damaged hair and Ive used it THREE TIMES AND MY HAIR FEELS AMAZING. LIKE I JUST TOUCHED MY HAIR AND IMMEDIATELY CAME TO WRITE THIS REVIEW I am IN LOVE! I&#x27;m gonna buy another!</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel like bristles on a brush</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any result from use of product. Maybe the purchase of several more bottle (since they are so small) will produce the result I am looking for.</li>
