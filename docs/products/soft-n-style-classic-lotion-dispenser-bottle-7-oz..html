            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>

            <li> Hard to pump when in a massage session, Works good for people with occasional use but for 15-20 times in an hour not really ideal.</li>
            <li> Have to pump it 3 or 4 times to get enough oil as one pump from some of my other bottles.</li>
            <li> Would NOT recommend to any other Massage Therapist!</li>
            <li> but it is a little irksome.</li>
            <li> But the only problem is its very hard to pump the oil in the plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> I use this pump for my dish soap and sometimes you have to pump it a few times for it to start dispensing soap.</li>
            <li> Now I can mix some of my oil with essence oil and still have a few bottle spare.  </li>
            <li> Not a huge issue</li>
            <li> These pump very very little amount at a time.  </li>
            <li> it pumps out a fairly small amount</li>
            <li> A little tricky to figure out how to open the pump, and it doesn&#x27;t close, which is inconvenient as I wanted it for my face wash in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> I buy giant bottles of shampoo and liquid soap for the cost savings, but hate to deal with them in the shower.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. I buy giant bottles of shampoo and liquid soap for the cost savings, but hate to deal with them in the shower. These are just the right size to fill up and use.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to replace the caps on my Soul Purpose 12oz Lotion and Shower Gels.  I share these with other Direct Sales Reps all the time! Nakiaevans.com</li>
            <li> These are great for homemade DIY projects - lotions, soaps and hand sanitizers. I just keep refilling them and the pumps have not given out yet!</li>
            <li> I bought these Soft &#x27;N&#x27; Style Classic Lotion Dispenser Bottles for our homemade liquid soap. I am thoroughly impressed with the conservative amount the comes out of the pump. Now, we wont be going through our soap so quickly! Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Working great for the lotions I make for family use.</li>
            <li> We have three cabins which we use Watkins products in.  We bought these bottles for lotion and shampoo, to place in these cabins for vacation rentals.  Their perfect.  Nice and clear and the pumps work amazingly well. This is our second set of six that we have purchased, only because a vacation renter stole a bottle of lotion so we have to replace it.</li>
            <li> I use this pump for my dish soap and sometimes you have to pump it a few times for it to start dispensing soap. Not a huge issue but it is a little irksome. I like that it pumps out a fairly small amount so you only use what you need.</li>
            <li> good quality product.  I ordered several sets for a project.  The pumps seem sturdy although I didn&#x27;t personally use them.  The product was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t always pump well..squeeze bottle better</li>
            <li> These pump very very little amount at a time.  I own a massage practice. I was hoping these would be a good alternative to ordering from our typical site that takes so long to ship but they just don&#x27;t pump enough out at one time.  They would be good for regular household use, but not for this purpose.  The bottle itself as well as the pump do seem very sturdy.</li>
            <li> These are too flimsy to last well and some of them wouldn&#x27;t stand up very well as they were a little bent.  They were admittedly cheap and they are indeed cheap.</li>
            <li> I got these bottles to replace the big flip top shampoo bottles in the shower.  My wife has so many different hair products they won&#x27;t all fit in the shower rack.  These smaller bottles solve that problem.  They work well dispelling a measured amount which saves on shampoo or conditioner.  They are easy to fill with a small cheap kitchen funnel.  All in all they are worth the price I paid for them.</li>
            <li> These are Very good bottles, I bought these to put Goat Milk Lotion in. I was very pleased. The pumps are a plus.</li>
            <li> product arrtved and everything was acceptable</li>
            <li> Excellent for me, the massage therapist</li>
            <li> perfect for my homemade lotion</li>

            <li> Great bottles to use with my aromatherapy massage oils. Easy to pump and to clean. Pump seems durable and 7oz is just the optimal size for the holsters I use. Definitely will buy more.</li>
            <li> A little tricky to figure out how to open the pump, and it doesn&#x27;t close, which is inconvenient as I wanted it for my face wash in my gym bag. Good for dispensing bulk liquid soaps (Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for example) into smaller containers for the shower or sink.</li>
