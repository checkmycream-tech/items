            <li>Hair feels so clean and smooth and smells delicious!  </li>
            <li>The best thing about Beautiful Nutrition Grapefruit Detox Shine Shampoo has been that it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Looks good (packaged well), smells delicious (with just the right amount of fresh grapefruit, which I love), from the bottle, and out of the bottle, while lathering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really digging the Beautiful Nutrition Detox shampoo and conditioner because they don&#x27;t harm m hair.</li>
            <li>First, the smell is delicious- very clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with the Grapefruit Detox , I use a lot of hair sprays and hair gel .</li>
            <li>fragrance is lovely.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t necessarily a daily product, but it works excellent for clearing build-up and damage for me two days a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love that it is hypoallergenic, not tested on animals and most important!</li>
            <li>I love that it is hypoallergenic, not tested on animals and most important!</li>
            <li>I love this product already.</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy and shines in one use.</li>
            <li>smell is also amazing , I love the smell of the fresh grapefruit scent  .</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a beautiful yellow color and an appealing fragrance from citrus oils and extracts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; where the shampoo starts off, the conditioner helps my hair finish strong.  </li>
            <li>This is a great smell to wake up too , I am also a huge fan that this is made in the USA ,  I am a male and would tell anyone who uses a lot of hair products to pick up a couple bottles of this that way you will never run out ,</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this shampoo and conditioner to try out.</li>
            <li>And most important: my hair looks beautiful, definitely shiny and soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure after trying these out</li>
            <li>And even though I normally donâ€™t like fruit scents in my shampoo/conditioner, the grapefruit smell was not overpowering, but nice and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s such an honest and refreshing addition to the directions for use, it deserves</li>
            <li>I do not usually review products, but this shampoo and conditioner are so amazing that I just had to share my thoughts!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially, this shampoo will require a little more working to get a good sudsy lather going.  </li>
            <li>Actually haven&#x27;t been so impressed with a shampoo and conditioning product in a long time.    </li>
            <li>With the [[ASIN:B00MCGYXEO Beautiful Nutrition Grapefruit Detox Shine Repair Shampoo]], I&#x27;ve gotten back the shine and soft look</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a scent of grapefruit, very aromatic, but also light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>The first few times I used this shampoo (along side the Beautiful Nutrition Conditioner), I noticed that my hair was staying so much softer and more manageable for a much longer time.</li>
            <li>It was the first time I&#x27;d seen a hair product claim that, and it really is true.</li>
            <li>so clean, soft, smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually a big fan of grapefruit, but this is more like a sweet citrus medley, and it&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shampoo really lathers up so that you know it is getting every strand of hair on your head clean.  </li>
            <li>My hair is chemically blonde and gets a lot of dullness in between salon visits but this made it 100% better.</li>
            <li>This is one product that does exactly what it claims to do.  </li>
            <li>I used the conditioner and the detox shine for the first time</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair so soft and so clean</li>
            <li>It really cleans up the buildup in your hair and (when used with the conditioner) leaves it soft, shiny, and full of body.  </li>
            <li>The whole experience was uplifting and rejuvenating.</li>
            <li>My hair really felt like it went through a &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34;..........</li>
            <li>I really desired.  </li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t need much product for medium/long hair.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t need much product for medium/long hair.</li>
            <li>love this shampoo made my hair soft and cleaned my build up of my well water left in my hair and gave it a mice feeling</li>
            <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this soft and healthy in a long time.  </li>
            <li>My hair is in not great condition, and this stuff made it soft, shiny, and well, like somebody else&#x27;s (great) hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have extensions and they feel so soft and real.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use, and would absolutely recommend this product, and its sister product, the Repair Conditioner, to anyone who wants to fulfill their hair&#x27;s potential!</li>
            <li>using this shampoo and the Cleaner Longer Conditioner, my hair was on the second day just like the first day.</li>
            <li>They leave my hair feeling very smooth, looking shiny (no easy feat for someone with colored, processed hair!)</li>
            <li>Consistency of shampoo is a little thicker than others, but foams a lot and feels and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using both shampoo and conditioner just a few times, I could already tell the difference in my hair, no product build-up, just clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>What really proved it to me was that I saw the \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; effect long before I ever read the description on the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about shampoo because I color my hair each month, and don&#x27;t want to dry it,</li>
            <li>I was traveling some last week and had to use a shampoo I had used many times in the past, and afterwards my hair was back to</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s old self, of having to be tamed with products by the next morning,</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m home and using these products again, and getting my hair back into the soft manageable shape</li>
            <li>shampoo daily (no conditioning) and my hair remains soft, shiny and feels</li>
            <li>probably wonâ€™t use this shampoo/conditioner daily, but definitely once a week, to clear the build-up of all the conditioning/styling products.</li>
            <li>This cleans my hair so good , I have used a lot of clarifying shampoo and they always dries my hair out so bad ,</li>

            <li> Before, I would have to use other products several times in a row (wash, rinse, reapply, wash, rinse, reapply, and so on).  </li>

            <li> my hair wasn&#x27;t tangled or dry feelingand guess what?!!</li>
            <li> Smells just like the fruit, unlike other products where the smell is artificial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But wow, 48 hours after washing my hair and I can wake up with soft fluffy hair instead of a bent, frizzy, awkward mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I had put in hair products to make it behave, by then, they&#x27;ve weighed my hair down and made it look a mess.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few washed with this and the conditioner, I then noticed on the conditioning bottle</li>
            <li> Conditioner is a little hard to rinse out.</li>
            <li> And a horrid mess the following morning after that, when I made a mad dash for the shower.</li>
            <li> Helps get hard water residue off my hair.</li>
            <li> you WILL BE addicted.</li>

            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing! I&#x27;ve never been so impressed with a product! My hair is chemically blonde and gets a lot of dullness in between salon visits but this made it 100% better.</li>
            <li> This product, along with its companion Grapefruit Detox Shine Repair Conditioner, is EXCELLENT!    Looks good (packaged well), smells delicious (with just the right amount of fresh grapefruit, which I love), from the bottle, and out of the bottle, while lathering.

            <li> Using this shampoo with the [[ASIN:B00M7VB3QU Beautiful Nutrition Cleaner Longer Rinse Out Conditioner]] is an amazing combination. The first few times I used this shampoo (along side the Beautiful Nutrition Conditioner), I noticed that my hair was staying so much softer and more manageable for a much longer time. Every shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve used in the past, I would have to absolutely wash my hair every other day. No way around it. By halfway through the day after my hair has been washed, it was looking rough. If I had put in hair products to make it behave, by then, they&#x27;ve weighed my hair down and made it look a mess. If I don&#x27;t have hair products in, my hair is a frizz ball of chaos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But using this shampoo and the Cleaner Longer Conditioner, my hair was on the second day just like the first day. And even more amazing, by the morning after that, a full 48 hours after washing it, it still looks great! Course I still go ahead and get a shower and wash my hair. But wow, 48 hours after washing my hair and I can wake up with soft fluffy hair instead of a bent, frizzy, awkward mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few washed with this and the conditioner, I then noticed on the conditioning bottle it says \\&quot;Cleaner Longer\\&quot;. It was the first time I&#x27;d seen a hair product claim that, and it really is true. What really proved it to me was that I saw the \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; effect long before I ever read the description on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful Nutrition has some awesome hair products. Pretty sure after trying these out there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;ll be going back to my other brands.

Now I&#x27;m home and using these products again, and getting my hair back into the soft manageable shape it was in prior to the trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for reviewin prior to the trip.

            <li> I am in love with the Grapefruit Detox , I use a lot of hair sprays and hair gel . This cleans my hair so good , I have used a lot of clarifying shampoo and they always dries my hair out so bad , This leaves my hair so soft and so clean .The smell is also amazing , I love the smell of the fresh grapefruit scent  . This is a great smell to wake up too , I am also a huge fan that this is made in the USA ,  I am a male and would tell anyone who uses a lot of hair products to pick up a couple bottles of this that way you will never run out ,</li>
            <li> This shampoo is excellent.  I can go an extra day without washing my hair.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shampoo!  It really cleans up the buildup in your hair and (when used with the conditioner) leaves it soft, shiny, and full of body.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Helps get hard water residue off my hair.</li>
            <li> love this shampoo made my hair soft and cleaned my build up of my well water left in my hair and gave it a mice feeling</li>
            <li> This is one product that does exactly what it claims to do.  My hair is in not great condition, and this stuff made it soft, shiny, and well, like somebody else&#x27;s (great) hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is lovely.  I&#x27;m not usually a big fan of grapefruit, but this is more like a sweet citrus medley, and it&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, this shampoo isn&#x27;t as sudsy as others.  You need to keep working with it, stick your head under the shower a couple of times, and you&#x27;ll be rewarded with enough heavenly smelling bubbles to satisfy anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of us programmed to &amp;#34;lather, rinse, repeat&amp;#34;, you only need to lather once.  That&#x27;s such an honest and refreshing addition to the directions for use, it deserves a mention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product along with the companion conditioner for review, after I&#x27;d tried and become a devotee of the company&#x27;s Citrseal leave-in conditioner.  My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this soft and healthy in a long time.  Big fangirl here.</li>
            <li> I do not usually review products, but this shampoo and conditioner are so amazing that I just had to share my thoughts!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this shampoo and the conditioner as a sample and after reading its&#x27; claims I decided to try it and see if it would stand up to my test!  Well, I have to say the it exceeded my expectations and more!!!  First, the smell is delicious- very clean and fresh.  The shampoo really lathers up so that you know it is getting every strand of hair on your head clean.  My hair really felt like it went through a &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34;..........so clean, soft, smooth and shiny.  I recommend that you give this product a try- you will not be sorry:)</li>
            <li> Smells great. Nice packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo along with the conditioner gives your hair a very nice smooth texture. Conditioner is a little hard to rinse out. Consistency of shampoo is a little thicker than others, but foams a lot and feels and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! Hair feels so clean and smooth and smells delicious!  Will continue to buy and the price is so  inexpensive!</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a beautiful yellow color and an appealing fragrance from citrus oils and extracts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does an excellent job cleaning hair and restoring shine and is a pleasure to use because of the wonderful scent and nice lather.  It also rinses clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paired conditioner is [[ASIN:B00MCGYXNU Grapefruit Detox Shine Repair Conditioner]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful Nutrition provided a bottle for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> From hard water and rough treatments on my hair, it loses it&#x27;s luster rather quickly.  With the [[ASIN:B00MCGYXEO Beautiful Nutrition Grapefruit Detox Shine Repair Shampoo]], I&#x27;ve gotten back the shine and soft look I really desired.  This shampoo has a scent of grapefruit, very aromatic, but also light and fresh.  Smells just like the fruit, unlike other products where the smell is artificial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, this shampoo will require a little more working to get a good sudsy lather going.  Frankly I don&#x27;t mind that for the results I get.  Before, I would have to use other products several times in a row (wash, rinse, reapply, wash, rinse, reapply, and so on).  With this Grapefruit Detox Shine Repair Shampoo, one wash and rinse and I&#x27;m good to go.  This shampoo works excellent with it&#x27;s brother product the [[ASIN:B00MCGYXNU Beautiful Nutrition Grapefruit Detox Shine Repair Conditioner]]; where the shampoo starts off, the conditioner helps my hair finish strong.  This isn&#x27;t necessarily a daily product, but it works excellent for clearing build-up and damage for me two days a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about shampoo because I color my hair each month, and don&#x27;t want to dry it, fry it, or fade it with my choice of products. I&#x27;m really digging the Beautiful Nutrition Detox shampoo and conditioner because they don&#x27;t harm m hair. They leave my hair feeling very smooth, looking shiny (no easy feat for someone with colored, processed hair!) and they don&#x27;t seem to affect the color. I&#x27;m a fan of this brand and these products - and they&#x27;re not too pricy either, for this level of quality!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is fantastic!  I can feel the difference!  I use it with the conditioner too and my hair has never looked and felt so good!</li>
            <li> The best thing about Beautiful Nutrition Grapefruit Detox Shine Shampoo has been that it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I shampoo daily (no conditioning) and my hair remains soft, shiny and feels clean.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo comes out thick but lathers really well. Smells great too.</li>

            <li> I received a free sample of this shampoo and conditioner to try out. Overall, I like the idea of clearing my hair of all the product build-up from conditioning/styling, etc.&lt;br /&gt;After using both shampoo and conditioner just a few times, I could already tell the difference in my hair, no product build-up, just clean and shiny. And even though I normally donâ€™t like fruit scents in my shampoo/conditioner, the grapefruit smell was not overpowering, but nice and subtle.&lt;br /&gt;I probably wonâ€™t use this shampoo/conditioner daily, but definitely once a week, to clear the build-up of all the conditioning/styling products.</li>
            <li> I used the conditioner and the detox shine for the first time today my hair feels amazing I can&#x27;t wait to get the shampoo. I have extensions and they feel so soft and real. I love this product already. My hair looks healthy and shines in one use.</li>
