            <li>Great bubble bath for a nice soothing soak.</li>
            <li>This is not that good for that price.  </li>
            <li>This soothing bath foam smells good and soothes.</li>
            <li>It is as good as the granular form, but easier to manage.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a fair amount of medium-range priced bath products, and was hoping for more from this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried all kind of therapeutic bath.</li>
            <li>smells good and is refreshing</li>
            <li>like the price and the bubbles are abundant get some for yourself</li>
            <li>a wonderful, natural, relaxing aroma with no side effects.  </li>
            <li>Has a good smell not too strong, bubbles are nice and it gets you clean</li>
            <li>what more can you ask for.</li>
            <li>Love Dr. Teal&#x27;s bubble baths.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely and adds to a relaxing bath.</li>
            <li>Dr Teals fault the price more than doubled...</li>
            <li>I used to love Amazon</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE the smell of this.</li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic too!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>It was OK considering the amount I paid for it.</li>
            <li>The smell is minty and refreshing without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>This Eucalyptus Spearmint foaming bath its wonderful especially in winter.</li>
            <li>I love this bubble bath.  </li>
            <li>Love the product and then found out</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>love love love my baths</li>
            <li>the more bubbles the happier</li>
            <li>eucalyptus spearmint scent is well-balanced, refreshing, and energizing.</li>
            <li>The scent is very natural and pleasant, and it makes nice bubbles.</li>
            <li>It leaves you feeling very clean and relaxed.</li>
            <li>-- I think a good part of it would have come from any hot bath.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice big bottle, and you don&#x27;t need to use much, so it is a great value as well.</li>
            <li>my skin is calm and feels nice again.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s nice to have bubble bath for when you really want bubbles!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is definitely true that you need to put more than a capful of this product into the tub to fill the tub with bubbles.  </li>
            <li>smells great, bought different scents and like them all.</li>
            <li>and I kept my old container because I loved the scent.  </li>
            <li>I came across Dr. Teal&#x27;s on Amazon and based on the five-star reviews ordered one, even though a 34 oz bottle for only $5 seemed too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is good especially for the damage that happened to my hip!</li>
            <li>(You can see the full ingredients list on the product</li>
            <li>Have always loved Dr. Teal&#x27;s products and unfortunately my local grocery store has stopped carrying the products.</li>
            <li>smells nice and is not overwhelming, makes good amount of bubbles.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice initially, but light and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>I even bought my own essential oils to try to recreate the scent.</li>
            <li>nice big bottle for a bubble bath</li>
            <li>The foaming action is nice and the eucalyptus spearmint scent is very soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li>This combination of eucalyptus and spearmint sets just the right mood to relax and calm yourself.  </li>
            <li>The eucalyptus and mint scents are pretty mild.  </li>
            <li>I poured a bit more than a cap full into running water and the bubbles last me over an hour.</li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;m happy enough to continue using my bottle and to potentially buy it again one day.  </li>
            <li>like very much that this does not contain any synthetic dyes.  </li>
            <li>I love this foaming bubble bath in combination with the epsom salt soaking solution of the same scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before, but this is my first purchase through Amazon.</li>
            <li>You only need a couple caps and have more bubbles than you can imagine.</li>
            <li>It comes in many different scents and soaks.</li>
            <li>I will use this again as this was not the first time using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying out different bath salts, treatments, etc., and this is the latest bath add-</li>
            <li>More importantly, I discovered only today in wandering the aisles of Walmart that I could have bought the exact same size bottle of it for one-third the price.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure what to think of the reviewers who have not tried other products in the category and get overwhelmingly impressed by their first purchase to leave a five-star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to keep pouring the buuble bath in large quantity while water was running</li>
            <li>I really like this as a bubble bath.</li>
            <li>The foaming bath feature allows one to really relax without the feeling of it being a medicinal soak.  </li>
            <li>a harmless guilty pleasure!--but Dr. Teal&#x27;s foaming bath is by far the best product out there.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I prefer the Epsom Salt Soaking Solution, since bubbles tend to be more drying to the skin and the Epsom salt provides other soothing benefits.</li>
            <li>It has the fragrance but required more to be used... Was watered down somewhat.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something more concentrated and to use less product, go for Village Naturals.</li>
            <li>Used to purchase my bubble bath from Bath &amp; Body Works, but this is better and is half the price.  </li>
            <li>I stock up whenever I see this for a decent price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as health benefits go, it is rather more likely to cause sudden leaps from the bathtub than it is to give a sense of relaxation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure the salts themselves do too much to relax, but the scent sure does.</li>
            <li>This takes 30 minutes and is kind of messy, so I usually just put my hair up in a processing cap and take a nice, long bath while reading a book.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the larger size and filled up the smaller bottle to keep near my bathtub.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I have an old claw foot tub</li>
            <li>A low score here because the product cost twice as much as in the store.</li>
            <li>This is a gentle means of getting an Epsom salt with muscle relaxing essential oils bath.  </li>
            <li>A thick layer of bubbles not only feels luxurious but also insulates the bathtub water and keeps the water warm for longer periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With high quality bubble baths, only one capful is enough to make a dense layer of bubbles covering the whole bathtub.</li>
            <li>The scent is potent, the bubbles are plentiful and long lasting, and I only need to use a small amount of  product to get the desired effect.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>However, one bottle is quite large and I still have half of mine left after using this weekly for over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I usually just squeeze a bunch out under running water, adding a little as needed, and occasionally stirring the bubbles around the tub with the bottle to get them more evenly dispersed.  </li>
            <li>if you take occasioanl baths and don&#x27;t mind an average quality, high value product, this is it</li>

            <li> but if you have ever smelled real eucaluptus oil, this bubble bath is far from it.&lt;br /&gt;Suffice to say my two recent baths have been mediocre and I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> We love this and use a bottle every month, we will reorder, it makes us rest and relax as the cold weather comes and goes from the Wht.</li>
            <li> I put close to half the bottle in the water and barely any foam was made.</li>
            <li> It seems to me that the anticipated refreshing aromas of both the eucalyptus and the spearmint did not marry well and formed something slightly unpleasant instead.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to products that are scented, so usually buy everything</li>
            <li> The bubbles also are few and do not last long.</li>
            <li> I would say that this is somewhat less concentrated than similar products.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of having plain old baths, so I wanted to add something new to it</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way in smell and creating bubbles.</li>
            <li> I paid $4.89 + $5.44 SH (included 3 other products as well)</li>
            <li> will try other scents.</li>
            <li> I like Dr. Teal&#x27;s Foaming Bath, but I paid way too much for it here unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Weak scent and low bubble grade.  </li>
            <li> a little stronger than what comes in the bottle</li>
            <li> so I add a little Eucalyptus oil to the bath water.</li>
            <li> About 11 years ago my mom purchased this for me as a small gift</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve even made it hard to know what your shipping is...</li>
            <li> Some synthetic fragrances are in a special class of headache evil.</li>
            <li> far I have used it twice and have been greatly disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is weak and it produces medium bubbles that are gone in 15-20 min.</li>
            <li> I wish it didn&#x27;t contain artificial fragrance, either, but I have not found it to be irritating.  </li>
            <li> The synthetic fragrance is so overpoweringly bad that I couldn&#x27;t detect the eucalyptus at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly disappointed in the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> This product is made with the evil.</li>
            <li> The amount of foam is outrageous.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Weak scent and low bubble grade.  Very disappointing.  How can this even be sold?</li>
            <li> About 11 years ago my mom purchased this for me as a small gift but forgot where she got it. I was happy to see that Amazon carried it and I kept my old container because I loved the scent.  I purchased the larger size and filled up the smaller bottle to keep near my bathtub.&lt;br /&gt;I use it all the time. I have an old claw foot tub so relaxing in this is sheer pleasure.</li>
            <li> Has a good smell not too strong, bubbles are nice and it gets you clean what more can you ask for.</li>
            <li> Love Dr. Teal&#x27;s bubble baths.</li>
            <li> Bubbles up nicely and smells good!</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Use this every day! Great way to start the day.</li>
            <li> Some synthetic fragrances are in a special class of headache evil. This product is made with the evil. The synthetic fragrance is so overpoweringly bad that I couldn&#x27;t detect the eucalyptus at all. As far as health benefits go, it is rather more likely to cause sudden leaps from the bathtub than it is to give a sense of relaxation. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaping from the bath because you might slip and crack your head, which will only add insult to injury.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a fair amount of medium-range priced bath products, and was hoping for more from this product. The scent is nice initially, but light and dissipates quickly. The bubbles also are few and do not last long. If you&#x27;re looking for something more concentrated and to use less product, go for Village Naturals.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and invigorating scent!  Great bubble bath for a nice soothing soak.</li>
            <li> I love this foaming bubble bath in combination with the epsom salt soaking solution of the same scent. It smells lovely and adds to a relaxing bath.</li>
            <li> I paid $4.89 + $5.44 SH (included 3 other products as well) approx. 2 months ago. I was thinking of re-ordering, but the cheapest price is now around $18 w/ shipping bc Amazon now doesn&#x27;t ship... LOL This is not that good for that price.  The fragrance is weak and it produces medium bubbles that are gone in 15-20 min. I would give it 3-4 stars at $4.89 but only 2 stars at $18.  I&#x27;d give it 1 star, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s Dr Teals fault the price more than doubled... it&#x27;s the sellers on here trying to rip you off on shipping. I used to love Amazon but they need to monitor and police the shipping scammers on here. They&#x27;ve even made it hard to know what your shipping is... you think you are buying from Amazon but when you get to final check-out you find you are being charged shipping by 3-5 different buyers.  Jeff stop playing w/ drones and start policing your sellers!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE the smell of this. Soo relaxing. I even bought my own essential oils to try to recreate the scent.</li>
            <li> smells nice and is not overwhelming, makes good amount of bubbles. will try other scents. i recommend this to anyone who loves relaxing bath time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and tried it out tonight...wow! I poured a bit more than a cap full into running water and the bubbles last me over an hour. The scent is fantastic too! I will definitely use this product regularly!</li>
            <li> The foulest mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever had.  Do NOT swallow this stuff.  It will not make your p**p smell like a spa.  Gargling with it as a mouthwash is an unmitigated disaster.  Had my girlfriend screaming and calling the ASPCA to get me carted off for rabies treatment.  The amount of foam is outrageous.  The smell would make a gum-chewing Koala very happy though.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Nice Product! Will buy again if needed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not keen on the smell of it.  It seems to me that the anticipated refreshing aromas of both the eucalyptus and the spearmint did not marry well and formed something slightly unpleasant instead.  More importantly, I discovered only today in wandering the aisles of Walmart that I could have bought the exact same size bottle of it for one-third the price.  Tsk, tsk.  Shame on me for making an impulse buy like this was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, but this is my first purchase through Amazon. It leaves you feeling very clean and relaxed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to products that are scented, so usually buy everything unscented.&lt;br /&gt;(Scented products often give me a headache).&lt;br /&gt;But I thought I&#x27;d take a chance on this and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a wonderful, natural, relaxing aroma with no side effects.  I use it every time I take a bath.</li>
            <li> A low score here because the product cost twice as much as in the store. Didn&#x27;t realize this before I bought it. I like Dr. Teal&#x27;s Foaming Bath, but I paid way too much for it here unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Great soothing body wash</li>
            <li> I was given Dr. Teal&#x27;s a couple years ago for my Birthday. I have tried all kind of therapeutic bath. Until I used this one&lt;br /&gt;I was convinced that one did not exist. You only need a couple caps and have more bubbles than you can imagine. It is so soothing. The scent is one that relaxes you in the tub. Dr. Teals also comes in a bath salt form. It comes in many different scents and soaks. I also use the Lavender often. Great price for the product.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what to think of the reviewers who have not tried other products in the category and get overwhelmingly impressed by their first purchase to leave a five-star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work 50-70 hr week and a bubble bath on the weekends helps me recharge and rejuvinate. Over the years I have tried several bath products. I came across Dr. Teal&#x27;s on Amazon and based on the five-star reviews ordered one, even though a 34 oz bottle for only $5 seemed too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have used it twice and have been greatly disappointed in the quality. I had to keep pouring the buuble bath in large quantity while water was running but the bubbles were barely enough to cover 1/3rd of my bathtub. With high quality bubble baths, only one capful is enough to make a dense layer of bubbles covering the whole bathtub. A thick layer of bubbles not only feels luxurious but also insulates the bathtub water and keeps the water warm for longer periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is supposed to be Eucalyptus but if you have ever smelled real eucaluptus oil, this bubble bath is far from it.&lt;br /&gt;Suffice to say my two recent baths have been mediocre and I will not be buying this product again. if you take occasioanl baths and don&#x27;t mind an average quality, high value product, this is it but if your baths are something you look forward to, consider something else.</li>
            <li> nice big bottle for a bubble bath</li>
            <li> This soothing bath foam smells good and soothes. The foaming action is nice and the eucalyptus spearmint scent is very soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li> I will use this again as this was not the first time using it. smells good and is refreshing woo hoo</li>
            <li> I really like this as a bubble bath. The scent is very natural and pleasant, and it makes nice bubbles. That being said, I prefer the Epsom Salt Soaking Solution, since bubbles tend to be more drying to the skin and the Epsom salt provides other soothing benefits. Still, it&#x27;s nice to have bubble bath for when you really want bubbles! This is a nice big bottle, and you don&#x27;t need to use much, so it is a great value as well.</li>
            <li> smells great, bought different scents and like them all. like the price and the bubbles are abundant get some for yourself</li>
            <li> It has the fragrance but required more to be used... Was watered down somewhat. It was OK considering the amount I paid for it.</li>
            <li> The smell is minty and refreshing without being overpowering. A little goes a long way in smell and creating bubbles. Very good bubble bath product. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of Eucalyptus but I do like it a little stronger than what comes in the bottle so I add a little Eucalyptus oil to the bath water. I like taking a bubble bath about once a week and this always opens up the air ways and relaxes me. I have been using Dr Teals brand as compared to others it is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> This Eucalyptus Spearmint foaming bath its wonderful especially in winter.</li>
            <li> I love this bubble bath.  Used to purchase my bubble bath from Bath &amp; Body Works, but this is better and is half the price.  The fragrance is really great.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it came at the perfect time.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I&#x27;m not sure the salts themselves do too much to relax, but the scent sure does.</li>
            <li> Love the product and then found out I could get it a lot cheaper in the store. It served the purpose when I could not drive.</li>
            <li> Smells Great, Wife enjoyed it!</li>
            <li> This is a gentle means of getting an Epsom salt with muscle relaxing essential oils bath.  It is as good as the granular form, but easier to manage.  The foaming bath feature allows one to really relax without the feeling of it being a medicinal soak.  I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I got tired of having plain old baths, so I wanted to add something new to it so I tried this. I&#x27;m highly disappointed in the quality of this product. I put close to half the bottle in the water and barely any foam was made. I will not be buying this product again, I will just use what I got then get something else.</li>
            <li> Aaaaaahhhh---and breathe.  This combination of eucalyptus and spearmint sets just the right mood to relax and calm yourself.  If I could walk around in a cloud of this, that&#x27;d be perfect.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Smells awesome and it makes you feel so relaxed.  This is my fave Dr Teals product ever.</li>
            <li> We love this and use a bottle every month, we will reorder, it makes us rest and relax as the cold weather comes and goes from the Wht. Mtns. of Northern Az. my skin is calm and feels nice again. I can even breath with ease now.</li>
            <li> love love love my baths the more bubbles the happier i am ,awsesome for the skin carebubble bubble bubble away</li>
            <li> I stock up whenever I see this for a decent price.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried lots of different bubble bath products in the past--they&#x27;re a harmless guilty pleasure!--but Dr. Teal&#x27;s foaming bath is by far the best product out there.  The scent is potent, the bubbles are plentiful and long lasting, and I only need to use a small amount of  product to get the desired effect.&lt;br /&gt;The eucalyptus spearmint scent is well-balanced, refreshing, and energizing.</li>
            <li> I have heard about this product, and TONIGHT I will be using it! It is good especially for the damage that happened to my hip!</li>
            <li> About once a week, I deep condition my hair with coconut oil.  This takes 30 minutes and is kind of messy, so I usually just put my hair up in a processing cap and take a nice, long bath while reading a book.  I&#x27;ve been trying out different bath salts, treatments, etc., and this is the latest bath add-in I tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely true that you need to put more than a capful of this product into the tub to fill the tub with bubbles.  I usually just squeeze a bunch out under running water, adding a little as needed, and occasionally stirring the bubbles around the tub with the bottle to get them more evenly dispersed.  I would say that this is somewhat less concentrated than similar products.  However, one bottle is quite large and I still have half of mine left after using this weekly for over a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like very much that this does not contain any synthetic dyes.  I wish it didn&#x27;t contain artificial fragrance, either, but I have not found it to be irritating.  The eucalyptus and mint scents are pretty mild.  But the smell of this product did not bother me.  (You can see the full ingredients list on the product page.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel relaxed after using this, although I can&#x27;t attribute the entire feeling of relaxation to this product -- I think a good part of it would have come from any hot bath.  Still, I&#x27;m happy enough to continue using my bottle and to potentially buy it again one day.  3.5 stars.</li>
            <li> Have always loved Dr. Teal&#x27;s products and unfortunately my local grocery store has stopped carrying the products. My granddaughter loves the bubbles!</li>
