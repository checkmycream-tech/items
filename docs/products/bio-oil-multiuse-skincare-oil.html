            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for the stress marks</li>
            <li>but it does feel good on the skin and smells good.</li>
            <li>It may not be good over time, but for now I can say I have used all kinds of moistures that didn&#x27;t work.</li>

            <li>It smells really good</li>
            <li>I have been buying used, thank you for your enthusiastic service, I would be happy to get your help, will focus on these products.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good and good price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not so sticky, and it smells good, it can use at skin, hair, face.</li>
            <li>Smells good</li>
            <li>This is the 1st review I&#x27;ve been compelled to write and its because this product is that good.</li>
            <li>Good stuff,</li>
            <li>(package was good, no leaks).</li>
            <li>I have tried all sorts of creams and none have worked as good as this.</li>
            <li>Its a good moisturizer but its oily and gets on clothes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was this oil or a combination of things, but I have no stretch marks and loved using</li>
            <li>Good product, but must use every day.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have those issues, maybe you should still give this product a try based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li>It smell good</li>
            <li>but I just rub the excess into the rest of my hands and am also seeing some good results there.  </li>
            <li>smells good helps scars and stretch marks</li>
            <li>but this has been doing a good job clearing it up for me.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It seems to be clearing them up fairly well.  </li>
            <li>I put it on every night and have seen a good improvement in the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Either way, my skin was so moisturized, and it smells really good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good things about Bio-Oil</li>
            <li>today I decided to have a good look</li>
            <li>This body oil feels so good on the skin and mine</li>
            <li>Heard good things about it, so we shall see.</li>
            <li>Good experience with seller, but this product hasn&#x27;t done anything for me.</li>
            <li>I get facials once a month and after using this product, the technician always comments how good my skin</li>
            <li>but It smells so good</li>
            <li>Well I use a good pumice stone, Bio Oil and a pair of cotton socks overnight a couple of nights a week.  </li>
            <li>AND IT SMELLS GOOD</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it smells really good, and also because it seems to have softened and hydrated my cuticles, elbows, ankles and knees.</li>
            <li>The smell is noticeable but fairly neutral - still, I didn&#x27;t want to use it while I had morning sickness.  </li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>works good on scars from hip replacement</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve found nothing this good, ever.</li>
            <li>it feels good</li>
            <li>good quality.</li>
            <li>Not as good as everyone says it is.</li>
            <li>i think its good...</li>
            <li>saying how good it is beginning to look.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the effect is as good as the it says.</li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>It seems to be good stuff</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and the fragrance is wonderful.</li>
            <li>And it smells good.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this works good luck ladies</li>
            <li>Smell is good and can use it every day.</li>
            <li>Best price, smells wonderful, works  good on my dry skin,very happy with purchase</li>
            <li>Upwards of &amp;#62;$100, easily!!</li>
            <li>It also smells very pleasant and feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It smells so good and feels very good on my pregnant tummy!  </li>
            <li>Very good Easy to absorb Pungent smell</li>
            <li>Smells nice and pleasant.</li>
            <li>It settles into skin nicely and leaves you with smooth skin and smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li>Happy to find a better price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>She is very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice oil, it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>Hello all!&lt;br /&gt;I rarely ever post reviews, however this product is truly legendary, it deserves an award of its own!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this stuff… smells great, absorbs quickly…</li>
            <li>I think it also has helped the effects of the Bio Oil too - the scar skin is softer, the scars aren&#x27;t bumpy any more, so I&#x27;m really happy.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a great product.making sure that the itching isnt being cause by fleas or another issue.</li>
            <li>have told so many others about it and they are equally happy.</li>
            <li>Just got this and have heard many great things from friends who have used it.</li>
            <li>The price seemed fair, but I just would not, at this point, consider it sufficiently effective at smoothing skin.</li>
            <li>it is nice oil with good smell</li>
            <li>I know the latest beauty research is all about oils, and they are very effective for skin care, so I did some additional research and found [[ASIN:B007VEPVZC Bel Essence - (2oz) 100% All-Natural, Organic Anti-Wrinkle Oil Treatment with Argan, Grapeseed and Avocado Oil]].</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very light and pleasant.  </li>

            <li>I am so satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li>This is the best cosmetic product I have ever got.&lt;br /&gt;Other than taking care of the skin blemishes, it works great as general</li>
            <li>One of the great things about this product is that it absorbs very quickly into your skin so you never have that &#x27;oily&#x27; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bio oil is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>This product is simply amazing.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I will keep update for this amazing product which I have never thought I would us.</li>
            <li>I think it is amazing</li>
            <li>I have been using this for couple of weeks now and my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li>And I also feel it moisturizes my skin amazingly.</li>
            <li>**amazingly</li>
            <li>I bought it on my own accord, but my doctor was impressed I chose such a great product.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Amazing oil during pregnancy and post partum to help ward off stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>this stuff smells amazing and does work.</li>

            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>the fragrance is amazing</li>
            <li>think this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing that it&#x27;s not greasy even if it&#x27;s an oil.</li>
            <li>This oil is amazing.</li>
            <li>Great light scent.</li>
            <li>This oil is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>it is amazing</li>
            <li>Also has a minty kind of smell to it.</li>
            <li>kind of a rose scent.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice gloss</li>
            <li>Ingredients seem nice though - just didn&#x27;t work for MY skin.</li>
            <li>Has a nice scent but when applied to my face, can cause plugging of my pores or breakouts which is undesirable.  </li>
            <li>I liked that feeling of softness.</li>
            <li>and it also smells nice.  </li>
            <li>nice smell, do not know the effect now</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I have no wrinkles and</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and nice texture.</li>
            <li>I think it is effective.</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s good :)</li>
            <li>It may be working, or it could be that the stretch marks fade on their own.  </li>
            <li>The product also smells nice and has a nice feel.</li>
            <li>this works nicely....</li>
            <li>#34;an honest review.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t absorb immediately, which has been nice.</li>
            <li>I have been using this as a moisturazer ever since and i have been loving it.</li>
            <li>Although, it would be nice if it could so something about my scars and stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Smells nice but does not fade scars.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t even an effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but I didnt have any stretchmarks, and I liked how this oil felt on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it was a good deal.</li>
            <li>I got hit in the lip with a softball this summer and have a nice chunk of scar tissue I have to massage 2x day.  </li>
            <li>So, am loving it.</li>
            <li>but i think it is effective.</li>
            <li>and mixing my own blend for my skin.</li>
            <li>say, believe what you want about bio-oil...make your own judgements.</li>
            <li>I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be 100% effective</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice and</li>
            <li>Nice oil ..</li>
            <li>Fast forward to now, I can say that it is the best moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use it rather than throw it away, but will buy rose hips oil when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>However, the oil has a nice feel to it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the BEST product I have used for my skin.</li>
            <li>My wife uses it and she says it has really worked for her and is the best</li>
            <li>but it would be nice to have it help somewhat.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much, I researched it on the internet and found the best deal with Amazon.</li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>it smells  wonderful and its so  light but feels so good fresh out</li>
            <li>i was excited to try this product because of the great reviews on this site.</li>
            <li>but im excited to see the rest of what this miracle oil has to offer!!</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel wonderful and, for the price, it&#x27;s a decent deal, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li>good for your body and face, it has good feeling and easy to use, many people recommended it to me</li>
            <li>Lightened a huge scar amazingly well!</li>
            <li>it works superb, My wife really love it and its working perfectly with her dead skin and stretch mark that accrued after post pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I am very confident that if you use the product as recommended, it will do more than a satisfactory job at fading the appearance of your scars or stretchmarks.</li>
            <li>keeps your skin healthy,smooth, clean and lustrous!!</li>
            <li>This product shipped quickly and was in great shape when it arrived.</li>
            <li>Great product , quick shipment.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong perfume smell and then felt a burn for hours after I put it on my face.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite product but better than using Vaseline!</li>
            <li>I can already see that is becoming smoother and my Doctor noticed too!.</li>
            <li>Very light nice smell.  </li>
            <li>: This is a very light oil that smooths on the face nicely.</li>
            <li>Just love it, use it mainly to nourish my hair (use it sparingly) but excellent on skin as well.</li>
            <li>but this is by far the best</li>
            <li>It has so many uses and works so amazingly.</li>
            <li>It works great and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>So far so good, I would recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>I continue to use it because excellent moisturizer but as far as stretch marks purposes does NOT work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously, most reviewers of this product feel it is effective, but I will not use this on my face again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m most amazed at the scars - the bio oil did a nice job on them, and the bel essence helped move that along too.  </li>
            <li>Best oil I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>More effective than any lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I ever used for stretch marks so far.</li>
            <li>Excellent moisturizing and so far</li>
            <li>Excellent natural product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak on the scar-removing or tone-evening properties, because I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, but it&#x27;s still a great moisturizer and it smells pretty nice too.</li>
            <li>It has a really pleasant flowery smell to it - it&#x27;s not too strong, which I worried about because I dont like strong scents.</li>
            <li>I used scarguard at first, and got great results..decided to try bio oil.</li>
            <li>This oil is great for everything and really does help with scars!</li>
            <li>and my skin is ready to hit the beach and look beautiful</li>
            <li>Every pregnant woman should buy this!!  </li>
            <li>I recommend this oil to all my pregnant friends!!</li>
            <li>People feel very comfortable</li>
            <li>In the 3 months, those acne marks just show very light mark on my face.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty happy and will continue to order more</li>
            <li>oil!&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I have always had issues finding the perfect face lotion, as I am 34, I am not oily, but not dry...</li>
            <li>and I could tell the difference immediately her skin is softer and honestly it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>Rather than an oil, I strongly prefer creams and Cetaphil has been one of the easiest creams to use and has seemed to be just as effective at keeping stretch marks and blemishes at bay during pregnancy.</li>
            <li>but its so nice as moisturize and for fine lines around moth..</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s doing very good.</li>
            <li>all belly, it&#x27;s huge!)</li>
            <li>So, my amazing results aren&#x27;t even near the best results that I could have gotten-- a true testament to how absolutely remarkable this oil really is.</li>
            <li>I love the bio oil</li>
            <li>and I feel more confident</li>
            <li>I love roses but the manufactured smell doesn&#x27;t compare IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>continue to use the product but put another cream over top to mask the odour.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Having it on your hands will prevent you from biting your nails anyways :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a horrible smell...</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>love, need to order more</li>
            <li>I stopped using it because I just didn&#x27;t see any more improvement on the stretch marks.</li>
            <li>fast delivery and great product</li>
            <li>This and Burt&#x27;s Bees Mama Bee lotion are my favorite products.</li>
            <li>All I can say is for me it has worked better that I imagined.</li>
            <li>and I am seeing results but mostly on scars.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I got this as a gift and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>So far so good for me, I&#x27;m 35 weeks and my skin looks good</li>
            <li>but my mom says it&#x27;s after the baby that you&#x27;ll know for sure what your skin will look like.  </li>
            <li>so much better</li>
            <li>Nice light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy any more of this highly-touted oil that does not do what it claims.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite but it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure that this oil prevented them</li>

            <li>, that gives aging skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>Great price and recieved fast as promised.</li>
            <li>The smell was OK and it was not greasy.  </li>
            <li>but most places sell for $20</li>
            <li>I am in love with this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had many comments remarking on how my skin is &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also compared the top of my hands and the effect-</li>
            <li>More stretch mark scars.</li>
            <li>skin has never looked better ever.</li>
            <li>I bought this at Costco, in hopes it would be the magic cure for my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product is ok.</li>
            <li>I have so many stretch marks and scars from my life, and this sure helps.</li>
            <li>so many people sell fakes, I wonder if this is one of them</li>
            <li>I just love this oil.</li>
            <li>So i just love it.</li>
            <li>Probably it would take more time to see a result in my stretch marks and then i will update again.</li>
            <li>Love love love this oil.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>The price is also much better for the bio oil.</li>
            <li>better that bleaching creams .</li>
            <li>and they thought it would make it all better by giving me 15.00....</li>
            <li>I still see them, but my husband is way impressed that after only a couple of months they were practically gone.</li>
            <li>Will post after pregnancy with the hopefully stretch mark free results!</li>
            <li>Love to use this on my face after the derma roller.</li>
            <li>w/my favorite lotion....</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>My skin has become brighter and more even.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>

            <li>I have many scars from moles being removed.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gotten significantly better.</li>
            <li>Love this product it has almost made</li>
            <li>I also eat healthy and exercise which is said to help circulation and avoid rapid weight gain which also causes stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This product is soothing and OK.</li>
            <li>What I love about the oil is because works and I have bought so many products that is being adverstised to fade away the brown spots and it does not</li>
            <li>One bottle lasted me 6 months or more.  </li>
            <li>I have to lather the Aveeno on and maybe, just maybe, I feel ok.  </li>
            <li>Which is better bio oil or coconut oil?</li>
            <li>I love the feel of the oil; it glides on smooth and soaks in nicely and is not sticky at all.</li>
            <li>I use just once a day, and am pleased with results.</li>
            <li>I love the price and how the oil felt on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more</li>
            <li>Still have 9 1/2 more weeks to go</li>
            <li>Ok I have used allot of creams and oils before</li>
            <li>she said its better than cocoa butter</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had way better luck with Mederma.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>I love this stuff -- I use it on my face.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>However, i love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but this is like 10 bucks and works maybe better.</li>
            <li>SMOOTH, NICE SCENT HELPED WITH HYDRATING SKIN -</li>
            <li>Even better:</li>
            <li>No scar and no ruined wedding photos :-).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would have minimized faster if I applied it 3x per day as recommended.</li>
            <li>and i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I applied it three times a day and at night for sure.</li>
            <li>I love it, it make my skin look so moist.  </li>
            <li>I love to put it in my water when I soak my feet.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully there will be results soon :)</li>
            <li>I have not seen and effect of this products, but it is ok for my skin ,no irratiation, but did not works for its function,too.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work any better than olive oil - which does not work.</li>
            <li>More even skin tone, softer and makeup just look so much better after using the bio-oil.  </li>
            <li>I tried many lotions but nothing showed improvement.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good for my face, just a few drops in the morning after I wash and my skin literally glows and feels wonderful all day.</li>
            <li>Love the absorption.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>LOVE  </li>
            <li>Totally buy for a great price!</li>
            <li>love Bio oil.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s reduced the appearance of my stretch marks, but I do believe it&#x27;s prevented me from getting more.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>JUST MAKES IT LOOK BETTER ,</li>
            <li>This is better than any moisturizing lotion I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>They all love it.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more for our daughter in law after she has the baby,  because of course She&#x27;s complaining about stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Nice and light oil.</li>

            <li>My skin seems to love this stuff because my complexion has never been better.</li>
            <li>Love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks, I started seeing a difference...slowly but surely.</li>
            <li>It should do magic for you too.</li>
            <li>can use it all over, is not sticky and makes your skin nice and smooth .</li>
            <li>I love this oil already I just got it yesturday</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The two products have changed my skin permanently for the better.  </li>
            <li>and I will continue to buy it. :)</li>
            <li>I love the subscription service and the product.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil..</li>
            <li>I use it for my face in the winter and hair for all year i love it</li>
            <li>this product looking forward to buying lots more</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>But that is okay</li>
            <li>A lovely oil</li>
            <li>I never got any strechmarks, but I can&#x27;t credit that to Bio Oil since I think that has more to do with genetics.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Your skin will love you for using it.</li>
            <li>Used a bottle per month :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much better alternative to most of the stretch mark creams out there, so I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I just decided not to look any more and that I&#x27;d sure never be able to wear a bikini again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Okay soo hello</li>
            <li>No stars is more appropriate.</li>
            <li>I have stretch marks from growth spurts on my hips growing up, and I was sure I would get them during pregnancy on my belly.  </li>
            <li>told me it may cause acne in oil skin,but i think it&#x27;s safe for me.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Skin felt smoother for sure because it is oil.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>There are better products out there for that.</li>
            <li>I LOVE my bio-oil, the product I received when I ordered this on Amazon</li>
            <li>I have some problem areas, like most women-just some stretch marks, and surgery scars.</li>
            <li>Its so much better than using those urea based lotions, that are so gloppy/sticky and stinky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am NOT a vet, nor am I saying you should use this on your dog without asking your vet, and making sure that the itching isnt being cause by fleas or another issue.</li>
            <li>I love Bio-Oil, have been using this for years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Top of the line.</li>
            <li>Love the smoothness of the skin after using this product.</li>
            <li>nothing more.  </li>
            <li>my face look more youthful&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love rubbing it on my expanding belly.</li>
            <li>I love, love this product.</li>
            <li>I love rubbing this oil on my belly, butt, thighs and breasts after a bath.</li>
            <li>The size is perfect because it looks as though i may have a lot left even after i give birth.</li>
            <li>But use it daily for best results!!!</li>
            <li>It smells ok, so I can put it on the scar in the morning and not worry about it smelling</li>
            <li>i couldn&#x27;t even bother to use the product for the suggest 2 weeks to see a difference because the zits on my face were going to end up causing more scars at the rate it was going.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i will update my review after some more days , my daughter  still using it... :)</li>
            <li>Perfect..i will buy more when i run out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not done yet with my pregnancy,but I sure will report after birth :</li>
            <li>and I like this stuff much better.</li>
            <li>It gives you a healthy glow but not an oily one.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad she did.  </li>
            <li>are more hydrated than with lotions.  </li>
            <li>This product basically helps push all the impurities out of my skin and replaces it with the lovely bio oil for healthy radient skin.</li>
            <li>It is ok.</li>
            <li>but I was ok with it.</li>
            <li>l love this product as an all over conditioner.</li>
            <li>I had two surgeries, and so there are prominent scars along my abdomen there.</li>
            <li>i absolutely LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I am buying another bottle to see how much more improvement</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be ordering more from this buyer</li>
            <li>I love using it.</li>
            <li>does magic to your skin</li>
            <li>It is not oily like most oils.</li>
            <li>I use this daily on my face and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased 😊</li>
            <li>i fall in love with it and want to give it another chance for scars..</li>
            <li>Love this product and the price.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I love this product.</li>
            <li>Excellent product that actually works and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day a day and for me it&#x27;s been working a million times better</li>
            <li>I have so many</li>
            <li>I have better results.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>and I got ZERO stretchmarks :).</li>
            <li>All in all I would recommend this product for discolored skin more than scarring.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff has improved my skin texture....</li>
            <li>It is oil, but not greasy at all, love the feel and aroma.</li>
            <li>But, I think I have been a lot better off using this product since a lot of it is gone and most of it will end up going away.</li>
            <li>it came in time and the price is ok.</li>
            <li>I can put it on my hands and don&#x27;t have to wash them before touching anything.</li>
            <li>When I didn&#x27;t know any better, I purchased Bio-Oil hoping that it would work miracles on the existing stretch marks on my hips.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use it to see if or how much more they will fade.</li>
            <li>BUT I didn&#x27;t get any more after I started using it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard from friends who used the product that it worked great, but I didn&#x27;t experience much of an improvement.</li>
            <li>and I Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Now looking at my thighs I can see that the oil successfully rapidly faded away most of the bright red stretch marks.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>I hope it&#x27;ll clear them away for good!</li>
            <li>It a great product I noticed a huge difference as soon as three days after first use</li>
            <li>I like it really good, i like it very much.</li>
            <li>I found nothing special or even effective about bio-oil.</li>
            <li>I love this oil; it is wonderful; helps scars and dry skin..</li>
            <li>Vitamin E oil smells better, has great healing properties, is all natural, feels better on the skin, and costs $2.</li>
            <li>It also smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are all pretty good for skin conditions and scarring</li>
            <li>To me that&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>I first saw this in a magazine and it looked so good.</li>
            <li>For someone who has lived with acne my whole teenage/adult life and has the scars to prove it, I am just thrilled with the results!</li>
            <li>My family has said it smells pretty good and not anything like baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bio-Oil moisturizer is not going to give you plastic surgery type results, but it is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m simply so excited over the improvements I&#x27;m already seeing that I felt compelled to write this review!</li>
            <li>Really excited about using this!</li>
            <li>Great price for a product I won&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li>Bio-oil is not only great for the stretch marks but also amazing for the skin.</li>
            <li>Best to use after the shower on dry skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff was amazing while pregnant.</li>
            <li>There is no fragrance too which is nice when your pregnant.  </li>
            <li>and it was amazing how it quickly healed the scar.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Amazing for your skin while pregnant.</li>
            <li>it works best for scars and dry skin.</li>
            <li>I use coconut oil instead now, which smells delicious and sinks into my skin more rapidly.</li>
            <li>Makes skin very soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>I think it did pretty good considering how easily I scar.</li>
            <li>The smell was a bit strong for me though, I have a strong sensitivity to smells, but some may find it appealing</li>
            <li>Bio-oil goes on so easily, it absorbs quickly and smells really nice.</li>
            <li>I also used this on my scars and because they are very prominent keloid scars, so I am sure it will take some time in seeing  any visible changes, or lessening of their appearence, but I am certain that this works...</li>
            <li>One of the most comfortable skin touch I have felt with moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it work better cheap</li>
            <li>The one thing I do not like is the smell, but luckily it is not a horrible smell and it is a light smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth light and doesn&#x27;t take a lot to apply a lot of coverage!</li>
            <li>Can break out the chest area so be careful but all in all great stuff !</li>
            <li>I would use this for more skin conditions, but honestly, the fact that I don&#x27;t know what the ingredients are, since most of them are chemicals I can&#x27;t even pronounce, I really don&#x27;t want to put this all over my body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for almost 4 months, my scars have noticeably faded and are stretching more comfortably.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so smooth and after a couple weeks of using it I can see the improvement in my skin in so many ways.</li>
            <li>This is great to keep skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>I so feel like it&#x27;s making my skin appear more smooth and faded.</li>
            <li>I now enjoy just touching</li>
            <li>My belly feels moisturized and way more comfortable than before.</li>
            <li>Pros: smells good and absorbs very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Good seller but product doesn&#x27;t do much justice on stretchmarks</li>
            <li>But honestly it wasnt worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very optimistic that it will eventually create good results.</li>
            <li>It is good quality and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Very effective for sensitive oily skin.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>and I know it is due to this -- excellent product!</li>
            <li>I originally started using this on a scar on my neck many years ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, but I suggest washing your hands after because it&#x27;ll of course have it stuck there.</li>
            <li>I found out about the Bio Oil a few weeks ago through a beauty product blog, and the blogger holding up this gem as the most perfect oil she has ever used in her life.</li>
            <li>Everything is becoming the same tone of color, blending in beautifully absent of any scars or marks or acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t reduce appearance of scar but a great product for daily use for better skin.  </li>
            <li>It easily washes off my hands when done applying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily &amp; doesn&#x27;t stain clothes.</li>
            <li>, I just wanted to make my skin more even-toned and the product had such great reviews.</li>
            <li>Shipment was very quick and efficient</li>
            <li>This is not oily,it is easy to get used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin scars really easily</li>
            <li>Five stars easy.</li>
            <li>so it is easy to swing by cvs or walgreens and grab a bottle when I see a friend who announced a pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Also the scent is REALLY strong.</li>
            <li>are too strong.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommand Bio Oil.</li>
            <li>The fragrance was too strong.</li>
            <li>the thing I love best about this is that the scars or black spots that it fades never return!</li>
            <li>the healing process was super fast and was amazing!  </li>
            <li>It kind of makes me get a breakout or two when I first start using it</li>
            <li>This is my first time used this kind of product.</li>
            <li>works wonders i love it super easy to just rub on and go</li>
            <li>It is very good on dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Scars diminish very quickly and the stretch marks smooth out.  </li>
            <li>It also faded some scars I had on my legs and has diminished fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li>My fine line are diminishing  gradually.</li>
            <li>It lightened my stretch marks, removed some fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li>- I thought I was never going to be able to flaunt a two-piece after the surgeries, but gradually, I think in the coming months, I will certainly be able to try that out ;)</li>
            <li>It helps reduce the fine lines on my neck.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like it was before I got pregnant!</li>
            <li>used while pregnant and both times no stretch marks!</li>
            <li>I did still get some stretch marks while pregnant and used 2x a day, but it did help!</li>
            <li>Came quickly and improved the appearance of my stretch marks!</li>
            <li>36 weeks pregnant and still no stretch marks!</li>
            <li>currently entertaining the possibility that my skin is a super mutant sponge or something, because I&#x27;m already seeing results.</li>
            <li>I also love that it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>And this product is advertised for pregnant women!</li>
            <li>I use it once or twice per day (started using it at 5 months pregnant) and have no stretch marks!</li>
            <li>Almost 9 months pregnant and no stretch marks yet!</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and lasts all day. :)</li>
            <li>I have been using it faithfully day &amp; night and am amazed at how quickly it has improved my skin!</li>
            <li>Looking good so far though!</li>
            <li>Bi-oil is the best at lightening old and new scars our skin imperfections.  </li>
            <li>This oil is wonderful for scars, new and old and stretch marks.</li>
            <li>It prevents and reduces pregnant wrinkles, and my wife feels much more comfortable than before.</li>
            <li>LOVE bio oil for stretch marks scars and just for moisturizing dry chapped skin its great</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing and certainly does moisturize, but it doesn&#x27;t offer prevention nor healing of stretch marks.</li>
            <li>the 100% Pure brand is nice ([...]).</li>
            <li>I kind of assumed that if it&#x27;s marketed towards pregnant women, it must be legit, right?  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much in the things I am satisfied with everything good, high quality</li>
            <li>I will most certainly continue using Bio-Oil, hopefully it will continue to make my skin look better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certainly going to try my best to keep the regime for the entire pregnancy and keep the faith that no stretch marks appear!</li>

            <li>But,Skin becomes smooth.</li>
            <li>So, honestly it&#x27;s all very confusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough great things about Bio Oil.  </li>
            <li>Well, as a facial moisturizer,  it&#x27;s great.</li>

            <li>/&gt;This was a great purchase and I still have about 1/4 the bottle left after using it all summer!</li>
            <li>Personallyl, i dont like the peachy-orange packaging because it looks cheap to me, but that  has nothing to do with the quality of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit strong, but it smells clean so that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>My lighter stretch marks are visible but feel smooth on the surface and are not a depression in my skin.</li>

            <li>When I apply it it seems to smooth it out</li>
            <li>I also put palmers cocoa butter on top after this was absorbed.</li>
            <li>Hm, I&#x27;m surprised this oil is so popular and worked for so many people.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it since the beginning of my pregnancy and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product at a low price plus fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically a completely natural feeling, almost as good as lotion.</li>
            <li>so far so good, I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed.</li>
            <li>Good so far - i haven&#x27;t had any stretch marks yet...</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and developed stretch marks on my thighs after having my baby four months ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to put on, doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and keeps me lathered up to prevent additional stretch marks.</li>
            <li>so far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Anyway, as far as lines go, I&#x27;m not saying the lines magically disappeared or that this is some kind of miracle lotion, but it has helped reduce lines by about 50%.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Also, if your looking for really good natural products</li>
            <li>, in all honesty it is soft and smells good and leaves my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>so so far so good again.</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>Something good, applied to the body also just good, not very much oil, the oil is very appropriate, no big taste, well, run out will continue to buy!</li>
            <li>/&gt;A very nice, light, facial oil</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and it really works.!!!</li>
            <li>but it soaks in pretty well!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Okay , not immediate effects, might be good at the early apply from first tri semester to avoid the stretch marks...</li>
            <li>and with 3 kids it would have been so easy and super helpful.</li>
            <li>The scars (about 8 years old) look softer, not as noticeable, I cant imagine how great they would look if I had begun to use the oil from the very start of my pregnant-I dare say that some of them could have been prevented, outright!</li>
            <li>Added sweet oil essential drops for fragrance is great.</li>
            <li>I just feel better buying 100% natural and pure oils (NOW is a good brand)</li>
            <li>This has been working good so far for my pregnant wife.</li>
            <li>It smells good and my skin in super soft.</li>
            <li>Love this light weight oil, I use it to help my skin fade old scars and it seems to be working...  :)</li>
            <li>I was excited about trying this product but one month after applying the oil, the stretch marks got darker.</li>
            <li>At first, I was satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>Originally bought for stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I was extremely excited to get it all done at once</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the $12!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than willing to stick with it.</li>
            <li>And i have noticed significant changes in my skin.</li>
            <li>pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure to give this product time to work its magic, I used it for a bit over a year before I decided I was pleased with the results, and then popped it onto our subscribe and save list as soon as we started trying for our 2nd.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this item to get rid of some scars I have.</li>
            <li>price in the stores is much higher than on Amazon and if you subscribe and save, you can reduce the price even more.</li>
            <li>I was successful in curing the back acne, however, the acne spots remained there and</li>
            <li>I am still on my first bottle ( just ordered two more yesterday)</li>
            <li>I am never disappointed using bio oil</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t see significant difference then I won&#x27;t buy it again.  </li>
            <li>its certainly worth a chance!  </li>
            <li>its certainly worth a chance!  </li>
            <li>Tried it for the first time and have ordered it for two friends, who also love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much!  </li>
            <li>It has shown remarkable improvement in only a couple of weeks.</li>

            <li>it smells very light and clean, and I love how soft it makes my skin.</li>
            <li>The product is easy to use, has a fresh scent, and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.</li>
            <li>I look more alive now :)</li>
            <li>it was then that I realised how powerful it really was...&amp; just how amazing this oil is.</li>
            <li>Organic fresh hint of like a lavender smell but very mild.</li>
            <li>My legs look super smooth</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle of bio oil and so far this has worked the best.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s the nicest and best working I&#x27;ve used so far for scars.</li>
            <li>I used it for a week,it&#x27;s really working!it makes my skin much more smooth than before!somebody</li>
            <li>great for dry areas on the body also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super cheap when it comes to this type of thing</li>
            <li>I used it after washing my face and it would be absorbed easily.</li>
            <li>], it is packed with great skin-moisturizing ingredients like green tea and aloe vera that make your skin smoother and softer, smoother and reduce wrinkles – I really love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since educated myself about what&#x27;s better for skin and have transitioned to using more natural products.  </li>
            <li>I read so many positive reviews before buying this.</li>
            <li>So far I love it!</li>
            <li>I slather it on, then put a light tank top on, then my regular clothes and this seems to help me feel a bit more comfortable.</li>
            <li>and I loved that it is not greasy, like many other pregnancy oils.</li>
            <li>most certainly look better/diminished.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me and it was right on time!</li>
            <li>; When I was searching for a product I found a lot of reviews were the result of free or discount priced products, which is fine, but kind of left doubt in my mind.</li>
            <li>First the size is awesome and, not available anywhere else.</li>
            <li>i have used bio-oil with both pregnancies and i can attest that bright red stretch marks are non-existent.</li>
            <li>I saw good results in only A WEEK of using.</li>
            <li>I love how it absorbs fast</li>
            <li>see the full guidelines for writing reviews on Amazon, go here.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this product but it has really helped to reduce the appearance of my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I always put a squirt in my bathwater and have even started using it on my 63 year old face; applying it while my skin is still warm after getting out of the bath/shower.</li>
            <li>My friends said my skin looks younger than before, I would recommend this to every one, cause it really is a good product.</li>
            <li>I use about 4 drops of oil on my face, any more, and it&#x27;s a bit too much oil.</li>
            <li>If you use more than two or three drops on your face and neck, you&#x27;re using too much.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this.</li>
            <li>And my bottle is still full.</li>
            <li>Works good enough though.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and fresh.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it did such a good job.</li>
            <li>The wife uses it ever day during her pregnancy and is just getting ready to order some more.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency of the oil very moisturizing and not too greasy.</li>
            <li>It is a true story about my experiences.</li>
            <li>It is full of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;even</li>
            <li>use it with Aquaphor Healing ointment as Bio-oil alone is only good for 1-2 hours</li>
            <li>Now to be fair, I only used bio-oil for about 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Nice soft comforting scent.</li>
            <li>This product holds true to what it does.</li>
            <li>I got hooked on this by my sister when visiting her this summer and people have commented on how nice and young my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>I have been fairly good about using it 2 x a day as directed, after my daily lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So it possibly could be a good preventative measure.</li>
            <li>the price for the size of the bottle is actually not bad and I would buy again once the oil was finished.</li>
            <li>I have had no bad side effects, no burning or anything</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have any real hope that it will fade them more quickly than time itself will.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use it daily and where ever you do, it will significantly help-- even with more indented stretch marks or scarring.</li>
            <li>Thought it was working until I woke up at 36 weeks pregnant with a belly full</li>
            <li>This oil is the best, specially if you are pregnant or about to go on a diet and lose some serious weight.</li>
            <li>It smells great but other than that I have not seen any changes.</li>
            <li>The look and feel of my skin was so great that two other family members are using it.</li>
            <li>I heard from other people that it was great and this and that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for stretch marks and all that other stuff.</li>
            <li>The other thing that&#x27;s great about Bio Oil is that it truly lightens&lt;br</li>
            <li>great for relieving itchy belly due to pregnancy.</li>

            <li>I was super inconsistent on using the product.</li>
            <li>The product from this seller came quickly and without any problems.</li>
            <li>I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my sister who&#x27;s pregnant.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work quickly</li>
            <li>I went ahead and read reviews on oils to use while pregnant to avoid stretchmarks.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re pregnant you need to buy this product.</li>
            <li>Definitely a worthy purchase</li>
            <li>I apply two time a day, every day since I found out I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>I had before I got pregnant and won&#x27;t go away,</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just been super swell dealing with these buggers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find that is goes on like suntan oil and absorbs into my skin quickly.</li>
            <li>I am 30 weeks pregnant and have no stretch marks.</li>
            <li>almost 9 months pregnant</li>
            <li>I am 16 weeks pregnant and used this product after reading about it reviews online.</li>
            <li>I used bio oil every day since I found out I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>I slathered this on morning and night from 6 weeks pregnant -</li>
            <li>Top tip- make sure you also apply this to your hips, bum and sides as they all grow enormously during pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to any pregnant woman.</li>
            <li>I began applying from about 4 months pregnant to about 2 months after delivery.  </li>
            <li>Never had any itching while pregnant.  </li>
            <li>now 35wks pregnant and haven&#x27;t got any stretch mark yet.</li>
            <li>It would have been a smarter idea to start using while she was pregnant</li>
            <li>My boss is pregnant.</li>
            <li>I got this for my sister when she was pregnant with twins.</li>
            <li>I started using this product when I was about 20 weeks pregnant (</li>
            <li>I used twice a day as recommended and my skin on hips and abdomen don&#x27;t have many obvious stretch marks, but I also think drinking 3-4 liters of water a day helped keep skin healthy as well.</li>
            <li>I rubbed this all over my belly, breasts, thighs and butt while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>Soaks in quickly without leaving a greasy residue.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s super greasy to apply (it is oil after all), it dries quickly and leaves no residue on my clothes.  </li>
            <li>i was pregnant and although i still have a couple months to go i am yet to see a stretch mark.</li>
            <li>Since my wife has been pregnant she has been using this stuff every night</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it will prevent stretch marks, but I am 8 months pregnant and don&#x27;t have any yet.  </li>
            <li>If using even once a day, it will run out quickly.  </li>
            <li>I came to know about this oil through my doctor for stretch marks while I was 5 months pregnant.</li>
            <li>so I know I&#x27;m not just one if those lucky women that never get them.</li>
            <li>The oil quickly absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li>I got this for my wife while she was pregnant to help prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li>mild smells, not so oil, can be adsorbed by skin quickly and wait to see the effect, need to consist using.</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly, moisturizes well, and does the job.  </li>
            <li>Super produit, facile à utiliser et très économique.</li>
            <li>I am 8 months pregnant</li>
            <li>I would recommend this oil to anyone that&#x27;s pregnant to PREVENT stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Foolishly, I didn&#x27;t use any product while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>I bought this one for a pregnant co-worker</li>
            <li>luckily i stopped using it a couple days ago</li>
            <li>I recommend this to all my pregnant friends.</li>
            <li>Arrived super quick.</li>
            <li>The lines are fading away really quick.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on reviews for preventing and help to rid your body of stretch marks when I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li>Unlike some of the reviews I read, this oil does not absorb into your skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>I stopped after I had my son but quickly started again after stomach shrinkage was showing marks again.</li>
            <li>Im 25 weeks pregnant</li>
            <li>I feel the difference on my pregnant belly since I&#x27;ve been using it and notice when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I use this oil when I am pregnant, nothing can compare, it keeps my skin from being itchy.</li>
            <li>Just remember to use it on the chest as well because that&#x27;s where you can also get stretch marks when pregnant and breastfeeding.</li>
            <li>Although continuing to use it after getting pregnant I switched to palmers just as I would use the oil.</li>
            <li>Stretch marks and imperfections were cleared away quickly.  </li>
            <li>it is a good deal and worth to have it next time</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re that worried about looking your age, I highly suggest something more affordable.</li>
            <li>Love the product and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>The very good thing is, all you have to use is a small drop of it at a time.</li>
            <li>I noticed the first ingredients a smineral oil - which is a cheap chemical used as a filler in many products that only clogs pores (as ldocuments in one of many articles I&#x27;ve read:http://www.drfranklipman.com/3-key-reasons-to-avoid-mineral-oil/)  </li>
            <li>I am naturally prone to stretch marks anytime my body grows, but I have now successfully made it through two pregnancies without any new ones.</li>
            <li>I grew so huge that my family was really scared for me, but I never got any marks!</li>
            <li>I originally bought it for my son to try for stretch marks on his stomach but after trying it myself on my face just to see what it might help with, I had to buy my own and in a larger bottle.</li>
            <li>Pretty cheap for its size.</li>
            <li>and I loving the results of my barely noticeable stretchmarks.(I</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>It is light scented, greasy at first</li>
            <li>After first month, the acne marks turn to light color.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more effective than any other lotion or oil I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>But after applying for so long it feels like a chore, the oil sticks to your hands making you give your hands a good scrub to get the oil off</li>
            <li>Shipped very fast nice package great price for the normal size bottle I use just about everyday luv</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just very sensitive to scents and considering most pregnant women are, you&#x27;d think they would dampen the scent a bit.</li>
            <li>Use bio oil with my first pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark:) love the smell, absorbs quickly and helps an ichy belly!</li>
            <li>I see the first ingredient is mineral oil not so good probably coconut oil would work the same.  </li>
            <li>It actually did work to lighten up the scars and it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this didn&#x27;t do anything after using the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>I like the fresh smell, but most other oils do a better job of moisturizing and getting smooth skin results...</li>
            <li>I did indeed lighten my stretch marks very much and smells clean and botanical.</li>
            <li>It really works !!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff!!!</li>
            <li>Found it again on Amazon, been using it religiously &amp; my skin is looking &amp; feeling SO much better!</li>
            <li>This size with daily use lasts me more than six months!</li>
            <li>With my first I didn&#x27;t use it a lot because I tend to forget, and with that came stretch marks!</li>
            <li>It really works !!</li>
            <li>I really do recommend this to everyone!!</li>
            <li>You have to be consistent with the product in order for it too work!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an oil, so I guess it is exactly what you think you are getting!</li>
            <li>Works very well!!</li>
            <li>Definitely buying more!</li>
            <li>It worked really well!!</li>
            <li>After 3 months of consistent use, the marks are gone!</li>
            <li>-  Great Moisturizer: I have dry skin, yet just 4 drops can keep my face moisturized for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;-  </li>
            <li>It did not work very well on my acne scars, but is great for the dry winter days.</li>
            <li>As with any body oil, goes on best when skin is wet not dry, so post shower is optimal.</li>
            <li>My skin is getting very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>If I ever get pregnant again, I will start using this right away.</li>
            <li>It also feels very nice going on and is not super greasy.</li>
            <li>I have not tried any other products out there as this is the first I bought and so far it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li>So far she is very pleased with this particular snake oil.  </li>
            <li>It give my belly little pimples, but those will go away and stretch marks wouldn&#x27;t, so I&#x27;ll take my chances :) not oily once it&#x27;s rubbed in and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>I mostly use this for my acne scars which are very dark and abundant.</li>
            <li>This is such an amazing body oil.</li>
            <li>It seems the oil refracts the light and gives the appearance discoloration is gone when it really isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>genuine product with much lower price</li>
            <li>Using it twice a day for 2 months has really improved how smooth my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>I but this over and over again because I enjoy it that much.</li>
            <li>Finally buy it, it is said that is amazing</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and smell, and the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Deff worth the money, as results are visible.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft I love it</li>
            <li>that was worth it.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it is nearly scentless.  </li>
            <li>Worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>For an &#x27;aging&#x27; woman or man I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure if it is genetics or the product that makes my skin stay young, but I do think this product helps.</li>
            <li>This product is useful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I was applying this product to my freshly appeared scar for 3 months.</li>
            <li>It has regained moisture and is more soft and supple than ever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She says the main thing she likes about it is that when applied, it is not greasy and her makeup goes on over it easily, evenly and does not cake.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>well worth the sacrifice</li>
            <li>This means that you have to be really careful when you put it on (timing wise).</li>
            <li>, we gave it some time, and young skin might fix itself better.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the money and this size has lasted me for years.</li>
            <li>I CAN say that it makes my skin feel more supple and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because of how simple it is to apply to the skin &amp; it has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Its a bit pricy, but definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Nice to find a cheap solution after I spent a bunch of money over the years trying to lighten/soften</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t sure about using the oil thinking it would be really greasy and get on everything</li>
            <li>The oil itself is nice because it&#x27;s not oily, but definitely makes my skin feel moisture.  </li>
            <li>It seems that it&#x27;s useful</li>
            <li>Yeah, I pay this with a bit of shine, but I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li>After a month of use, mostly applying once at night after showering, my scar is nearly gone.  </li>
            <li>I found out that some of the natural oils in the Bel Essence help correct scars, so maybe the combination makes everything work better.  </li>
            <li>So far I am completely satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>It goes on oily but is quickly absorbed into the leather.  </li>
            <li>Anywho, it&#x27;s nice to see them back to the way they used to be in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying to get something useful, buy Ambi.</li>
            <li>I have found that, in conjunction with my dry-brushing routine (look on-line for directions how to do this-it really changes your skin for the better), the Bio-Oil has pretty much made the KP go away!</li>
            <li>too however this stuff is worth the money.</li>
            <li>We rarely give five stars to anything.</li>
            <li>I have only had great results so far...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Instead I went with more natural creams and oils.</li>
            <li>I message it into my skin until it almost is completely absorbed.</li>
            <li>It seemed that I would go through about one 4.2oz bottle in 3 or so weeks, but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>i love this oil more than all of the other popular oils that are being sold presently.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product since I was 10 weeks pregnant with my first baby.</li>
            <li>It has a pretty perfumy smell but it fades quickly.</li>
            <li>The smell goes away pretty quickly as well.</li>
            <li>First time I used my bio oil was when I was pregnant and used it to prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li>If I ever get pregnant again, this will be the first thing i get.</li>
            <li>super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this, but you have to be patient with it, as it may and most certainly will, take time for visible scars to vanish, but trust me, it will pay to stick with it for a while and see the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well that led to the interesting problem of the skin wasn&#x27;t fully healed and ready for that older skin to come off.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since the very first day of my first trimester during pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>My stretch marks are not old (maybe 6 months) and it is making all of them look extremely better!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a visible difference, but it sure feels good.</li>
            <li>and it clears it right up in a day or so</li>
            <li>This product does not work right away.</li>
            <li>thats right</li>
            <li>I rub in all my expanding parts in the morning out of the shower and then again right before bed.</li>
            <li>Use it all over your face right after you wash it</li>
            <li>I was right.</li>
            <li>They are on my right arm and right leg in visible areas</li>
            <li>The treatment you have always been looking for is right here.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put it on my face like some people do because I don&#x27;t feel right putting oil on that area for fear of breakouts.</li>
            <li>It purely seems like oil without any special qualities.</li>
            <li>I apply it right before bed everynight</li>
            <li>I can say for sure (well almost for sure) if your stretch marks are red ( lighter skin) or brown ( darker skin), it is new stretch marks use this right away</li>
            <li>Bio-oil is good enough that I sometimes use this as a substitute for my normal Obagi routine.</li>
            <li>i have many marks and use this oil to help tone it down and to prevent more from coming.</li>
            <li>It is a light and highly absorbent oil that comforts itchy, irritated skin.</li>
            <li>The smell is light not too overwhelming giving a natural fresh clean scent lasting all day.</li>
            <li>Bio oil typically has a nice light sent to it - the item I received had a funky odor.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t stain clothes, and has a mild/light smell that I actually quite like. :)</li>
            <li>and I hope you made the right choice in buying this product, I certainly did!</li>
            <li>Product works great on recent scars but it doesn&#x27;t do much for old ones.</li>
            <li>I use as a daily routine after showering, sometimes I&#x27;ll put a cap full in a hot bath :)</li>
            <li>I have been using Bio Oil for the past 6 months and have had great results.</li>
            <li>Works great for scars and uneven skin tone!</li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely, so the smell doesn&#x27;t bother for long.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a nice product and continue using it long.</li>
            <li>I used this product on my chest when I had gotten a nice long scratch across my chest.</li>
            <li>This is a good product that wears down marks and scars.</li>
            <li>when I was pregnant with my first son I am bigger this time around and my skin looks better.</li>
            <li>It costs much less than other oil, but it is still very hydrating to the skin without feeling too oily, doesn&#x27;t leave oily residues, easy to apply, smells good,  and makes skin soft and nice!</li>
            <li>Very dry areas are between eye browse and nose, NOT ANY MORE!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African American woman and this worked great for evening out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>So I ended up with pretty much a nice road rash on my stomach; which it did hurt when I sat to long and then stood up.</li>
            <li>I so wish I had this when I was pregnant instead of cocoa butter which did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt help too much with my stretch marks since my stretch marks are already old, but they look better than before.</li>
            <li>that specialize in pregnant itchy belly and preventing stretch marks but for me, Bio-Oil really did the trick.</li>
            <li>I have tried this oil and it seams to be doing a good job, they are smoother, and less noticeable, but I will continue using untill</li>
            <li>Live in Houston, have oily skin, and still use every night!!!</li>
            <li>Very soft and light.  </li>
            <li>Oil smells good and is light not thick and heavy.</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin, and this product was so good to my skin.</li>
            <li>very fast shipment.</li>
            <li>very much hope it can help me</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much at all.</li>
            <li>I saw this at Costco at a very reasonable price compared to what I was paying at Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This worked very very well for me.</li>
            <li>It works very very well for that.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much.</li>
            <li>Very absorbing and smoothing...</li>
            <li>I have been using bio oil under and around my eyes to deal with crows feet (I&#x27;m 30, in good shape, but noticing those little lines).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this consistently for 2+ years and noticed almost no change.</li>
            <li>Cross your fingers! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>My freinds and family are pretty amazed, too.</li>
            <li>I have gotten compliments on how smooth and soft my legs are.&lt;br /&gt;used</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>I got s stretch marks after I had my first kid</li>
            <li>just make sure to put it on daily and nightly.</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>I use it on my face when I go to bed and have noticed wrinkles arent as deep and a more even tone.</li>
            <li>Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>Well into my first trimester, I had gotten some stretch marks on my belly and sides.</li>
            <li>My face and hands absorbed it very well.</li>
            <li>I put it on my hands every night and it is oily at first but then seems to penetrate my skin.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough about how much I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is reliable and has been building trustworthy from the first time I am using..</li>
            <li>but it does obsorb pretty well</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Noticeable decrease of scar appearance with consistent use.</li>
            <li>After first application, you will look greasy, but this will go away.</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it religiously.</li>
            <li>love this product will be ordering again in 3 months or maybe earlier then that!!!</li>
            <li>On my back and shoulders, even more acne scars.</li>
            <li>This is the first review I have ever given in my life.</li>
            <li>but i love the smell and it instantly absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to put up with the smell if it helps me.</li>
            <li>It works better than traditional vitamin e oil.  </li>
            <li>most people think I am much younger than my years.</li>
            <li>My stretch marks are fading and it is starting to look more uniform with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>It is my first time writing a review for a product.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d have to buy more, but I&#x27;m in my third trimester</li>
            <li>so she had many deep scars.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell and feel better than then</li>
            <li>I used in my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li>If I ever notice any marks starting to form on my skin I just apply more oil before I go to bed and my marks are gone by morning.</li>
            <li>so I am pretty hopeful that it will work as directed in 3 months.  </li>
            <li>My skin does feel some what softer after the first couple uses.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this product my unwanted scar in my legs vanish, and I can now go to the beach every time with my sexy and smooth legs minus the scars.</li>
            <li>so this product is not only for women who just has a baby, if you become fat at first and slim again, you can also try this product :)</li>
            <li>First off the product description says &amp;#34;Non Greasy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have scars on my legs from bug bites, scratches, burning myself with hot irons, etc.</li>
            <li>Definitely hydrates the skin without leaving the oily feel that most can.</li>
            <li>, it is pretty oily, but</li>
            <li>My scars are significantly smaller than most others</li>
            <li>I used this once a day before bed during my first pregnancy on my belly and chest and had NO stretch marks (I started as soon as I started to show).</li>
            <li>We at first got this to help with my sons scar.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement!</li>
            <li>Even my husband loves to use it because it makes his face soft after he shaves and the scent is so light.</li>
            <li>but you can feel it when you touch the skin and that has helped me become immediately aware when I start messing with my skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin looks soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for a speedy delivery!</li>
            <li>love this stuff second bottle I have bought</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>And there hasn&#x27;t been much progress in their disappearance since after I stopped using the oil, so I must contribute all of the success in my story to this bio-oil.</li>
            <li>I will be sure to keep the oil on hand in case I may need it in the future.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!  </li>
            <li>After googling for and finding pictures of acne nodules tonight, I can see that this is most likely what I have.</li>
            <li>makes my skin feel really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>and it will just soak into your skin and leave it feeling so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My first time using this</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s pretty pricey.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still on my first bottle</li>
            <li>but the oil does need to be removed first or</li>
            <li>I really like this oil!  </li>
            <li>So yes, I love this Bio-oil and will definitely buy it a 3rd time :)</li>
            <li>I feel better about using Bio Oil when I am using the Bel Essence as a regular skin care.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen anything that works so well and so fast!</li>
            <li>Very recommend it!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone interested</li>
            <li>again my first Review was on Feb28,2014&lt;</li>
            <li>Ppl need to know that you have to be consistent in using this oil and</li>
            <li>Definitely like this stuff, but I&#x27;m not so sure it works to reduce appearance of scars.</li>
            <li>Wish I would of used this my first time I could have saved my belly.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look toned and glowy with consistent use.</li>
            <li>Started using this within my first 2 months of pregnancy with twins and have been using it for close to 4 months now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time Mom and by the time I delivered, I had stretch marks all over my tummy and sides.  </li>
            <li>It started to fade my red/purple stretch marks within the first couple of days.</li>
            <li>this can be used on hair, face, body, and my tip is mixing with facial mist to be more</li>
            <li>It seems to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I first used Bio-Oil about a year ago.</li>
            <li>Wish I known about this for my first.</li>
            <li>Must be used consistently to see results.</li>
            <li>It was first recommended to me by my surgeon--the first time she&#x27;d recommended it to any of her patients.  </li>
            <li>Expecting our first baby</li>
            <li>I should have read the ingredients first.</li>
            <li>My skin is sooooo soft and smooth</li>
            <li>I started using it in my first trimester to get in the habit.</li>
            <li>I also use in on my chest for sun spots and overall discoloring and my skin tone is much more even.</li>
            <li>Makes skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I used Bio Oil daily during most of my pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>I thought for sure I would be a giant stretch mark after childbirth.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to ward off stretch marks during my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not TERRIBLE but they are definitely there.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this consistently.</li>
            <li>I did not get any stretch mark the first time around</li>
            <li>The first Amazon shopping is quite satisfactory.</li>
            <li>I started using this twice a day toward the end of my first trimester.</li>
            <li>And the price was better then any local store.</li>
            <li>my scar has faded to almost nothing i love this product and just bought a bigger bottle about a week ago and use all over my body now</li>
            <li>I purchased this product hoping that it would be an environmentally safe way to lubricate machinery, but when applied to said machinery, it actually slowed the activity of the machinery.  </li>
            <li>Overall, an okay experience--</li>
            <li>However, it did help with the healing of smaller, more superficial wounds like cuts and abrasions -</li>
            <li>It is exactly as pictured and described.</li>
            <li>At first I thought I saw a difference, it looked like</li>
            <li>my mother and my sister both have pretty severe preg.</li>
            <li>Few people who have tried it have nothing but good things to say,</li>
            <li>This oil is really lightweight and doesn&#x27;t weight you down, plus it smells really good too.</li>
            <li>and she is also mixed with black but is very fair skinned.</li>
            <li>I decided to use this product when pregnant with my first child because it was highly rated in the United Kingdom and I saw an ad in a baby magazine.  </li>
            <li>It really does absorb super fast and never feels greasy.</li>
            <li>It is deep penetrating, light, not oily on the surface, awesomely gentle, very light, natural scent.</li>
            <li>Ive only used this for two days but what i was most surprised with is that not only is it moisturizing and made my skin instantly look alive and awesome</li>
            <li>This product does not absorb very quickly; do not apply this product and then immediately put on clothes that are good or immediately rest on blankets you care about because this stuff is greasy.  </li>
            <li>It has done a good job of lightening the older scars and keeping the skin and current scabs soft.</li>
            <li>but it did help keep my skin super soft, and with the 3 stretch marks that did appear, it helped them fade super fast.</li>
            <li>I even think it is better than any other famous brand, because it is very natural and gentle.</li>
            <li>It smells good, a little goes a long way, and on top of helping his eczema, it&#x27;s cleared up my KP on my arms and faded stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Kind of like baby powder but not exactly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as dark as it use to be, and though its not all gone its much better than it was before!</li>
            <li>It does smell nice and moisturized the skin but other than that it didn&#x27;t do anything else.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have any new stretch marks, only old ones that have kind of showed up a little more prominently.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, not greasy, smells good, use it regularly on the occasional precancerous spot removals I occasionally need...and those brown spots on my face and hands from too much sun...</li>
            <li>but why spend so much for this when it has such better applications than that?</li>
            <li>am very please with the progress and will definitely be buyin more.</li>
            <li>In addition, I LOVE the way it makes my skin look when I wear no make-up - it really evens out red spots and sun damage.  </li>
            <li>I love it, only the oils make me sweat too much.  </li>
            <li>I applied this oil every day, multiple times a day, making sure I rubbed it into the scar really well.</li>
            <li>I have since began using it on older scars with very positive results.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I have deep red marks on my inn re thighs and after putting this on only 3 times, it was already unnoticeable, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>7 months pregnant and no stretch marks so far... I&#x27;ve used bio oil twice a day since the first trimester</li>
            <li>I got this product because I have recently gotten pretty overweight very quickly..</li>
            <li>I tend to have very dry cuticles that peel easily, and this oil helps a lot!</li>
            <li>Before using do your research and do not rely on the paid ads or fraudulent positive reviews you will see.</li>
            <li>.... extremely greasy, I have stretch marks on my inner thighs and hips so reading all these great reviews saying this product has helped with stretch marks</li>
            <li>It smells ok and doesn&#x27;t seem to be too greasy for too long like some oils can be.</li>
            <li>It has lots of mineral oil which is pretty much just a filler or an ingredient that coats the skin</li>
            <li>My stretch marks have faded from a light purple color to a silvery, barely visible color.</li>
            <li>but it may be too early to say... Not bad.</li>
            <li>All in all the product is good, but I&#x27;m not sure if the oil caused a bit of a breakout on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Bio Oil for maybe a little over 6 months now, and I love it!</li>
            <li>the residue left in your skin is not bad!</li>
            <li>To be direct - I am 8 months pregnant and use this once or twice a day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this in the past, and so far this has worked great for my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do anything for dark spots, but great overall.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before using this I was using Acne.org products, (pretty much their whole line).</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and its so moist, it makes me super soft.</li>
            <li>I am super sensitive to smells but this oil has not been a problem.</li>
            <li>Love it, am 76 and at this age have dry skin.</li>
            <li>I like it anyway, especially because its pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t damage clothing.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin super hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve developed stretch marks while I was pregnant with my son..</li>
            <li>Any one with scabs or burns or scars I strongly recommend using this over Neosporin or Mederma (once a scab is formed don&#x27;t use on open wounds).</li>
            <li>Before i had finished using a single 4 oz bottle MOST OF THE MARKS WERE GONE.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my face &amp; It gives me a certain glow....</li>
            <li>I did get a couple of rather large pimples on my belly</li>
            <li>I bought this for the large pores on my face and as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>If there is an improvement, I will certainly update my opinion.</li>
            <li>I have certainly seen a change in all of those areas..</li>
            <li>My first time using bio oil a few years ago, I had great results after a relatively short period of time considering my use pattern.</li>
            <li>But the design of the bottle is not so well, it easily get too much than I actually need.</li>
            <li>She just had a baby and this Oil sinks into the skin - no oily residue - with a very light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get not one single stretch mark during my last pregnancy,  I also purchased this as a gift for one of my coworkers and she loved it as well.  </li>
            <li>If you need a product to fade scars, discolorations, even fine lines, this is definitely the product.</li>
            <li>There are better brands for cheaper that does more or less the same thing.</li>
            <li>There is a very noticeable difference in my skin, maybe not to others but certainly to me.  </li>
            <li>skin already feels better and I would venture to say it looks better too: less red and blotchy, softer, and I have not broken out from using it.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised its performance in the first month!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not a fan of synthetic products or petroleum-based ingredients such as mineral oil (a distilled product of petroleum), I suggest using more nourishing, natural oils like pure argan oil and rosehip seed oil to help prevent scars and stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin and found this lite weight oil to be a great adjunct to other moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>We also live at a high elevation in a very dry area, so it helps keeps my skin nice and moist.</li>
            <li>Seems that it has worked for many other people, so all I&#x27;m saying is take the positive reviews with a grain of salt, and don&#x27;t get your hopes up</li>
            <li>I would suggest getting smaller quantity and trying it out before buying the huge bottle.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it really helped my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>work so much for me as a scar remover.</li>
            <li>I also use it on a scar I received about a month ago from a burn and it is fading quite fast.</li>
            <li>My skin is also so much softer.</li>
            <li>The item showed up fast with no problems.</li>
            <li>Works really well for me.</li>
            <li>it was moisturizing haha.</li>
            <li>but I cant swear by its stretch mark disappearing or appearing powers because I really think it&#x27;s a genetic thing regardless of what you do.</li>
            <li>I would use a very liberal amount and spend about 30 minutes rubbing it into my tummy.</li>
            <li>Everyone warned me that my belly will get really itchy in my 2nd-3rd trimester but as of today (35 weeks), I still don&#x27;t have itchy skin.</li>
            <li>My sister who has very oily skin did not like this product</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really help much on the stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The smell is really perfumey, which bothers my nose a lot.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for a month, really like it.</li>
            <li>I dont know why people were raving about it because it did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li>Really keeps the itch away too.</li>
            <li>Do t really work but the itching went away from growing Prego skin</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant because it was oil.</li>
            <li>I could really see the difference.</li>
            <li>where I really need it.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil.</li>
            <li>After using this for a month straight, alot of my stretch marks had gone away</li>
            <li>, I just grew really fast.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if this really works</li>
            <li>I really like this oil.  </li>
            <li>seems to heal much quicker.</li>
            <li>It really does keep skin moist.  </li>
            <li>Really recommend it.</li>
            <li>BUT after the three-day uses I got puppp which caused my belly very itchy every day and night.  </li>
            <li>That said, this is an absolute steal for the price.</li>
            <li>They are not noticeable unless I look very closely.</li>
            <li>I saw some improvement in my acne, but it took a lot of time to do the whole routine and the bleaching of my clothes</li>
            <li>I really thought it would work for me but after using it I did not see any difference.</li>
            <li>Bio-oil really does work.  </li>
            <li>But does absolutely nothing to help scars/stretchmarks</li>
            <li>Hope for the fantastic effect two months later.</li>
            <li>If you have acne this really helps and for stretch marks as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very disheartening that I did not have the results that I anticipated, so I console myself by saying what works for others may not be for me.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for reading</li>
            <li>I really wish this had worked.  </li>
            <li>and it is really helping me to regain elasticity in my belly.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very moist when I use it.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s a whole thing), so everything becomes a scar.</li>
            <li>, it being summer in all, so I was really exited.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my scars and it works very well.</li>
            <li>but it really does make a difference.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product for anyone who needs to use it in a very noticeable area all day, but you could try putting it on and then after it sits for a while take any excess oil off with a paper towel to see how it works.  </li>
            <li>If you accidentally use too much oil, use a tissue to dab it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>NOTHING REALLY WORKS...</li>
            <li>But if you do decide to peel off that skin before it is ready, I would recommend this to help you.</li>
            <li>but in any case I&#x27;d much rather have a couple breakouts than permanent scarring from stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>but it works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t even use it as much as I was supposed to.</li>
            <li>The reviews calling it greasy are very correct.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very greasy, but I tell ya.  </li>
            <li>this product is very greasy.</li>
            <li>I was really bummed that this product gave me a rash.  </li>
            <li>I have slightly sensitive skin, but rarely get rashes from creams or anything.  </li>
            <li>I do not have much to say about it</li>
            <li>really took it out of my skin and was aging me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if its genetics or if this stuff really works, but why risk it?</li>
            <li>I ended up popping really fast</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>DID NOT SEE TOO MUCH DIFFERENCE WITH STRETCH MARKS</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really notice</li>
            <li>Well, maybe not so much....</li>
            <li>It has too much of a fragrancy smell, which I don&#x27;t care for, and</li>
            <li>That said, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really some miracle cure for scars and stretch marks or not.  </li>
            <li>Therefore I really can&#x27;t say if the product is working or not.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing when the stretch marks itch</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell... too much perfume ....</li>
            <li>This in conjunction with a slightly messy homemade coffee ground scrub got my belly looking worlds better, and that in turn helped my self esteem and alleviated all the frustration I dealt with daily on account of the scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I started applying for my whole body.</li>
            <li>It does help my skin glow and makes it very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too much hype.</li>
            <li>I have used products that cost five times as much as Bio-Oil and did not get these results.  </li>
            <li>n ice and fast del ivery</li>
            <li>I really like using this product.</li>
            <li>Used it from 4 month onwards until 9 months of pregnancy, really worked for me.</li>
            <li>My skin has not broken out.  </li>
            <li>Daughter really likes it.  </li>
            <li>I am truly, terrifically grateful, I cannot even express how much this oil has done for me!&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I cannot say with absolute certainty that this will be the case for everyone else, however I can say with 1000% certainty that this is a must buy--an absolute must buy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt to buy one bottle and try it out (in my opinion), and it really does work.</li>
            <li>and I can all ready see that it is going to heal well.</li>
            <li>Really makes a difference in how my neck and the backs of my hads look.  </li>
            <li>I used this my whole pregnancy still using it now</li>
            <li>You will literally have to see to believe the magic it does on aged sun damaged skin.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really make a difference to the skin.</li>
            <li>If you choose to try this oil, I suggest you pay very close attention to any changes in your face or skin while using it.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t absorb it that much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about and it has really cleared up my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very oily, but I use it instead of lotion on my face.  </li>
            <li>I just finished using Bio-Oil once a day, every day, for 13 months straight.</li>
            <li>She found it reasonable as she have used it before.</li>
            <li>She have not had any issues and would like to issue it out to all who wants to try.</li>
            <li>I have used it on two pregnancies since discovering it and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>I have heard so much about Bio-Oil</li>
            <li>They are so much lighter than they were.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it on my c section scar as well and am not seeing much of a difference there, but it works wonders on stretch marks.</li>
            <li>it absorbs very well and doesn&#x27;t leave much of an oily feel.</li>
            <li>However, the really silvery ones were still there.  </li>
            <li>I really like how fast it dries.  </li>
            <li>Light color leather may darken some but begins to lighten up about twelve hours later.  </li>
            <li>I really like the scent of the product, too.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Stretch marks have gotten much lighter.</li>
            <li>dries fast.</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t really think it will work)</li>
            <li>and it really does hydrate your skin</li>
            <li>so I react to a lot) which I really like.</li>
            <li>no matter how much you apply and does absolutely NOTHING.</li>
            <li>I really do regret buying this product.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much for it help your skin...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery fast.  </li>
            <li>Absorbing performance is under average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Bio-Oil is very moisturizing, and seems to really sink in well.</li>
            <li>Really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>It contains hazlenut oil, which I am very allergic to.</li>
            <li>Just started using this oil, can&#x27;t really post a review on it yet.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if it&#x27;s made a difference, but my skin feels hydrated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;have to use product twice a day to correct any damage&lt;br /&gt;oily for some time&lt;br /&gt;no real instructions</li>
            <li>very versatile oil.</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>Really evens out scars and marks on the skin.</li>
            <li>Absorbs really well and makes my skin feel really moisterzied,I still don&#x27;t know if it helped with stretch marks</li>
            <li>but that didn&#x27;t seem to really affect the treatment of my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants their stretch marks faded fairly fast.</li>
            <li>It is a very oily product but it compliments my face well and keeps it from drying.</li>
            <li>We bought and discovered it is really in a class by itself.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing yet not greasy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>They protrude just as much, no difference in that.</li>
            <li>Doesnt feel so much greasy as it does creamy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>and it is much cheaper</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>fast thank</li>
            <li>i didnt see much difference in my scars</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the whole bottle</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind so much and</li>
            <li>They are absolute too oily for summer.</li>
            <li>My homemade makeup goes on much smoother with this under it, too.</li>
            <li>For the price nowhere near worth it.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been a month and my scars have already lightened and started to smooth out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>stretch marks, so i really think that moisturizing has spared my stomach.</li>
            <li>However, I must mention that I saw the most improvement after using the oil in conjunction with the dermaroller, but that has so far only been one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am prone to stretch marks and have several old ones from being overweight for most of my life.  </li>
            <li>results are slow but good</li>
            <li>Having used about half of the bottle attempting to make various appliances around the house work, there wasn&#x27;t a full use left of the bottle, but I was able to use the rest of it on my face, and to my surprise, it worked a lot better there.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay wet long and therefore is great for quick massages where I need to put her clothes back on.</li>
            <li>It absorbs pretty quickly, has a nice, light scent and moisturizes like crazy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, after a month and a half of use I could probably head back to the Walmart to return this thing because it still looks full to the brim</li>
            <li>Speaking on her behalf, I would say this seems work but very slowly and very effectively.</li>
            <li>I am currently 7 1/2 months pregnant, and am willing to try anything to keep stretch marks away.</li>
            <li>I started ordering this when I first got pregnant with my 2nd child.</li>
            <li>I was recommended this oil when I was pregnant with my first and now using it again with my second.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and added perk-my skin is so freaking soft right now.</li>
            <li>It did feel a little greasy at first, but I just had to make sure I didn&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>First thing I noticed that it makes my skin very very soft.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I&#x27;m rolling with Mother&#x27;s Special Blend All Natural Toning Oil, straight coconut oil, and natural cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that was due to a variety of reasons.</li>
            <li>Stretchmarks get a more even tone due to the moisture but it doesn&#x27;t diminish the appearance to a noticeable degree.</li>
            <li>I have trouble with many products and this is very gentle.</li>
            <li>My expectations were probably too high to begin with, but this product really didn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li>, my whole body has a glow almost, very nice, I only rated four stars because it consumes allot of time applying it to your entire body and letting it dry</li>
            <li>If you buy it, particularly if you are pregnant, please be aware that this product contains the following ingredients that are rated as high hazards by EWG: fragrance, retinyl palmitate, amylcinnamaldehyde, benzyl salicylate, geraniol, hydroxycitronellal, eugenol and coumarin.</li>
            <li>I had to admit that  I&#x27;ve tried almost every (positively reviewed) product to lessen the stretch (beauty) marks I got after having two precious little ones.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve yet to notice any significant improvement in those areas, but I remain highly hopeful as it&#x27;s only been a couple of days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read other reviews that many though the price is too high.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is super oily and greasy; no matter how much I tried to rub it into my skin it still just felt yucky and oily even hours later.</li>
            <li>I have old but light stretch marks between my thighs &amp; on my muffin top from gaining/losing weight, &amp; also a very unattractive dark shade inbetween my inner thighs from skin friction.</li>
            <li>Now they&#x27;re dark in color and more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that the first ingredient is mineral oil.</li>
            <li>This was recommended to me following bilateral full knee replacement surgery</li>
            <li>I am lazy, and it honestly took me quite a while to rub in the oil--probably about 30 minutes, which I didn&#x27;t have the patience for.</li>
            <li>Not only does my husband daily tell my how much he loves how my face smells, I love how it does not make my face oily at any point in the day.  </li>
            <li>the dark spots on my skin are mostly faded.  </li>
            <li>Within the first two weeks I noticed that some of my stretch marks were completely fading.  </li>
            <li>and now I have more dark spots</li>
            <li>so I am not sure if it works to be honest.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark while I was pregnant!</li>
            <li>compared to all the other $200 plus stuff out there! :)</li>
            <li>new thing i was using!</li>
            <li>I have very fair, sensitive skin and was skeptical about trying something new due to the fact that I am allergic to many products.</li>
            <li>I applied this on top and underneath my nails and on my cuticles and massaged it in several times over the next two days then went back to Walgreens to purchase a full 2 oz bottle.  </li>
            <li>been using for 5 months now and still doesnt see much improvement in my new scar.</li>
            <li>I live on the east coast and my skin really struggles in our winter season here.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t spill out, and it&#x27;s not too oily as I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel any more hydrated than previously; I feel like I should be using a moisturizer as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is particularly helpful for traveling since I can travel with one product instead of an array of creams.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would&#x27;ve done differently is use it more onmy thighs, hips, and breasts.</li>
            <li>Started using this beginning of the 2nd trimester and now 9 months pregnant</li>
            <li>Maybe the acne.org stuff dried out my skin so much that it started producing more oils than normal?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the darker and older ones I use bio oil</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product religiously since 3 months pregnant &amp; have just finished the bottle after 3 months of use often twice/day.</li>
            <li>I am pregnant and in my 3rd trimester and have been using this since the beginning of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>The most obvious (and embarrassing) of the demon craters litter my upper arms, stomach, and breasts</li>
            <li>I am currently 26 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li>Better safe than sorry</li>
            <li>but I.believe this is softening them and will aid in skin elasticity coming back quickly after baby.</li>
            <li>but that might be because he got older</li>
            <li>Use this stuff with my 1st pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get stretch marks... Trying again for second pregnant.</li>
            <li>I have only gained 25 lbs, and jot quickly, so</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research and found that this oil had the best reviews and testimonials; I didn&#x27;t think it was that expensive (especially considering the posited outcome), so I bought a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use bio oil all the time now that I&#x27;m pregnant with my second child!</li>
            <li>She is pregnant and she started complain that her belly was itching at the beginning of the second trimester.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about 4 mo pregnant when I got it, and I used it daily in the mornings.</li>
            <li>LOVE this for scars and daily face oil and will never go back to anything else!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>but I really believe this oil is helping my nails look better, even the supposedly dead nail plate.  </li>
            <li>Especially since they tell you to use it while pregnant.</li>
            <li>In the morning, my face is vibrant and plumped up from the oil, without any greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am on my 3rd bottle and 7.5 months pregnant.</li>
            <li>and my face is healing and on its way to normalcy again, and i gladly switched back to just using my regular trader joe&#x27;s moisturizer(which</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks, almost daily and already some on my legs have already turned into super skinny, skin tone lines that you would have to look for (or know where they were) to find.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m 9mo pregnant and have been using this since the beginning and only have stretch marks on my hips.</li>
            <li>If I feel super full after a meal and feel my skin stretching, I will apply a little oil and my skin is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this oil if not only to help with your skins elasticity, but to help you skin feel extremely soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This was originally available as a limited item at Costco.</li>
            <li>They have not completely disappeared and I don&#x27;t expect that to be the results, but they definitely look a whole lot better.  </li>
            <li>Even on the very old stretch marks!</li>
            <li>Really like what I am seeing, SO FAR!</li>
            <li>I have been using this after a light layer of cortisone and seen a slight difference the first week for my peeling eczema.</li>
            <li>I was sixteen years old at the time, and I was growing too fast for my skin to handle, so I ended up getting stretch marks from the top of my thigh to a bit over half-way down.</li>
            <li>It helps moisturize my dry skin better, reduce acne scars, and improve general complexion/tone of my skin.</li>
            <li>I like this particularly for my neck which is more sensitive than my face and some other products</li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had plenty of scarring from acme (that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll say on that), so I had plenty of high hopes for this.</li>
            <li>I probably bought it having too high of expectations.  </li>
            <li>Its&#x27;s high up on the list.</li>
            <li>For scars, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>No problem during the using, highly recommand.</li>

            <li>we hIghly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My skin got really itchy while pregnant and using this definitely helped and made my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>to all the research I did, I&#x27;ve chosen to switch to natural and 100% pure oils.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has clearly started working for me- someone who has visible surgery marks ( not even just stretch marks ), so I am certain it will definetely help you too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I thought it would do a little better of a job at keeping my strech marks on the lighter side.  </li>
            <li>If I had only known about it for my first pregnancy!</li>
            <li>I just took a chance with this, because the ingredients didn&#x27;t indicate anything that would be a danger to my little man, so, if your vet &#x27;ok&#x27;s&#x27; it for use</li>
            <li>I just took a chance with this, because the ingredients didn&#x27;t indicate anything that would be a danger to my little man, so, if your vet &#x27;ok&#x27;s&#x27; it for use</li>
            <li>Works good especially for little scars!</li>
            <li>pretty large bottle that I think will last for years and years.</li>
            <li>and I am proud to say my white, silvery stretch marks are almost all gone and my dark red ones are a light pink color so they are fading!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first body oil I&#x27;ve ever used, but other pregnant ladies recommended it.  </li>
            <li>Especially since my further research on the particular brand of Bio-Oil does not contain any of the TRUE &amp;#34;key&amp;#34; ingredient - Purcellin Oil - that is need for healing!  </li>
            <li>It really makes my skin soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>Very nice...lightweight and soft fragrance.</li>
            <li>As far as helping with scars, not so much.  </li>
            <li>I developed a heat rash and it works very well on keeping my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to go the all natural route.</li>
            <li>and my daughter is 3 months does absolutely nothing but moisturize and make the skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I get acne scars and somewhat blotchy scars that are much darker like scabs when mosquitos bite me because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It really helps soften and clear my skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much difference with the stretch marks yet, but it does make the skin soft.</li>
            <li>but she said it really worked for her stretch marks and they were damn near invisible.</li>
            <li>I had nothing to lose and I was really getting self conscious about my skin, so I brought it.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised, and I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to fade their scars, stretchmarks, etc.</li>
            <li>It is working really well so far</li>
            <li>i plan on using it after baby too as i really really like how soft it has made my skin.</li>
            <li>They need to declare that this product only works on fresh scars and stretch marks.</li>
            <li>So, I was not looking forward to never having a normal tummy again.</li>
            <li>not crazy about the smell though, so I only use it at night.</li>
            <li>I look forward to close to normal skin after 90 days of using it.</li>
            <li>I will follow up in a few months to give a better review based on the results I see.</li>
            <li>The only product in the past that helped in the slightest was the dermaroller, but my results were fairly minuscule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would work better if I could remember to use it everyday.</li>
            <li>night wash your face or body with your normal regiment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled to find a good moisturizer in the past and I&#x27;ve finally found one with Bio-Oil.</li>
            <li>It totally gets absorbed in my skin, when I use it on my face, and my skin has a glowing effect, without being greasy or anything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a bunch of big chemically words that I can&#x27;t read, and I certainly don&#x27;t feel safe putting them on my stomach with my baby on the other side of my skin.  </li>
            <li>but I just wanted more oil for my skin that was starting to get dry as I age.  </li>
            <li>Reduce dark spot:  Not as significant as I would like, but the dark spots are not as prominent.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t got a single stretch marks, and it kept my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>right in the middle.  </li>
            <li>Compared to my right one, my left knee is like new-bore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant &amp; have been using the oil for a month.&lt;br /&gt;Feels lightweight &amp; keeps my tummy moisturized for a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And for those tired feet after a long day at work, I ask my man to use this on my feet...feels soo good!</li>
            <li>LOVES this stuff, seriously works wonders :) Smells pretty and makes my skin</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li>and i wanted to by a product to provent new strech marks and fade away my resent ones...</li>
            <li>and I didnt notice any new ones either.</li>
            <li>If it helps, I had new stretch marks that were red/purplish.</li>
            <li>I used up a 4.2oz bottle within 3 months, and just purchased a new one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I cant live without bio oil.</li>
            <li>I now use it on new handbags and boots before I wear them and apply again two or three times a year.  </li>
            <li>and I still don&#x27;t have a new stretch mark.</li>
            <li>If I get any new stretch marks I will update my review.</li>
            <li>I receieved the box sealed and brand new.</li>
            <li>and I feel like I see a new stretch mark every couple of weeks these days, despite using the bio oil as directed.</li>
            <li>but I u have learned to live with them.</li>
            <li>started using this only 5 days ago, but I thought my early impressions were worth noting</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m curious as to whether many of these reviews are fabricated by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I am sure it is not legal to sell personal products like this with an unsealed cap.</li>
            <li>I just received my Order which is more than 10 days later than the expected delivery date.  </li>
            <li>The oil feels nice on my skin, but I really looks like my stretchmarks have gotten worse.  </li>
            <li>I highly suggest applying this oil as directed because it will clear and prevent new marks.</li>
            <li>Left hand is SO smooth and soft with younger appearance and right hand has larger, deeper lines of aging.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Takes a while to absorb into the skin, but once it does it leaves it very soft.</li>
            <li>Might I add, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>goes on oily but soaks in makes my skin feel very soft</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It does keep my skin on my belly very soft and hydrated</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This has def helped to lighten many fresh scars, but does not really impact or make a make a difference on existing scars that have been there for a long time or scars from deep cuts either.</li>
            <li>(I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>But my my stomach has a very old surgery scar</li>
            <li>It is significantly more expensive than Palmer ( the other brand I tried) but the smell of Palmer was super strong and neither me or my husband could stand it</li>
            <li>After using this daily during my second trimester I found out that it’s full of chemicals, and rated 8 (high concern) by the environmental working group (EWG) database.</li>
            <li>(I will clearly be repurchasing here instead)!</li>
            <li>and I never knew that my skin could be this clear!</li>
            <li>I just bought a larger bottle so that I can use it even more liberally on other parts of my body.</li>
            <li>It was sent on time, but because of the fragance-I am allergic to most -I was not able to use it, but</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s completely safe to use for stretch marks.</li>
            <li>My stretch marks first turn red then lighten.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 12 years after my first child and all my stretch marks were white and somewhat faded.</li>
            <li>I have ordered many times in the past.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how it could help my skin if all it does is sit on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its a small light weight bottle, I even carry it in my purse!</li>
            <li>The two oils are pretty similar to one another</li>
            <li>But it makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>Have been using the oil to prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy since the middle of my first trimester.  </li>
            <li>but they are almost completely gone!</li>
            <li>It helped prevent stretch marks from my second baby and fade the ones from my first.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying silicone scar patches that were more expensive, but had a lot more results to show after only 1 month.</li>
            <li>Just a couple of drops and my face immediately felt soft and supple!  </li>
            <li>The itching has nearly completely resolved and I have not one stretch mark!</li>
            <li>I went through two bottles my first pregnancy and am on track for the same this time around also.</li>
            <li>Second time I used my bio oil was when I burned my wrist and hand with hot oil when cooking.</li>
            <li>As far as shipping - I got my bio oil within a week of my purchase!</li>
            <li>just yesterday (my first use since last summer).</li>
            <li>I used this twice a day with my first child and am using it again with my second.  </li>
            <li>The first time I discovered bio-oil was at a local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now 38 weekspregnant and tried different creams,butters, and oils at first until I decided to try the bio-oil.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only oily when you first lather it on, but it keeps you moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li>only once day or every other day along with Palmer&#x27;s coco butter, which my skins seems to agree with better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle and will most likely be on my 3rd soon</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I have noticed that my skin looks better-softer, smoother, &#x27;glowing&#x27;...the stretch marks (which are 9 years old!)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product for the past 3 weeks and my skin looks and feel better.</li>
            <li>The only downside perhaps is that it leaves the skin oily when first applied</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>This is actually not the first time I&#x27;ved used bio-oil.</li>
            <li>not one stretch mark and has helped in fading my old growth spurt and stretch marks!</li>
            <li>and yes it is a bit greasy, it is an oil after all, but if you use just a little and give it time to absorb you can easily use it under make up.</li>
            <li>it smells a little strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try due to the high ratings and a recommendation from a friend and by using it for two weeks, I&#x27;m seeing tremendous improvement.</li>
            <li>the only active ingredient most tube scar creams had was sunblock.  </li>
            <li>new and old scars - surprised cosmetic surgeons haven&#x27;t put this in fancy packaging and sold it for 10 x the price!</li>
            <li>If you have scars you want to eliminate, and you want a safe, skin-friendly way to do that, I highly recommend using this 2 x&#x27;s a day for at least 3 months</li>
            <li>I used on the top of left hand and not right.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at how fast it works and even though I still have a few they have lightened in color and size significantly</li>
            <li>I now have new marks on my skin and decided to give my old friend a try once again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my old stretchmarks fading and have maybe one or two new ones.</li>
            <li>This stuff made my stretch marks slightly dissapear and it also made my skin very very smooth i wish it was bigger</li>
            <li>I am currently 8 months pregnant with my 3rd child and decided to use Bio Oil as prevention and erasing of any new stretch marks.</li>
            <li>This was my first bad experience with Amazon after years of great service.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference in how light my stretch marks look from my previous pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using the bio oil in hopes of allot more results in combination with my daily routine of skin creams, bronzer and what not, I recommend it to anyone who reads this, it&#x27;s worth a shot to try it, seriously, added bonus, I put it on my face while applying it</li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother, feels more even and my Stretch marks are disappearing ( not sure about  old ones....</li>
            <li>It seems like my stomach gets a new stretch mark everyday, my breasts have stretch marks, and I just don&#x27;t enjoy having that on my body.</li>
            <li>But after comparing my before-and-after photos (I was skeptical before I had started as to whether or not the bio-oil would really work), I saw evidence that confirmed what I had already learned over those two months--this oil is black magic!</li>
            <li>Great for tired, dry skin on the face and preventing wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I have dry itchy skin, it&#x27;s so helpful during winter and light enough for summer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently 8 months pregnant and have no stretch marks and only use at night.</li>
            <li>I am currently 5/6 months pregnant with my second child and use this along with a lotion based product for stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>currently 8 months pregnant with my second child.</li>
            <li>The heels of my feet get dry and cracked and this clears it right up.</li>
            <li>Plus, I am now having dry skin and my skin just soaks it right up.</li>
            <li>I bought more of the Bio-oil from Amazon for other scars that have been around for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Using it for two months on a large scar I recently acquired through a car accident.</li>
            <li>i notice that not only did i not see any changes but new stretch marks appeared!!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my scars, but I break out a little bit if I use it every night.</li>
            <li>right above my existing marks were new red ones!!</li>
            <li>I use it on my face to even out my skin tone and hydrate my skin (which it does both amazingly), I use it on my rashes and eczema due to having OVERLY sensitive skin (as long as it&#x27;s not an open rash from scratching -shame on me-)</li>
            <li>The only product that truely keeps my skin moisturized up in dry climate that I live in.</li>
            <li>I also began using it on other blemishes and marks on my legs and arms ALL fading tremendously.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m am glad I can order it from Amazon because it can be hard to locate in stores.</li>
            <li>I love the oil, never had any brake out, it is really lifting away the brwon spots but very slowly, you got be patient and put on your face 3 times a day.</li>
            <li>I searched many reviews of many products, but I never came across a bad review for the Bio Oil.</li>
            <li>and i see clearly the difference on her skin before and now</li>
            <li>It is too early to tell of the final results, but I really like how it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>basically, after my baby is in the clear, I&#x27;ll try this for any lingering marks.  </li>
            <li>It also helped clear up the spots on my face.</li>
            <li>didnt notice that much of a difference in reducing stretch marks but left skin feeling soft</li>
            <li>it makes my skin soft</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do anything for old  stretch marks.</li>
            <li>so I like the product thus far.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working as far as evening out the colours</li>
            <li>Been using this for a month so far</li>
            <li>I have been using the product twice a day in the morning and at night and so far it has worked.</li>
            <li>and I really appreciate the larger bottle and price.  </li>
            <li>After 2 months of continuous usage on my face as a moisturizer, it helped fade old acne scarring.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin feeling soft plus it gives an even tone with prolong use</li>
            <li>However, this order took 2 weeks to arrive, was surprised by this.</li>
            <li>but it made my skin soft</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and am already seeing results.</li>
            <li>I am 18 weeks and have not seen any stretch marks so far</li>
            <li>but i haven&#x27;t had ANY itching so far</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft after I use it.  </li>
            <li>The second week, my makeup glides on much easier without the cakekiness.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and not itchy at all.  </li>
            <li>though, so it&#x27;s not wasted.</li>
            <li>I do however have a problem with my skin tone being uneven and this product fit the bill.</li>
            <li>So far it is preventing any stretch marks on my stomach.</li>
            <li>It has made my stretch marks nearly vanish.</li>
            <li>acne scars on my back are on their way to vanishing, and as for the stretchmarks on my thighs, I await promising results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a month straight of constant break outs.</li>
            <li>I will likely have to re-stock very soon.</li>
            <li>So far I have not noticed any difference on my body - I have been using it for 2 months now.</li>
            <li>My 12 year old daughter uses this to moisturize her faces.  </li>
            <li>Its recommended to apply 2-3 times a day early on in your pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be starting to use it more regularly and earlier with my next baby.</li>
            <li>Been using It for a month now and haven&#x27;t change the appearance of my scars so far.</li>
            <li>I think it has also improved the appearance of decades old severe stretchmarks on my abdomen skin.</li>
            <li>#34;how will this get rid of old scares?&amp;#34; All I can say is it does.</li>
            <li>I am 15 years old</li>
            <li>just my skin healing naturally healing or the oil.</li>
            <li>Please it makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>My friend got attacked by a wild cat and had to go to emergency.</li>
            <li>It also can make my skin soft and stay hydrated.</li>
            <li>Used it for months and so far I haven&#x27;t got any scretch yet</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I admit I have a sensitive skin but did not expect itchiness or intermittent &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; sensation in each and every body part the oil was applied on.</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin approves.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nearly gone.</li>
            <li>My scars were within 7 months old.</li>
            <li>but they didn&#x27;t completely go away.</li>
            <li>but no where near as noticeable as before.</li>
            <li>so it appears to work well so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 20 years old</li>
            <li>and so far haven&#x27;t gotten any.  </li>
            <li>it makes my skin soft and lighter.</li>
            <li>(I did have old ones on my hips from puberty)</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I bought this oil because my belly was starting to really itch at about 16 weeks into my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>So Soft</li>
            <li>and I agree completely.</li>
            <li>I had several areas of melasma that were very pronounced.</li>
            <li>I dont hve sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very oily and you must use a tiny amount.</li>
            <li>it soft the skin every day,  </li>
            <li>but it really makes your face brighter looking and younger.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product because it is natural and shows results.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>No itching or stretch marks so far.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>My son is 2 months old, and I still use it on my stomach every day.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>but anything wow~</li>
            <li>But I guess it takes longer time to get natural skin tone.</li>
            <li>She used it after her bat and made her skin feel silky soft.</li>
            <li>Then i found my old bottle of bio oil.</li>
            <li>but it smells like cloves and old women.</li>
            <li>I might even go as far as to say that this is a life changer.</li>
            <li>Old scars I&#x27;ve had for years are beginning to lighten, too.</li>
            <li>Works well so far for applying to scar tissue.</li>
            <li>I am 55 years old &amp; have used Bio Oil on my face for about 10 years now.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>While it does leave my skin soft, it has not improved my stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>After three days of using this they were completely gone.  </li>
            <li>There was no noticable difference as far as skin improvement goes.</li>
            <li>Started using when my scars were 7weeks old.</li>
            <li>Using with silicone scar sheets for 24hr action</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this from my local enabler at the cosmetic counter at Walgreens (thanks, MJ) who helps to feed my nail polish addiction.  </li>
            <li>You might be pleasantly surprised at the results.</li>
            <li>, I thought I smelled a bit like an old lady.</li>
            <li>I feel it may cause breakouts, but I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I have old stretch marks in my hips from puberty -</li>
            <li>This is 5 natural oils, no chemicals, and</li>
            <li>as far as moisturizing, healing and improving your skin condition - IT WORKS.</li>
            <li>Some of the natural oils also help scarring, but so far, the Bio Oil works faster for scars.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone suffering from self conscious scarring looking for an answer to clearing up their skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft...</li>
            <li>It restores old leather, enhances the shine, and seems to prevent cracking.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is now 7 weeks old.</li>
            <li>this may have not kept the stretch marks away completely</li>
            <li>I bought it for help with 10+ year old stretch marks form puberty.</li>
            <li>People have been using natural oils for thousands of years</li>
            <li>The key is not to use too much because it can have a reverse drying effect if you do.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so considerably lighter that some areas doesn&#x27;t even look like I have stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I am also applying this to old scars and they are fading.</li>
            <li>You can still see the stretch marks, but at least it&#x27;s not as prominent as before.</li>
            <li>but have found much cheaper options that do the same things.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too bothered by the linear incisions because they were out of the way, but the big X was very upsetting.</li>
            <li>For me, it took a long time to notice results, and by then I was almost out of my first bottle</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t worked fantastically yet but who knows if there is a product that does completely heal scars?</li>
            <li>I bought this oil because I&#x27;m in early stages of pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the item was old</li>
            <li>It helps to keep your skin moist and soft.</li>
            <li>So far no stretch marks on my growing belly...</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not too greasy and so far</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product until my stretch marks are completely faded even if I have to by another bottle.</li>
            <li>I like it so far.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m usually sensitive.</li>
            <li>For those that have acne marks or hyperpigmentation, this helps to fade them and leave yoir skin with its natural undertone glow.</li>
            <li>I used my entire pregnancy by the directions as to how much to apply and how often to apply.  </li>
            <li>This was my least favorite product of all of the stretch mark prevention oils/creams I used during pregnancy.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li>soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is soft afterward, but I don&#x27;t expect to see a difference in texture.</li>
            <li>It will not make deep scars go away, but it really does soften them.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper here than obtaining locally.</li>
            <li>I started using this for about a week and as far as  my skin tone goes (face) - it is already fairer and almost even now.</li>
            <li>It is removing my old scars, tone my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, time lines are softer too.</li>
            <li>Before I was so self conscious even around my boyfriend to show my tummy</li>
            <li>I have tried many products, to try to at least demish them, nothing has work.</li>
            <li>I started using the product when she was about 2  months old.</li>
            <li>I have a six month old daughter and NO stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Baby Natural Stretch Oil</li>
            <li>a non-preg note, my skin has become sooo soft where i&#x27;ve been using it, i started using it on my legs after shaving and before going out with skirts or shorts.&lt;br /&gt;there</li>
            <li>Two linear ones under my arm and towards my back, and a big X right on my side (where a camera went.)</li>
            <li>I used bio oil and after almost a month the small scars are completely gone and the big darker ones have become very light.</li>
            <li>I was using it on my face to help with it being pretty dry during the winter months.</li>
            <li>Went from a gross brown to a light pink!</li>
            <li>Also, my stomach shrunk back to almost normal size and elasticity within the first 2 to 3 wks after my c-section, not sure if bio oil played a part but its definitely worth using this product.</li>
            <li>The skin on my face is clearer, and less dry. :)</li>
            <li>It makes my skin look so clear and vibrant and some of my tiny frown lines are diminished.</li>
            <li>I have heard that your stomach can get itchy when pregnant due to dryness, but not with this oil!</li>
            <li>I am writing this review only two weeks after starting this product so it may not be as accurate as if I was using this long term as the product states, but it definitley makes my skin feel softer.</li>
            <li>the scars from even my first pimples have even remained and i finally decided to try this product and it said that i would see improvement in 3 months and it has only been 1 week and the scars are almost completely faded.</li>
            <li>If by this time next year I still have no results then I will knock those 3 stars down to a big fat zero :)</li>
            <li>had a huge, dry, red rash on the back of my knee</li>
            <li>Retinol cream is something I&#x27;ve used in the past for fine lines around my eyes for instance; [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>My marks were gone really quickly, probably after using about a bottle and a half of this.</li>
            <li>Also acne and pimples were never a big problem for me, but I have noticed that when I use this product consistently I don&#x27;t get even the occasional ones.</li>
            <li>keep this short, I will be using this regularly and would absolutely recommend without hesitation!</li>
            <li>It looked exactly the same 3 months later.</li>
            <li>I am not entirely sure, but I am guessing that they became more visible when blood flow increased around my thighs such as while running and</li>
            <li>Although I finally found a face lotion I love, it is almost $100 for a small container, so one day I thought, why not try the bio-oil?  </li>
            <li>I got stretch marks from my pregnancy, mainly around the back of my knees and thighs.</li>
            <li>I also think that the scent doesn&#x27;t last long once it&#x27;s absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li>then most of the moisturizers on the market and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I use it on my cellulite and it really takes it down, and I use it on any redness or blemishes I see absolutely anywhere.</li>
            <li>The stretch marks on both of my arms end right at the antecubital fossa (aka the other side of your elbow for all you non-a&amp;p nerds).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, not only for scars but for surgical site healing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend prior to applying lotions.</li>
            <li>She told me that the nurses in the hospital told her about Bio Oil and highly recommend it to patients who are left with scars after receiving surgery.  </li>
            <li>before getting pregnant and knowing that I had developed stretch marks in the past I was worried about creating new ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using Bio-Oil to fade both new and old stretch marks, and it definitely has had a noticeable effect.</li>
            <li>After 3 months there is barely any trace of a scar!!</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, the fine lines are gone, the deeper lines that went across my forehead like crevices are down to short, barely noticeable lines and</li>
            <li>Make sure that the area is dry before putting clothing on, otherwise you will stain your clothing (similar to any other oil stain).</li>
            <li>It was ok it absorbed well, but is something you have to do everyday for at least a year.</li>
            <li>If you have small &amp; light ones like mine you may get results faster.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for my sensitive and acne prone facial skin and does not appear to cause any breakouts after applied.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>But when i try this i noticed my stretch marks is not dark than before.</li>
            <li>I spent over $400 buying this over the months and used it consistently...</li>
            <li>I WAS HOPING YO SEE FAST RESULTS, BUT IT DOES WORK WELL ON CERTAIN TYPES OF UNEVEN SKIN TONE</li>
            <li>ive been rubbing it in to my neck and breastbone as well, sometimes my a little on my face, and ive seen HUGE improvements in the texture, color and overall appearance of my skin tone...</li>
            <li>First let me say that I am very prone to stretch marks, having them on my hips from puberty growth spurt and previous weight gain as a teen.</li>
            <li>Other products, like Kiels etc, are great but feel a bit thick and heavy, particularly as it gets warmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been about a month, will update if I see any new changes</li>
            <li>New stretch marks have came back as a result of me stopping usage</li>
            <li>It did NOT help with the existing stretch marks but definitely prevented new ones.</li>
            <li>I use to live in southern cali and even tho I always spfd, I have noticed just living there for 5 years</li>
            <li>My stretch marks were relatively new still red.</li>
            <li>However, after using it for a week, not only did it not reduce any acne scars, but the oil clogged my pores and caused 7 new acne to form on my cheeks and nose.</li>
            <li>Really help on my dry skin around elbows and knees.  </li>
            <li>third time using it and noticed that my recent scar from over 3 months ago is starting to become less noticeable :)</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m in my last trimester of pregnancy, I am using bio-oil 2-3 times a day to help avoid/reduce (if at all possible) the much dreaded stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I only apply it ones a day and it give my skin that extra moisture it needs for the whole day...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been purchasing this at a local drugstore only to find it on Amazon for much cheaper</li>
            <li>I has made the marks less distinct over time.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t seen any major color correction.</li>
            <li>I am trying it as an after peel oil for the first time for comparison to other oils.</li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side, leaves your face extremely greasy</li>
            <li>And I barely see any scars now!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had really dry skin this past winter and the oil works a lot better than any of the lotions I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
            <li>I am Black with a dark complexion, so maybe it just works better on lighter skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They worked okay, they really dried out my skin and would ball up if I tried to use sunscreen or other serums with it.</li>
            <li>This product is decent and is taking a long time to heal my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I used this product on my darker skin due to shaving and I noticed a good difference with lightning and keeping my skin from irritating and getting darker if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>I am done with the large size bottle and there is absolutely no difference in the scarring.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was a little cheaper considering how often I use it, but the product is worth it.</li>
            <li>Slow and steady wins the race,</li>
            <li>I have seen such a positive change in my dry skin and it has also helped with the itching.</li>
            <li>It came highly recommended by several friends in the medical field.</li>
            <li>but I had wondered out loud if it would do some good for my nails, which can be very dry, have lots of ridges and basically look pretty bad without polish.  </li>
            <li>I took some bad advice from a couple tall, long torso ladies about stretch marks not being a real problem unless you have multiples and any old moisturizer will keep your belly looking good.</li>
            <li>Results also depend on the age of your stretch marks, your genes, how you take care of your skin and health in general, etc.</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t wear make up</li>
            <li>but if you take before and after pictures it clearly does, especially for darker skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this to try to clear up two pimples on my face that no matter what they would just keep breaking open and not heal.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t use the oil long enough to see my result</li>
            <li>Been using it last 4 month and no strech marks so far.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see a ssignificant change the next morning...</li>
            <li>Noticable improvements in old stretch marks, scars and facial wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>and I started to develop strech marks on my inner thighs and breast area ( non on my stomach so far...</li>
            <li>Yup, apparently that&#x27;s a thing.</li>
            <li>3 stars only because it&#x27;s too early to tell if it works for intended purpose.</li>
            <li>After awhile you could barely see them anymore.</li>
            <li>I used it on a surgical scar, and it is now barely visible.  </li>
            <li>My baby is 4 months now and you can barely see my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I started using this early in my second trimester to avoid stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>I bought this not really expecting a whole lot</li>
            <li>It definitely helps in preventing stretch marks and fading away old marks.</li>
            <li>ive been using this since the beginning of my 2nd trimester and so far no stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Someone at Walgreen&#x27;s recommended this product to me early in my pregnancy back in 2009.</li>
            <li>As a young mother, I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li>In which the surgeon needed to open a 33 year old C-Section scar.</li>
            <li>Some spots are completely removed and overall the redness is quite suppressed.</li>
            <li>Conclusion, I would save my money and buy something at an Apothecary or natural pharmacy next time.</li>
            <li>Some type of surgery (ranging from laser to micro-dermabrasion) is the only method of completely removing the stretch marks anyway.</li>
            <li>Well apparently I can&#x27;t use it on my body either..</li>
            <li>I use it on my feet to keep calluses away, I use it on my inner thighs and it completely changed the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>So far it has not clogged my pores and left pimples or anything,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a month, but I can already tell a difference in the appearance of my old surgery scar.</li>
            <li>I am 20 years old, had a baby back in March, and had a lot of stretch marks on my thighs.</li>
            <li>Tried it only twice so far.</li>
            <li>It barely helps.</li>
            <li>my face is more radian instead of the bluish looking when you are tired.  </li>
            <li>They haven&#x27;t gotten better, but they haven&#x27;t gotten worse either, they sort of stopped in their tracks and seem to not know which way to go.</li>
            <li>I have tried literally 20-30 lotions over the past few years, from the cheap to the expensive, all seemed to have the same issue with starting off good in the first part of the day, but</li>
            <li>The consistency is light and liquidy, not the thick, nourishing oil texture I was wanting.</li>
            <li>My skin soaks it right up after a little while.</li>
            <li>The scent of it is a little odd, but not disgusting.</li>
            <li>Well as I was doing some stuff around the house I noticed that some of the skin was loose so instead of having all those dry skin flakes; I figured why not peal it off right now.</li>
            <li>Six weeks ago I had a large section of the end of my nose excised due to skin cancer.</li>
            <li>NOT A SINGLE STRETCH MARK with this product!</li>
            <li>Really saves my skin, especially in the dry winter months.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not thrilled with this oil, but it has a pleasant, non-sweet smell and seems to at least temporarily nourish skin&lt;br /&gt;dry</li>
            <li>In terms of stretch marks, it really did not help with ones that I have, but that may be due to the fact that they are old, white stretch marks.</li>
            <li>you have the harsh red stretch marks I extremely recommend this product, it make your stretch marks look better.</li>
            <li>I went through a total of three bottles throughout the whole pregnancy - and I don&#x27;t have a single stretch mark.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m in my early 40s and have been using Bio Oil as a facial moisturizer (since I live in the southwest and its so dry).</li>
            <li>has tried other products, more and less expensive, and most caked her makeup.</li>
            <li>: When I first  used this I put it on half of my face</li>
            <li>, I have very light stretch marks in a few places that are stubborn and a few scars, one being on my forehead from a car accident that still had glass in it from three years ago</li>
            <li>but it goes a long way, for me the whole bottle will probably last about two months (with daily use and on a couple areas).</li>
            <li>Ive noticed if i wear a tight shirt to bed the oil is still there in the morning and that is exactly what i was looking for in a stretch mark product I want something that stays.</li>
            <li>The price isn&#x27;t too bad and worth a try if you are looking for a beauty fix :)</li>
            <li>is one negative though, i have had to wear undershirts between my skin and my actual clothes to avoid staining them with oil, but i could have easily just used it at night only.</li>
            <li>this bottle is also so big I have used maybe a 1/2 inch of it so far at daily use on 3 places.</li>
            <li>By the time I had gone back to try and find amazon products to switch out for the third party items some of the items I had chosen were gone completely.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will help to prevent any stretch marks as my mother has some pretty deep and dark ones on her stomach and thighs.</li>
            <li>As expected, the product is very oily and actually stained some of my clothes.</li>
            <li>It may take regular application of this oil on the scars for may be a several months, before I completely see them disappear, but I can tell you it works.</li>
            <li>I figured since I was not a skinny girl to begin with that I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry as much (since I already had some extra fluff).</li>
            <li>I recently bought mustela double action.</li>
            <li>I have hideous dry patches on my face and not only were they irritating but kind of embarrassing because they looked so flakey.  </li>
            <li>It can be a little oily at first, until you rub it in.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any major scars to worry about, only one which was a cancer spot removed from my fore arm.  </li>
            <li>used it very long, but so far I like the way it makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li>I only had a few stretch marks on the right side of my tummy.</li>
            <li>; so I will give it a few more weeks to see if there is any noticeable change in my skin texture, the little discolorations that are starting to appear on my face, or a reduction in wrinkles.</li>
            <li>only con is that the bottle is small and I use it up quickly.</li>
            <li>I used different products for these new, red stretch marks all over my legs, especially on the back of my knees and none of them gave me the results that this one did.</li>
            <li>the other reviews said, my face would clear up and I would have radiantly clear skin.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been  using for a month now and the dark marks are really fading away.  </li>
            <li>now you can barely notice them I only get 4 stars because they didn&#x27;t work on all parts of my body</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in the first few times I used it</li>
            <li>used 5 times a day everyday since first trimester.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item for fresh 1st and 2nd degree burns that I acquired a few months back.  </li>
            <li>First few days you will feel it is working wonders.&lt;br /&gt;But, according to my experience it will cause uncountable number of pimples on pimples, neck , cheeks.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, I was very incompetent in my application of the oil, as I skipped many days, even successively.</li>
            <li>I started using it in my 2nd trimester and not a single stretch mark yet!</li>
            <li>Given that there is NO evidence that stretch marks during pregnancy can be prevented by moisturizing the skin, I&#x27;ve steered well clear from Bio-Oil for the past couple of months and switched to pure coconut oil, which is working just as well.</li>
            <li>months in to pregnancy number two and not a single new scar, though one of the old ones is looking a little</li>
            <li>OK- first off, need to address a previous review that say this doesn&#x27;t work for wrinkles, age spots and that it is TOO expensive to use for these purposes.</li>
            <li>I gave this 3 stars because I feel this product could work wonders on dry &amp; scaly skin, wrinkles, small or light scars or deep pores.</li>
            <li>It softened the fine lines on my face a little bit, and made my skin slightly softer.</li>
            <li>It seemed a little crazy to use oil for my already oily skin, but my sister has beautiful skin and is a Bio-Oil user</li>
            <li>Got myself a first class ground beef belly after baby number one, discovered Bio Oil a little over a year later.</li>
            <li>you have to be careful, and only put a few drops at a time on, then work it it very well, if you put too much you can be greasy for</li>
            <li>I saw a huge difference in my skin and hardly got any stretch marks!</li>
            <li>This oil REALLY did lighten the darkness of the skin, &amp; made my stretch marks less noticeable when going out in a bikini.</li>
            <li>Help keep my face soft - I have dry skin.</li>
            <li>Ii continue to order this because it keeps my dry skin moisturized and soft, without being greasy.</li>
            <li>As far as treating dry skin and some lines and wrinkles, can&#x27;t beat the Bel Essence though.  </li>
            <li>Once the product is absorbed, I found that it actually led to excessive itchiness.  </li>
            <li>became, like bold and thick.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate and Bio Oil has made such a difference improving the skin on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have used Bio Oil religiously twice a day for the past 4 months on fresh scars left by the removal of skin cancer.</li>
            <li>Well, one morning I did wake up to find two small red lines on the right underside of my belly.</li>
            <li>hey, it&#x27;s less than $20 with eligible free shipping when combined with other products and the bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>My first reaction was uneasiness due to the pink colour, thinking it may not be as \\&quot;natural\\&quot; as it claims.</li>
            <li>and the skin on my tummy (which was kinda loose) seems to be tightening as well, maybe because i&#x27;m doing alot of ab exercises of late to complement the smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I wish it didn&#x27;t smell quite so much and that the packaging was a little nicer.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Highly recommend for all types of skin issues scars dark spots</li>
            <li>although I was hoping for more, I thought it would make at least a little bit of a difference.</li>
            <li>I feel like it helped prepare skin to be capable of absorbing the very thick palmers cream.</li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t really speak too negatively of this product as I don&#x27;t think any product would have completely prevented them.</li>

            <li> The bottle is a good size</li>
            <li> I put it on 2-3 times a day and use a fair amount each time.  </li>
            <li> Smell really good</li>
            <li> Good after shower moisturizer.</li>
            <li> A friend introduced this product to me and says it&#x27;s good to remove operation scar.</li>
            <li> Good product, but takes a LOOONNNGGG time to work.</li>
            <li> It does smell good though</li>
            <li> I heard lots of good reviews on Bio-Oil for pregnancy stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Bio-oil is good for face, scars and diminish the look of scars and spots.</li>
            <li> good stuff&lt;br /&gt;liked</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good deal</li>
            <li> Good moisture without oily feel.</li>
            <li> And I believe  Tissot is a good brand.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I stoped by at the pharmacy and  asked the employee what she would recommend for brown spots and she told me Bio Oil is good.</li>
            <li> its a good moisturizer before make up and bed time&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> It smells really good</li>
            <li> I have been buying used, thank you for your enthusiastic service, I would be happy to get your help, will focus on these products.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good and good price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not so sticky, and it smells good, it can use at skin, hair, face.</li>
            <li> Smells good</li>
            <li> This is the 1st review I&#x27;ve been compelled to write and its because this product is that good.</li>
            <li> Good stuff,</li>
            <li> (package was good, no leaks).</li>
            <li> I have tried all sorts of creams and none have worked as good as this.</li>
            <li> Its a good moisturizer but its oily and gets on clothes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was this oil or a combination of things, but I have no stretch marks and loved using</li>
            <li> Good product, but must use every day.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have those issues, maybe you should still give this product a try based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li> It smell good</li>
            <li> but I just rub the excess into the rest of my hands and am also seeing some good results there.  </li>
            <li> smells good helps scars and stretch marks</li>
            <li> but this has been doing a good job clearing it up for me.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> It seems to be clearing them up fairly well.  </li>
            <li> I put it on every night and have seen a good improvement in the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Either way, my skin was so moisturized, and it smells really good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good things about Bio-Oil</li>
            <li> today I decided to have a good look</li>
            <li> This body oil feels so good on the skin and mine</li>
            <li> Heard good things about it, so we shall see.</li>
            <li> Good experience with seller, but this product hasn&#x27;t done anything for me.</li>
            <li> I get facials once a month and after using this product, the technician always comments how good my skin</li>
            <li> but It smells so good</li>
            <li> Well I use a good pumice stone, Bio Oil and a pair of cotton socks overnight a couple of nights a week.  </li>
            <li> AND IT SMELLS GOOD</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it smells really good, and also because it seems to have softened and hydrated my cuticles, elbows, ankles and knees.</li>
            <li> The smell is noticeable but fairly neutral - still, I didn&#x27;t want to use it while I had morning sickness.  </li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> works good on scars from hip replacement</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve found nothing this good, ever.</li>
            <li> it feels good</li>
            <li> good quality.</li>
            <li> Not as good as everyone says it is.</li>
            <li> i think its good...</li>
            <li> saying how good it is beginning to look.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the effect is as good as the it says.</li>
            <li> Good price</li>
            <li> It seems to be good stuff</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and the fragrance is wonderful.</li>
            <li> And it smells good.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this works good luck ladies</li>
            <li> Smell is good and can use it every day.</li>
            <li> Best price, smells wonderful, works  good on my dry skin,very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> Upwards of &amp;#62;$100, easily!!</li>
            <li> It also smells very pleasant and feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and feels very good on my pregnant tummy!  </li>
            <li> Very good Easy to absorb Pungent smell</li>

            <li> Happy to find a better price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> She is very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice oil, it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li> Hello all!&lt;br /&gt;I rarely ever post reviews, however this product is truly legendary, it deserves an award of its own!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this stuff… smells great, absorbs quickly…</li>
            <li> I think it also has helped the effects of the Bio Oil too - the scar skin is softer, the scars aren&#x27;t bumpy any more, so I&#x27;m really happy.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a great product.making sure that the itching isnt being cause by fleas or another issue.</li>
            <li> have told so many others about it and they are equally happy.</li>
            <li> Just got this and have heard many great things from friends who have used it.</li>
            <li> The price seemed fair, but I just would not, at this point, consider it sufficiently effective at smoothing skin.</li>
            <li> it is nice oil with good smell</li>
            <li> I know the latest beauty research is all about oils, and they are very effective for skin care, so I did some additional research and found [[ASIN:B007VEPVZC Bel Essence - (2oz) 100% All-Natural, Organic Anti-Wrinkle Oil Treatment with Argan, Grapeseed and Avocado Oil]].</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very light and pleasant.  </li>

            <li> I am so satisfied with this product!</li>
            <li> This is the best cosmetic product I have ever got.&lt;br /&gt;Other than taking care of the skin blemishes, it works great as general</li>
            <li> One of the great things about this product is that it absorbs very quickly into your skin so you never have that &#x27;oily&#x27; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bio oil is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> This product is simply amazing.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I will keep update for this amazing product which I have never thought I would us.</li>
            <li> I think it is amazing</li>
            <li> I have been using this for couple of weeks now and my skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> And I also feel it moisturizes my skin amazingly.</li>
            <li> **amazingly</li>
            <li> I bought it on my own accord, but my doctor was impressed I chose such a great product.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> Amazing oil during pregnancy and post partum to help ward off stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells amazing and does work.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> the fragrance is amazing</li>
            <li> think this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing that it&#x27;s not greasy even if it&#x27;s an oil.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great light scent.</li>
            <li> This oil is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> it is amazing</li>
            <li> Also has a minty kind of smell to it.</li>
            <li> kind of a rose scent.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice gloss</li>
            <li> Ingredients seem nice though - just didn&#x27;t work for MY skin.</li>
            <li> Has a nice scent but when applied to my face, can cause plugging of my pores or breakouts which is undesirable.  </li>
            <li> I liked that feeling of softness.</li>
            <li> and it also smells nice.  </li>
            <li> nice smell, do not know the effect now</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I have no wrinkles and</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and nice texture.</li>
            <li> I think it is effective.</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s good :)</li>
            <li> It may be working, or it could be that the stretch marks fade on their own.  </li>
            <li> The product also smells nice and has a nice feel.</li>
            <li> this works nicely....</li>
            <li> #34;an honest review.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t absorb immediately, which has been nice.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as a moisturazer ever since and i have been loving it.</li>
            <li> Although, it would be nice if it could so something about my scars and stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but does not fade scars.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t even an effective moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but I didnt have any stretchmarks, and I liked how this oil felt on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it was a good deal.</li>
            <li> I got hit in the lip with a softball this summer and have a nice chunk of scar tissue I have to massage 2x day.  </li>
            <li> So, am loving it.</li>
            <li> but i think it is effective.</li>
            <li> and mixing my own blend for my skin.</li>
            <li> say, believe what you want about bio-oil...make your own judgements.</li>
            <li> I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be 100% effective</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice and</li>
            <li> Nice oil ..</li>
            <li> Fast forward to now, I can say that it is the best moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it rather than throw it away, but will buy rose hips oil when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> However, the oil has a nice feel to it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the BEST product I have used for my skin.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it and she says it has really worked for her and is the best</li>
            <li> but it would be nice to have it help somewhat.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much, I researched it on the internet and found the best deal with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> it smells  wonderful and its so  light but feels so good fresh out</li>
            <li> i was excited to try this product because of the great reviews on this site.</li>
            <li> but im excited to see the rest of what this miracle oil has to offer!!</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel wonderful and, for the price, it&#x27;s a decent deal, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> good for your body and face, it has good feeling and easy to use, many people recommended it to me</li>
            <li> Lightened a huge scar amazingly well!</li>
            <li> it works superb, My wife really love it and its working perfectly with her dead skin and stretch mark that accrued after post pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I am very confident that if you use the product as recommended, it will do more than a satisfactory job at fading the appearance of your scars or stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> keeps your skin healthy,smooth, clean and lustrous!!</li>
            <li> This product shipped quickly and was in great shape when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Great product , quick shipment.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong perfume smell and then felt a burn for hours after I put it on my face.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite product but better than using Vaseline!</li>
            <li> I can already see that is becoming smoother and my Doctor noticed too!.</li>
            <li> Very light nice smell.  </li>
            <li> : This is a very light oil that smooths on the face nicely.</li>
            <li> Just love it, use it mainly to nourish my hair (use it sparingly) but excellent on skin as well.</li>
            <li> but this is by far the best</li>
            <li> It has so many uses and works so amazingly.</li>
            <li> It works great and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I would recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I continue to use it because excellent moisturizer but as far as stretch marks purposes does NOT work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously, most reviewers of this product feel it is effective, but I will not use this on my face again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m most amazed at the scars - the bio oil did a nice job on them, and the bel essence helped move that along too.  </li>
            <li> Best oil I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> More effective than any lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I ever used for stretch marks so far.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizing and so far</li>
            <li> Excellent natural product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak on the scar-removing or tone-evening properties, because I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, but it&#x27;s still a great moisturizer and it smells pretty nice too.</li>
            <li> It has a really pleasant flowery smell to it - it&#x27;s not too strong, which I worried about because I dont like strong scents.</li>
            <li> I used scarguard at first, and got great results..decided to try bio oil.</li>
            <li> This oil is great for everything and really does help with scars!</li>
            <li> and my skin is ready to hit the beach and look beautiful</li>
            <li> Every pregnant woman should buy this!!  </li>
            <li> I recommend this oil to all my pregnant friends!!</li>
            <li> People feel very comfortable</li>
            <li> In the 3 months, those acne marks just show very light mark on my face.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty happy and will continue to order more</li>
            <li> oil!&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I have always had issues finding the perfect face lotion, as I am 34, I am not oily, but not dry...</li>
            <li> and I could tell the difference immediately her skin is softer and honestly it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> Rather than an oil, I strongly prefer creams and Cetaphil has been one of the easiest creams to use and has seemed to be just as effective at keeping stretch marks and blemishes at bay during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> but its so nice as moisturize and for fine lines around moth..</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s doing very good.</li>
            <li> all belly, it&#x27;s huge!)</li>
            <li> So, my amazing results aren&#x27;t even near the best results that I could have gotten-- a true testament to how absolutely remarkable this oil really is.</li>
            <li> I love the bio oil</li>
            <li> and I feel more confident</li>
            <li> I love roses but the manufactured smell doesn&#x27;t compare IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> continue to use the product but put another cream over top to mask the odour.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Having it on your hands will prevent you from biting your nails anyways :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a horrible smell...</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> love, need to order more</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because I just didn&#x27;t see any more improvement on the stretch marks.</li>
            <li> fast delivery and great product</li>
            <li> This and Burt&#x27;s Bees Mama Bee lotion are my favorite products.</li>
            <li> All I can say is for me it has worked better that I imagined.</li>
            <li> and I am seeing results but mostly on scars.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> So far so good for me, I&#x27;m 35 weeks and my skin looks good</li>
            <li> but my mom says it&#x27;s after the baby that you&#x27;ll know for sure what your skin will look like.  </li>
            <li> so much better</li>
            <li> Nice light fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy any more of this highly-touted oil that does not do what it claims.</li>

            <li> love this product, at 37 weeks</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure that this oil prevented them</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say for sure if it prevented them.</li>
            <li> You will be highly satisfied with your purchase.</li>
            <li> Love, love,love this oil.</li>
            <li> , that gives aging skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Great price and recieved fast as promised.</li>
            <li> The smell was OK and it was not greasy.  </li>
            <li> but most places sell for $20</li>
            <li> I am in love with this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had many comments remarking on how my skin is &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also compared the top of my hands and the effect-</li>
            <li> More stretch mark scars.</li>
            <li> skin has never looked better ever.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Costco, in hopes it would be the magic cure for my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product is ok.</li>
            <li> I have so many stretch marks and scars from my life, and this sure helps.</li>
            <li> so many people sell fakes, I wonder if this is one of them</li>
            <li> I just love this oil.</li>
            <li> So i just love it.</li>
            <li> Probably it would take more time to see a result in my stretch marks and then i will update again.</li>
            <li> Love love love this oil.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> The price is also much better for the bio oil.</li>
            <li> better that bleaching creams .</li>
            <li> and they thought it would make it all better by giving me 15.00....</li>
            <li> I still see them, but my husband is way impressed that after only a couple of months they were practically gone.</li>
            <li> Will post after pregnancy with the hopefully stretch mark free results!</li>
            <li> Love to use this on my face after the derma roller.</li>
            <li> w/my favorite lotion....</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> My skin has become brighter and more even.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>

            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This product is soothing and OK.</li>
            <li> What I love about the oil is because works and I have bought so many products that is being adverstised to fade away the brown spots and it does not</li>
            <li> One bottle lasted me 6 months or more.  </li>
            <li> I have to lather the Aveeno on and maybe, just maybe, I feel ok.  </li>
            <li> Which is better bio oil or coconut oil?</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the oil; it glides on smooth and soaks in nicely and is not sticky at all.</li>
            <li> I use just once a day, and am pleased with results.</li>
            <li> I love the price and how the oil felt on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more</li>
            <li> Still have 9 1/2 more weeks to go</li>
            <li> Ok I have used allot of creams and oils before</li>
            <li> she said its better than cocoa butter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had way better luck with Mederma.</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> I love this stuff -- I use it on my face.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> However, i love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> but this is like 10 bucks and works maybe better.</li>
            <li> SMOOTH, NICE SCENT HELPED WITH HYDRATING SKIN -</li>
            <li> Even better:</li>
            <li> No scar and no ruined wedding photos :-).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would have minimized faster if I applied it 3x per day as recommended.</li>
            <li> and i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> I love to put it in my water when I soak my feet.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully there will be results soon :)</li>
            <li> I have not seen and effect of this products, but it is ok for my skin ,no irratiation, but did not works for its function,too.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work any better than olive oil - which does not work.</li>
            <li> More even skin tone, softer and makeup just look so much better after using the bio-oil.  </li>
            <li> I tried many lotions but nothing showed improvement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good for my face, just a few drops in the morning after I wash and my skin literally glows and feels wonderful all day.</li>
            <li> Love the absorption.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> LOVE  </li>
            <li> Totally buy for a great price!</li>
            <li> love Bio oil.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s reduced the appearance of my stretch marks, but I do believe it&#x27;s prevented me from getting more.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> JUST MAKES IT LOOK BETTER ,</li>
            <li> This is better than any moisturizing lotion I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> They all love it.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more for our daughter in law after she has the baby,  because of course She&#x27;s complaining about stretch marks.</li>

            <li> Love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks, I started seeing a difference...slowly but surely.</li>
            <li> It should do magic for you too.</li>
            <li> can use it all over, is not sticky and makes your skin nice and smooth .</li>
            <li> I love this oil already I just got it yesturday</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The two products have changed my skin permanently for the better.  </li>
            <li> and I will continue to buy it. :)</li>
            <li> I love the subscription service and the product.  </li>
            <li> I love this oil..</li>
            <li> I use it for my face in the winter and hair for all year i love it</li>
            <li> this product looking forward to buying lots more</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> But that is okay</li>
            <li> A lovely oil</li>
            <li> I never got any strechmarks, but I can&#x27;t credit that to Bio Oil since I think that has more to do with genetics.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Your skin will love you for using it.</li>
            <li> Used a bottle per month :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much better alternative to most of the stretch mark creams out there, so I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just decided not to look any more and that I&#x27;d sure never be able to wear a bikini again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Okay soo hello</li>
            <li> No stars is more appropriate.</li>
            <li> I have stretch marks from growth spurts on my hips growing up, and I was sure I would get them during pregnancy on my belly.  </li>
            <li> told me it may cause acne in oil skin,but i think it&#x27;s safe for me.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Skin felt smoother for sure because it is oil.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> There are better products out there for that.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my bio-oil, the product I received when I ordered this on Amazon</li>
            <li> I have some problem areas, like most women-just some stretch marks, and surgery scars.</li>
            <li> Its so much better than using those urea based lotions, that are so gloppy/sticky and stinky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am NOT a vet, nor am I saying you should use this on your dog without asking your vet, and making sure that the itching isnt being cause by fleas or another issue.</li>
            <li> I love Bio-Oil, have been using this for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Top of the line.</li>
            <li> Love the smoothness of the skin after using this product.</li>
            <li> nothing more.  </li>
            <li> my face look more youthful&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love rubbing it on my expanding belly.</li>
            <li> I love, love this product.</li>
            <li> I love rubbing this oil on my belly, butt, thighs and breasts after a bath.</li>
            <li> The size is perfect because it looks as though i may have a lot left even after i give birth.</li>
            <li> But use it daily for best results!!!</li>
            <li> It smells ok, so I can put it on the scar in the morning and not worry about it smelling</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t even bother to use the product for the suggest 2 weeks to see a difference because the zits on my face were going to end up causing more scars at the rate it was going.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i will update my review after some more days , my daughter  still using it... :)</li>
            <li> Perfect..i will buy more when i run out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not done yet with my pregnancy,but I sure will report after birth :</li>
            <li> and I like this stuff much better.</li>
            <li> It gives you a healthy glow but not an oily one.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad she did.  </li>
            <li> are more hydrated than with lotions.  </li>
            <li> This product basically helps push all the impurities out of my skin and replaces it with the lovely bio oil for healthy radient skin.</li>
            <li> It is ok.</li>
            <li> but I was ok with it.</li>
            <li> l love this product as an all over conditioner.</li>
            <li> I had two surgeries, and so there are prominent scars along my abdomen there.</li>
            <li> i absolutely LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I am buying another bottle to see how much more improvement</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be ordering more from this buyer</li>
            <li> I love using it.</li>
            <li> does magic to your skin</li>
            <li> It is not oily like most oils.</li>
            <li> I use this daily on my face and it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased 😊</li>
            <li> i fall in love with it and want to give it another chance for scars..</li>
            <li> Love this product and the price.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I love this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that actually works and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day a day and for me it&#x27;s been working a million times better</li>
            <li> I have so many</li>
            <li> I have better results.</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> and I got ZERO stretchmarks :).</li>
            <li> All in all I would recommend this product for discolored skin more than scarring.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff has improved my skin texture....</li>
            <li> It is oil, but not greasy at all, love the feel and aroma.</li>
            <li> But, I think I have been a lot better off using this product since a lot of it is gone and most of it will end up going away.</li>
            <li> it came in time and the price is ok.</li>
            <li> I can put it on my hands and don&#x27;t have to wash them before touching anything.</li>
            <li> When I didn&#x27;t know any better, I purchased Bio-Oil hoping that it would work miracles on the existing stretch marks on my hips.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use it to see if or how much more they will fade.</li>
            <li> BUT I didn&#x27;t get any more after I started using it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard from friends who used the product that it worked great, but I didn&#x27;t experience much of an improvement.</li>
            <li> and I Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Now looking at my thighs I can see that the oil successfully rapidly faded away most of the bright red stretch marks.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> I hope it&#x27;ll clear them away for good!</li>
            <li> It a great product I noticed a huge difference as soon as three days after first use</li>
            <li> I like it really good, i like it very much.</li>
            <li> I found nothing special or even effective about bio-oil.</li>
            <li> I love this oil; it is wonderful; helps scars and dry skin..</li>
            <li> Vitamin E oil smells better, has great healing properties, is all natural, feels better on the skin, and costs $2.</li>
            <li> It also smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are all pretty good for skin conditions and scarring</li>
            <li> To me that&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> I first saw this in a magazine and it looked so good.</li>
            <li> For someone who has lived with acne my whole teenage/adult life and has the scars to prove it, I am just thrilled with the results!</li>
            <li> My family has said it smells pretty good and not anything like baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bio-Oil moisturizer is not going to give you plastic surgery type results, but it is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m simply so excited over the improvements I&#x27;m already seeing that I felt compelled to write this review!</li>
            <li> Really excited about using this!</li>
            <li> Great price for a product I won&#x27;t live without.  </li>
            <li> Bio-oil is not only great for the stretch marks but also amazing for the skin.</li>
            <li> Best to use after the shower on dry skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff was amazing while pregnant.</li>
            <li> There is no fragrance too which is nice when your pregnant.  </li>
            <li> and it was amazing how it quickly healed the scar.  </li>
            <li> Excellent for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing for your skin while pregnant.</li>
            <li> it works best for scars and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use coconut oil instead now, which smells delicious and sinks into my skin more rapidly.</li>
            <li> Makes skin very soft and smells great.</li>
            <li> I think it did pretty good considering how easily I scar.</li>
            <li> The smell was a bit strong for me though, I have a strong sensitivity to smells, but some may find it appealing</li>
            <li> Bio-oil goes on so easily, it absorbs quickly and smells really nice.</li>
            <li> I also used this on my scars and because they are very prominent keloid scars, so I am sure it will take some time in seeing  any visible changes, or lessening of their appearence, but I am certain that this works...</li>
            <li> One of the most comfortable skin touch I have felt with moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it work better cheap</li>
            <li> The one thing I do not like is the smell, but luckily it is not a horrible smell and it is a light smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth light and doesn&#x27;t take a lot to apply a lot of coverage!</li>
            <li> Can break out the chest area so be careful but all in all great stuff !</li>
            <li> I would use this for more skin conditions, but honestly, the fact that I don&#x27;t know what the ingredients are, since most of them are chemicals I can&#x27;t even pronounce, I really don&#x27;t want to put this all over my body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for almost 4 months, my scars have noticeably faded and are stretching more comfortably.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so smooth and after a couple weeks of using it I can see the improvement in my skin in so many ways.</li>
            <li> This is great to keep skin hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> I so feel like it&#x27;s making my skin appear more smooth and faded.</li>
            <li> I now enjoy just touching</li>
            <li> My belly feels moisturized and way more comfortable than before.</li>
            <li> Pros: smells good and absorbs very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Good seller but product doesn&#x27;t do much justice on stretchmarks</li>
            <li> But honestly it wasnt worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very optimistic that it will eventually create good results.</li>
            <li> It is good quality and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Very effective for sensitive oily skin.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> and I know it is due to this -- excellent product!</li>
            <li> I originally started using this on a scar on my neck many years ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, but I suggest washing your hands after because it&#x27;ll of course have it stuck there.</li>
            <li> I found out about the Bio Oil a few weeks ago through a beauty product blog, and the blogger holding up this gem as the most perfect oil she has ever used in her life.</li>
            <li> Everything is becoming the same tone of color, blending in beautifully absent of any scars or marks or acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t reduce appearance of scar but a great product for daily use for better skin.  </li>
            <li> It easily washes off my hands when done applying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily &amp; doesn&#x27;t stain clothes.</li>

            <li> the healing process was super fast and was amazing!  </li>
            <li> It kind of makes me get a breakout or two when I first start using it</li>
            <li> This is my first time used this kind of product.</li>
            <li> works wonders i love it super easy to just rub on and go</li>
            <li> It is very good on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Scars diminish very quickly and the stretch marks smooth out.  </li>
            <li> It also faded some scars I had on my legs and has diminished fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li> My fine line are diminishing  gradually.</li>
            <li> It lightened my stretch marks, removed some fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li> - I thought I was never going to be able to flaunt a two-piece after the surgeries, but gradually, I think in the coming months, I will certainly be able to try that out ;)</li>
            <li> It helps reduce the fine lines on my neck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like it was before I got pregnant!</li>

            <li> Came quickly and improved the appearance of my stretch marks!</li>
            <li> 36 weeks pregnant and still no stretch marks!</li>
            <li> currently entertaining the possibility that my skin is a super mutant sponge or something, because I&#x27;m already seeing results.</li>
            <li> I also love that it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> And this product is advertised for pregnant women!</li>
            <li> I use it once or twice per day (started using it at 5 months pregnant) and have no stretch marks!</li>
            <li> Almost 9 months pregnant and no stretch marks yet!</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and lasts all day. :)</li>
            <li> I have been using it faithfully day &amp; night and am amazed at how quickly it has improved my skin!</li>
            <li> Looking good so far though!</li>
            <li> Bi-oil is the best at lightening old and new scars our skin imperfections.  </li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful for scars, new and old and stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It prevents and reduces pregnant wrinkles, and my wife feels much more comfortable than before.</li>
            <li> LOVE bio oil for stretch marks scars and just for moisturizing dry chapped skin its great</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing and certainly does moisturize, but it doesn&#x27;t offer prevention nor healing of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> the 100% Pure brand is nice ([...]).</li>
            <li> I kind of assumed that if it&#x27;s marketed towards pregnant women, it must be legit, right?  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much in the things I am satisfied with everything good, high quality</li>
            <li> I will most certainly continue using Bio-Oil, hopefully it will continue to make my skin look better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certainly going to try my best to keep the regime for the entire pregnancy and keep the faith that no stretch marks appear!</li>
            <li> Wonderful right out of the shower to avoid dry skin!</li>

            <li> But,Skin becomes smooth.</li>
            <li> So, honestly it&#x27;s all very confusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough great things about Bio Oil.  </li>
            <li> Well, as a facial moisturizer,  it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> goes on kind of greasy but absorbs fast and does not clog pores</li>
            <li> it looks nice, and very convenient to use.</li>

            <li> /&gt;This was a great purchase and I still have about 1/4 the bottle left after using it all summer!</li>
            <li> Personallyl, i dont like the peachy-orange packaging because it looks cheap to me, but that  has nothing to do with the quality of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit strong, but it smells clean so that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> My lighter stretch marks are visible but feel smooth on the surface and are not a depression in my skin.</li>

            <li> B00VSL3390 Skingenixx Advanced Age-Reversing Night Time Skin Serum]]</li>
            <li> When I apply it it seems to smooth it out</li>
            <li> I also put palmers cocoa butter on top after this was absorbed.</li>
            <li> Hm, I&#x27;m surprised this oil is so popular and worked for so many people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it since the beginning of my pregnancy and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product at a low price plus fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically a completely natural feeling, almost as good as lotion.</li>
            <li> so far so good, I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> Good so far - i haven&#x27;t had any stretch marks yet...</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and developed stretch marks on my thighs after having my baby four months ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to put on, doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and keeps me lathered up to prevent additional stretch marks.</li>
            <li> so far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Anyway, as far as lines go, I&#x27;m not saying the lines magically disappeared or that this is some kind of miracle lotion, but it has helped reduce lines by about 50%.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Also, if your looking for really good natural products</li>
            <li> , in all honesty it is soft and smells good and leaves my skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> So far so good...</li>
            <li> so so far so good again.</li>
            <li> So far so good...</li>
            <li> Something good, applied to the body also just good, not very much oil, the oil is very appropriate, no big taste, well, run out will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;A very nice, light, facial oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and it really works.!!!</li>
            <li> but it soaks in pretty well!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Okay , not immediate effects, might be good at the early apply from first tri semester to avoid the stretch marks...</li>
            <li> and with 3 kids it would have been so easy and super helpful.</li>
            <li> The scars (about 8 years old) look softer, not as noticeable, I cant imagine how great they would look if I had begun to use the oil from the very start of my pregnant-I dare say that some of them could have been prevented, outright!</li>
            <li> Added sweet oil essential drops for fragrance is great.</li>
            <li> I just feel better buying 100% natural and pure oils (NOW is a good brand)</li>
            <li> This has been working good so far for my pregnant wife.</li>
            <li> It smells good and my skin in super soft.</li>
            <li> Love this light weight oil, I use it to help my skin fade old scars and it seems to be working...  :)</li>
            <li> I was excited about trying this product but one month after applying the oil, the stretch marks got darker.</li>
            <li> At first, I was satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Originally bought for stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to get it all done at once</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the $12!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than willing to stick with it.</li>
            <li> And i have noticed significant changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure to give this product time to work its magic, I used it for a bit over a year before I decided I was pleased with the results, and then popped it onto our subscribe and save list as soon as we started trying for our 2nd.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this item to get rid of some scars I have.</li>
            <li> price in the stores is much higher than on Amazon and if you subscribe and save, you can reduce the price even more.</li>
            <li> I was successful in curing the back acne, however, the acne spots remained there and</li>
            <li> I am still on my first bottle ( just ordered two more yesterday)</li>
            <li> I am never disappointed using bio oil</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t see significant difference then I won&#x27;t buy it again.  </li>
            <li> its certainly worth a chance!  </li>
            <li> its certainly worth a chance!  </li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time and have ordered it for two friends, who also love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much!  </li>
            <li> It has shown remarkable improvement in only a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks have diminished significantly.</li>
            <li> it smells very light and clean, and I love how soft it makes my skin.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use, has a fresh scent, and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes.</li>
            <li> I look more alive now :)</li>
            <li> it was then that I realised how powerful it really was...&amp; just how amazing this oil is.</li>
            <li> Organic fresh hint of like a lavender smell but very mild.</li>
            <li> My legs look super smooth</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of bio oil and so far this has worked the best.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s the nicest and best working I&#x27;ve used so far for scars.</li>
            <li> I used it for a week,it&#x27;s really working!it makes my skin much more smooth than before!somebody</li>
            <li> great for dry areas on the body also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super cheap when it comes to this type of thing</li>
            <li> I used it after washing my face and it would be absorbed easily.</li>
            <li> ], it is packed with great skin-moisturizing ingredients like green tea and aloe vera that make your skin smoother and softer, smoother and reduce wrinkles – I really love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since educated myself about what&#x27;s better for skin and have transitioned to using more natural products.  </li>
            <li> I read so many positive reviews before buying this.</li>
            <li> So far I love it!</li>
            <li> I slather it on, then put a light tank top on, then my regular clothes and this seems to help me feel a bit more comfortable.</li>
            <li> and I loved that it is not greasy, like many other pregnancy oils.</li>
            <li> most certainly look better/diminished.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me and it was right on time!</li>
            <li> ; When I was searching for a product I found a lot of reviews were the result of free or discount priced products, which is fine, but kind of left doubt in my mind.</li>
            <li> First the size is awesome and, not available anywhere else.</li>
            <li> i have used bio-oil with both pregnancies and i can attest that bright red stretch marks are non-existent.</li>
            <li> I saw good results in only A WEEK of using.</li>
            <li> I love how it absorbs fast</li>
            <li> see the full guidelines for writing reviews on Amazon, go here.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this product but it has really helped to reduce the appearance of my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I always put a squirt in my bathwater and have even started using it on my 63 year old face; applying it while my skin is still warm after getting out of the bath/shower.</li>
            <li> My friends said my skin looks younger than before, I would recommend this to every one, cause it really is a good product.</li>
            <li> I use about 4 drops of oil on my face, any more, and it&#x27;s a bit too much oil.</li>
            <li> If you use more than two or three drops on your face and neck, you&#x27;re using too much.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this.</li>
            <li> And my bottle is still full.</li>
            <li> Works good enough though.</li>
            <li> The smell is light and fresh.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it did such a good job.</li>
            <li> The wife uses it ever day during her pregnancy and is just getting ready to order some more.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of the oil very moisturizing and not too greasy.</li>
            <li> It is a true story about my experiences.</li>
            <li> It is full of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;even</li>
            <li> use it with Aquaphor Healing ointment as Bio-oil alone is only good for 1-2 hours</li>
            <li> Now to be fair, I only used bio-oil for about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Nice soft comforting scent.</li>
            <li> This product holds true to what it does.</li>
            <li> I got hooked on this by my sister when visiting her this summer and people have commented on how nice and young my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> I have been fairly good about using it 2 x a day as directed, after my daily lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So it possibly could be a good preventative measure.</li>
            <li> the price for the size of the bottle is actually not bad and I would buy again once the oil was finished.</li>
            <li> I have had no bad side effects, no burning or anything</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have any real hope that it will fade them more quickly than time itself will.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use it daily and where ever you do, it will significantly help-- even with more indented stretch marks or scarring.</li>
            <li> Thought it was working until I woke up at 36 weeks pregnant with a belly full</li>
            <li> This oil is the best, specially if you are pregnant or about to go on a diet and lose some serious weight.</li>
            <li> It smells great but other than that I have not seen any changes.</li>
            <li> The look and feel of my skin was so great that two other family members are using it.</li>
            <li> I heard from other people that it was great and this and that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for stretch marks and all that other stuff.</li>
            <li> The other thing that&#x27;s great about Bio Oil is that it truly lightens&lt;br</li>
            <li> great for relieving itchy belly due to pregnancy.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this stuff while she&#x27;s pregnant.  </li>
            <li> Orders came quickly every time.</li>
            <li> Are used this product when I&#x27;m pregnant</li>

            <li> Also, I got more lines on the top of my thighs where I didn&#x27;t use the oil there very religiously either.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work quickly</li>
            <li> I went ahead and read reviews on oils to use while pregnant to avoid stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re pregnant you need to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Definitely a worthy purchase</li>
            <li> I apply two time a day, every day since I found out I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> I had before I got pregnant and won&#x27;t go away,</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just been super swell dealing with these buggers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that is goes on like suntan oil and absorbs into my skin quickly.</li>
            <li> I am 30 weeks pregnant and have no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> almost 9 months pregnant</li>
            <li> I am 16 weeks pregnant and used this product after reading about it reviews online.</li>
            <li> I used bio oil every day since I found out I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> I slathered this on morning and night from 6 weeks pregnant -</li>
            <li> Top tip- make sure you also apply this to your hips, bum and sides as they all grow enormously during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to any pregnant woman.</li>
            <li> I began applying from about 4 months pregnant to about 2 months after delivery.  </li>
            <li> Never had any itching while pregnant.  </li>
            <li> now 35wks pregnant and haven&#x27;t got any stretch mark yet.</li>
            <li> It would have been a smarter idea to start using while she was pregnant</li>
            <li> My boss is pregnant.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister when she was pregnant with twins.</li>
            <li> I started using this product when I was about 20 weeks pregnant (</li>
            <li> I used twice a day as recommended and my skin on hips and abdomen don&#x27;t have many obvious stretch marks, but I also think drinking 3-4 liters of water a day helped keep skin healthy as well.</li>
            <li> I rubbed this all over my belly, breasts, thighs and butt while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> Soaks in quickly without leaving a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s super greasy to apply (it is oil after all), it dries quickly and leaves no residue on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> i was pregnant and although i still have a couple months to go i am yet to see a stretch mark.</li>
            <li> Since my wife has been pregnant she has been using this stuff every night</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it will prevent stretch marks, but I am 8 months pregnant and don&#x27;t have any yet.  </li>
            <li> If using even once a day, it will run out quickly.  </li>
            <li> I came to know about this oil through my doctor for stretch marks while I was 5 months pregnant.</li>
            <li> so I know I&#x27;m not just one if those lucky women that never get them.</li>
            <li> The oil quickly absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife while she was pregnant to help prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> mild smells, not so oil, can be adsorbed by skin quickly and wait to see the effect, need to consist using.</li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly, moisturizes well, and does the job.  </li>
            <li> Super produit, facile à utiliser et très économique.</li>
            <li> I am 8 months pregnant</li>
            <li> I would recommend this oil to anyone that&#x27;s pregnant to PREVENT stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Foolishly, I didn&#x27;t use any product while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for a pregnant co-worker</li>
            <li> luckily i stopped using it a couple days ago</li>
            <li> I recommend this to all my pregnant friends.</li>
            <li> Arrived super quick.</li>
            <li> The lines are fading away really quick.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews for preventing and help to rid your body of stretch marks when I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some of the reviews I read, this oil does not absorb into your skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> I stopped after I had my son but quickly started again after stomach shrinkage was showing marks again.</li>
            <li> Im 25 weeks pregnant</li>
            <li> I feel the difference on my pregnant belly since I&#x27;ve been using it and notice when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I use this oil when I am pregnant, nothing can compare, it keeps my skin from being itchy.</li>
            <li> Just remember to use it on the chest as well because that&#x27;s where you can also get stretch marks when pregnant and breastfeeding.</li>
            <li> Although continuing to use it after getting pregnant I switched to palmers just as I would use the oil.</li>
            <li> Stretch marks and imperfections were cleared away quickly.  </li>
            <li> it is a good deal and worth to have it next time</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re that worried about looking your age, I highly suggest something more affordable.</li>
            <li> Love the product and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> The very good thing is, all you have to use is a small drop of it at a time.</li>
            <li> I noticed the first ingredients a smineral oil - which is a cheap chemical used as a filler in many products that only clogs pores (as ldocuments in one of many articles I&#x27;ve read:http://www.drfranklipman.com/3-key-reasons-to-avoid-mineral-oil/)  </li>
            <li> I am naturally prone to stretch marks anytime my body grows, but I have now successfully made it through two pregnancies without any new ones.</li>
            <li> I grew so huge that my family was really scared for me, but I never got any marks!</li>
            <li> I originally bought it for my son to try for stretch marks on his stomach but after trying it myself on my face just to see what it might help with, I had to buy my own and in a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> Pretty cheap for its size.</li>
            <li> and I loving the results of my barely noticeable stretchmarks.(I</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> It is light scented, greasy at first</li>
            <li> After first month, the acne marks turn to light color.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more effective than any other lotion or oil I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> But after applying for so long it feels like a chore, the oil sticks to your hands making you give your hands a good scrub to get the oil off</li>
            <li> Shipped very fast nice package great price for the normal size bottle I use just about everyday luv</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just very sensitive to scents and considering most pregnant women are, you&#x27;d think they would dampen the scent a bit.</li>
            <li> Use bio oil with my first pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark:) love the smell, absorbs quickly and helps an ichy belly!</li>
            <li> I see the first ingredient is mineral oil not so good probably coconut oil would work the same.  </li>
            <li> It actually did work to lighten up the scars and it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this didn&#x27;t do anything after using the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I like the fresh smell, but most other oils do a better job of moisturizing and getting smooth skin results...</li>
            <li> I did indeed lighten my stretch marks very much and smells clean and botanical.</li>
            <li> It really works !!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Found it again on Amazon, been using it religiously &amp; my skin is looking &amp; feeling SO much better!</li>
            <li> This size with daily use lasts me more than six months!</li>
            <li> With my first I didn&#x27;t use it a lot because I tend to forget, and with that came stretch marks!</li>
            <li> It really works !!</li>
            <li> I really do recommend this to everyone!!</li>
            <li> You have to be consistent with the product in order for it too work!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an oil, so I guess it is exactly what you think you are getting!</li>
            <li> Works very well!!</li>
            <li> Definitely buying more!</li>
            <li> It worked really well!!</li>
            <li> After 3 months of consistent use, the marks are gone!</li>
            <li> -  Great Moisturizer: I have dry skin, yet just 4 drops can keep my face moisturized for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;-  </li>
            <li> It did not work very well on my acne scars, but is great for the dry winter days.</li>
            <li> As with any body oil, goes on best when skin is wet not dry, so post shower is optimal.</li>
            <li> My skin is getting very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> If I ever get pregnant again, I will start using this right away.</li>
            <li> It also feels very nice going on and is not super greasy.</li>
            <li> I have not tried any other products out there as this is the first I bought and so far it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li> So far she is very pleased with this particular snake oil.  </li>
            <li> It give my belly little pimples, but those will go away and stretch marks wouldn&#x27;t, so I&#x27;ll take my chances :) not oily once it&#x27;s rubbed in and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I mostly use this for my acne scars which are very dark and abundant.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing body oil.</li>
            <li> It seems the oil refracts the light and gives the appearance discoloration is gone when it really isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> genuine product with much lower price</li>
            <li> Using it twice a day for 2 months has really improved how smooth my skin feels.  </li>
            <li> I but this over and over again because I enjoy it that much.</li>
            <li> Finally buy it, it is said that is amazing</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and smell, and the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Deff worth the money, as results are visible.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft I love it</li>
            <li> that was worth it.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it is nearly scentless.  </li>
            <li> Worth purchasing.</li>
            <li> For an &#x27;aging&#x27; woman or man I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure if it is genetics or the product that makes my skin stay young, but I do think this product helps.</li>
            <li> This product is useful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I was applying this product to my freshly appeared scar for 3 months.</li>
            <li> It has regained moisture and is more soft and supple than ever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She says the main thing she likes about it is that when applied, it is not greasy and her makeup goes on over it easily, evenly and does not cake.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> well worth the sacrifice</li>
            <li> This means that you have to be really careful when you put it on (timing wise).</li>
            <li> , we gave it some time, and young skin might fix itself better.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the money and this size has lasted me for years.</li>
            <li> I CAN say that it makes my skin feel more supple and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because of how simple it is to apply to the skin &amp; it has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Its a bit pricy, but definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Nice to find a cheap solution after I spent a bunch of money over the years trying to lighten/soften</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t sure about using the oil thinking it would be really greasy and get on everything</li>
            <li> The oil itself is nice because it&#x27;s not oily, but definitely makes my skin feel moisture.  </li>
            <li> It seems that it&#x27;s useful</li>
            <li> Yeah, I pay this with a bit of shine, but I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> After a month of use, mostly applying once at night after showering, my scar is nearly gone.  </li>
            <li> I found out that some of the natural oils in the Bel Essence help correct scars, so maybe the combination makes everything work better.  </li>
            <li> So far I am completely satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> It goes on oily but is quickly absorbed into the leather.  </li>
            <li> Anywho, it&#x27;s nice to see them back to the way they used to be in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to get something useful, buy Ambi.</li>
            <li> I have found that, in conjunction with my dry-brushing routine (look on-line for directions how to do this-it really changes your skin for the better), the Bio-Oil has pretty much made the KP go away!</li>
            <li> too however this stuff is worth the money.</li>
            <li> We rarely give five stars to anything.</li>
            <li> I have only had great results so far...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Instead I went with more natural creams and oils.</li>
            <li> I message it into my skin until it almost is completely absorbed.</li>
            <li> It seemed that I would go through about one 4.2oz bottle in 3 or so weeks, but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> i love this oil more than all of the other popular oils that are being sold presently.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I was 10 weeks pregnant with my first baby.</li>
            <li> It has a pretty perfumy smell but it fades quickly.</li>
            <li> The smell goes away pretty quickly as well.</li>
            <li> First time I used my bio oil was when I was pregnant and used it to prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> If I ever get pregnant again, this will be the first thing i get.</li>
            <li> super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this, but you have to be patient with it, as it may and most certainly will, take time for visible scars to vanish, but trust me, it will pay to stick with it for a while and see the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well that led to the interesting problem of the skin wasn&#x27;t fully healed and ready for that older skin to come off.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since the very first day of my first trimester during pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> My stretch marks are not old (maybe 6 months) and it is making all of them look extremely better!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a visible difference, but it sure feels good.</li>
            <li> and it clears it right up in a day or so</li>
            <li> This product does not work right away.</li>
            <li> thats right</li>
            <li> I rub in all my expanding parts in the morning out of the shower and then again right before bed.</li>
            <li> Use it all over your face right after you wash it</li>
            <li> I was right.</li>
            <li> They are on my right arm and right leg in visible areas</li>
            <li> The treatment you have always been looking for is right here.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put it on my face like some people do because I don&#x27;t feel right putting oil on that area for fear of breakouts.</li>
            <li> It purely seems like oil without any special qualities.</li>
            <li> I apply it right before bed everynight</li>
            <li> I can say for sure (well almost for sure) if your stretch marks are red ( lighter skin) or brown ( darker skin), it is new stretch marks use this right away</li>
            <li> Bio-oil is good enough that I sometimes use this as a substitute for my normal Obagi routine.</li>
            <li> i have many marks and use this oil to help tone it down and to prevent more from coming.</li>
            <li> It is a light and highly absorbent oil that comforts itchy, irritated skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is light not too overwhelming giving a natural fresh clean scent lasting all day.</li>
            <li> Bio oil typically has a nice light sent to it - the item I received had a funky odor.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t stain clothes, and has a mild/light smell that I actually quite like. :)</li>
            <li> and I hope you made the right choice in buying this product, I certainly did!</li>
            <li> Product works great on recent scars but it doesn&#x27;t do much for old ones.</li>
            <li> I use as a daily routine after showering, sometimes I&#x27;ll put a cap full in a hot bath :)</li>
            <li> I have been using Bio Oil for the past 6 months and have had great results.</li>
            <li> Works great for scars and uneven skin tone!</li>
            <li> It absorbs nicely, so the smell doesn&#x27;t bother for long.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a nice product and continue using it long.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my chest when I had gotten a nice long scratch across my chest.</li>
            <li> This is a good product that wears down marks and scars.</li>
            <li> when I was pregnant with my first son I am bigger this time around and my skin looks better.</li>
            <li> It costs much less than other oil, but it is still very hydrating to the skin without feeling too oily, doesn&#x27;t leave oily residues, easy to apply, smells good,  and makes skin soft and nice!</li>
            <li> Very dry areas are between eye browse and nose, NOT ANY MORE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman and this worked great for evening out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> So I ended up with pretty much a nice road rash on my stomach; which it did hurt when I sat to long and then stood up.</li>
            <li> I so wish I had this when I was pregnant instead of cocoa butter which did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt help too much with my stretch marks since my stretch marks are already old, but they look better than before.</li>
            <li> that specialize in pregnant itchy belly and preventing stretch marks but for me, Bio-Oil really did the trick.</li>
            <li> I have tried this oil and it seams to be doing a good job, they are smoother, and less noticeable, but I will continue using untill</li>
            <li> Live in Houston, have oily skin, and still use every night!!!</li>
            <li> Very soft and light.  </li>
            <li> Oil smells good and is light not thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin, and this product was so good to my skin.</li>
            <li> very fast shipment.</li>
            <li> very much hope it can help me</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use very much at all.</li>
            <li> I saw this at Costco at a very reasonable price compared to what I was paying at Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This worked very very well for me.</li>
            <li> It works very very well for that.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need very much.</li>
            <li> Very absorbing and smoothing...</li>
            <li> I have been using bio oil under and around my eyes to deal with crows feet (I&#x27;m 30, in good shape, but noticing those little lines).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this consistently for 2+ years and noticed almost no change.</li>
            <li> Cross your fingers! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> My freinds and family are pretty amazed, too.</li>
            <li> I have gotten compliments on how smooth and soft my legs are.&lt;br /&gt;used</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> I got s stretch marks after I had my first kid</li>
            <li> just make sure to put it on daily and nightly.</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> I use it on my face when I go to bed and have noticed wrinkles arent as deep and a more even tone.</li>
            <li> Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Well into my first trimester, I had gotten some stretch marks on my belly and sides.</li>
            <li> My face and hands absorbed it very well.</li>
            <li> I put it on my hands every night and it is oily at first but then seems to penetrate my skin.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about how much I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It is reliable and has been building trustworthy from the first time I am using..</li>
            <li> but it does obsorb pretty well</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Noticeable decrease of scar appearance with consistent use.</li>
            <li> After first application, you will look greasy, but this will go away.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it religiously.</li>
            <li> love this product will be ordering again in 3 months or maybe earlier then that!!!</li>
            <li> On my back and shoulders, even more acne scars.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have ever given in my life.</li>
            <li> but i love the smell and it instantly absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to put up with the smell if it helps me.</li>
            <li> It works better than traditional vitamin e oil.  </li>
            <li> most people think I am much younger than my years.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are fading and it is starting to look more uniform with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It is my first time writing a review for a product.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d have to buy more, but I&#x27;m in my third trimester</li>
            <li> so she had many deep scars.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell and feel better than then</li>
            <li> I used in my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li> If I ever notice any marks starting to form on my skin I just apply more oil before I go to bed and my marks are gone by morning.</li>
            <li> so I am pretty hopeful that it will work as directed in 3 months.  </li>
            <li> My skin does feel some what softer after the first couple uses.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this product my unwanted scar in my legs vanish, and I can now go to the beach every time with my sexy and smooth legs minus the scars.</li>
            <li> so this product is not only for women who just has a baby, if you become fat at first and slim again, you can also try this product :)</li>
            <li> First off the product description says &amp;#34;Non Greasy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have scars on my legs from bug bites, scratches, burning myself with hot irons, etc.</li>
            <li> Definitely hydrates the skin without leaving the oily feel that most can.</li>
            <li> , it is pretty oily, but</li>
            <li> My scars are significantly smaller than most others</li>
            <li> I used this once a day before bed during my first pregnancy on my belly and chest and had NO stretch marks (I started as soon as I started to show).</li>
            <li> We at first got this to help with my sons scar.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement!</li>
            <li> Even my husband loves to use it because it makes his face soft after he shaves and the scent is so light.</li>
            <li> but you can feel it when you touch the skin and that has helped me become immediately aware when I start messing with my skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin looks soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for a speedy delivery!</li>
            <li> love this stuff second bottle I have bought</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> And there hasn&#x27;t been much progress in their disappearance since after I stopped using the oil, so I must contribute all of the success in my story to this bio-oil.</li>
            <li> I will be sure to keep the oil on hand in case I may need it in the future.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  </li>
            <li> After googling for and finding pictures of acne nodules tonight, I can see that this is most likely what I have.</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> and it will just soak into your skin and leave it feeling so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> My first time using this</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s pretty pricey.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still on my first bottle</li>
            <li> but the oil does need to be removed first or</li>
            <li> I really like this oil!  </li>
            <li> So yes, I love this Bio-oil and will definitely buy it a 3rd time :)</li>
            <li> I feel better about using Bio Oil when I am using the Bel Essence as a regular skin care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen anything that works so well and so fast!</li>
            <li> Very recommend it!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone interested</li>
            <li> again my first Review was on Feb28,2014&lt;</li>
            <li> Ppl need to know that you have to be consistent in using this oil and</li>
            <li> Definitely like this stuff, but I&#x27;m not so sure it works to reduce appearance of scars.</li>
            <li> Wish I would of used this my first time I could have saved my belly.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look toned and glowy with consistent use.</li>
            <li> Started using this within my first 2 months of pregnancy with twins and have been using it for close to 4 months now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time Mom and by the time I delivered, I had stretch marks all over my tummy and sides.  </li>
            <li> It started to fade my red/purple stretch marks within the first couple of days.</li>
            <li> this can be used on hair, face, body, and my tip is mixing with facial mist to be more</li>
            <li> It seems to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I first used Bio-Oil about a year ago.</li>
            <li> Wish I known about this for my first.</li>
            <li> Must be used consistently to see results.</li>
            <li> It was first recommended to me by my surgeon--the first time she&#x27;d recommended it to any of her patients.  </li>
            <li> Expecting our first baby</li>
            <li> I should have read the ingredients first.</li>
            <li> My skin is sooooo soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I started using it in my first trimester to get in the habit.</li>
            <li> I also use in on my chest for sun spots and overall discoloring and my skin tone is much more even.</li>
            <li> Makes skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I used Bio Oil daily during most of my pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> I thought for sure I would be a giant stretch mark after childbirth.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to ward off stretch marks during my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not TERRIBLE but they are definitely there.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this consistently.</li>
            <li> I did not get any stretch mark the first time around</li>
            <li> The first Amazon shopping is quite satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I started using this twice a day toward the end of my first trimester.</li>
            <li> And the price was better then any local store.</li>
            <li> my scar has faded to almost nothing i love this product and just bought a bigger bottle about a week ago and use all over my body now</li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping that it would be an environmentally safe way to lubricate machinery, but when applied to said machinery, it actually slowed the activity of the machinery.  </li>
            <li> Overall, an okay experience--</li>
            <li> However, it did help with the healing of smaller, more superficial wounds like cuts and abrasions -</li>
            <li> It is exactly as pictured and described.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I saw a difference, it looked like</li>
            <li> my mother and my sister both have pretty severe preg.</li>
            <li> Few people who have tried it have nothing but good things to say,</li>
            <li> This oil is really lightweight and doesn&#x27;t weight you down, plus it smells really good too.</li>
            <li> and she is also mixed with black but is very fair skinned.</li>
            <li> I decided to use this product when pregnant with my first child because it was highly rated in the United Kingdom and I saw an ad in a baby magazine.  </li>
            <li> It really does absorb super fast and never feels greasy.</li>
            <li> It is deep penetrating, light, not oily on the surface, awesomely gentle, very light, natural scent.</li>
            <li> Ive only used this for two days but what i was most surprised with is that not only is it moisturizing and made my skin instantly look alive and awesome</li>
            <li> This product does not absorb very quickly; do not apply this product and then immediately put on clothes that are good or immediately rest on blankets you care about because this stuff is greasy.  </li>
            <li> It has done a good job of lightening the older scars and keeping the skin and current scabs soft.</li>
            <li> but it did help keep my skin super soft, and with the 3 stretch marks that did appear, it helped them fade super fast.</li>
            <li> I even think it is better than any other famous brand, because it is very natural and gentle.</li>
            <li> It smells good, a little goes a long way, and on top of helping his eczema, it&#x27;s cleared up my KP on my arms and faded stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Kind of like baby powder but not exactly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as dark as it use to be, and though its not all gone its much better than it was before!</li>
            <li> It does smell nice and moisturized the skin but other than that it didn&#x27;t do anything else.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have any new stretch marks, only old ones that have kind of showed up a little more prominently.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, not greasy, smells good, use it regularly on the occasional precancerous spot removals I occasionally need...and those brown spots on my face and hands from too much sun...</li>
            <li> but why spend so much for this when it has such better applications than that?</li>
            <li> am very please with the progress and will definitely be buyin more.</li>
            <li> In addition, I LOVE the way it makes my skin look when I wear no make-up - it really evens out red spots and sun damage.  </li>
            <li> I love it, only the oils make me sweat too much.  </li>
            <li> I applied this oil every day, multiple times a day, making sure I rubbed it into the scar really well.</li>
            <li> I have since began using it on older scars with very positive results.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I have deep red marks on my inn re thighs and after putting this on only 3 times, it was already unnoticeable, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> 7 months pregnant and no stretch marks so far... I&#x27;ve used bio oil twice a day since the first trimester</li>
            <li> I got this product because I have recently gotten pretty overweight very quickly..</li>
            <li> I tend to have very dry cuticles that peel easily, and this oil helps a lot!</li>
            <li> Before using do your research and do not rely on the paid ads or fraudulent positive reviews you will see.</li>
            <li> .... extremely greasy, I have stretch marks on my inner thighs and hips so reading all these great reviews saying this product has helped with stretch marks</li>
            <li> It smells ok and doesn&#x27;t seem to be too greasy for too long like some oils can be.</li>
            <li> It has lots of mineral oil which is pretty much just a filler or an ingredient that coats the skin</li>
            <li> My stretch marks have faded from a light purple color to a silvery, barely visible color.</li>
            <li> but it may be too early to say... Not bad.</li>
            <li> All in all the product is good, but I&#x27;m not sure if the oil caused a bit of a breakout on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bio Oil for maybe a little over 6 months now, and I love it!</li>
            <li> the residue left in your skin is not bad!</li>
            <li> To be direct - I am 8 months pregnant and use this once or twice a day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past, and so far this has worked great for my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for dark spots, but great overall.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before using this I was using Acne.org products, (pretty much their whole line).</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and its so moist, it makes me super soft.</li>
            <li> I am super sensitive to smells but this oil has not been a problem.</li>
            <li> Love it, am 76 and at this age have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I like it anyway, especially because its pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t damage clothing.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin super hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve developed stretch marks while I was pregnant with my son..</li>
            <li> Any one with scabs or burns or scars I strongly recommend using this over Neosporin or Mederma (once a scab is formed don&#x27;t use on open wounds).</li>
            <li> Before i had finished using a single 4 oz bottle MOST OF THE MARKS WERE GONE.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my face &amp; It gives me a certain glow....</li>
            <li> I did get a couple of rather large pimples on my belly</li>
            <li> I bought this for the large pores on my face and as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If there is an improvement, I will certainly update my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have certainly seen a change in all of those areas..</li>
            <li> My first time using bio oil a few years ago, I had great results after a relatively short period of time considering my use pattern.</li>
            <li> But the design of the bottle is not so well, it easily get too much than I actually need.</li>
            <li> She just had a baby and this Oil sinks into the skin - no oily residue - with a very light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get not one single stretch mark during my last pregnancy,  I also purchased this as a gift for one of my coworkers and she loved it as well.  </li>
            <li> If you need a product to fade scars, discolorations, even fine lines, this is definitely the product.</li>
            <li> There are better brands for cheaper that does more or less the same thing.</li>
            <li> There is a very noticeable difference in my skin, maybe not to others but certainly to me.  </li>
            <li> skin already feels better and I would venture to say it looks better too: less red and blotchy, softer, and I have not broken out from using it.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised its performance in the first month!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not a fan of synthetic products or petroleum-based ingredients such as mineral oil (a distilled product of petroleum), I suggest using more nourishing, natural oils like pure argan oil and rosehip seed oil to help prevent scars and stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and found this lite weight oil to be a great adjunct to other moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> We also live at a high elevation in a very dry area, so it helps keeps my skin nice and moist.</li>
            <li> Seems that it has worked for many other people, so all I&#x27;m saying is take the positive reviews with a grain of salt, and don&#x27;t get your hopes up</li>
            <li> I would suggest getting smaller quantity and trying it out before buying the huge bottle.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it really helped my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> work so much for me as a scar remover.</li>
            <li> I also use it on a scar I received about a month ago from a burn and it is fading quite fast.</li>
            <li> My skin is also so much softer.</li>
            <li> The item showed up fast with no problems.</li>
            <li> Works really well for me.</li>
            <li> it was moisturizing haha.</li>
            <li> but I cant swear by its stretch mark disappearing or appearing powers because I really think it&#x27;s a genetic thing regardless of what you do.</li>
            <li> I would use a very liberal amount and spend about 30 minutes rubbing it into my tummy.</li>
            <li> Everyone warned me that my belly will get really itchy in my 2nd-3rd trimester but as of today (35 weeks), I still don&#x27;t have itchy skin.</li>
            <li> My sister who has very oily skin did not like this product</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really help much on the stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The smell is really perfumey, which bothers my nose a lot.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a month, really like it.</li>
            <li> I dont know why people were raving about it because it did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> Really keeps the itch away too.</li>
            <li> Do t really work but the itching went away from growing Prego skin</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant because it was oil.</li>
            <li> I could really see the difference.</li>
            <li> where I really need it.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.</li>
            <li> After using this for a month straight, alot of my stretch marks had gone away</li>
            <li> , I just grew really fast.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if this really works</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.  </li>
            <li> seems to heal much quicker.</li>
            <li> It really does keep skin moist.  </li>
            <li> Really recommend it.</li>
            <li> BUT after the three-day uses I got puppp which caused my belly very itchy every day and night.  </li>
            <li> That said, this is an absolute steal for the price.</li>
            <li> They are not noticeable unless I look very closely.</li>
            <li> I saw some improvement in my acne, but it took a lot of time to do the whole routine and the bleaching of my clothes</li>
            <li> I really thought it would work for me but after using it I did not see any difference.</li>
            <li> Bio-oil really does work.  </li>
            <li> But does absolutely nothing to help scars/stretchmarks</li>
            <li> Hope for the fantastic effect two months later.</li>
            <li> If you have acne this really helps and for stretch marks as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very disheartening that I did not have the results that I anticipated, so I console myself by saying what works for others may not be for me.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for reading</li>
            <li> I really wish this had worked.  </li>
            <li> and it is really helping me to regain elasticity in my belly.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very moist when I use it.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a whole thing), so everything becomes a scar.</li>
            <li> , it being summer in all, so I was really exited.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my scars and it works very well.</li>
            <li> but it really does make a difference.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product for anyone who needs to use it in a very noticeable area all day, but you could try putting it on and then after it sits for a while take any excess oil off with a paper towel to see how it works.  </li>
            <li> If you accidentally use too much oil, use a tissue to dab it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> NOTHING REALLY WORKS...</li>
            <li> But if you do decide to peel off that skin before it is ready, I would recommend this to help you.</li>
            <li> but in any case I&#x27;d much rather have a couple breakouts than permanent scarring from stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> but it works very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t even use it as much as I was supposed to.</li>
            <li> The reviews calling it greasy are very correct.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very greasy, but I tell ya.  </li>
            <li> this product is very greasy.</li>
            <li> I was really bummed that this product gave me a rash.  </li>
            <li> I have slightly sensitive skin, but rarely get rashes from creams or anything.  </li>
            <li> I do not have much to say about it</li>
            <li> really took it out of my skin and was aging me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its genetics or if this stuff really works, but why risk it?</li>
            <li> I ended up popping really fast</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> DID NOT SEE TOO MUCH DIFFERENCE WITH STRETCH MARKS</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really notice</li>
            <li> Well, maybe not so much....</li>
            <li> It has too much of a fragrancy smell, which I don&#x27;t care for, and</li>
            <li> That said, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really some miracle cure for scars and stretch marks or not.  </li>
            <li> Therefore I really can&#x27;t say if the product is working or not.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soothing when the stretch marks itch</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell... too much perfume ....</li>
            <li> This in conjunction with a slightly messy homemade coffee ground scrub got my belly looking worlds better, and that in turn helped my self esteem and alleviated all the frustration I dealt with daily on account of the scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I started applying for my whole body.</li>
            <li> It does help my skin glow and makes it very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too much hype.</li>
            <li> I have used products that cost five times as much as Bio-Oil and did not get these results.  </li>
            <li> n ice and fast del ivery</li>
            <li> I really like using this product.</li>
            <li> Used it from 4 month onwards until 9 months of pregnancy, really worked for me.</li>
            <li> My skin has not broken out.  </li>
            <li> Daughter really likes it.  </li>
            <li> I am truly, terrifically grateful, I cannot even express how much this oil has done for me!&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I cannot say with absolute certainty that this will be the case for everyone else, however I can say with 1000% certainty that this is a must buy--an absolute must buy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt to buy one bottle and try it out (in my opinion), and it really does work.</li>
            <li> and I can all ready see that it is going to heal well.</li>
            <li> Really makes a difference in how my neck and the backs of my hads look.  </li>
            <li> I used this my whole pregnancy still using it now</li>
            <li> You will literally have to see to believe the magic it does on aged sun damaged skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really make a difference to the skin.</li>
            <li> If you choose to try this oil, I suggest you pay very close attention to any changes in your face or skin while using it.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t absorb it that much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about and it has really cleared up my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very oily, but I use it instead of lotion on my face.  </li>
            <li> I just finished using Bio-Oil once a day, every day, for 13 months straight.</li>
            <li> She found it reasonable as she have used it before.</li>
            <li> She have not had any issues and would like to issue it out to all who wants to try.</li>
            <li> I have used it on two pregnancies since discovering it and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I have heard so much about Bio-Oil</li>
            <li> They are so much lighter than they were.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it on my c section scar as well and am not seeing much of a difference there, but it works wonders on stretch marks.</li>
            <li> it absorbs very well and doesn&#x27;t leave much of an oily feel.</li>
            <li> However, the really silvery ones were still there.  </li>
            <li> I really like how fast it dries.  </li>
            <li> Light color leather may darken some but begins to lighten up about twelve hours later.  </li>
            <li> I really like the scent of the product, too.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Stretch marks have gotten much lighter.</li>
            <li> dries fast.</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t really think it will work)</li>
            <li> and it really does hydrate your skin</li>
            <li> so I react to a lot) which I really like.</li>
            <li> no matter how much you apply and does absolutely NOTHING.</li>
            <li> I really do regret buying this product.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much for it help your skin...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivery fast.  </li>
            <li> Absorbing performance is under average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Bio-Oil is very moisturizing, and seems to really sink in well.</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> It contains hazlenut oil, which I am very allergic to.</li>
            <li> Just started using this oil, can&#x27;t really post a review on it yet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if it&#x27;s made a difference, but my skin feels hydrated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;have to use product twice a day to correct any damage&lt;br /&gt;oily for some time&lt;br /&gt;no real instructions</li>
            <li> very versatile oil.</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> Really evens out scars and marks on the skin.</li>
            <li> Absorbs really well and makes my skin feel really moisterzied,I still don&#x27;t know if it helped with stretch marks</li>
            <li> but that didn&#x27;t seem to really affect the treatment of my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants their stretch marks faded fairly fast.</li>
            <li> It is a very oily product but it compliments my face well and keeps it from drying.</li>
            <li> We bought and discovered it is really in a class by itself.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing yet not greasy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> They protrude just as much, no difference in that.</li>
            <li> Doesnt feel so much greasy as it does creamy.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> and it is much cheaper</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> fast thank</li>
            <li> i didnt see much difference in my scars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the whole bottle</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind so much and</li>
            <li> They are absolute too oily for summer.</li>
            <li> My homemade makeup goes on much smoother with this under it, too.</li>
            <li> For the price nowhere near worth it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a month and my scars have already lightened and started to smooth out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> stretch marks, so i really think that moisturizing has spared my stomach.</li>
            <li> However, I must mention that I saw the most improvement after using the oil in conjunction with the dermaroller, but that has so far only been one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am prone to stretch marks and have several old ones from being overweight for most of my life.  </li>
            <li> results are slow but good</li>
            <li> Having used about half of the bottle attempting to make various appliances around the house work, there wasn&#x27;t a full use left of the bottle, but I was able to use the rest of it on my face, and to my surprise, it worked a lot better there.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay wet long and therefore is great for quick massages where I need to put her clothes back on.</li>
            <li> It absorbs pretty quickly, has a nice, light scent and moisturizes like crazy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, after a month and a half of use I could probably head back to the Walmart to return this thing because it still looks full to the brim</li>
            <li> Speaking on her behalf, I would say this seems work but very slowly and very effectively.</li>
            <li> I am currently 7 1/2 months pregnant, and am willing to try anything to keep stretch marks away.</li>
            <li> I started ordering this when I first got pregnant with my 2nd child.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this oil when I was pregnant with my first and now using it again with my second.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and added perk-my skin is so freaking soft right now.</li>
            <li> It did feel a little greasy at first, but I just had to make sure I didn&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed that it makes my skin very very soft.</li>
            <li> In the meantime, I&#x27;m rolling with Mother&#x27;s Special Blend All Natural Toning Oil, straight coconut oil, and natural cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure that was due to a variety of reasons.</li>
            <li> Stretchmarks get a more even tone due to the moisture but it doesn&#x27;t diminish the appearance to a noticeable degree.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with many products and this is very gentle.</li>
            <li> My expectations were probably too high to begin with, but this product really didn&#x27;t do much for me.  </li>
            <li> , my whole body has a glow almost, very nice, I only rated four stars because it consumes allot of time applying it to your entire body and letting it dry</li>
            <li> If you buy it, particularly if you are pregnant, please be aware that this product contains the following ingredients that are rated as high hazards by EWG: fragrance, retinyl palmitate, amylcinnamaldehyde, benzyl salicylate, geraniol, hydroxycitronellal, eugenol and coumarin.</li>
            <li> I had to admit that  I&#x27;ve tried almost every (positively reviewed) product to lessen the stretch (beauty) marks I got after having two precious little ones.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to notice any significant improvement in those areas, but I remain highly hopeful as it&#x27;s only been a couple of days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read other reviews that many though the price is too high.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is super oily and greasy; no matter how much I tried to rub it into my skin it still just felt yucky and oily even hours later.</li>
            <li> I have old but light stretch marks between my thighs &amp; on my muffin top from gaining/losing weight, &amp; also a very unattractive dark shade inbetween my inner thighs from skin friction.</li>
            <li> Now they&#x27;re dark in color and more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that the first ingredient is mineral oil.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me following bilateral full knee replacement surgery</li>
            <li> I am lazy, and it honestly took me quite a while to rub in the oil--probably about 30 minutes, which I didn&#x27;t have the patience for.</li>
            <li> Not only does my husband daily tell my how much he loves how my face smells, I love how it does not make my face oily at any point in the day.  </li>
            <li> the dark spots on my skin are mostly faded.  </li>
            <li> Within the first two weeks I noticed that some of my stretch marks were completely fading.  </li>
            <li> and now I have more dark spots</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if it works to be honest.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark while I was pregnant!</li>
            <li> compared to all the other $200 plus stuff out there! :)</li>
            <li> new thing i was using!</li>
            <li> I have very fair, sensitive skin and was skeptical about trying something new due to the fact that I am allergic to many products.</li>
            <li> I applied this on top and underneath my nails and on my cuticles and massaged it in several times over the next two days then went back to Walgreens to purchase a full 2 oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> been using for 5 months now and still doesnt see much improvement in my new scar.</li>
            <li> I live on the east coast and my skin really struggles in our winter season here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t spill out, and it&#x27;s not too oily as I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel any more hydrated than previously; I feel like I should be using a moisturizer as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is particularly helpful for traveling since I can travel with one product instead of an array of creams.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would&#x27;ve done differently is use it more onmy thighs, hips, and breasts.</li>
            <li> Started using this beginning of the 2nd trimester and now 9 months pregnant</li>
            <li> Maybe the acne.org stuff dried out my skin so much that it started producing more oils than normal?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the darker and older ones I use bio oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product religiously since 3 months pregnant &amp; have just finished the bottle after 3 months of use often twice/day.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and in my 3rd trimester and have been using this since the beginning of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> The most obvious (and embarrassing) of the demon craters litter my upper arms, stomach, and breasts</li>
            <li> I am currently 26 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li> Better safe than sorry</li>
            <li> but I.believe this is softening them and will aid in skin elasticity coming back quickly after baby.</li>
            <li> but that might be because he got older</li>
            <li> Use this stuff with my 1st pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get stretch marks... Trying again for second pregnant.</li>
            <li> I have only gained 25 lbs, and jot quickly, so</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and found that this oil had the best reviews and testimonials; I didn&#x27;t think it was that expensive (especially considering the posited outcome), so I bought a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use bio oil all the time now that I&#x27;m pregnant with my second child!</li>
            <li> She is pregnant and she started complain that her belly was itching at the beginning of the second trimester.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about 4 mo pregnant when I got it, and I used it daily in the mornings.</li>
            <li> LOVE this for scars and daily face oil and will never go back to anything else!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> but I really believe this oil is helping my nails look better, even the supposedly dead nail plate.  </li>
            <li> Especially since they tell you to use it while pregnant.</li>
            <li> In the morning, my face is vibrant and plumped up from the oil, without any greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am on my 3rd bottle and 7.5 months pregnant.</li>
            <li> and my face is healing and on its way to normalcy again, and i gladly switched back to just using my regular trader joe&#x27;s moisturizer(which</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks, almost daily and already some on my legs have already turned into super skinny, skin tone lines that you would have to look for (or know where they were) to find.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m 9mo pregnant and have been using this since the beginning and only have stretch marks on my hips.</li>
            <li> If I feel super full after a meal and feel my skin stretching, I will apply a little oil and my skin is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this oil if not only to help with your skins elasticity, but to help you skin feel extremely soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This was originally available as a limited item at Costco.</li>
            <li> They have not completely disappeared and I don&#x27;t expect that to be the results, but they definitely look a whole lot better.  </li>
            <li> Even on the very old stretch marks!</li>
            <li> Really like what I am seeing, SO FAR!</li>
            <li> I have been using this after a light layer of cortisone and seen a slight difference the first week for my peeling eczema.</li>
            <li> I was sixteen years old at the time, and I was growing too fast for my skin to handle, so I ended up getting stretch marks from the top of my thigh to a bit over half-way down.</li>
            <li> It helps moisturize my dry skin better, reduce acne scars, and improve general complexion/tone of my skin.</li>
            <li> I like this particularly for my neck which is more sensitive than my face and some other products</li>
            <li> I would recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had plenty of scarring from acme (that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll say on that), so I had plenty of high hopes for this.</li>
            <li> I probably bought it having too high of expectations.  </li>
            <li> Its&#x27;s high up on the list.</li>
            <li> For scars, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> No problem during the using, highly recommand.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> we hIghly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My skin got really itchy while pregnant and using this definitely helped and made my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> to all the research I did, I&#x27;ve chosen to switch to natural and 100% pure oils.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has clearly started working for me- someone who has visible surgery marks ( not even just stretch marks ), so I am certain it will definetely help you too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I thought it would do a little better of a job at keeping my strech marks on the lighter side.  </li>
            <li> If I had only known about it for my first pregnancy!</li>
            <li> I just took a chance with this, because the ingredients didn&#x27;t indicate anything that would be a danger to my little man, so, if your vet &#x27;ok&#x27;s&#x27; it for use</li>
            <li> I just took a chance with this, because the ingredients didn&#x27;t indicate anything that would be a danger to my little man, so, if your vet &#x27;ok&#x27;s&#x27; it for use</li>
            <li> Works good especially for little scars!</li>
            <li> pretty large bottle that I think will last for years and years.</li>
            <li> and I am proud to say my white, silvery stretch marks are almost all gone and my dark red ones are a light pink color so they are fading!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first body oil I&#x27;ve ever used, but other pregnant ladies recommended it.  </li>
            <li> Especially since my further research on the particular brand of Bio-Oil does not contain any of the TRUE &amp;#34;key&amp;#34; ingredient - Purcellin Oil - that is need for healing!  </li>
            <li> It really makes my skin soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> Very nice...lightweight and soft fragrance.</li>
            <li> As far as helping with scars, not so much.  </li>
            <li> I developed a heat rash and it works very well on keeping my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to go the all natural route.</li>
            <li> and my daughter is 3 months does absolutely nothing but moisturize and make the skin soft.  </li>
            <li> I get acne scars and somewhat blotchy scars that are much darker like scabs when mosquitos bite me because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It really helps soften and clear my skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much difference with the stretch marks yet, but it does make the skin soft.</li>
            <li> but she said it really worked for her stretch marks and they were damn near invisible.</li>
            <li> I had nothing to lose and I was really getting self conscious about my skin, so I brought it.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised, and I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to fade their scars, stretchmarks, etc.</li>
            <li> It is working really well so far</li>
            <li> i plan on using it after baby too as i really really like how soft it has made my skin.</li>
            <li> They need to declare that this product only works on fresh scars and stretch marks.</li>
            <li> So, I was not looking forward to never having a normal tummy again.</li>
            <li> not crazy about the smell though, so I only use it at night.</li>
            <li> I look forward to close to normal skin after 90 days of using it.</li>
            <li> I will follow up in a few months to give a better review based on the results I see.</li>
            <li> The only product in the past that helped in the slightest was the dermaroller, but my results were fairly minuscule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would work better if I could remember to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> night wash your face or body with your normal regiment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled to find a good moisturizer in the past and I&#x27;ve finally found one with Bio-Oil.</li>
            <li> It totally gets absorbed in my skin, when I use it on my face, and my skin has a glowing effect, without being greasy or anything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a bunch of big chemically words that I can&#x27;t read, and I certainly don&#x27;t feel safe putting them on my stomach with my baby on the other side of my skin.  </li>
            <li> but I just wanted more oil for my skin that was starting to get dry as I age.  </li>
            <li> Reduce dark spot:  Not as significant as I would like, but the dark spots are not as prominent.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t got a single stretch marks, and it kept my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> right in the middle.  </li>
            <li> Compared to my right one, my left knee is like new-bore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant &amp; have been using the oil for a month.&lt;br /&gt;Feels lightweight &amp; keeps my tummy moisturized for a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And for those tired feet after a long day at work, I ask my man to use this on my feet...feels soo good!</li>
            <li> LOVES this stuff, seriously works wonders :) Smells pretty and makes my skin</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li> and i wanted to by a product to provent new strech marks and fade away my resent ones...</li>
            <li> and I didnt notice any new ones either.</li>
            <li> If it helps, I had new stretch marks that were red/purplish.</li>
            <li> I used up a 4.2oz bottle within 3 months, and just purchased a new one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I cant live without bio oil.</li>
            <li> I now use it on new handbags and boots before I wear them and apply again two or three times a year.  </li>
            <li> and I still don&#x27;t have a new stretch mark.</li>
            <li> If I get any new stretch marks I will update my review.</li>
            <li> I receieved the box sealed and brand new.</li>
            <li> and I feel like I see a new stretch mark every couple of weeks these days, despite using the bio oil as directed.</li>
            <li> but I u have learned to live with them.</li>
            <li> started using this only 5 days ago, but I thought my early impressions were worth noting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious as to whether many of these reviews are fabricated by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I am sure it is not legal to sell personal products like this with an unsealed cap.</li>
            <li> I just received my Order which is more than 10 days later than the expected delivery date.  </li>
            <li> The oil feels nice on my skin, but I really looks like my stretchmarks have gotten worse.  </li>
            <li> I highly suggest applying this oil as directed because it will clear and prevent new marks.</li>
            <li> Left hand is SO smooth and soft with younger appearance and right hand has larger, deeper lines of aging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes a while to absorb into the skin, but once it does it leaves it very soft.</li>
            <li> Might I add, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> goes on oily but soaks in makes my skin feel very soft</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It does keep my skin on my belly very soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This has def helped to lighten many fresh scars, but does not really impact or make a make a difference on existing scars that have been there for a long time or scars from deep cuts either.</li>
            <li> (I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> But my my stomach has a very old surgery scar</li>
            <li> It is significantly more expensive than Palmer ( the other brand I tried) but the smell of Palmer was super strong and neither me or my husband could stand it</li>
            <li> After using this daily during my second trimester I found out that it’s full of chemicals, and rated 8 (high concern) by the environmental working group (EWG) database.</li>
            <li> (I will clearly be repurchasing here instead)!</li>
            <li> and I never knew that my skin could be this clear!</li>
            <li> I just bought a larger bottle so that I can use it even more liberally on other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> It was sent on time, but because of the fragance-I am allergic to most -I was not able to use it, but</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s completely safe to use for stretch marks.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks first turn red then lighten.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 12 years after my first child and all my stretch marks were white and somewhat faded.</li>
            <li> I have ordered many times in the past.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it could help my skin if all it does is sit on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its a small light weight bottle, I even carry it in my purse!</li>
            <li> The two oils are pretty similar to one another</li>
            <li> But it makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> Have been using the oil to prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy since the middle of my first trimester.  </li>
            <li> but they are almost completely gone!</li>
            <li> It helped prevent stretch marks from my second baby and fade the ones from my first.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying silicone scar patches that were more expensive, but had a lot more results to show after only 1 month.</li>
            <li> Just a couple of drops and my face immediately felt soft and supple!  </li>
            <li> The itching has nearly completely resolved and I have not one stretch mark!</li>
            <li> I went through two bottles my first pregnancy and am on track for the same this time around also.</li>
            <li> Second time I used my bio oil was when I burned my wrist and hand with hot oil when cooking.</li>
            <li> As far as shipping - I got my bio oil within a week of my purchase!</li>
            <li> just yesterday (my first use since last summer).</li>
            <li> I used this twice a day with my first child and am using it again with my second.  </li>
            <li> The first time I discovered bio-oil was at a local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 38 weekspregnant and tried different creams,butters, and oils at first until I decided to try the bio-oil.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only oily when you first lather it on, but it keeps you moisturized all day.  </li>
            <li> only once day or every other day along with Palmer&#x27;s coco butter, which my skins seems to agree with better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle and will most likely be on my 3rd soon</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I have noticed that my skin looks better-softer, smoother, &#x27;glowing&#x27;...the stretch marks (which are 9 years old!)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for the past 3 weeks and my skin looks and feel better.</li>
            <li> The only downside perhaps is that it leaves the skin oily when first applied</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> This is actually not the first time I&#x27;ved used bio-oil.</li>
            <li> not one stretch mark and has helped in fading my old growth spurt and stretch marks!</li>
            <li> and yes it is a bit greasy, it is an oil after all, but if you use just a little and give it time to absorb you can easily use it under make up.</li>
            <li> it smells a little strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try due to the high ratings and a recommendation from a friend and by using it for two weeks, I&#x27;m seeing tremendous improvement.</li>
            <li> the only active ingredient most tube scar creams had was sunblock.  </li>
            <li> new and old scars - surprised cosmetic surgeons haven&#x27;t put this in fancy packaging and sold it for 10 x the price!</li>
            <li> If you have scars you want to eliminate, and you want a safe, skin-friendly way to do that, I highly recommend using this 2 x&#x27;s a day for at least 3 months</li>
            <li> I used on the top of left hand and not right.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how fast it works and even though I still have a few they have lightened in color and size significantly</li>
            <li> I now have new marks on my skin and decided to give my old friend a try once again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my old stretchmarks fading and have maybe one or two new ones.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my stretch marks slightly dissapear and it also made my skin very very smooth i wish it was bigger</li>
            <li> I am currently 8 months pregnant with my 3rd child and decided to use Bio Oil as prevention and erasing of any new stretch marks.</li>
            <li> This was my first bad experience with Amazon after years of great service.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in how light my stretch marks look from my previous pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the bio oil in hopes of allot more results in combination with my daily routine of skin creams, bronzer and what not, I recommend it to anyone who reads this, it&#x27;s worth a shot to try it, seriously, added bonus, I put it on my face while applying it</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother, feels more even and my Stretch marks are disappearing ( not sure about  old ones....</li>
            <li> It seems like my stomach gets a new stretch mark everyday, my breasts have stretch marks, and I just don&#x27;t enjoy having that on my body.</li>
            <li> But after comparing my before-and-after photos (I was skeptical before I had started as to whether or not the bio-oil would really work), I saw evidence that confirmed what I had already learned over those two months--this oil is black magic!</li>
            <li> Great for tired, dry skin on the face and preventing wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have dry itchy skin, it&#x27;s so helpful during winter and light enough for summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently 8 months pregnant and have no stretch marks and only use at night.</li>
            <li> I am currently 5/6 months pregnant with my second child and use this along with a lotion based product for stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> currently 8 months pregnant with my second child.</li>
            <li> The heels of my feet get dry and cracked and this clears it right up.</li>
            <li> Plus, I am now having dry skin and my skin just soaks it right up.</li>
            <li> I bought more of the Bio-oil from Amazon for other scars that have been around for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Using it for two months on a large scar I recently acquired through a car accident.</li>
            <li> i notice that not only did i not see any changes but new stretch marks appeared!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my scars, but I break out a little bit if I use it every night.</li>
            <li> right above my existing marks were new red ones!!</li>
            <li> I use it on my face to even out my skin tone and hydrate my skin (which it does both amazingly), I use it on my rashes and eczema due to having OVERLY sensitive skin (as long as it&#x27;s not an open rash from scratching -shame on me-)</li>
            <li> The only product that truely keeps my skin moisturized up in dry climate that I live in.</li>
            <li> I also began using it on other blemishes and marks on my legs and arms ALL fading tremendously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am glad I can order it from Amazon because it can be hard to locate in stores.</li>
            <li> I love the oil, never had any brake out, it is really lifting away the brwon spots but very slowly, you got be patient and put on your face 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> I searched many reviews of many products, but I never came across a bad review for the Bio Oil.</li>
            <li> and i see clearly the difference on her skin before and now</li>
            <li> It is too early to tell of the final results, but I really like how it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> basically, after my baby is in the clear, I&#x27;ll try this for any lingering marks.  </li>
            <li> It also helped clear up the spots on my face.</li>
            <li> didnt notice that much of a difference in reducing stretch marks but left skin feeling soft</li>
            <li> it makes my skin soft</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for old  stretch marks.</li>
            <li> so I like the product thus far.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working as far as evening out the colours</li>
            <li> Been using this for a month so far</li>
            <li> I have been using the product twice a day in the morning and at night and so far it has worked.</li>
            <li> and I really appreciate the larger bottle and price.  </li>
            <li> After 2 months of continuous usage on my face as a moisturizer, it helped fade old acne scarring.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin feeling soft plus it gives an even tone with prolong use</li>
            <li> However, this order took 2 weeks to arrive, was surprised by this.</li>
            <li> but it made my skin soft</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and am already seeing results.</li>
            <li> I am 18 weeks and have not seen any stretch marks so far</li>
            <li> but i haven&#x27;t had ANY itching so far</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft after I use it.  </li>
            <li> The second week, my makeup glides on much easier without the cakekiness.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and not itchy at all.  </li>
            <li> though, so it&#x27;s not wasted.</li>
            <li> I do however have a problem with my skin tone being uneven and this product fit the bill.</li>
            <li> So far it is preventing any stretch marks on my stomach.</li>
            <li> It has made my stretch marks nearly vanish.</li>
            <li> acne scars on my back are on their way to vanishing, and as for the stretchmarks on my thighs, I await promising results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a month straight of constant break outs.</li>
            <li> I will likely have to re-stock very soon.</li>
            <li> So far I have not noticed any difference on my body - I have been using it for 2 months now.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter uses this to moisturize her faces.  </li>
            <li> Its recommended to apply 2-3 times a day early on in your pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be starting to use it more regularly and earlier with my next baby.</li>
            <li> Been using It for a month now and haven&#x27;t change the appearance of my scars so far.</li>
            <li> I think it has also improved the appearance of decades old severe stretchmarks on my abdomen skin.</li>
            <li> #34;how will this get rid of old scares?&amp;#34; All I can say is it does.</li>
            <li> I am 15 years old</li>
            <li> just my skin healing naturally healing or the oil.</li>
            <li> Please it makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> My friend got attacked by a wild cat and had to go to emergency.</li>
            <li> It also can make my skin soft and stay hydrated.</li>
            <li> Used it for months and so far I haven&#x27;t got any scretch yet</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I admit I have a sensitive skin but did not expect itchiness or intermittent &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; sensation in each and every body part the oil was applied on.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin approves.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nearly gone.</li>
            <li> My scars were within 7 months old.</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t completely go away.</li>
            <li> but no where near as noticeable as before.</li>
            <li> so it appears to work well so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 20 years old</li>
            <li> and so far haven&#x27;t gotten any.  </li>
            <li> it makes my skin soft and lighter.</li>
            <li> (I did have old ones on my hips from puberty)</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil because my belly was starting to really itch at about 16 weeks into my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> So Soft</li>
            <li> and I agree completely.</li>
            <li> I had several areas of melasma that were very pronounced.</li>
            <li> I dont hve sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very oily and you must use a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> it soft the skin every day,  </li>
            <li> but it really makes your face brighter looking and younger.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product because it is natural and shows results.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> No itching or stretch marks so far.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> My son is 2 months old, and I still use it on my stomach every day.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> but anything wow~</li>
            <li> But I guess it takes longer time to get natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> She used it after her bat and made her skin feel silky soft.</li>
            <li> Then i found my old bottle of bio oil.</li>
            <li> but it smells like cloves and old women.</li>
            <li> I might even go as far as to say that this is a life changer.</li>
            <li> Old scars I&#x27;ve had for years are beginning to lighten, too.</li>
            <li> Works well so far for applying to scar tissue.</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old &amp; have used Bio Oil on my face for about 10 years now.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> While it does leave my skin soft, it has not improved my stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> After three days of using this they were completely gone.  </li>
            <li> There was no noticable difference as far as skin improvement goes.</li>
            <li> Started using when my scars were 7weeks old.</li>
            <li> Using with silicone scar sheets for 24hr action</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this from my local enabler at the cosmetic counter at Walgreens (thanks, MJ) who helps to feed my nail polish addiction.  </li>
            <li> You might be pleasantly surprised at the results.</li>
            <li> , I thought I smelled a bit like an old lady.</li>
            <li> I feel it may cause breakouts, but I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I have old stretch marks in my hips from puberty -</li>
            <li> This is 5 natural oils, no chemicals, and</li>
            <li> as far as moisturizing, healing and improving your skin condition - IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> Some of the natural oils also help scarring, but so far, the Bio Oil works faster for scars.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone suffering from self conscious scarring looking for an answer to clearing up their skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft...</li>
            <li> It restores old leather, enhances the shine, and seems to prevent cracking.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is now 7 weeks old.</li>
            <li> this may have not kept the stretch marks away completely</li>
            <li> I bought it for help with 10+ year old stretch marks form puberty.</li>
            <li> People have been using natural oils for thousands of years</li>
            <li> The key is not to use too much because it can have a reverse drying effect if you do.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so considerably lighter that some areas doesn&#x27;t even look like I have stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I am also applying this to old scars and they are fading.</li>
            <li> You can still see the stretch marks, but at least it&#x27;s not as prominent as before.</li>
            <li> but have found much cheaper options that do the same things.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too bothered by the linear incisions because they were out of the way, but the big X was very upsetting.</li>
            <li> For me, it took a long time to notice results, and by then I was almost out of my first bottle</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t worked fantastically yet but who knows if there is a product that does completely heal scars?</li>
            <li> I bought this oil because I&#x27;m in early stages of pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the item was old</li>
            <li> It helps to keep your skin moist and soft.</li>
            <li> So far no stretch marks on my growing belly...</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not too greasy and so far</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product until my stretch marks are completely faded even if I have to by another bottle.</li>
            <li> I like it so far.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m usually sensitive.</li>
            <li> For those that have acne marks or hyperpigmentation, this helps to fade them and leave yoir skin with its natural undertone glow.</li>
            <li> I used my entire pregnancy by the directions as to how much to apply and how often to apply.  </li>
            <li> This was my least favorite product of all of the stretch mark prevention oils/creams I used during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is soft afterward, but I don&#x27;t expect to see a difference in texture.</li>
            <li> It will not make deep scars go away, but it really does soften them.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper here than obtaining locally.</li>
            <li> I started using this for about a week and as far as  my skin tone goes (face) - it is already fairer and almost even now.</li>
            <li> It is removing my old scars, tone my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, time lines are softer too.</li>
            <li> Before I was so self conscious even around my boyfriend to show my tummy</li>
            <li> I have tried many products, to try to at least demish them, nothing has work.</li>
            <li> I started using the product when she was about 2  months old.</li>
            <li> I have a six month old daughter and NO stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Baby Natural Stretch Oil</li>
            <li> a non-preg note, my skin has become sooo soft where i&#x27;ve been using it, i started using it on my legs after shaving and before going out with skirts or shorts.&lt;br /&gt;there</li>
            <li> Two linear ones under my arm and towards my back, and a big X right on my side (where a camera went.)</li>
            <li> I used bio oil and after almost a month the small scars are completely gone and the big darker ones have become very light.</li>
            <li> I was using it on my face to help with it being pretty dry during the winter months.</li>
            <li> Went from a gross brown to a light pink!</li>
            <li> Also, my stomach shrunk back to almost normal size and elasticity within the first 2 to 3 wks after my c-section, not sure if bio oil played a part but its definitely worth using this product.</li>
            <li> The skin on my face is clearer, and less dry. :)</li>
            <li> It makes my skin look so clear and vibrant and some of my tiny frown lines are diminished.</li>
            <li> I have heard that your stomach can get itchy when pregnant due to dryness, but not with this oil!</li>
            <li> I am writing this review only two weeks after starting this product so it may not be as accurate as if I was using this long term as the product states, but it definitley makes my skin feel softer.</li>
            <li> the scars from even my first pimples have even remained and i finally decided to try this product and it said that i would see improvement in 3 months and it has only been 1 week and the scars are almost completely faded.</li>
            <li> If by this time next year I still have no results then I will knock those 3 stars down to a big fat zero :)</li>
            <li> had a huge, dry, red rash on the back of my knee</li>
            <li> Retinol cream is something I&#x27;ve used in the past for fine lines around my eyes for instance; [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> My marks were gone really quickly, probably after using about a bottle and a half of this.</li>
            <li> Also acne and pimples were never a big problem for me, but I have noticed that when I use this product consistently I don&#x27;t get even the occasional ones.</li>
            <li> keep this short, I will be using this regularly and would absolutely recommend without hesitation!</li>
            <li> It looked exactly the same 3 months later.</li>
            <li> I am not entirely sure, but I am guessing that they became more visible when blood flow increased around my thighs such as while running and</li>
            <li> Although I finally found a face lotion I love, it is almost $100 for a small container, so one day I thought, why not try the bio-oil?  </li>
            <li> I got stretch marks from my pregnancy, mainly around the back of my knees and thighs.</li>
            <li> I also think that the scent doesn&#x27;t last long once it&#x27;s absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li> then most of the moisturizers on the market and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I use it on my cellulite and it really takes it down, and I use it on any redness or blemishes I see absolutely anywhere.</li>
            <li> The stretch marks on both of my arms end right at the antecubital fossa (aka the other side of your elbow for all you non-a&amp;p nerds).</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, not only for scars but for surgical site healing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend prior to applying lotions.</li>
            <li> She told me that the nurses in the hospital told her about Bio Oil and highly recommend it to patients who are left with scars after receiving surgery.  </li>
            <li> before getting pregnant and knowing that I had developed stretch marks in the past I was worried about creating new ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using Bio-Oil to fade both new and old stretch marks, and it definitely has had a noticeable effect.</li>
            <li> After 3 months there is barely any trace of a scar!!</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, the fine lines are gone, the deeper lines that went across my forehead like crevices are down to short, barely noticeable lines and</li>
            <li> Make sure that the area is dry before putting clothing on, otherwise you will stain your clothing (similar to any other oil stain).</li>
            <li> It was ok it absorbed well, but is something you have to do everyday for at least a year.</li>
            <li> If you have small &amp; light ones like mine you may get results faster.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough for my sensitive and acne prone facial skin and does not appear to cause any breakouts after applied.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> But when i try this i noticed my stretch marks is not dark than before.</li>
            <li> I spent over $400 buying this over the months and used it consistently...</li>
            <li> I WAS HOPING YO SEE FAST RESULTS, BUT IT DOES WORK WELL ON CERTAIN TYPES OF UNEVEN SKIN TONE</li>
            <li> ive been rubbing it in to my neck and breastbone as well, sometimes my a little on my face, and ive seen HUGE improvements in the texture, color and overall appearance of my skin tone...</li>
            <li> First let me say that I am very prone to stretch marks, having them on my hips from puberty growth spurt and previous weight gain as a teen.</li>
            <li> Other products, like Kiels etc, are great but feel a bit thick and heavy, particularly as it gets warmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been about a month, will update if I see any new changes</li>
            <li> New stretch marks have came back as a result of me stopping usage</li>
            <li> It did NOT help with the existing stretch marks but definitely prevented new ones.</li>
            <li> I use to live in southern cali and even tho I always spfd, I have noticed just living there for 5 years</li>
            <li> My stretch marks were relatively new still red.</li>
            <li> However, after using it for a week, not only did it not reduce any acne scars, but the oil clogged my pores and caused 7 new acne to form on my cheeks and nose.</li>
            <li> Really help on my dry skin around elbows and knees.  </li>
            <li> third time using it and noticed that my recent scar from over 3 months ago is starting to become less noticeable :)</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m in my last trimester of pregnancy, I am using bio-oil 2-3 times a day to help avoid/reduce (if at all possible) the much dreaded stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I only apply it ones a day and it give my skin that extra moisture it needs for the whole day...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this at a local drugstore only to find it on Amazon for much cheaper</li>
            <li> I has made the marks less distinct over time.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen any major color correction.</li>
            <li> I am trying it as an after peel oil for the first time for comparison to other oils.</li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side, leaves your face extremely greasy</li>
            <li> And I barely see any scars now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had really dry skin this past winter and the oil works a lot better than any of the lotions I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
            <li> I am Black with a dark complexion, so maybe it just works better on lighter skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They worked okay, they really dried out my skin and would ball up if I tried to use sunscreen or other serums with it.</li>
            <li> This product is decent and is taking a long time to heal my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my darker skin due to shaving and I noticed a good difference with lightning and keeping my skin from irritating and getting darker if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> I am done with the large size bottle and there is absolutely no difference in the scarring.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was a little cheaper considering how often I use it, but the product is worth it.</li>
            <li> Slow and steady wins the race,</li>
            <li> I have seen such a positive change in my dry skin and it has also helped with the itching.</li>
            <li> It came highly recommended by several friends in the medical field.</li>
            <li> but I had wondered out loud if it would do some good for my nails, which can be very dry, have lots of ridges and basically look pretty bad without polish.  </li>
            <li> I took some bad advice from a couple tall, long torso ladies about stretch marks not being a real problem unless you have multiples and any old moisturizer will keep your belly looking good.</li>
            <li> Results also depend on the age of your stretch marks, your genes, how you take care of your skin and health in general, etc.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t wear make up</li>
            <li> but if you take before and after pictures it clearly does, especially for darker skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try to clear up two pimples on my face that no matter what they would just keep breaking open and not heal.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t use the oil long enough to see my result</li>
            <li> Been using it last 4 month and no strech marks so far.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see a ssignificant change the next morning...</li>
            <li> Noticable improvements in old stretch marks, scars and facial wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> and I started to develop strech marks on my inner thighs and breast area ( non on my stomach so far...</li>
            <li> Yup, apparently that&#x27;s a thing.</li>
            <li> 3 stars only because it&#x27;s too early to tell if it works for intended purpose.</li>
            <li> After awhile you could barely see them anymore.</li>
            <li> I used it on a surgical scar, and it is now barely visible.  </li>
            <li> My baby is 4 months now and you can barely see my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I started using this early in my second trimester to avoid stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> I bought this not really expecting a whole lot</li>
            <li> It definitely helps in preventing stretch marks and fading away old marks.</li>
            <li> ive been using this since the beginning of my 2nd trimester and so far no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Someone at Walgreen&#x27;s recommended this product to me early in my pregnancy back in 2009.</li>
            <li> As a young mother, I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> In which the surgeon needed to open a 33 year old C-Section scar.</li>
            <li> Some spots are completely removed and overall the redness is quite suppressed.</li>
            <li> Conclusion, I would save my money and buy something at an Apothecary or natural pharmacy next time.</li>
            <li> Some type of surgery (ranging from laser to micro-dermabrasion) is the only method of completely removing the stretch marks anyway.</li>
            <li> Well apparently I can&#x27;t use it on my body either..</li>
            <li> I use it on my feet to keep calluses away, I use it on my inner thighs and it completely changed the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> So far it has not clogged my pores and left pimples or anything,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a month, but I can already tell a difference in the appearance of my old surgery scar.</li>
            <li> I am 20 years old, had a baby back in March, and had a lot of stretch marks on my thighs.</li>
            <li> Tried it only twice so far.</li>
            <li> It barely helps.</li>
            <li> my face is more radian instead of the bluish looking when you are tired.  </li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t gotten better, but they haven&#x27;t gotten worse either, they sort of stopped in their tracks and seem to not know which way to go.</li>
            <li> I have tried literally 20-30 lotions over the past few years, from the cheap to the expensive, all seemed to have the same issue with starting off good in the first part of the day, but</li>
            <li> The consistency is light and liquidy, not the thick, nourishing oil texture I was wanting.</li>
            <li> My skin soaks it right up after a little while.</li>
            <li> The scent of it is a little odd, but not disgusting.</li>
            <li> Well as I was doing some stuff around the house I noticed that some of the skin was loose so instead of having all those dry skin flakes; I figured why not peal it off right now.</li>
            <li> Six weeks ago I had a large section of the end of my nose excised due to skin cancer.</li>
            <li> NOT A SINGLE STRETCH MARK with this product!</li>
            <li> Really saves my skin, especially in the dry winter months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled with this oil, but it has a pleasant, non-sweet smell and seems to at least temporarily nourish skin&lt;br /&gt;dry</li>
            <li> In terms of stretch marks, it really did not help with ones that I have, but that may be due to the fact that they are old, white stretch marks.</li>
            <li> you have the harsh red stretch marks I extremely recommend this product, it make your stretch marks look better.</li>
            <li> I went through a total of three bottles throughout the whole pregnancy - and I don&#x27;t have a single stretch mark.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m in my early 40s and have been using Bio Oil as a facial moisturizer (since I live in the southwest and its so dry).</li>
            <li> has tried other products, more and less expensive, and most caked her makeup.</li>
            <li> : When I first  used this I put it on half of my face</li>
            <li> , I have very light stretch marks in a few places that are stubborn and a few scars, one being on my forehead from a car accident that still had glass in it from three years ago</li>
            <li> but it goes a long way, for me the whole bottle will probably last about two months (with daily use and on a couple areas).</li>
            <li> Ive noticed if i wear a tight shirt to bed the oil is still there in the morning and that is exactly what i was looking for in a stretch mark product I want something that stays.</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t too bad and worth a try if you are looking for a beauty fix :)</li>
            <li> is one negative though, i have had to wear undershirts between my skin and my actual clothes to avoid staining them with oil, but i could have easily just used it at night only.</li>
            <li> this bottle is also so big I have used maybe a 1/2 inch of it so far at daily use on 3 places.</li>
            <li> By the time I had gone back to try and find amazon products to switch out for the third party items some of the items I had chosen were gone completely.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will help to prevent any stretch marks as my mother has some pretty deep and dark ones on her stomach and thighs.</li>
            <li> As expected, the product is very oily and actually stained some of my clothes.</li>
            <li> It may take regular application of this oil on the scars for may be a several months, before I completely see them disappear, but I can tell you it works.</li>
            <li> I figured since I was not a skinny girl to begin with that I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry as much (since I already had some extra fluff).</li>
            <li> I recently bought mustela double action.</li>
            <li> I have hideous dry patches on my face and not only were they irritating but kind of embarrassing because they looked so flakey.  </li>
            <li> It can be a little oily at first, until you rub it in.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any major scars to worry about, only one which was a cancer spot removed from my fore arm.  </li>
            <li> used it very long, but so far I like the way it makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li> I only had a few stretch marks on the right side of my tummy.</li>
            <li> ; so I will give it a few more weeks to see if there is any noticeable change in my skin texture, the little discolorations that are starting to appear on my face, or a reduction in wrinkles.</li>
            <li> only con is that the bottle is small and I use it up quickly.</li>
            <li> I used different products for these new, red stretch marks all over my legs, especially on the back of my knees and none of them gave me the results that this one did.</li>
            <li> the other reviews said, my face would clear up and I would have radiantly clear skin.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been  using for a month now and the dark marks are really fading away.  </li>
            <li> now you can barely notice them I only get 4 stars because they didn&#x27;t work on all parts of my body</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in the first few times I used it</li>
            <li> used 5 times a day everyday since first trimester.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for fresh 1st and 2nd degree burns that I acquired a few months back.  </li>
            <li> First few days you will feel it is working wonders.&lt;br /&gt;But, according to my experience it will cause uncountable number of pimples on pimples, neck , cheeks.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I was very incompetent in my application of the oil, as I skipped many days, even successively.</li>
            <li> I started using it in my 2nd trimester and not a single stretch mark yet!</li>
            <li> Given that there is NO evidence that stretch marks during pregnancy can be prevented by moisturizing the skin, I&#x27;ve steered well clear from Bio-Oil for the past couple of months and switched to pure coconut oil, which is working just as well.</li>
            <li> months in to pregnancy number two and not a single new scar, though one of the old ones is looking a little</li>
            <li> OK- first off, need to address a previous review that say this doesn&#x27;t work for wrinkles, age spots and that it is TOO expensive to use for these purposes.</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars because I feel this product could work wonders on dry &amp; scaly skin, wrinkles, small or light scars or deep pores.</li>
            <li> It softened the fine lines on my face a little bit, and made my skin slightly softer.</li>
            <li> It seemed a little crazy to use oil for my already oily skin, but my sister has beautiful skin and is a Bio-Oil user</li>
            <li> Got myself a first class ground beef belly after baby number one, discovered Bio Oil a little over a year later.</li>
            <li> you have to be careful, and only put a few drops at a time on, then work it it very well, if you put too much you can be greasy for</li>
            <li> I saw a huge difference in my skin and hardly got any stretch marks!</li>
            <li> This oil REALLY did lighten the darkness of the skin, &amp; made my stretch marks less noticeable when going out in a bikini.</li>
            <li> Help keep my face soft - I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Ii continue to order this because it keeps my dry skin moisturized and soft, without being greasy.</li>
            <li> As far as treating dry skin and some lines and wrinkles, can&#x27;t beat the Bel Essence though.  </li>
            <li> Once the product is absorbed, I found that it actually led to excessive itchiness.  </li>
            <li> became, like bold and thick.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate and Bio Oil has made such a difference improving the skin on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have used Bio Oil religiously twice a day for the past 4 months on fresh scars left by the removal of skin cancer.</li>
            <li> Well, one morning I did wake up to find two small red lines on the right underside of my belly.</li>
            <li> hey, it&#x27;s less than $20 with eligible free shipping when combined with other products and the bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> My first reaction was uneasiness due to the pink colour, thinking it may not be as \\&quot;natural\\&quot; as it claims.</li>
            <li> and the skin on my tummy (which was kinda loose) seems to be tightening as well, maybe because i&#x27;m doing alot of ab exercises of late to complement the smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I wish it didn&#x27;t smell quite so much and that the packaging was a little nicer.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Highly recommend for all types of skin issues scars dark spots</li>
            <li> although I was hoping for more, I thought it would make at least a little bit of a difference.</li>
            <li> I feel like it helped prepare skin to be capable of absorbing the very thick palmers cream.</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t really speak too negatively of this product as I don&#x27;t think any product would have completely prevented them.</li>
            <li> And it contains almost no pure natural oils.</li>
            <li> this product delivers but must use twice a day, can get expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it, once that kid pops out and your belly return to normal!</li>
            <li> Given, I haven&#x27;t been using this strictly as directed, which is my fault (this 4 month old keeps me busy!), but I only see a small difference.</li>
            <li> One for old acne scars and the other family member as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have some new stretch marks that WERE deep thick and dark brown (African American brown skin), my friend told me about Bio Oil ( not my first hearing about it)</li>
            <li> At the lovely young age of 12, I blew up to approximately the size of a small beluga whale in a relatively short period of time.</li>
            <li> As you can see, I&#x27;ve used barley any of this so far and holy cow it has already made such a HUGEEE difference.</li>
            <li> it does make your skin soft, but other than that i do not recommend this at all to lighten stretch marks, instead maybe to prevent your skin from stretching during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I used this at 16yr old after discovering stretch marks due to puberty.</li>
            <li> I am now going to use this all over my skin when my other bottle come and see how they do with old stretch marks.</li>
            <li> oil really replenishes moisture to my face and body and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> however it will work well if u use it with other products and natural masks..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using it due to being so busy all the time..</li>
            <li> Love using this for my skin during pregnancy, Unfortunately I have still gotten a ton of stretch marks but definitely makes skin slightly oily and soft.</li>
            <li> After about a month there is a noticable differance in the stretch marks and they actually feel far less deep than they did prior to use of the Bio-Oil and micro-needling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I applied to my stomach, sides and thighs after showering, and my previous stretch marks lightened, and new stretch marks were prevented.</li>
            <li> It is helping keep new marks from appearing and lessening the appearance of the ones she has from previous pregnancies.</li>
            <li> I credit the absence of stretch marks to Bio Oil!</li>
            <li> Gradually after a few months, friends and acquaintences would comment how pretty my skin was or how I aged</li>
            <li> Takes good care of the skin, no more expensive creams.</li>
            <li> (Also, I went about excessive with the oil in certain</li>
            <li> A little messy, but the oil dries out quick</li>
            <li> But if you want faster, more dramatic results, I reccomend splurging a bit, and doing some research on other remedies.</li>
            <li> Anytime i have strayed away from my usual moisturizer even trying natural oils, my chin will be the first to rage when it aint working out and that only takes a few hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen little changes in my previous stretchmarks and I am waiting for the results on new stretch marks, I haven&#x27;t noticed any new ones though.</li>
            <li> My only problem with this product is that since I live in Florida, the sun is really harsh</li>
            <li> Lastly, the product does not last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I suppose and with the 4.2 oz it will probably last a very very long time with moderate use.  </li>
            <li> After reading the back and seeing it could be used on dry skin i put it on my face and there was instant improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that Baby Oil or something similar wouldn&#x27;t work as well,&lt;br /&gt;though, especially given the fairly high price of this oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now using on my face to clear up dark spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is real or what.</li>
            <li> One bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> after last year&#x27;s usage), so that might go a long way</li>
            <li> IT LAST LONG ..</li>
            <li> I read before I bought this that you can&#x27;t fade white, silvery stretch marks as they have been there a long time.</li>
            <li> I know it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This does have a distinct scent but not overwhelming to a preggo&#x27;s extreme olfactory nerves.</li>
            <li> May have to use it as normal routine everyday to reduce the visibility of strechmark.</li>
            <li> The only major gripe I have about this is that my hands are really oily after I apply it; though its to be expected, but oils are always hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> and I got the linea nigra when I was pregnant too and those results are very very slow too.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about a week, but I can notice a very minor improvement</li>
            <li> The Bio Oil has helped my dry facial skin.</li>
            <li> It does help on my face though when my skin is extra dry.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy as heck to use, and it does NOT leave your skin feeling oily or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have used half the bottle so far</li>
            <li> On the next really dry day I have, I&#x27;m going to try rubbing it all over my body.</li>
            <li> I knew the itching was related to dry, stretching skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on pregancy stretch marks, keeping my dry feet moisterized, and now as an anti aging facial moisterizer at night.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be the only thing that helps my severely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> But maybe after a week of me washing my face with natural organic  black soap and then putting this bio oil on it moisturizes and gives me radiant glowing skin.</li>
            <li> Old stretch marks have less of appearance.</li>
            <li> A small amount really goes a long way.</li>
            <li> No new stretch marks yet with my 3rd pregnancy.</li>
            <li> She has been using now for a few weeks and loves it, plus her belly is very soft.</li>
            <li> Used this every single day in the last two trimesters of my pregnancy</li>
            <li> I never got a single stretch mark (was it only because I used bio-oil???</li>
            <li> , I use it on burns or sunburns and they literally disappear in days, I use it on my stretch marks from my now 2 year old son and they went from very noticeable, thick and ugly to me being very comfortable in shorts or a bikini  </li>
            <li> , bio oil, I honestly can say has reduced the scar on my face, several small pieces of glass have come out while rubbing the bio oil on my eyebrow, which my eyebrow also had a gap from the scar and has now grown back, the scar on my eyebrow has already reduced, stretch marks are not far from non-existent, have been using the bio oil for about a month now, haven&#x27;t even used half of the 4.2 bottle, already used the 1 something ounce bottle, my other scar from a burn has thinned, lightened and has seriously reduced in size.</li>
            <li> I have been using it alternating  with other much more expensive oils</li>
            <li> I had the other earlobe repaired a few years ago and wasn&#x27;t given the suggestion to use Bio-Oil that time, and I really wish I would have known about it--</li>
            <li> In addition, as a final parting note, I want to give a brief summary on my results to conclude this review: 1) I only used it for less than two months, even though the instructions say to use it for a minimum of three.</li>
            <li> It gets very dry during the winters and this oil is used daily.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it for the prevention of stretch marks, albeit I am not sure if it works well once you have stretch marks.</li>
            <li> So far I only have a few stretch marks on my sides from pregnancy and only use this about once every other day.  </li>
            <li> Like it so far, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Hard to know if it really makes a difference or not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After many years passed and many pounds lost, all I really want to do is find something, anything, to help these nasty little suckers fade.</li>
            <li> I mean I still have a large amount of stretch marks</li>
            <li> haha what a joke to say the least.</li>
            <li> so I really wanted to get rid of the scarring before it is too late.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any negative reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> At least does not work for me that much.</li>
            <li> not sure yet rubbing it on my scar so far it looks the same..</li>
            <li> I used this the day I got it on my face because of my uneven skin tone ( I&#x27;m biracial and often have red splotches or tan/un-tan differences) and I instantly saw results, my face appeared softer and no red spots!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking surgical scars, minor knife wounds, burns etc.</li>
            <li> This stuff is greasy and has made absolutely no change to my skin with regular use.</li>
            <li> I have considered wearing long sleeves all the time.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to buy as long as it is produced.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but for me it lasted a  long time.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I did not developed any reaction and haven&#x27;t seen any stretch marks yet.</li>
            <li> I was trying to spend almost 600.00 on my order and the extra 79.00 I had just spent</li>
            <li> I not really not work try later togther cocoa butter formula lotion stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and I used it with my pregnancy,</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s because I was on a really long road trip and my skin didn&#x27;t get the care it deserved over the 12 hour drive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right after i stopped everything came back to normal, so SPARE YOUR MONEY and look for&lt;br /&gt;something else because the side effects of all the oils this thing has are just not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and my skin is really soft and glowing.</li>
            <li> I injured my arm on a screw that was protruding from a piece of wood and had a long visible scar (about 1\\&quot;) after it healed.  </li>
            <li> It was not moisturizing at all but instead dried out my naturally oily skin.</li>
            <li> It just lasts long</li>
            <li> but when it arrived it was a lot bigger than I expected</li>
            <li> Used everyday, twice a day, for nearly 5 months, and there is no difference.</li>
            <li> how long its on your skin.  </li>
            <li> It soothed the itching of a tightly stretched belly.</li>
            <li> Because I know that scar products can take a LONG time to work.</li>
            <li> Bio Oil is the way to go after a few Aloe uses..now i use it on my hands to keep them soft and moisturized..</li>
            <li> I have seen improvement in the color of stretch marks but not a complete fade.</li>
            <li> I also had 2 spots that were from breaking out and because they were newer scars they completely disappeared in less than a month using this!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s any better than less expensive oils, but I will stick with this.  </li>
            <li> You couldn&#x27;t even tell there were blemishes beforehand, which is truly truly remarkable considering that I had started out using the oil when my marks were constantly a harsh, angry red (I couldn&#x27;t even wear gym shorts, because my stretch marks were so visible past the hem--which is another reason that prompted me to actively find a solution to &amp;#34;removing&amp;#34; them by using this oil).</li>
            <li> 5 weeks later, the scar is lighter, softer, less grainy and SMALLER!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the scar will ever fully go away, but after only a couple weeks of using it not super religiously, it has started to do away with the redness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been three days and my stretch marks appear to be visibly less red.</li>
            <li> I mean it is straight up oil</li>
            <li> I find no positive result as I am using last about one month.</li>
            <li> even a little tiny lighter .it happened after I have used this for 3 weeks twice daily ....</li>
            <li> the other I just recently got.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> After reading multiple reviews on both amazon and other sites I decided to order the product.</li>
            <li> It will be a part of my skin care regimen for a long time!</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m very mixed due to things I&#x27;ve read about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I see weekly improvement when i use it religiously and with other oils.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been scratching his back like mad-so a put a few drops of Bio-Oil (just a few!) and rubbed in into his skin/fur, really well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is due to twice daily use of bio-oil or genetics, but it can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> So they compliment each other well, now if only they did their job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been suffering for so long!</li>
            <li> However, be careful during the day not too put too much on your face, it will make you face oily for a while and make it hard to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> I have dry oil sentive skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone looking for a solution for scars, dry skin, and stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Also, let it dry for a couple minutes before putting a shirt on because it will leave a mark (that should come out in the wash).</li>
            <li> My arms aren&#x27;t so dry either.  </li>
            <li> Winter has made my skin so dry and chapped that it hurts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely dry on my face and neck, so this oil absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For scars as well as hair and dry skin</li>
            <li> Your face will not look dry or even matte, it will look GLOWING.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This might work for you if you have verrrryyyy dry skin.</li>
            <li> but then when my face got really dry from my Retin A and hydroquinone combo  </li>
            <li> and I still use it because my skin gets so dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> This helped get rid of dry patches on my skin.</li>
            <li> I also have really dry hands</li>
            <li> The skin felt like it was dry and trying to stretch every time I stood up.</li>
            <li> from winter indoor heat and dry air.  </li>
            <li> Also use this on my face and dry spots on body.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin problem and my face looks flaky after applying makeup.</li>
            <li> It is so soothing on dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin nosedived after pregnancy and was sooo dry.</li>
            <li> After giving up on the Cocoa butter from palmers I switched to Bio-Oil to save me from itchy and dry</li>
            <li> Cleared my dry patches and made my arms glow.</li>
            <li> I use Mederma at night and in the morning my skin is dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> It works so nicely on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Also using it on dry patches.</li>
            <li> I recommend to anyone with streatch marcs scars dry flaky skin to try this</li>
            <li> Only helps with uneven facial skin tone.</li>
            <li> can  not  live without  it</li>
            <li> I moved from high humidity areas to desert area, and my skin did not liked it.</li>
            <li> My wife did not get a single post pregnancy stretch mark.</li>
            <li> I do not have a single mark on my belly and the skin is not one bit crepe-like.</li>
            <li> Downfall, I can not wear deodorant when I apply the Bio Oil, and being summertime I&#x27;m limited to clothing, activities</li>
            <li> Whatever it was, I had my baby and did not have a single stretch mark.</li>
            <li> My skin feels moistened and soft with very little product used.</li>
            <li> It has certainly given me back my full confidence with my body image, as I am one of those people who absolutely hate scars, and I was always self-conscious about other people seeing me with those glaring streaks across my skin when I wanted to wear shorts while going out.</li>
            <li> This has completely moisturized his face and no more dry skin.</li>
            <li> I initially tried it on another dark mark to see how it would work.</li>
            <li> I can see the dark discoloration of where I have scratched and picked at blemishes that would have otherwise just gone away if I had left them alone.</li>
            <li> I ended up with dark brown patches of several sizes on my hand.</li>
            <li> I had four really dark red stretch marks on my stomach then</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and the oil is too greasy for me, but I can see how it would help someone with dry or very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a decent oil just not great for pregnancy.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so even this size bottle can last you quite some time.</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin started to get dry and tight after I took a shower, especially in the winter time.  </li>
            <li> Despite humidity below 20%, hot winds, and merciless sun, my skin stays moisturized the whole day.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind this won&#x27;t make your stretch marks disppear, only make it a lot less noticable.</li>
            <li> it usually takes about 2 weeks before you actually start seeing improvements and this is only for the lighter and newer ones.</li>
            <li> The ones in that area have already vastly improved in appearance, looking smaller, less crater-y and even less shiny.</li>
            <li> and i notice that they are less noticeable but not totally gone.</li>
            <li> You have to use this product religiously in order to get the results of less scars and/or stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bio-Oil nightly after my shower, and the marks are no longer red and are much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have about half of a bottle left and plan to use it all.</li>
            <li> But really, these marks probably came from my increase in height over the past few years.</li>
            <li> I started using this to target the stretch marks on my butt (like the typical &amp;#34;zebra-print&amp;#34;-like white lines</li>
            <li> Just made skin really wet for a couple of mins, and then went to dry again.</li>
            <li> With my previous 2 pregnancies, I started having stretch marks since the 20th week.</li>
            <li> , my first lasted a few months, and I used it at least 3x/week.</li>
            <li> post shaving as I have found that I am less likely to show razor burn or experience itching when I have used the product.</li>
            <li> we small family of 4 like the smell of this product , after using 1 week on my son&#x27;s 4-year old, his skin turned rough</li>
            <li> Actually, I&#x27;m not even half way through the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it on my face because I&#x27;ve been battling with dry skin and spots on my face due to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> My fiance has very dry skin and has started to use it as well</li>
            <li> but I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I work in a very dry environment and my skin loves this product.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I also like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this over very dry areas of skin to soften and moisture.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face every night (very dry skin)</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> is very dry.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t typically spend this much on oil, but I am not loving the stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> A few months later the skin on my face became extremely dry.</li>
            <li> i was expecting so much more after using this product for a few months, but unfortunately it let me down, no improvements in skin</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten a single stretch mark!</li>
            <li> I am 5 foot and gained 20 pounds, and didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark!</li>
            <li> i do recommend only using it at night and with a tight night shirt on that</li>
            <li> it left a pretty bad scar I still actually have some left and use it twice a day</li>
            <li> I thought it was a bit expensive when I bought it, but a little goes a LONG way and it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I started using this during my second trimester like the bottle suggested, but unfortunately I still got a few stretch marks at 8 1/2 months pregnant.</li>
            <li> The oil I think has actually helped a little with the stretch marks,</li>
            <li> They still look like just little red dots.</li>
            <li> I only used a little and</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit to work.</li>
            <li> I sometimes mix it with a little bit of regular body lotion to create an emulsion for lighter hydration or to change the scent.</li>
            <li> I only use a little so that it is not too oilly, but my skin is fully moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Big or little ones</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t smell bad and comes in a cute container</li>
            <li> Also, use it to shave your legs if you want skin that is crazy smooth.</li>
            <li> leave me with rough skin.  </li>
            <li> The price is a bit expensive, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I received my product faster than expected.</li>
            <li> However, I was not so religious about rubbing the oil into my breasts, and I did get a few lines there.</li>
            <li> I use it nearly everyday and this product actually works.</li>
            <li> Have used a bottle, but did not see any effect, others spent three years said that basically could not see stretch marks, so I choose to continue to use</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend to anyone who used to have a oil and uneven skin.</li>
            <li> Not really happy about this product, took the redness out of my stretch marks but havent really faded them.</li>
            <li> i have seen my stretch marks go from pink to even with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Delivered promptly as expected</li>
            <li> Not really a fan of the smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Bio Oil for a few days.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> However, the lid of the bio oil wasn&#x27;t properly closed and it spilled on the box.</li>
            <li> I used it for 3 months twice a day as directed and saw absolutely no improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every day for a month now and my scars are minimal.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only had it for about a month and haven&#x27;t been using it everyday.</li>
            <li> Recently I used the Bio-oil to treat a burn from kitchen oil, and the scar vanished within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I applied twice daily (and ruined a few shirts in the process from the greasy residue) and I still have severe stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 weeks and my stretchmarks are minimal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a few weeks though.</li>
            <li> I feel that Bio Oil would be too heavy for the face and neck, so I only use it on the backs of my hands.</li>
            <li> In my experience pregnancy related health care items are overly laden with fragrance, tacky creams and sold with a heavy price.  </li>
            <li> I keep the bottle in the shower and apply after showering while skin is still wet.</li>
            <li> oil itself is not very greasy.</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops in with my regular store bought moisturizer 2x a day</li>
            <li> In order to erase some acne marks on my temples and cheeks (They were not very serious.)I bought one for myself.</li>
            <li> Summer and sandals create the rough heels on your feet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter in color and not so rough feeling.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops every night on face/neck/chest and a bottle will last me 9+ months.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> My skin glows and does not look even remotely greasy.</li>
            <li> Have been using this stuff for only a few days</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this during or before my second pregnancy and ended up with a few marks.</li>
            <li> the acne scars were beginning to fade, but after a few weeks no further change took place.</li>
            <li> It was healing extremely slow and actually had a tiny bubble.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how permanent the effects of Bio-Oil are, but at least in the short-term it seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been a year now, and I would like to update the status of my inner thigh stretch marks--they are usually &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; (unless, of course, you look closely; but from the outer appearance, they are not visible, so I can wear shorts again!), but sometimes you can see the faintest white sheen.</li>
            <li> My family and friends even asked me how my marks went away because they were REALLY red and noticeable as I have pale skin.</li>
            <li> The longer you&#x27;ve had the scars the longer it will take to make less noticeable (especially the dark ones</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle for my mother who has very dry skin due to diabetes and her feet and legs now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certainly not throwing away my bio-oil</li>
            <li> Needless to say she bought some right away.</li>
            <li> I like that it does not clog my pores, and does not have an unpleasant or strong odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I found the smell to be quite strong and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It has been about 6 weeks now and it is about half-an-inch long and is less visible.  </li>
            <li> I am almost done with two weeks of daily application and I am looking forward to springtime when I can expose my legs with less shame and less scarring.</li>
            <li> Bio oil is a dry oil that doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greased down.</li>
            <li> and i have to be careful not to get on clothes due to it</li>
            <li> The other marks seem to be improving as well, although not nearly to the extent as the ones previously mentioned.</li>
            <li> Started using this product to hopefully slow down the stretch mark process during my pregnancy and am at six months and have none so far.</li>
            <li> A little of this product seems to go a long way.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs well and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and it took so long with little to no results.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> I use it all over my body, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> ( I don&#x27;t necessarily smother it all over my skin, but I am certainly not stingy as I admittedly usually am with other products).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s embarrassing to live with the scars and red, angry marks</li>
            <li> i started to use this twice daily every single day for at least 3 weeks on my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It also reduced the appearance of a newer scar I had on my wrist due to a tattoo removal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil daily for the past couple of months and find it keeps my skin dewey-looking.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily for the past month now, and it looks like it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I do not have extreme blotches or marks on my skin.</li>
            <li> No more red blotch here</li>
            <li> You only need to use a small amount and massage over the desires area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other cheaper alternatives like baby oil</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical at first, because I have tried everything.</li>
            <li> What should other customers know when considering this item?&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> For stretch marks and other skin blimishes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on other body parts with darker skin, we will see how it affects those.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m trying other products to combat stretch marks.</li>
            <li> After using this product twice a day for three weeks a thick,ropey scar due to an operation undergone two years ago&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
            <li> Now they&#x27;re extremely lightened.</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers have stated this product does make the skin feel greasy and oil, but that is because it is an oil based product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different moisturizers since I&#x27;ve been breaking out  over the past year.</li>
            <li> I read a lot about stretch marks being mostly due to genetics</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i started noticing small zits on my &amp;#34;cheeks&amp;#34;, and of course this was the only different&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with other oils</li>
            <li> Yes, I get the occasional small pimple here and</li>
            <li> It helps whenever I get chewed up by mosquitoes and other biting insects.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and also used it on my face.</li>
            <li> It also isnt greasy like other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I know a lot of other people have)</li>
            <li> With the help of another reviewer of this product, I think I know why a small knot appeared on the side of my nose during the time that I was using this oil or shortly afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have used it on other scars on myself, and</li>
            <li> Works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it actually helps, but I like to think so.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any dryness from using it as I did with other oils.</li>
            <li> This oil contains things that other products strive to keep OUT of their products (Parabens).</li>
            <li> To me this is a small price to pay for younger looking skin and fuller eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It has also worked on my stretch marks and plenty of other scars i have.</li>
            <li> Lots of small red pinples appeared on my face.</li>
            <li> might work for other people but not me</li>
            <li> (2 weeks from my due date) has helped prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> If you have skin problems or extreme dryness</li>
            <li> Now I use them for my face every other day</li>
            <li> I know there are other creams (mama mio ect.)</li>
            <li> Be careful of the labeling on a package before buying it!  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product about every other day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 10+ weeks on my face and  body to eliminate acne and other scars, as well as stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I have a few scares on my face and expected it to at least make my face soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m latina and my skin is a little bit oily and dry.</li>
            <li> Oh-lastly-I have a little wire-haired dog that gets really dry skin as the weather cools and the heater comes on.</li>
            <li> I did start noticing a few little red dots on the bottom of my belly at 30 weeks, but as of today, they have not connected like a stretch mark.</li>
            <li> Bio oil keeps then soft and smooth and rather faint in appearance, but despite routine use, I have started just recently to get some very faint marks on my belly.</li>
            <li> And a few drops go a long way!</li>
            <li> I use a drop on each location, massage for a few and  let it dry.</li>
            <li> and it was less pink looking.</li>
            <li> I used this for 3 months day and night on my face for some slight discoloration and minimal acne scars.</li>
            <li> I have scars I can measure by the foot, thanks to potentially dangerous hobbies, however, this stuff, while it does not lessen the look of the scars, definitely keeps irritation to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, because it&#x27;s not oily or greasy</li>
            <li> It certainly is not for facial use because of its thick consistency.</li>
            <li> They were dark purple and my skin is very pale so they were obvious.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and although it&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t do anything other products don&#x27;t do for less money.</li>
            <li> Previously used liquid vitamin E for dark spots, scars and other skin blemishes.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is the smell...</li>
            <li> when i finally received it, i read that it will take at least 3 months to see results.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to but fragrance is one contents and not the last and least.</li>
            <li> I have some dark scars on my legs from when I have cut myself with a razor while shaving.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s and Native American).  </li>
            <li> It may work for stretch marks, but it definitely does NOT work on the scars, at least, not for my case.</li>
            <li> My goal for this product is two fold: to help alleviate the dark discoloration from my scars and help break my harmful habit by replacing it with a skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since my skin is darker I get dark scars.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it helps take away dark spots.</li>
            <li> and I had really dark ones, but it gave me a breakout hence the 3 stars.</li>
            <li> My acne marks was dark brown color before using biooil.</li>
            <li> is really my only complaint).</li>
            <li> I believe I&#x27;ll get desired results, which is to fade dark spots on my hands, if I continue.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got dark spots and you&#x27;re trying to get rid of them &amp;#34;naturally&amp;#34;, RUN.</li>
            <li> I use it on dark spots and scars too.</li>
            <li> --they are inevitable at least for me after two pregnancys.</li>
            <li> within just a few days of use my skin broke out into the worse acne/zits/cystic nightmare ive seen in months (never the less my period is as far away as can be, and usually that&#x27;s the only reason i get any).</li>
            <li> Drop by drop sytem leads to dribbles down side.</li>
            <li> A friend tried it on her scar and overnight it took down the raised look of it</li>
            <li> I started using it in my 4th month of pregnancy twice a day, from my breasts down to my thighs; my son is about to be 11 wks</li>
            <li> Seemed too expensive to use as a body and hand lotion, but after the results on face and neck, and given its little amount for large areas, we began using it for everything.</li>
            <li> The dark spots on my arms that were there for years seem to be getting lighter--those on my face a bit less noticeable now.</li>
            <li> and I have dark spots or redness from previous acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> I did put the oil in a small bottle so that it was easier to use with as little waste as possible.  </li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s a waste of money and an opportunity of using possibly other alternatives.</li>
            <li> I did notice a slight improvement on stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Noticed slight results.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I used Dr. Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter but that did nothing, it was like putting on lotion and expecting to  see my marks gone.</li>
            <li> and it helped out a lot less noticable there</li>
            <li> and I believe that my age spots are less brown.</li>
            <li> I typically go through one bottle every 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Helps to decrease scarring in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy and has an odd smell, but I don&#x27;t mind it because of how wondefully it works.</li>
            <li> I have had them for over a year and by applying this once a day for a half hour for two weeks they are noticeably lights and softer.</li>
            <li> Reduces redness and they become less visible...</li>
            <li> Not even a slight change in color, size, texture, etc.</li>
            <li> It did not make a slight difference.</li>
            <li> Those have since faded and are not all that noticeable but Bio Oil made them even less visible in the months I have been using it; it even faded those I had since puberty</li>
            <li> They now have a slight shine that they never had before.  </li>
            <li> It is everything that previous customers have said.</li>
            <li> I took a tumble mountain biking over a month and a half ago</li>
            <li> Ive used almost half a bottle</li>
            <li> I use this oil for just about everything, cuticles, face, even on the bottom of my hair to piece the strands out slightly.</li>
            <li> But after I used it for only 3 times, I got seriously allergy on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin sensitivities are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I love this product, however I had to wait over a month for my order to be delievered, and that is just plain stupid.</li>
            <li> So after the first use, it no longer feels like knives are stabbing me when I stand up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but this oil makes my hands feel rough.  </li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t scratched since, which is fantastic, because he was driving himself and us crazy at night!</li>
            <li> On my face, I had acne scars on my cheeks, little break outs here and there, and black heads on my nose.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received have a little black impurity.</li>
            <li> Eventually his scar became a little less noticable.  </li>
            <li> I even use it for my face since my facial skin lost all its moisture and became totally lifeless due to cold weather and hormonal changes inside my body.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the product should have done, but it was smelly with no positive changes.</li>
            <li> Now, three months later, my stretch marks are hardly noticeable!</li>
            <li> My mother and all her sisters got them bad while pregnant.</li>
            <li> I have however purchased another bottle for after my baby is born in hopes that it helps the ugly marks fade quickly.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t use it long enough it became an expensive because I have to get a lot of bottles</li>
            <li> My burn scars are so much less noticeable after a few months.  </li>
            <li> I think there is no magic lotion for stretch marks, but its about moisturizing as much as possible and gaining weight slowly.</li>
            <li> #34;winter skin&amp;#34; (little bumps on thighs and arms) for the past few years with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> I also use a little bit of it on my face to even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> May help the appearance a little bit on strechmark but not get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little worried it will make me break out.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints except that it is a little oily.</li>
            <li> This lasted throughout the day and two little drops covered my face and neck area.  </li>
            <li> So not worth it!</li>
            <li> Even my little boy had a glowing complextion.  </li>
            <li> or when I start after I stop for a little bit</li>
            <li> Im almost 9 months and just started to get little ones on my tummy.</li>
            <li> and i have seen little to no results</li>
            <li> The little knot on my face appeared out of nowhere; I had never had anything like this on my skin before.</li>
            <li> However, I use this on my face with my face lotion before bed and a little bit in the morning.</li>
            <li> It smells awful due to the added fragrances, much like some kind of old lady perfume, and I hated having to walk around smelling it for hours after I put it on.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t mind messing up a little.</li>
            <li> know I need to use it a little longer for any &amp;#34;visible results&amp;#34</li>
            <li> MJ gave me two little packets and told me to try it.  </li>
            <li> Not a lot, but just a little.</li>
            <li> They have lotions, soaps, cosmetics, Argan oil...but are a little pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another</li>
            <li> She would get mad at me if I would remind her to use it, like I wouldn&#x27;t think she was pretty if she didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> One 4.2 oz bottle lasted me though two trimesters (1X day application), and I had a little leftover.  </li>
            <li> It feels a little tingly, like its working.</li>
            <li> You can read my Amazon reviews as I&#x27;m not sure I can mention other products by name here.</li>
            <li> , I put a little bit on my face, neck, shoulders, and then on my stretch mark spots.</li>
            <li> , i am little scared to use this on him .i</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit thicker and not quite as slippy and the Bio-Oil.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about buying it because I heard people say it didn&#x27;t work at all on stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Maybe my scars look a little darker (closer to my skin tone) maybe not.</li>
            <li> The marks faded a little bit but nothing like what it was suppose to do.</li>
            <li> nothing a little Neosporin can&#x27;t do.  </li>
            <li> I have some horrible huge purple red stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it everyday and it lighten my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> The dead skin washes off.</li>
            <li> My mother has terrible crepe-like skin and stretchmarks on her tummy from her own pregnancies, too.</li>
            <li> I wasted time that I couldve been using scarguard instead.</li>
            <li> I even tried it to make my uneven skin tone go away, an redness</li>
            <li> I say my strech marks get a few lighter shades..</li>
            <li> I saw no change in my stretch marks after a few bottles.</li>
            <li> Not too shiny and doesn&#x27;t feel oily after a few seconds.</li>
            <li> If using under makeup (which I do everyday, can be used as a moisturizer/toner)</li>
            <li> Use it everyday....</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I notice if I use both the oil and the butter everyday in the morning and at night the stretch marks were fading quicker than before.</li>
            <li> (once I&#x27;m dried off).</li>
            <li> so I used this on my chest everyday.</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops with my face lotion.  </li>
            <li> Results show up in a few months though.</li>
            <li> so it seems like a waste of money to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only broken out once while using this product</li>
            <li> I felt like I wasted my money and time.</li>
            <li> I bought Bio Oil about 5 Years ago because I had a few brown spots on my face.</li>
            <li> So i dampen my face using a cotton ball with bio-oil everyday.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using Bio-Oil as a skin lubricant for a few years now after we saw a demo at a Costco store.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it almost everyday for 2 months</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product but so far I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> I started using it and saw visible results in a few days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have money to waste on wrinkle cream or anti aging cream.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wear heavy</li>
            <li> has anti aging effects &amp; helps with uneven skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few months.</li>
            <li> I even use it under my tinted moisturizer and it is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I put it on after I shower everyday and give it a few minutes to soak.</li>
            <li> old scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus way cheaper than prescription or expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> Will post an update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have about three very faint stretch marks from my 8.5lb first child.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, I know the &#x27;experts&#x27; out there will probably say that the nail plate itself is dead and won&#x27;t absorb anything (so, explain to me how nails can become water logged then, geniuses)</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I noticed a difference and softening of the lines.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I ran out of leather conditioner and grabbed the bottle of Bio Oil.  </li>
            <li> I rubbed the oil on my skin every day - sometimes twice a day, and within a few weeks, all of the&lt;br /&gt;eczema is gone.  </li>
            <li> So I put a few drops and mix it with my moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li> name it.&lt;br /&gt;a few reviewers mentioned not to apply on face.</li>
            <li> Helps uneven skin tone also.....</li>
            <li> This product is just a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I purchased Bio-Oil a few months ago, to use during my dry-brushing skin maintenance routine.</li>
            <li> belly is full of stretch mark :-(</li>
            <li> I have already been through a few bottles.</li>
            <li> and I run this on it everyday after I shower.</li>
            <li> It was a few months until I saw results.</li>
            <li> I used tho stuff everyday day and got a few</li>
            <li> It seemed to make them worse, if that&#x27;s even possible!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin glow, it dried up my acne on my shoulders.</li>
            <li> Although I do think it has been helpful in reducing the appearance of scars, uneven skin tones and stretch marks.</li>
            <li> so i have started to use it sometimes instead of lotion, but i have not seen a difference in the fading of any scars or the few stretch marks on my side and tummy.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to ANYBODY who has stretch marks, scars and dry skin etc......great product!!!!!</li>
            <li> If anything, I think it makes my face break out a lot less!</li>
            <li> I saw results in less than a week!</li>
            <li> But the two small linear incisions are dark purple!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 6 months pregnant and my breasts have had terrible deep stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel tight or itchy when I use my bio oil!</li>
            <li> Cat ripped up her legs pretty bad</li>
            <li> i bought this for my wife, we don&#x27;t have a baby yet, she became fat at first, and after she lost weight and became slim again, she used this product to  reduce the ugly print on her body.</li>
            <li> I burned my arm with a curling iron and usually I have trouble with my skin healing.  </li>
            <li> (I had been in the sun the past few days)</li>
            <li> I was doing raw cocoa, raw Shea butter, and coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this product, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Ill write another review in a few months to update everyone on how well it actually worked on my scars.</li>
            <li> I am a clumsy person who has lots of scars and this product makes them less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Some belly creams, like cocoa butter, are so thick that application is not very easy.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit greasy, but I would take that any day over stretch marks!</li>
            <li> Overall disappointed, would like a refund because I definitely feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I have cats and commonly get little scraps on my arms playing with them.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using it and switched to organic jojoba oil, which has very little smell.</li>
            <li> :S</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product or the combination of products is working.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I am not having the small pimples that were coming up around my jaw line and around my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have messed myself up in the past and I&#x27;ve got a lot of scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that this is usually a heriditary thing.</li>
            <li> As for scars, I&#x27;m not sure it works as well for mine as it does my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> i like the feel of it, although im not sure it is working.</li>
            <li> Used it to rid of small stretch marks on my breast , instead it made them deeper...</li>
            <li> im not sure about the efficiency of the product, i just stated using it.. but gave 5 star because it got here as promised.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an itchy belly like I did with my past pregnancies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the product works or if it&#x27;s too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> stretch marks eventually faded but I&#x27;m not sure if it was from Bio- oil or from time passing, as all stretch marks fade eventually.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am anxious to see if it evens out my skin tone (because I need it).  </li>
            <li> That bottle of liquid salvation arrived on my doorstep and into my anxious hands just a couple of days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been applying bio oil (2 drops) to it twice a day for the past 2-3 weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its working the way we had hoped, my daughter has seen some improvement...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure wether or not</li>
            <li> It smells not bed, but I not sure if it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not expecting miracles, but having used silicone strips for a small scar from surgery, I do expect something to come of using a product like this for 3 months.</li>
            <li> She is too lazy to apply it on herself.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Again she is too lazy to apply this herself and we are wanting to know if we as her employees can help our boss.  </li>
            <li> None of my moisturizers were making even a small difference.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if its works yet.</li>
            <li> and I first noticed those dreadful red lines beginning to appear on my thighs.</li>
            <li> In addition, I stopped after no more than two months.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was the oil, the butter mix or working out,</li>
            <li> I stopped using it for my stretch mark since i already have no time for the past weeks</li>
            <li> Stopped by at the Walmart to compare scar creams and was amazed at how expensive they were when obviously</li>
            <li> and I already had 3 small strech marks on my breasts.</li>
            <li> After two pregnancies, stretch marks did a small number on my stomach, thighs, and buttocks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite a small bottle for the price so after rubbing this continuously over my body during my pregnancy I tend to run out of it soon.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works, since it is still summer.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> When I ordered it I was expecting it to be quite small</li>
            <li> ( the bottle is too damn small</li>
            <li> My small bottle of Bio-Oil has lasted going on five years, however, my wife found she like it for some kinda of makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works just started using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for the past year to get rid of my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> With that, unfortunately I&#x27;ve been using it on my surgical scars for about 2 months and the only thing its done was grease up my scarring</li>
            <li> bought this for him to use it on a small scare from a wound  on the face .&lt;br /&gt;may</li>
            <li> I have to admit that sometimes I got lazy or forgot to apply the Bio Oil</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my skin and doesn&#x27;t seem to cause oil stains on clothing, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it until it&#x27;s gone, but I&#x27;m not sure whether I&#x27;ll reorder.</li>
            <li> Product has a weird smell, but that is a personal preference.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too uncomfortable with their appearance, and so I did NOT use bio oil regularly.</li>
            <li> Ive gained alot of weight these past two years of my life.</li>
            <li> Not sure she will continue to use it afterwards.</li>
            <li> I use this in place of expensive face creams and it helps with overall skin aging, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> After purchasing and using this product for awhile I read that it is not safe for pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Also maybe try it with the derma roller or olive oil (not sure if either affects my results, but not changing the routine that is working for me)</li>
            <li> but I have been lazy and haven&#x27;t been using it as I should...will update when I do</li>
            <li> I had a baby about 5 months ago and was left with some pretty nasty stretch marks.</li>
            <li> not sure if this is denial</li>
            <li> And I have quite a few fresh stretch marks that are painful!</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strange, but I don&#x27;t hate it enough to stop using it.  </li>
            <li> Very few products do what they say.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do much for me :(</li>
            <li> Bought this looking to lighten and make some stretch marks less noticeable, I had hope in this product, but hopes were broken...</li>
            <li> I hated the smell of that when I was pregnant and Bio-Oil has virtually no smell at all.</li>
            <li> hardly any stretch marks from the pregnancy, woo hoo.  </li>
            <li> And the stretch marks are hardly visible now.</li>
            <li> I hardly got any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> and I had a hard time finding the X.</li>
            <li> It feels a little bit like a really thin vegetable oil except that it absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> many people know how annoying this yucky chicken skin&#x27; can be-and how hard it is to deal with.</li>
            <li> but, you also need to wait at least 10-20 minutes before applying any primer, foundation, etc.</li>
            <li> I started using this late in my pregnancy and immediately after baby about once a day.</li>
            <li> Try to apply it at least once a day.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, but it takes at least a year.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it at least once a day  </li>
            <li> You always need to wait at least 10 minutes before dressing.</li>
            <li> I recently had a baby and had stretch marks that were seriously depressing me.</li>
            <li> applied at least 2 times a</li>
            <li> But I DON&#x27;T like the ingredients or the negative assessments of the product.</li>
            <li> Not effective to me, never see a change after using this product.</li>
            <li> a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I aso have the common condition, KP/Keratosis Pillaris...</li>
            <li> Been using for about 1 month and applying at least 1 to 2 times a day.</li>
            <li> but it does say you need to use it for at least 3 months to see a difference.</li>
            <li> and it says on the package to use it for at least 3 months.</li>
            <li> (at least that&#x27;s what I do).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing results, just slowly.  </li>
            <li> I swear this has helped to slow the process.</li>
            <li> I started using bio oil and the lighter stretch marks started slowly fading away.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel too thick and I can even wear it under makeup.</li>
            <li> my scars are slowly disappearing.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a thick oil.</li>
            <li> Self esteem is slowly</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can&#x27;t afford an endless supply of this stuff but it does work.</li>
            <li> I mean I guess it could work</li>
            <li> I mean the scar didn&#x27;t disappear</li>
            <li> Try it, you&#x27;ll see what I mean.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t mean it would not work for someone else&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li> but I am little disappointed because in my final month I got lots of stretch marks even after using this product continuously.</li>
            <li> I mean, I bought it for stretch marks and didn&#x27;t get the effects over night that I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about all the claims the other people made, but if you are finding yourself with a bad sun burn and notice the skin is still moist but you can start to pick at it and pull it off; don&#x27;t peel it off until it is completely dried and flaking off of you.</li>
            <li> I first started out with the palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter formula but hated the smell and texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this works for stretch marks or not, but I am addicted to the scent.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has done virtually nothing for my scars, dark spots and redness.</li>
            <li> I will stress that I used alot of the oil with every application and seriously did spend about 30 minutes rubbing it into the belly.</li>
            <li> I wish it was less expensive</li>
            <li> Bio Oil has seriously changed my life.</li>
            <li> (I am also acne prone and my skin has been horrible ever since getting pregnant, so maybe it wasn&#x27;t cause by the oil)</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time with other products; spend the money and use Strivectin and Bio Oil and you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Other than the smell--which isn&#x27;t awful, just not to my liking--I&#x27;m surprised by this stuff.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little weird.</li>
            <li> The ingredient list is honestly a little scary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on 2 recent scars - a gash on my shoulder from a fence and a bad wound on my ankle from horse stirrups.  </li>
            <li> I regret purchasing it because it gave me a really bad red rash that lasted about 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> not good as they said remove scars&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t very bad but very noticeable..</li>
            <li> and I got a nasty scar on my right elbow.  </li>
            <li> I was never really fat to begin with, and at my worst I was a size 4/6 in women&#x27;s clothing, which was last summer.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day everyday for a few months until I got so frustrated and just threw it out.</li>
            <li> but it might be too late; can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> Bio-Oil in the morning helps keep my skin from the painful itch of the dry winter weather.</li>
            <li> I assumed I was destined to get stretch marks during pregnancy since I got a lot of them during a weight gain period some years ago - the horrible, dark, big ones, on my hips, thighs and even arms.</li>
            <li> I also use very expensive department store skin care products and other specialty brands that I buy on-line.  </li>
            <li> and I hope there will be no more stretch marks after my pregnancy!!</li>
            <li> In doing so it decreased the appearance of my scar.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the worse they&#x27;re going to get.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My incision failed to heal for 10 weeks, and I was forced to rely on a wound vac to close the surgical wound.</li>
            <li> I got my dad addicted to it as well.  </li>
            <li> and this hasn&#x27;t made it any worse.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this 2 times a day throughout my whole pregnancy and am 38.5 weeks and have no stretch marks (they say they are genetic and my mom had them horribly).</li>
            <li> not happy about it.</li>
            <li> I was desperate) day and night on my trouble areas.</li>
            <li> Has effectively decreased level of flaking and dryness.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t just mean silly sun spots or things like that.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical since it&#x27;s very small and pricey</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth any benefits with all the side effects, unnatural ingredients, and bad smell.</li>
            <li> Especially when it looks like you have a bad case of road rash that feels like someone is stabbing you with knives.</li>
            <li> Obviously i have really bad stretch marks around my body!</li>
            <li> that are stiff, ugly, and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> WHAT A WASTE!!!!  </li>
            <li> Be wary using this product.</li>
            <li> Of course I was skeptical on the reviews</li>
            <li> 4 months ago, I had a spinal fusion surgery which was unfortunately complicated by a MRSA infection.</li>
            <li> So sad</li>
            <li> ill take my tiger stripes</li>
            <li> This was unfortunate.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s sort of expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I thought &amp;</li>
            <li> and it was really uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> whatever troubled area you have.</li>
            <li> I used to use expensive creams like Clinique</li>
            <li> Its expensive too.</li>
            <li> the weird pink/orange color of the oil made me look at the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> i am obsessed with this bio oil</li>
            <li> - It&#x27;s unlikely that I will have stretch marks since my mother didn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> But, still i was skeptical.</li>
            <li> The smell is weird, is it really&lt;</li>
            <li> but unfortunately this bio oil alone did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> On the worst appearances, they were very faintly red.</li>
            <li> I would have given 3 stars if the product wasn&#x27;t so expensive or hyped up.</li>
            <li> my back looked terrible like I have a skin disease.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I am stuck with the scars until I can find something that I will fade it over time.</li>
            <li> I was sad knowing that at the age of 28, I could never wear a bikini.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not have a horrible scent, actually it&#x27;s quite pleasing to smell.</li>
            <li> I was always concerned about my stretch marks and bought an expensive cream</li>
            <li> I have scars on my arms from being hit by a tree branch (unlikely situation).  </li>
            <li> what&#x27;s so weird is</li>
            <li> Sadly, it&#x27;s been about 2 months now and nothing has changed.</li>
            <li> and the scar was bad - worse, it still hurt through</li>
            <li> It was priced cheaper compared to the scar creams and seemed to have active ingredients that you would want reacting with your skin to heal a nasty scar.  </li>
            <li> and you can hardly tell, she uses Bio-Oil!!!  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t care for that artificial odour.  </li>
            <li> All my stretch zone areas were itchy and driving me crazy until I started using this.  </li>
            <li> For a 3 day mini vacation I used palmers cocoa butter for stretch marks &amp; itched like crazy...</li>
            <li> can stain and be dangerous in the dryer.</li>
            <li> I even accidentally touched my lips with oil residue still on my hands and it burnt like crazy.</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t fill like knives stabbing me when I stood up.</li>
            <li> The only think I hate about this product when you apply it, your hands always have that nasty, oily feeling from rubbing</li>
            <li> Made me itch like crazy</li>
            <li> I try to avoid products containing dangerous chemicals, but for some reason I didn&#x27;t do my research with Bio-Oil.</li>
            <li> If you look up bio-oil on youtube you find scary videos of people talking about how it is basically mineral oil and how that&#x27;s bad...comes from crude oil etc, but baby oil is also basically mineral oil.</li>
            <li> So I got some Bio-Oil and desperately started applying it every day.</li>
            <li> I have been very frustrated with the slow rate of healing...</li>
            <li> but unfortunately this one did&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had lot of expectations from this product but its really disappointing :(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I got to the end of my shopping venture and had over 150.00 in shipping fees :(.</li>
            <li> Needless to say its working like a charm!</li>
            <li> But now she&#x27;s mad because she has stretch marks.</li>
            <li> But this product proved that theory wrong!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very skeptical online buyer</li>
            <li> I got bad allergic reactions on my face</li>
            <li> it worked ,in a bad way .I</li>
            <li> but I just applied it after my shower and it wasn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> my bad.  </li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to this product.  </li>
            <li> My chest and neck broke out in a bad rash withing two days of using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use on my face to heal some scars from the bad acne I used to have.</li>
            <li> gave it a bad review</li>
            <li> It smelt bad.</li>
            <li> My mom sent this to me for a bad scar I have on my knee that happened about 5 months ago.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this to my friends and family that have bad skin and need to look radient....</li>
            <li> I want to say I have bad stretch marks after my two kids.</li>
            <li> I am shocked at the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to find out</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll still have the lighter skin where the stretch marks are, but it helped get rid of the ugly purple lines on arms and hips.</li>
            <li> It helps even out any redness and those ugly brown spots.</li>
            <li> I bought it at Costco and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed and upset how my body looks.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> none of my stretch marks went away! :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked up some recipes for skin/stretch mark care blends online (some recipes can be found here: [...].</li>
            <li> DO NOT SPEND A TON OF MONEY ON EXPENSIVE TREATMENTS!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I hate how oily the product is, it is a miracle oil</li>
            <li> The bad thing is the shipping company they are using now, it is the WORST.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Opening up the translucent orange bottle, I already immediately hated it.</li>
            <li> I hated the oily feel of it</li>
            <li> Soo I have countinued use of this product even though I hated it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed...</li>
            <li> Very disappointed as I was hoping this would take care of them for me.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed, and will not use it again.</li>
            <li> About 2 weeks ago I got a really nasty sun burn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit greasy and the smell is horrible.</li>
            <li> After a couple months the horrible spots that had been plaguing me for two years were gone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after getting a nasty curling iron burn on my forearm.  </li>
            <li> She was terrible at remembering to use it</li>
            <li> This stuff also smells disgusting, and the smell lingers.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife swears by this stuff while she&#x27;s pregnant.  Orders came quickly every time. Get the big bottle it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for someone and i see clearly the difference on her skin before and now</li>
            <li> I love the bio oil it makes my skin soft and I feel more confident</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing results, just slowly.  I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day for about two months.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for old  stretch marks. Only helps with uneven facial skin tone. They need to declare that this product only works on fresh scars and stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Goes on silky smooth and I hope to see results as I have just bought this product and hope it works.also the price was great with speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to absorb into the skin, but once it does it leaves it very soft. Also has a minty kind of smell to it.</li>
            <li> Been using for years. Great for tired, dry skin on the face and preventing wrinkles. Also wonderful for preventing stretch marks during pregnancy!  Only issue is I don&#x27;t like the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Oil is working as it promised it could...it&#x27;s not been the time length stated it could take but it is making a difference.</li>
            <li> Really good product. Been using it last 4 month and no strech marks so far. A little messy, but the oil dries out quick</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, not greasy, smells good, use it regularly on the occasional precancerous spot removals I occasionally need...and those brown spots on my face and hands from too much sun...</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff. Absorbs in and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I bought it at Costco and was disappointed. The scent is overpowering and made my eyes burn and water. I had to wash it off after an hour. :S</li>
            <li> Great price, great product!  My stretch marks are still hanging around, but there is no miracle cream for that, but this definitely keeps your skin hydrated!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this product advertised in magazines and on television.  I&#x27;ve begun laser tattoo removal and the multiple passes one session leave me with rough skin.  I was searching for a product that would hydrate the skin before the next session.  I thought I would try this product.&lt;br /&gt;It feels like a thinner baby oil and does soak into the skin well.  The only problem I have with the product is the smell (I can&#x27;t even use the word fragrance).  It smells like roses and I don&#x27;t care for that artificial odour.  I love roses but the manufactured smell doesn&#x27;t compare IMHO.&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use the product but put another cream over top to mask the odour.  Now I&#x27;m calling it an odour (it&#x27;s graduated from smell)&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m not sure if the product or the combination of products is working.&lt;br /&gt;But hey, it&#x27;s less than $20 with eligible free shipping when combined with other products and the bottle will last a long time.  Perhaps you won&#x27;t mind the smell.</li>
            <li> This product works great!! However, I always forget to use it. Best to use after the shower on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use it to avoid stretch marks from pregnancy.  To be direct - I am 8 months pregnant and use this once or twice a day and I do not have even one stretch mark.  Both my mom and sister had them during their pregnancies and they used just cocoa butter.  This has been a life saver!  But it!</li>
            <li> Love it. I&#x27;m using it everyday and it lighten my stretch marks. I&#x27;ll buy again!!!</li>
            <li> I used BioOil during and after my pregnancy but I don&#x27;t think it really helped my stretch marks. Also the scent is REALLY strong. Kind of like baby powder but not exactly. I will probably pass on using it in the future.</li>
            <li> This oil smells so good that I do not use any par fums with it. It goes on smoothly and it is not greasy. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> USE THIS ON YOUR CUTICLES. If you bite your nails or pick at the skin around them, this is a miracle worker for you. Having it on your hands will prevent you from biting your nails anyways :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t work so much for me as a scar remover. I&#x27;ve used this consistently for 2+ years and noticed almost no change. Skin has evened out a bit but won&#x27;t benefit raised scars.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell any difference.  Applied to scar on forehead.  Switched to biocoreuem after awhile.</li>
            <li> Be wary using this product. I never finished using it because it&#x27;s too oily, staining clothing and anything else you come in contact with.</li>
            <li> very fast shipment. i like it</li>
            <li> I like this oil for my face, and my stretch marks. I use it after my derma-roller. I took one star off b/c it smells a little strong for my taste. It&#x27;s not a horrible smell... kind of a rose scent. But it&#x27;s stronger than I would like.</li>
            <li> Every pregnant woman should buy this!!  I didn&#x27;t get not one single stretch mark during my last pregnancy,  I also purchased this as a gift for one of my coworkers and she loved it as well.  If I ever get pregnant again, I will start using this right away.</li>
            <li> Good. I hope it can remove the scar on my arm.</li>
            <li> Are used this product when I&#x27;m pregnant it&#x27;s good for the stress marks I love it</li>
            <li> I like this particularly for my neck which is more sensitive than my face and some other products are too strong. Also have used with scars.  Bio-oil is good enough that I sometimes use this as a substitute for my normal Obagi routine. This is particularly helpful for traveling since I can travel with one product instead of an array of creams. I am in my 60s and my skin is drier, so the moisture feels very good.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. My wife did not get a single post pregnancy stretch mark.</li>
            <li> I just started using this on Monday and i can already tell a difference! (Today is Friday) my surgery scar is noticably lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got a derma roller today i ordered through amazon as well, and im going to use it in conjunction with this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband likes the way it smells, and i like it too. I use it on my face and all over my body. its great use after shaving your legs.</li>
            <li> love, need to order more</li>
            <li> The discovery of this product was a god-send for me. Six weeks ago I had a large section of the end of my nose excised due to skin cancer. I have been very frustrated with the slow rate of healing...until I discovered Bio Oil. Once the surgical site was scabbed over, I began using the Bio Oil and literally overnight the healing process accelerated. I have since began using it on older scars with very positive results. I just bought a larger bottle so that I can use it even more liberally on other parts of my body. I love the texture and smell, and the natural ingredients. It can be a little oily at first, until you rub it in. Highly recommended, not only for scars but for surgical site healing.</li>
            <li> I used it for 6 months. I did notice a slight improvement on stretch marks. Makes skin very soft and smells great. I stopped using it because I just didn&#x27;t see any more improvement on the stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of imorovement.</li>
            <li> It was sent on time, but because of the fragance-I am allergic to most -I was not able to use it, but&lt;br /&gt;the person to whom I gave it says that it is a very effective product</li>
            <li> I used this the day I got it on my face because of my uneven skin tone ( I&#x27;m biracial and often have red splotches or tan/un-tan differences) and I instantly saw results, my face appeared softer and no red spots! Going to use on some stretch marks</li>
            <li> Love it!! It really works !!</li>
            <li> fast delivery and great product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past, and so far this has worked great for my stretch marks. It&#x27;s easy to apply, but I suggest washing your hands after because it&#x27;ll of course have it stuck there. Not permanently of course.</li>
            <li> I got bad allergic reactions on my face so I only use in my legs</li>
            <li> Noticed slight results.  Gives a nice gloss</li>
            <li> I cannot yet comment on if it helps stretch marks but it does feel good on the skin and smells good. This and Burt&#x27;s Bees Mama Bee lotion are my favorite products.</li>
            <li> I have not researched this product. All I can say is for me it has worked better that I imagined. I have dry oil sentive skin. The Bio Oil has helped my dry facial skin. I wash my face prior to applying also using a facial scrubber. The dead skin washes off. I am not having the small pimples that were coming up around my jaw line and around my mouth. It may not be good over time, but for now I can say I have used all kinds of moistures that didn&#x27;t work. This product is moderatily priced and accomplishes the desired effect for me.</li>
            <li> This has been working good so far for my pregnant wife. This is oily but no overly so. The price is a bit expensive, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Given, I haven&#x27;t been using this strictly as directed, which is my fault (this 4 month old keeps me busy!), but I only see a small difference. I got stretch marks from the pregnancy and had to have a c section for delivery. The oil I think has actually helped a little with the stretch marks, so YAY! But I don&#x27;t see a any difference with the c section scar. I will continue to buy and use though and hopefully it works eventually. Cross your fingers! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This oil is very effective for curing scabs and as anti-aging. Very good price for the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Started using this product to hopefully slow down the stretch mark process during my pregnancy and am at six months and have none so far. I also use it on a scar I received about a month ago from a burn and it is fading quite fast. My fiance has very dry skin and has started to use it as well and it has done wonders for him. Great product!</li>
            <li> Pros: smells good and absorbs very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it&#x27;s not made specifically for pregnant women so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s completely safe to use for stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with the healing process of surgery. In doing so it decreased the appearance of my scar. My skin is also so much softer. I would recommend it highly.  I used it along with a vit. e 400 gel cap and healed in record time. My surgeon was amazed. Visibly my scar is not visible unless I point to it. The scar was located on my neck under my chin. Thank you bio oil &amp; amazon.</li>
            <li> Arrived the next day! Good item but not the best product out there for scars. May not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife.  She has been using this oil for some time.  The item showed up fast with no problems.</li>
            <li> I feel that it is making my skin softer and my scars lighter so I like the product thus far.</li>
            <li> I have used the bio-oil on some of my biggest problem areas. I don&#x27;t just mean silly sun spots or things like that. I&#x27;m talking surgical scars, minor knife wounds, burns etc. I have messed myself up in the past and I&#x27;ve got a lot of scars. Unfortunately I can&#x27;t afford an endless supply of this stuff but it does work. I had a burn on my face from a blow dryer that I managed to seemingly eliminate in just 2 applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people talk about buying this for aging and wrinkles. I mean I guess it could work but why spend so much for this when it has such better applications than that? If you&#x27;re that worried about looking your age, I highly suggest something more affordable. Retinol cream is something I&#x27;ve used in the past for fine lines around my eyes for instance; [[ASIN:B009WK0M6G Retinol Cream (Vitamin A) - 2 oz. + FREE St. Ives Renewing Collagen Elastin Advanced Body Moisturizer Gift Set]]. It works great and it&#x27;s cheaper than Bio-oil~!</li>
            <li> I have been using it alternating  with other much more expensive oils but this is still a 5 star body oil.  It costs much less than other oil, but it is still very hydrating to the skin without feeling too oily, doesn&#x27;t leave oily residues, easy to apply, smells good,  and makes skin soft and nice!</li>
            <li> my skin got darker ,discoloration happened !!??and i wanted to get rid of a mark but that mar still is there, didnt get even a little tiny lighter .it happened after I have used this for 3 weeks twice daily ....it worked ,in a bad way .I wont consider this brand anymore .</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping! Oil smells great, can&#x27;t wait to see how it works for me!</li>
            <li> I received my product faster than expected. It smells good, and it is not oily, and does not stain my underwear. I gave it a four because I am still trying it. I will follow up later.</li>
            <li> been using for 5 months now and still doesnt see much improvement in my new scar.</li>
            <li> I used twice a day during my pregnancy. I think it kept me moisturized but didn&#x27;t prevent stretch marks. I never got itchy.</li>
            <li> Bought for a friend to help with stretch marks. Seems to be working as far as evening out the colours</li>
            <li> my only complaint is the smell...it&#x27;s a little weird.</li>
            <li> Works really well for me.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work miracles for me like everyone else claims, but atlas it was moisturizing haha.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a month so far and I am seeing results but mostly on scars.</li>
            <li> This product is surprisingly good....I had a scar on my shoulder &amp; use a chemical peel which help to fade it somewhat.. Then I bought the Bio Oil&amp; applied it overnight...I was surprised to see a ssignificant change the next morning...I mean the scar didn&#x27;t disappear but it faded to a lighter shade...I continued to use the bio oil every night &amp; now the scar is 95% faded....I also use it on my face &amp; It gives me a certain glow....this product works....It is now a regular part of my skincare routine...I would recommend it.....4.5stars....</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my stretch marks as of yet. I&#x27;m hopeful after months of use it will change.</li>
            <li> Hm, I&#x27;m surprised this oil is so popular and worked for so many people. Didn&#x27;t help preventing my stretch marks at all (diligently putting it every morning and evening for months on). Ingredients seem nice though - just didn&#x27;t work for MY skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 8 months pregnant. I have been using the product twice a day in the morning and at night and so far it has worked. It keeps my skin hydrated and I don&#x27;t have visible stretch marks yet. It is significantly more expensive than Palmer ( the other brand I tried) but the smell of Palmer was super strong and neither me or my husband could stand it</li>
            <li> I used different products for these new, red stretch marks all over my legs, especially on the back of my knees and none of them gave me the results that this one did. Previously, I used Dr. Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter but that did nothing, it was like putting on lotion and expecting to  see my marks gone. This oil is really lightweight and doesn&#x27;t weight you down, plus it smells really good too. My marks were gone really quickly, probably after using about a bottle and a half of this. It won&#x27;t disappear overnight, you do need to keep using it for about 1-2 months but it WILL go away. My family and friends even asked me how my marks went away because they were REALLY red and noticeable as I have pale skin. Love this stuff! If Dr. Palmer&#x27;s didn&#x27;t work for you, try this!!!</li>
            <li> love it. takes forever to work though</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and am glad I did. Everything I&#x27;ve read about it has women swearing by it. I like it because it smells good and its a good moisturizer but I cant swear by its stretch mark disappearing or appearing powers because I really think it&#x27;s a genetic thing regardless of what you do. So far so good for me, I&#x27;m 35 weeks and my skin looks good but my mom says it&#x27;s after the baby that you&#x27;ll know for sure what your skin will look like.  PS: I always wear an undershirt in case the oil were to stain my clothes but none of my undershirts are stained so I also like it for that reason.</li>
            <li> I used this religiously during my pregnancy to try to prevent stretch marks and IT WORKS! First let me say that I am very prone to stretch marks, having them on my hips from puberty growth spurt and previous weight gain as a teen. My mother has terrible crepe-like skin and stretchmarks on her tummy from her own pregnancies, too. I&#x27;ve read that this is usually a heriditary thing. So, I was not looking forward to never having a normal tummy again. I searched many reviews of many products, but I never came across a bad review for the Bio Oil. So, from about 3 mos. along when I started showing a bump, I used this twice a day on my tummy. I would use a very liberal amount and spend about 30 minutes rubbing it into my tummy. I grew so huge that my family was really scared for me, but I never got any marks! Well, one morning I did wake up to find two small red lines on the right underside of my belly. I showed my husband, brother, and sister-in-law that morning. I rubbed the Bio oil into them, and they disappeared by the next day. I swear! I do not have a single mark on my belly and the skin is not one bit crepe-like. It&#x27;s just like it was before I got pregnant! However, I was not so religious about rubbing the oil into my breasts, and I did get a few lines there. Also, I got more lines on the top of my thighs where I didn&#x27;t use the oil there very religiously either. To me, that is proof that this stuff works. I tell everyone who gets pregnant about it. I don&#x27;t know how it is for existing stretch marks, but it definitely can PREVENT stretch marks. My freinds and family are pretty amazed, too. I will stress that I used alot of the oil with every application and seriously did spend about 30 minutes rubbing it into the belly. Go ahead and buy about 3 or 4 of the largest bottles to last the entire pregnancy. The only thing I would&#x27;ve done differently is use it more onmy thighs, hips, and breasts. I hope this helps someone out there.</li>
            <li> used for 9 months, did nothing for skin elasticity or stretch marks. It may work to prevent stretch marks during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I was 10 weeks pregnant with my first baby. Everyone warned me that my belly will get really itchy in my 2nd-3rd trimester but as of today (35 weeks), I still don&#x27;t have itchy skin. My Mom had stretch marks (8 kids). 3 of my sisters have stretch marks while one has none (she didn&#x27;t use any products for prevention). I did start noticing a few little red dots on the bottom of my belly at 30 weeks, but as of today, they have not connected like a stretch mark. They still look like just little red dots. I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed and hope that&#x27;s the worse they&#x27;re going to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I gave it a 4 star is because it&#x27;s uncomforablly oily. I slather it on, then put a light tank top on, then my regular clothes and this seems to help me feel a bit more comfortable. My sister who has very oily skin did not like this product but I have very dry skin so it seems to \\&quot;fade\\&quot; into my skin after about 20-30 minutes. I use it 2x a day, morning and evening.</li>
            <li> I have been using bio-oil over a year now.  Not overly greasy and I really appreciate the larger bottle and price.  After 2 months of continuous usage on my face as a moisturizer, it helped fade old acne scarring. They are non existent now!! Might I add, I have very sensitive skin. It also reduced the appearance of a newer scar I had on my wrist due to a tattoo removal. Now, I&#x27;m in my last trimester of pregnancy, I am using bio-oil 2-3 times a day to help avoid/reduce (if at all possible) the much dreaded stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Bought it for preventing pregnancy stretch marks, and just started to use in from the beginning of 4th month. It&#x27;s easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t spill out, and it&#x27;s not too oily as I expected. Like the smell, and hope it works for the purpose.</li>
            <li> Best thing I have ever used my stretch marks disappeared in 2 months</li>
            <li> I used this through my pregnancy - didn&#x27;t really help much on the stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;I still use this after delivering the baby and I found this working so much better postpartum.&lt;br /&gt;This helps diminishing the look of my stretch marks (still redish and brownish).</li>
            <li> Its a good product. Have been using it on my tummy and legs. I have gotten compliments on how smooth and soft my legs are.&lt;br /&gt;used it on my tummy to prevent stretch mark from my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Bio oil is an amazing product. It really makes my skin soft and silky.  I haven&#x27;t been faithful in it&#x27;s application but it still has changed my skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is really perfumey, which bothers my nose a lot. I mix it with some moisturizer and put it on before bed. It absorbs nicely, so the smell doesn&#x27;t bother for long. Quite a lot in the bottle. I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my scars, but I break out a little bit if I use it every night.</li>
            <li> Tried this poroduct several months ago.  Happy to find a better price on Amazon.  Noticable improvements in old stretch marks, scars and facial wrinkles.  Nice light fragrance.  Wish bottle had a different lid.  Drop by drop sytem leads to dribbles down side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on 2 recent scars - a gash on my shoulder from a fence and a bad wound on my ankle from horse stirrups.  I put it on twice a day on both spots and they have healed well, and I can see the scars fading.</li>
            <li> Best product to prevent stretch marks. I&#x27;ve used it since the beginning of my pregnancy and so far so good. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use it nearly everyday and this product actually works. It keeps my skin feeling soft plus it gives an even tone with prolong use</li>
            <li> Love it! They&#x27;re gone!! Really works!</li>
            <li> Not that impressed.  It didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.  I read a lot of ratings and on this product.  Maybe just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is greasy and has made absolutely no change to my skin with regular use. I won&#x27;t buy any more of this highly-touted oil that does not do what it claims.</li>
            <li> I got s stretch marks after I had my first kid I bought bio oil and it helped out a lot less noticable there all white now they were red purple ish color now you can barely notice them I only get 4 stars because they didn&#x27;t work on all parts of my body I also got some in my inner thighs which were my darkest ones and it didn&#x27;t take those away but I didn&#x27;t use it long enough it became an expensive because I have to get a lot of bottles but it does work and if you&#x27;re looking for something you should tryyy it out doesn&#x27;t hurt to try I also continue using it with my second pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get any more thank god!!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a month, really like it. However, this order took 2 weeks to arrive, was surprised by this.</li>
            <li> Replaced my face cream with this. I used this product 2-3 times a day for around a year. The bottle lasts a loooong time. Deff worth the money, as results are visible.</li>
            <li> I have heard good things about bio oil, and i used it for months after breast surgery with literally no change at all! I used scarguard at first, and got great results..decided to try bio oil. I dont know why people were raving about it because it did absolutely nothing and didnt even absorb either. I wasted time that I couldve been using scarguard instead. This stuff isn&#x27;t for everyone, I know I wouldn&#x27;t reccommend it. I even tried it to make my uneven skin tone go away, an redness and it did nothing.</li>
            <li> Used this every single day in the last two trimesters of my pregnancy and I credit it 100% for why I ended up without any stretch marks. The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite but it WORKS. Really keeps the itch away too. I can&#x27;t speak to how it minimizes scars and stretch marks but I DO believe it prevents.</li>
            <li> Just love it, use it mainly to nourish my hair (use it sparingly) but excellent on skin as well.</li>
            <li> I love this! It makes my skin so soft I love it I love it I love it........it just makes the appearance of the skin almost perfect.</li>
            <li> Famous brand, famous goods. We love it. Hope it could give the surprise to me so that no scars on the skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for months, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a solution for scars, dry skin, and stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference.. but it made my skin soft</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I love Bio Oil.  I work in a very dry environment and my skin loves this product.</li>
            <li> goes on oily but soaks in makes my skin feel very soft</li>
            <li> I had bought Bio-Oil along with Trilastin 2 months ago,and I must say Bio-0il Works Wonders. I am 25 Weeks Pregnant and I started to develop strech marks on my inner thighs and breast area ( non on my stomach so far...Fingers Crossed) and i wanted to by a product to provent new strech marks and fade away my resent ones... Bio_Oil does this!!! After a week of using Bio-Oil I say my strech marks get a few lighter shades..I only apply it ones a day and it give my skin that extra moisture it needs for the whole day...Trilastin also works wonders but its like 7x&#x27;s more expensive... So if you are looking for a cheap product that does improve the appearance of strech marks this is it!!! Andd OHH YEAH i almost forgot (pregnancy brain lol) I used Bio-Oil on a scar i got 3 years ago on my calf from running in the woods (cross country runner...stick got stuck in me) and it completly faded it away..I am hispanic so when we get scars in looks darker than my already tan skin and it bumps up and the Bio-Oil made it look like i never had a scar.</li>
            <li> Started using this beginning of the 2nd trimester and now 9 months pregnant and I have no stretch marks!</li>
            <li> hardly any stretch marks from the pregnancy, woo hoo.  just make sure to put it on daily and nightly.</li>
            <li> Do t really work but the itching went away from growing Prego skin</li>
            <li> Before going on I must say that I&#x27;m not a twice a day user, but I do try my best to use it daily. My first time using bio oil a few years ago, I had great results after a relatively short period of time considering my use pattern. The stretch marks that were cleared up did not darken again after use. I now have new marks on my skin and decided to give my old friend a try once again. So far I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks and am already seeing results. My stretch marks first turn red then lighten. I&#x27;m currently at the red stage. As for scars, I&#x27;m not sure it works as well for mine as it does my stretch marks. I&#x27;m now using on my face to clear up dark spots. Hopefully it works its wonders on those.</li>
            <li> love this product, at 37 weeks i have no stretch marks on my belly, just remember to rub it on your hips as well!</li>
            <li> Got for post pregnancy stretch marks....used it twice, sits in my medicine cabinet, might as well rub Vaseline on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have to get over the oily-ness of the product. I mean it is straight up oil and I won&#x27;t fault it for that. I started off with Mama bee belly butter and it did nothing. NOTHING! I swear this has helped to slow the process. Also it&#x27;s not even belly marks, it&#x27;s inner thigh stretch marks. Yup, apparently that&#x27;s a thing.</li>
            <li> Has a nice scent but when applied to my face, can cause plugging of my pores or breakouts which is undesirable.  I use it to moisturize my legs and feet.  Not my favorite product but better than using Vaseline! Sort of leaves an oily film until you work it into your skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and I believe that my age spots are less brown.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 2 weeks ago and have been using it for about 1 week now, twice a day, morning and night, and i have to say that my stretch marks that i got during pregnancy.....are practically almost gone!!!!! no lie! I was really surprised at how fast it works and even though I still have a few they have lightened in color and size significantly and the skin on my tummy (which was kinda loose) seems to be tightening as well, maybe because i&#x27;m doing alot of ab exercises of late to complement the smooth skin. I also use a little bit of it on my face to even out my skin tone. Plus it smells really great. Its not oily or greasy, it absorbs really good into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to ANYBODY who has stretch marks, scars and dry skin etc......great product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this light weight oil, I use it to help my skin fade old scars and it seems to be working...  :)</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Really works!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It smells so good and feels very good on my pregnant tummy!  I am 18 weeks and have not seen any stretch marks so far (and i know i will get them because my mom did).  I can&#x27;t say for sure that this oil prevented them but i haven&#x27;t had ANY itching so far and i am religious about putting it on 3x daily!  Also, let it dry for a couple minutes before putting a shirt on because it will leave a mark (that should come out in the wash).</li>
            <li> I  purchased this item because a Salon Rep burned my armpits during waxing. The Salon recommended this oil to me. I was very hesitant because it was oil. I initially tried it on another dark mark to see how it would work. Just after one week I saw the mark had lightened. I could really see the difference. I also began using it on other blemishes and marks on my legs and arms ALL fading tremendously. GREAT stuff!!!! So, I am currently trying it on my burn mark so I will update further as time progresses. Downfall, I can not wear deodorant when I apply the Bio Oil, and being summertime I&#x27;m limited to clothing, activities and/or using the Bio Oil where I really need it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for stretch marks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very skeptical online buyer so I do lots of research on a product before purchasing it. Of course I was skeptical on the reviews but I saw this oil everywhere. I have old but light stretch marks between my thighs &amp; on my muffin top from gaining/losing weight, &amp; also a very unattractive dark shade inbetween my inner thighs from skin friction. I saw good results in only A WEEK of using. I&#x27;m not kidding. This oil REALLY did lighten the darkness of the skin, &amp; made my stretch marks less noticeable when going out in a bikini. Keep in mind this won&#x27;t make your stretch marks disppear, only make it a lot less noticable. Also results vary depending how big &amp; deep your stretch marks are. If you have small &amp; light ones like mine you may get results faster.</li>
            <li> used while pregnant and both times no stretch marks!</li>
            <li> I have been noticing &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34; on my forearms and its become kind of embarrassing!  I have considered wearing long sleeves all the time.  Since I have been using Bio-oil I have been seeing changes and lightening of the spots.  My arms aren&#x27;t so dry either.  I burned my arm with a curling iron and usually I have trouble with my skin healing.  while using Bio-oil the healing process was super fast and was amazing!  I am sold.  I use it on my face when I go to bed and have noticed wrinkles arent as deep and a more even tone.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft after I use it.  It absorbs nicely leaving your skin feeling and smelling great.  I didn&#x27;t get stretch marks but I can&#x27;t say for sure if it prevented them.</li>
            <li> A++++++++ Excellent seller and product</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. I have several stretch marks from having twins and I can&#x27;t say whether or not they have diminished. However, I can say that I keep this in my shower and it makes my skin feel incredible. It also smells pretty good. I would highly recommend this oil if not only to help with your skins elasticity, but to help you skin feel extremely soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Help keep my face soft - I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I saw no change in my stretch marks after a few bottles. It does help on my face though when my skin is extra dry.</li>
            <li> I did still get some stretch marks while pregnant and used 2x a day, but it did help!</li>
            <li> i like the feel of it, although im not sure it is working.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing body oil.</li>
            <li> Bio-Oil has been a savior for my skin.  Winter has made my skin so dry and chapped that it hurts. Bio-Oil in the morning helps keep my skin from the painful itch of the dry winter weather.</li>
            <li> Great blemish reducer</li>
            <li> People feel very comfortable</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and still have not seen any changes to the marks on my body.  It has not fade the stretch marks either.  It smells great but other than that I have not seen any changes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this after a light layer of cortisone and seen a slight difference the first week for my peeling eczema. The second week, my makeup glides on much easier without the cakekiness.  I like the way it dries. Not too shiny and doesn&#x27;t feel oily after a few seconds. I&#x27;m extremely dry on my face and neck, so this oil absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen any major color correction. My tone has not evened out yet. Scars look the same. It&#x27;s only been about a month, will update if I see any new changes</li>
            <li> Been using bio oil for a while. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman and this worked great for evening out my skin tone. Didn&#x27;t do anything for dark spots, but great overall. Also acne and pimples were never a big problem for me, but I have noticed that when I use this product consistently I don&#x27;t get even the occasional ones.</li>
            <li> I have used bio Oil for the last several months and it seems to do the job. Well into my first trimester, I had gotten some stretch marks on my belly and sides. After using this for a month straight, alot of my stretch marks had gone away and I didnt notice any new ones either. Such a big improvement! I unfortunately lost my bottle and have to reorder more. New stretch marks have came back as a result of me stopping usage but I am not worried because it will eventually go away with use of this product. I highly suggest applying this oil as directed because it will clear and prevent new marks.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for an individual that uses this product quite regularly.  A little of this product seems to go a long way.  Would purchase through here again.</li>
            <li> i WISH IT WOULD WORK FASTER!aFTER 6 MONTHS MY STRETCH MARKS ARE LIGHTER. i HOPE THEY&#x27;LL DISAPPEAR!Be paTIENT, IT TAKES TIME!</li>
            <li> Came quickly and improved the appearance of my stretch marks!</li>
            <li> Good seller but product doesn&#x27;t do much justice on stretchmarks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 18. I have stretch marks not from pregnancy and I&#x27;m not fat at all, I just grew really fast.  I&#x27;ve had stretchmarks for about 4 yrs until I started doing something about them. I initially used palmers cocoa butter but that didn&#x27;t work. Bio oil lightened my stretchmarks from years ago and now I feel comfortable wearing a bikini !!!!</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone having a baby!</li>
            <li> I was excited about trying this product but one month after applying the oil, the stretch marks got darker. It&#x27;s been 12 years after my first child and all my stretch marks were white and somewhat faded. Now they&#x27;re dark in color and more noticeable. I&#x27;m so disappointed and upset how my body looks. I stopped using it and hopefully the damage is reversed.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Purchased for myself and various family members.  Smells wonderful, doesn&#x27;t stain clothing. Scars beginning to fade</li>
            <li> i was excited to try this product because of the great reviews on this site. when i finally received it, i read that it will take at least 3 months to see results. i started to use this twice daily every single day for at least 3 weeks on my stretch marks. i notice that not only did i not see any changes but new stretch marks appeared!! right above my existing marks were new red ones!! i&#x27;m assuming that the oil made my skin stretch out and caused this to happen. it does make your skin soft, but other than that i do not recommend this at all to lighten stretch marks, instead maybe to prevent your skin from stretching during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. For scars as well as hair and dry skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any scars, but I use it on my face and hands in place of a moisturizer before my bed. My face and hands absorbed it very well. I liked that feeling of softness.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product at a low price plus fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I am shocked at the bad reviews. Bio Oil is nothing short of a miracle. 4 months ago, I had a spinal fusion surgery which was unfortunately complicated by a MRSA infection. My incision failed to heal for 10 weeks, and I was forced to rely on a wound vac to close the surgical wound. As soon as the wound healed, I began applying Bio Oil two to three times a day. 5 weeks later, the scar is lighter, softer, less grainy and SMALLER! The product is easy to use, has a fresh scent, and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes. It is a light and highly absorbent oil that comforts itchy, irritated skin. I will continue to use this product not only on my scar, but to maintain moisture on hands, lips, toes.. everywhere. It is amazing! You will be highly satisfied with your purchase.</li>
            <li> Has not done as it says it can ( stretch marks, etc). Use it as a after shower oil</li>
            <li> Used it to rid of small stretch marks on my breast , instead it made them deeper... So sad</li>
            <li> It works to smooth out strech marks n fade them but they do not disappear. It works great for the price.</li>
            <li> This bottle of bio-oil is really a great price for the amount you get.  I put it on my hands every night and it is oily at first but then seems to penetrate my skin.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about how much I love this stuff.It feels and smells wonderful. I&#x27;ve noticed when I use this on my arms and neck, I can&#x27;t keep from feeling how smooth they feel. This stuff smells delicious,very pleasant aroma. I wish I could afford to buy a gallon of this stuff..Love, love,love this oil.Try it, you&#x27;ll see what I mean. I originally bought it for my son to try for stretch marks on his stomach but after trying it myself on my face just to see what it might help with, I had to buy my own and in a larger bottle. I have been using this product for close to 2 months now and take it with me everywhere.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have stretch marks yet so I don&#x27;t know if this really works but it makes my skin smooth and it smells so good. I like it. I think I will continue buying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil daily for the past couple of months and find it keeps my skin dewey-looking.  I have melasma on my face, but do not notice any fading per se, but it seems to enhance effect of hydroquinone, a skin lightener, when used together.  I couldn&#x27;t figure how some reviewers said it faded skin discoloration, which immediately returned after discontinued use of the product.  It seems the oil refracts the light and gives the appearance discoloration is gone when it really isn&#x27;t.  To me, that means it might hide some of my skin flaws when I use it.  I like that it does not clog my pores, and does not have an unpleasant or strong odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very nice, light, facial oil, that gives aging skin a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had plenty of scarring from acme (that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ll say on that), so I had plenty of high hopes for this. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for the past month now, and it looks like it&#x27;s working. The dark spots on my arms that were there for years seem to be getting lighter--those on my face a bit less noticeable now. The only major gripe I have about this is that my hands are really oily after I apply it; though its to be expected, but oils are always hard to wash off. Looking good so far though!</li>
            <li> Have not tried for scar/mark minimizing, but, it is not intended for facial use as it will clog your pores and cause some breakout.</li>
            <li> im not sure about the efficiency of the product, i just stated using it.. but gave 5 star because it got here as promised.</li>
            <li> I have ordered many times in the past.  This is a great product and it works wonderfully. I will continue to buy as long as it is produced.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> worked great for my skin, but i of course still got stretch marks. bio oil takes away all the itch though and to me finding an oil to do that was worth it. ill take my tiger stripes just stop the itch!</li>
            <li> Love the product!! Great price and recieved fast as promised. Already ordered more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still waiting to see if it helps the marks on my sekin. Feels great, has a plesant scent, locks in moisture all day.</li>
            <li> This product is simply amazing.  I have very sensitive skin and I&#x27;m currently pregnant.  All my stretch zone areas were itchy and driving me crazy until I started using this.  I put it on every night before I go to bed.  My skin is so soft and not itchy at all.  I try to remember to put it on in the morning too, but I&#x27;m usually in such a rush that I forget.  I read somewhere that this is what Princess Kate used and she didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks.  I&#x27;m 30 weeks pregnant and I don&#x27;t have any new stretch marks, only old ones that have kind of showed up a little more prominently.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.  I tend to have very dry cuticles that peel easily, and this oil helps a lot!</li>
            <li> i use this oil in my hair, on my face, anywhere i want to moisturize . although i am a oil lover. i prefer oils for my up keep, over lotions. keep them wrinkles away, lOL.  and i have found it is also good for making redness go away in your skin from a wound. seems to heal much quicker.</li>
            <li> 3 stars only because it&#x27;s too early to tell if it works for intended purpose.</li>
            <li> Does nothing bottom line!</li>
            <li> Worry about unsafe ingredients, there is no use</li>
            <li> Bio-oil is great. You question if it does anything but if you take before and after pictures it clearly does, especially for darker skin.</li>
            <li> One of the most comfortable skin touch I have felt with moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;I do feel the goodness of this Bio-oil product. It is reliable and has been building trustworthy from the first time I am using..&lt;br /&gt;I will keep update for this amazing product which I have never thought I would us. (I used to buy Erno Laszlo, Lancome, etc.. Until my house burned and I got to be independent from my parents..)</li>
            <li> I was super inconsistent on using the product. Def lubes you up and i like the smell. But I cannot say I&#x27;ve seen difference in stretch marks</li>
            <li> This stuff made my stretch marks slightly dissapear and it also made my skin very very smooth i wish it was bigger i used it all up in a month</li>
            <li> not sure yet rubbing it on my scar so far it looks the same.. I see the first ingredient is mineral oil not so good probably coconut oil would work the same.  but it does obsorb pretty well that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face too!  I got my dad addicted to it as well.  It really does keep skin moist.  I use it for my heels and elbows in the winter.  Love the fact that it is nearly scentless.  My dog seems to like licking it off my leg too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that the bottle is small and I use it up quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for some tiny scars I had after having contact dermatitis. It didn&#x27;t seem to help those spots at all though. I did find that it works well as a moisturizer and have been using it for that though, so it&#x27;s not wasted.</li>
            <li> Really help on my dry skin around elbows and knees.  Not too greasy when apply on skin.  Very light nice smell.  May help the appearance a little bit on strechmark but not get rid of it.  May have to use it as normal routine everyday to reduce the visibility of strechmark.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this product just wasn&#x27;t for me. I do not have extreme blotches or marks on my skin. I do however have a problem with my skin tone being uneven and this product fit the bill. I am sometimes at a loss whether to use it at night and get my pillow oily or use it during the day and have my skin looking oily. I have yet to master its usage.</li>
            <li> -  Great Moisturizer: I have dry skin, yet just 4 drops can keep my face moisturized for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;-  Great toner:  my face is even out.  No more red blotch here and there.&lt;br /&gt;-  Radian Skin:  my face is more radian instead of the bluish looking when you are tired.  I look more alive now :)&lt;br /&gt;-  Reduce dark spot:  Not as significant as I would like, but the dark spots are not as prominent.  i won&#x27;t blame this product since I have a habit of picking at my pimples, which preventing them to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely use this product from now on.</li>
            <li> Even after using as instructed, this oil had no effect whatsoever and is simply an embellished body oil. Thankfully I purchased these on sale.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my brother after he had had both knees replaced.  He used this on the scars as he healed and said it helped keep the skin supple.  Fortunately he lives where he could wear shorts as this product is an oil and it takes a while to absorb and will leave greasy, oily (what else?) marks on clothing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have only Ben using it for about a week now and can already see a difference. I recently had spine surgery on my lower back and have a scar that is about 5 inches. I can already see that is becoming smoother and my Doctor noticed too!. You only need to use a small amount and massage over the desires area. The bottle is a good size so I think it will last me for 2 maybe 3 months. I rubbed a litlle around the eyes (not to close to the eyes) since it says it&#x27;s for aging skin too so I saw a difference in the morning. Really recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used it for about 3-4 days.  The smell was OK and it was not greasy.  At first, I was satisfied with this product BUT after the three-day uses I got puppp which caused my belly very itchy every day and night.  Fortunately, I got recovered after I stopped using it for one week.  I think I will never dare to put this oil on my body again.  Maybe I am just allergic to some ingredient of it.</li>
            <li> Very effective for sensitive oily skin. Notice big improvement in 2 days! Must use 2 times a day to see improvement.</li>
            <li> Bio oil was recommended to me by my dermatologist for my scars. The product works (and takes time so don&#x27;t rush it) so I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone. The product from this seller came quickly and without any problems. The bottle is not big enough for all the scars I have (from mosquito bites in south america, ugh) but I know I can rely on this seller to buy from them again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Got it from Costco used all of them (2 bottle package)2 times a day for .. maybe 2 month- nothing happened... returned !!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as soon as I found out I was pregnant.  I probably bought it having too high of expectations.  It does keep my skin on my belly very soft and hydrated but I thought it would do a little better of a job at keeping my strech marks on the lighter side.  I have however purchased another bottle for after my baby is born in hopes that it helps the ugly marks fade quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other cheaper alternatives like baby oil but this is by far the best and it also smells nice.  I don&#x27;t have scarring but I use it to hydrate my face before make up and after shower at night.  I wish it was less expensive but most places sell for $20 but with Amazon it&#x27;s $5 cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great product. So far it is preventing any stretch marks on my stomach. It absorbs well and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used this throughout my entire pregnancy and I did not get one stretch mark!!! I put it on 2-3 times a day and use a fair amount each time.  I will warn you that if you put your clothes on immediately after applying you will stain your clothes. I typically go through one bottle every 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Just so so for my sister.</li>
            <li> genuine product with much lower price</li>
            <li> Helps to decrease scarring in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Worth purchasing. Noticeable decrease of scar appearance with consistent use. I also use as a moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li> As you can see, I&#x27;ve used barley any of this so far and holy cow it has already made such a HUGEEE difference. I&#x27;ve been purchasing this at a local drugstore only to find it on Amazon for much cheaper (I will clearly be repurchasing here instead)! But for starters, you can use this just about anywhere on anything (on the body)... I use it on my face to even out my skin tone and hydrate my skin (which it does both amazingly), I use it on my rashes and eczema due to having OVERLY sensitive skin (as long as it&#x27;s not an open rash from scratching -shame on me-) and it clears it right up in a day or so, I use it on burns or sunburns and they literally disappear in days, I use it on my stretch marks from my now 2 year old son and they went from very noticeable, thick and ugly to me being very comfortable in shorts or a bikini  again (thank you bio oil!) I use it on my cellulite and it really takes it down, and I use it on any redness or blemishes I see absolutely anywhere. This stuff is a godsend and I will never go without it now. It has so many uses and works so amazingly. I highly recommend this stuff!!! Highlyyyy!!!&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: it is called bio OIL... so it is oily and will take time to sink in. After first application, you will look greasy, but this will go away. If using under makeup (which I do everyday, can be used as a moisturizer/toner) you need to not only blend it into your skin veryyyy well using a beauty blender or some sort of sponge and realllllyyy work it into your skin but, you also need to wait at least 10-20 minutes before applying any primer, foundation, etc. The oil will absorb all your makeup if you do not wait. If used properly and you wait the allotted time, this will absolutely help to give you a smooth flawless look.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this stuff. OK- first off, need to address a previous review that say this doesn&#x27;t work for wrinkles, age spots and that it is TOO expensive to use for these purposes. Uh, HELLO! Have you looked at what the beauty industry is charging for anything that is supposed to be &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34;! Upwards of &amp;#62;$100, easily!! That said, this is an absolute steal for the price. I&#x27;ve been using for about 1 month. It has totally changed the overall appearance of my skin and I&#x27;ve had many comments remarking on how my skin is &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve also compared the top of my hands and the effect- I used on the top of left hand and not right. Left hand is SO smooth and soft with younger appearance and right hand has larger, deeper lines of aging.&lt;br /&gt;To keep this short, I will be using this regularly and would absolutely recommend without hesitation!</li>
            <li> Great product! Use it everyday.... Tones skin &amp; eliminates dryness. Not greasy. I have very dry skin so I use after each shower.</li>
            <li> Smell really good and I&#x27;m using it everyday. Hopefully it works for the stretch marks. The bad thing is the shipping company they are using now, it is the WORST.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Highly recommend for all types of skin issues scars dark spots etc... I use it at night on My Face for an extra layer of moisture..... \\&quot;</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it religiously. It has made my stretch marks nearly vanish. They are not noticeable unless I look very closely. This product does not work right away. You must have patience. It took two bottles before my stretch marks faded. It is a bit greasy and has an odd smell, but I don&#x27;t mind it because of how wondefully it works. This product shipped quickly and was in great shape when it arrived.</li>
            <li> love this product will be ordering again in 3 months or maybe earlier then that!!!</li>
            <li> It moisturize my skin. But i have not seen a noticeable result</li>
            <li> Good after shower moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I bought this during both of my pregnancies. I started using this during my second trimester like the bottle suggested, but unfortunately I still got a few stretch marks at 8 1/2 months pregnant. Everywhere I&#x27;ve heard, stretch marks are genetic and are inevitable no matter what you use. So I can&#x27;t really speak too negatively of this product as I don&#x27;t think any product would have completely prevented them.That being said I still like this product. My skin got really itchy while pregnant and using this definitely helped and made my skin feel so soft. Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but for me it lasted a  long time. I had plenty left after pregnancy and still continued to use them on stretch marks to help fade them. After awhile you could barely see them anymore.</li>
            <li> This product has amazed me.  I have only been using this product a short time (maybe two months) for stretch marks and scars and I have literally seen results in that time.  Scars diminish very quickly and the stretch marks smooth out.  They have not completely disappeared and I don&#x27;t expect that to be the results, but they definitely look a whole lot better.  This oil is also very good for softening the skin, so this will always be a part of my beauty regimen - for life!</li>
            <li> Have used a bottle, but did not see any effect, others spent three years said that basically could not see stretch marks, so I choose to continue to use</li>
            <li> I found out about the Bio Oil a few weeks ago through a beauty product blog, and the blogger holding up this gem as the most perfect oil she has ever used in her life. I was so skeptical at first, because I have tried everything. On my face, I had acne scars on my cheeks, little break outs here and there, and black heads on my nose. On the sides of my legs? More stretch mark scars. On my back and shoulders, even more acne scars. The Bio Oil arrived in my mailbox only around 3 DAYS AGO. Keep this in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening up the translucent orange bottle, I already immediately hated it. It was so oily, and that is its only downside. I have never ever been of fan of oils, because I have always associated it with a catalyst for furthering acne. Not this treasure though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it on my cheeks, cringing at how oily it was. I continued on my nose, forehead,  shoulders, thighs, and hips. The instructions say to use twice daily, so I used it twice daily, morning and night. (Also, I went about excessive with the oil in certain areas.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Low and behold, almost EVERY MARK IS GONE. On the back of the bottle, it says to use it for 3 MONTHS daily to see optimal results. Within 3 DAYS, my acne scars on my face have vanished. IT IS A MIRACLE OIL, DO NOT OVERLOOK THIS. My acne? Gone. My blackheads? Non-existent. The scars? I wonder if they were even there to begin with and it was all in my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acne scars on my back are on their way to vanishing, and as for the stretchmarks on my thighs, I await promising results. My skin there is already smoother, cleaner, softer and evenly toned in color. This goes for my face as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has never looked better ever. Everything is becoming the same tone of color, blending in beautifully absent of any scars or marks or acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I hate how oily the product is, it is a miracle oil and I want to slap myself for ever thinking otherwise. Your face will not look dry or even matte, it will look GLOWING. It moisturizes and heals your face. When you walk out of your door, people will wonder what you have done to look so evanescent and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already received comments about my skin and how &amp;#34; beautiful&amp;#34; I look now. DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE AND IGNORE THIS PRODUCT, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and I hope you made the right choice in buying this product, I certainly did!</li>
            <li> I bought this at Costco, in hopes it would be the magic cure for my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using this I was using Acne.org products, (pretty much their whole line). They worked okay, they really dried out my skin and would ball up if I tried to use sunscreen or other serums with it. Also, the treatment bleached my clothes and bathroom rugs..... I saw some improvement in my acne, but it took a lot of time to do the whole routine and the bleaching of my clothes sucked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried adding this to the routine, it is not compatible. I got the balling up of the products. So after over a year on the acne.org stuff I said to hell with it and stopped using it. I started using the Bio-oil as a moisterzier along with ROC daily moisterizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would not absorb into my skin at all. I would say I have normal/combo oil levels in my skin. Maybe the acne.org stuff dried out my skin so much that it started producing more oils than normal?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I used 1 pump of the ROC moisterizer which is about a 1/3 teaspoon, (pretty small amount) and 2 drops of this stuff. My face was so greasy. I would go through about 3-4 of those rice paper blotting sheets. Then I started breaking out. I hoped if I stuck it out like the other reviews said, my face would clear up and I would have radiantly clear skin.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month straight of constant break outs. I am throwing in the towel. I&#x27;m not sure how it could help my skin if all it does is sit on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might work for you if you have verrrryyyy dry skin.</li>
            <li> It soaks into your skin, leaves no greasy residue, and light fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used on scare tissue to soften them and prevent itching.</li>
            <li> 36 weeks pregnant and still no stretch marks!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister who&#x27;s pregnant. She uses it every day to minimize the appearance of stretch marks. She loves it!!</li>
            <li> this product is ok. i bought it because alot of people claimed it helped with stretch marks. it didn&#x27;t do anything for me. it helped my skin feel hydrated but that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> Started using it my second trimester for stretch marks. Thought it was working until I woke up at 36 weeks pregnant with a belly full if stretch marks. I used this combined with Palmers massage butter for stretch marks and tummy butter. Nothing works. I guess if your going to get them nothing can stop it</li>
            <li> I have so many stretch marks and scars from my life, and this sure helps. Yes it does take time to start showing improvement, but with daily use it will happen. WAY CHEAPER here on Amazon then if you were to buy it in stores. A little goes a long way so even this size bottle can last you quite some time. Its a small light weight bottle, I even carry it in my purse!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 7 months pregnant &amp; have been using the oil for a month.&lt;br /&gt;Feels lightweight &amp; keeps my tummy moisturized for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell though, so I only use it at night.</li>
            <li> A friend introduced this product to me and says it&#x27;s good to remove operation scar. Hope it have effect.</li>
            <li> Only being 19 I already had stretch marks on my waist line, some on the side on my thighs , and also up my side. I had been using coco butter but didn&#x27;t see the results I wanted. I started using bio oil and the lighter stretch marks started slowly fading away. It doesn&#x27;t work quickly it usually takes about 2 weeks before you actually start seeing improvements and this is only for the lighter and newer ones. For the darker and older ones I use bio oil but I would also apply african shea butter on them also. I notice if I use both the oil and the butter everyday in the morning and at night the stretch marks were fading quicker than before. At the end of the week I use a vitamin e oil just to tighten up the skin. Over all I loveee the product !</li>
            <li> This item is almost gone in my bathroom since I use it every time I shower (once I&#x27;m dried off). You can see changes within 72 hours and it smells great. I will likely have to re-stock very soon.</li>
            <li> I have a few stretch marks that have really healed up well with this product. I think it is amazing and I love this price!</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have ever given in my life. I purchased Bio Oil for stretch marks.  It works great! :)I am so happy with Bio Oil. I use it in conjunction with Strivectin and it has virtually made my stretch marks disappear within 4-6 weeks. Do not waste your time with other products; spend the money and use Strivectin and Bio Oil and you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I am using this product during my third pregnancy. I love how it absorbs fast so I can get out of the shower put it on and forget about it. It moisturizes well and I only use it once a day. I don&#x27;t have an itchy belly like I did with my past pregnancies. I&#x27;ve seen little changes in my previous stretchmarks and I am waiting for the results on new stretch marks, I haven&#x27;t noticed any new ones though. So far so good!</li>
            <li> My wife had double knee replacement surgery in July and swears by this oil for minimizing the resulting scars.  Take it from me, it works.</li>
            <li> Good product, but takes a LOOONNNGGG time to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this oil. It actually does what it claims to do. I&#x27;m am glad I can order it from Amazon because it can be hard to locate in stores.</li>
            <li> I really thought it would work for me but after using it I did not see any difference. It does smell good though</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 2 months now and I can tell you, you will see a difference in the appearance of a scar with this. I use it morning and night post washing. I have a scar on each of my cheeks and one on my eyelid from an accident. I use a drop on each location, massage for a few and  let it dry. I have replaced my makeup primer with this as my face is always succulent now. this bottle is also so big I have used maybe a 1/2 inch of it so far at daily use on 3 places.</li>
            <li> What should other customers know when considering this item?&lt;br /&gt;What aspects of this item do you like or dislike?&lt;br /&gt;How do you use this item?&lt;br /&gt;What similar items have you used?&lt;br /&gt;Was the quality of this item above or below your expectations?&lt;br /&gt;To see the full guidelines for writing reviews on Amazon, go here.</li>
            <li> Other than the smell--which isn&#x27;t awful, just not to my liking--I&#x27;m surprised by this stuff. I got it for my mastectomy scars but then when my face got really dry from my Retin A and hydroquinone combo  I used it on my face. My skin has changed from age and cancer treatment; I suspect if I&#x27;d used this before all that I&#x27;d have cystic acne--but now when i use it at night i get compliments on my skin aling the lines of &#x27;have you done something&#x27;? For an &#x27;aging&#x27; woman or man I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li> leaky bottle in shipment. so many people sell fakes, I wonder if this is one of them</li>
            <li> Bio-oil really does work.  The fragrance is very light and pleasant.  I used it on a surgical scar, and it is now barely visible.  It works great and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I just love this oil. I have been using this for couple of weeks now and my skin feels amazing. I do not know yet about the stretch marks but i love the smell and it instantly absorbs into the skin. And I also feel it moisturizes my skin amazingly. So i just love it. Probably it would take more time to see a result in my stretch marks and then i will update again.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review only two weeks after starting this product so it may not be as accurate as if I was using this long term as the product states, but it definitley makes my skin feel softer. Using this on my tummy, sides and scar after two c section pregnancies. Hope to see great results</li>
            <li> Love love love this oil. Originally bought for stretch marks. The look and feel of my skin was so great that two other family members are using it. One for old acne scars and the other family member as a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I heard lots of good reviews on Bio-Oil for pregnancy stretch marks. I regret purchasing it because it gave me a really bad red rash that lasted about 2 weeks! I switched to Mustela and I have to say that I did not developed any reaction and haven&#x27;t seen any stretch marks yet.</li>
            <li> Very nice...lightweight and soft fragrance.</li>
            <li> Waiting to see result after 6 mos to a year</li>
            <li> I am currently 7 1/2 months pregnant, and am willing to try anything to keep stretch marks away. I saw an ad for this on tv and thought I would give it a try. So far I have not noticed any difference on my body - I have been using it for 2 months now. But I guess that means it&#x27;s working. I have been using it 1-2x a day, and after every shower.</li>
            <li> It wasnt the best. I heard from other people that it was great and this and that. But honestly it wasnt worth it. At all...</li>
            <li> I love Bio-Oil and use it all the time!  I use it at night and under makeup; not too oily and feels great.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s any better than less expensive oils, but I will stick with this.  I use it on &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34; where I&#x27;ve had things removed (basil cell, etc)  I know my sister had melanomas on her face and twice surgery and you can hardly tell, she uses Bio-Oil!!!  Sells it for me.</li>
            <li> Bio-oil is good for face, scars and diminish the look of scars and spots. Moisturizes well helping to soften and smoothen the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using bio-oil now for a couple of months.  I leaves my skin  feeling smooth, and the spots and lines are diminishing.</li>
            <li> it is really perfect, wish sell more things like this, wonderful for each one, good product, thank you a lot</li>
            <li> Love this product.I would recommend this product to friends and family. I have noticed a difference in how light my stretch marks look from my previous pregnancy. Works great.</li>
            <li> Product works great on recent scars but it doesn&#x27;t do much for old ones. It helps even out skin tone and works well as moisturizer. I have very sensitive skin. During winter skin around the side of nose dies to the point of bleeding. Since I started using the oil ,about a year ago, haven&#x27;t had that issue.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, use it at night, washes off in the shower in the am.The larger size of the Bio-oil (4.2 oz) last about sixty days.</li>
            <li> Pretty cheap for its size. I&#x27;m not sure if the product works or if it&#x27;s too soon to tell. I&#x27;ve been using this since my 2nd trimester and I don&#x27;t see any stretch marks yet.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it a 3 because it doesn&#x27;t smell like the ones I got from Walgreens. I&#x27;m not sure if this is real or what. This one&#x27;s too smelly.</li>
            <li> This stuff does what it says its gonna do! I&#x27;ve been  using for a month now and the dark marks are really fading away.  Glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> For stretch marks and other skin blimishes this is a great product. Use sparingly and often and you will see a difference.</li>
            <li> This a great smelling product, but it&#x27;s not overpowering.  My skin feels great after using it.  As to claims that it&#x27;s great for scarring, I can&#x27;t say.  I just know that my skin feels silky after applying it.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my plastic surgeon after I had a torn earring hole repaired. Works *****amazingly***** well. After 3 months there is barely any trace of a scar!! I had the other earlobe repaired a few years ago and wasn&#x27;t given the suggestion to use Bio-Oil that time, and I really wish I would have known about it-- the difference in the two scars is night and day!! I thought it was a bit expensive when I bought it, but a little goes a LONG way and it is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I went ahead and read reviews on oils to use while pregnant to avoid stretchmarks. I first started out with the palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter formula but hated the smell and texture. I then went ahead and tried this and also bought the Mama Mio oil. The two oils are pretty similar to one another but I prefer the bio-oil to the Mama Mio oil as it is easier to wash off your hands once you have applied. The price is also much better for the bio oil. I would definitely recommend this product. I&#x27;m currently 8 months pregnant and have no stretch marks and only use at night.</li>
            <li> This product works !!!&lt;br /&gt;It takes like a year to see drastic results.&lt;br /&gt;Way better that bleaching creams . and I would rather use this&lt;br /&gt;product around my eyes than any overnight cream.I learned about creams  the&lt;br /&gt;hard way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;patience is the key with this product</li>
            <li> I recently set out to purchase my family&#x27;s christmas on amazon.com. I was extremely excited to get it all done at once and with 3 kids it would have been so easy and super helpful. Unfortunately I got to the end of my shopping venture and had over 150.00 in shipping fees :(. This was unfortunate. So I decided I would join amazon prime. So I paid the 79.00$ fee and away with my order I went. But amazon prime does not cover third party shipping. I was iterated about this. I was trying to spend almost 600.00 on my order and the extra 79.00 I had just spent didnt even touch my shipping charges. So I called.  They put me on hold for over 20 min and hung up on me. So i called again. They put me on hold again for 20 min to tell me there was nothing they could do about it. By the time I had gone back to try and find amazon products to switch out for the third party items some of the items I had chosen were gone completely. How did amazon respond to this? Well they wrote me an email and gave me a 15.00 gift card..... thats right I wanted to spend 600.00 and they thought it would make it all better by giving me 15.00.... haha what a joke to say the least. I felt extreamly insulted.  Amazon made me feel like my problem was not theres and they did not care at all. It made me feel like I was shopping at walmart! So no I dont want your 15.00 you can keep that and give it to someone else.</li>
            <li> I not really not work try later togther cocoa butter formula lotion stretch marks. Pleause not send me bio oil.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this product but it has really helped to reduce the appearance of my stretch marks. And I don&#x27;t even use it every day as recommended. The scent of it is a little odd, but not disgusting. I&#x27;m willing to put up with the smell if it helps me.</li>
            <li> nice smell, do not know the effect now</li>
            <li> It is very nice I like it very much hope it can help me</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and I used it with my pregnancy,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 30 and have combination, acne (cystic) prone skin and was worried about how oily it would be on my skin, but I have no problems at all. I wash my face and apply the Bio-Oil, then a light moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t feel too thick and I can even wear it under makeup. I think it has already started lightening my skin. I&#x27;ve also used it on other body parts with darker skin, we will see how it affects those.</li>
            <li> 7 months pregnant and no stretch marks so far... I&#x27;ve used bio oil twice a day since the first trimester</li>
            <li> I wish this helped... But does absolutely nothing to help scars/stretchmarks</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter uses this to moisturize her faces.  No greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Bio oil skincare oil is an an excellent product. This is definitely a nice product and continue using it long.</li>
            <li> Wife was told about this product and tried it. She is very pleased with the results. The best proof is in the trying.</li>
            <li> I started using this late in my pregnancy and immediately after baby about once a day. My baby is 4 months now and you can barely see my stretch marks. This is my 2nd bottle. Its recommended to apply 2-3 times a day early on in your pregnancy. I&#x27;ll definitely be starting to use it more regularly and earlier with my next baby. I still see them, but my husband is way impressed that after only a couple of months they were practically gone.</li>
            <li> It works great and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. I would recommend it to everyone to buy it.</li>
            <li> smells wired, but i will see how it work</li>
            <li> Been using It for a month now and haven&#x27;t change the appearance of my scars so far. If you have hyperpigmentation spots don&#x27;t think this will get rid of them.</li>
            <li> this stuff is like magic! very nice scent too!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my belly during pregnancy however it has a derivative of retinol in it. I waited until after my pregnancy to use it. Overall it is a decent oil just not great for pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Bi-oil is the best at lightening old and new scars our skin imperfections.  I buy this product it regularly.  It works better than traditional vitamin e oil.  I bought it on my own accord, but my doctor was impressed I chose such a great product.  Results can be seen in no time.</li>
            <li> good stuff&lt;br /&gt;liked product&lt;br /&gt;liked speed of delivery&lt;br /&gt;liked price&lt;br /&gt;liked packaging&lt;br /&gt;liked it, period&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no problems... amen brother..........amen&lt;br /&gt;good stuff</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good deal</li>
            <li> As an expecting parent you read all sorts of articles to determine what are the best products whilst trying to ensure you get good value for money. As instructed I have just started my second trimester and begun to use the bio oil twice daily. Hopefully it will help to prevent any stretch marks as my mother has some pretty deep and dark ones on her stomach and thighs. I sometimes add some palmers stretch mark cream during the day just to ensure that my skin in those stretch mark prone areas are well moisturized. I heard that&#x27;s the most that can be done, keeping the skin lubricated! I&#x27;m certainly going to try my best to keep the regime for the entire pregnancy and keep the faith that no stretch marks appear! Can&#x27;t hurt as I see it!  Will post after pregnancy with the hopefully stretch mark free results! Oh, the smell of the bio oil I like and it only takes about 5 minutes to absorb so the residue left in your skin is not bad!</li>
            <li> Just started using this and obviously havent noticed a difference in scars. But it makes my skin so soft! Even using it on my face and it hasn&#x27;t clogged my pores! 4 stars just because I can&#x27;t say it works yet.</li>
            <li> I used this at 16yr old after discovering stretch marks due to puberty. Twice daily for about three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stretch marks eventually faded but I&#x27;m not sure if it was from Bio- oil or from time passing, as all stretch marks fade eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the smell and that it absorbed quickly.&lt;br /&gt; Unfortunately it&#x27;s sort of expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying other products to combat stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I have used this oil for several years now and truly believe it has improved my skin. I always put a squirt in my bathwater and have even started using it on my 63 year old face; applying it while my skin is still warm after getting out of the bath/shower. I can honestly say I have no wrinkles and most people think I am much younger than my years. I can&#x27;t say for sure if it is genetics or the product that makes my skin stay young, but I do think this product helps. I think it has also improved the appearance of decades old severe stretchmarks on my abdomen skin. I also like the scent!</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I will always buy this no matter where I am in the world</li>
            <li> I‘ve used it on my stretchmarks for several days and it dose make difference! Hope for the fantastic effect two months later.</li>
            <li> Love to use this on my face after the derma roller.</li>
            <li> This is excellent for acne scar and even out your skin tone.If you have acne this really helps and for stretch marks as well. My stretch marks are fading and it is starting to look more uniform with my skin tone.I am loving this! Will be buying more soon!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Bio Oil upon recommendation of a friend who said that it took care of a surgery scar for him.  I am using it on a surgery scar and also on my face at nighttime.  It is too early to tell of the final results, but I really like how it makes my skin feel.  I am anxious to see if it evens out my skin tone (because I need it).  It has a nice smell and nice texture.</li>
            <li> Have been using the oil to prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy since the middle of my first trimester.  I apply it twice a day as directed.  Im at the beginning of my third trimester... no stretch marks yet.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to but fragrance is one contents and not the last and least. Its&#x27;s high up on the list. It has a very strong perfume smell and then felt a burn for hours after I put it on my face.</li>
            <li> It is my first time writing a review for a product. It fixes my skin. Definitely recommend to anyone who used to have a oil and uneven skin.</li>
            <li> started using it in my 2nd trimester and put it on almost every day when I get out of the shower.  Haven&#x27;t gotten a single stretch mark! Also the perfect amount.  I thought I&#x27;d have to buy more, but I&#x27;m in my third trimester and it looks like I&#x27;ll have enough to finish out the pregnancy!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t reduce appearance of scar but a great product for daily use for better skin.  Helps to moisturize skin daily.</li>
            <li> I had been applying this oil on the stretch marks on my inner thighs for a month. I stopped applying after the 30 day mark because I didn&#x27;t see any difference what so ever. Now looking at my thighs I can see that the oil successfully rapidly faded away most of the bright red stretch marks. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I thought &amp;#34;how will this get rid of old scares?&amp;#34; All I can say is it does. I have some dark scars on my legs from when I have cut myself with a razor while shaving. It took about 2 to 3 months of persistence, applying twice a day at night and in the morning but they are almost completely gone! I also had 2 spots that were from breaking out and because they were newer scars they completely disappeared in less than a month using this! The longer you&#x27;ve had the scars the longer it will take to make less noticeable (especially the dark ones like I had on my legs). I would suggest anyone one who has scars anywhere to try this!</li>
            <li> hydrates your skin wonderfully~ I mix it w/my favorite lotion....My skin glows~ Scars are going away~~~</li>
            <li> Very good Easy to absorb Pungent smell</li>
            <li> very good! I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Not really happy about this product, took the redness out of my stretch marks but havent really faded them. I am 15 years old and i have deep marks on my breast and it just didnt cut it, but they were very red now its my skin color. I dont know if thats just my skin healing naturally healing or the oil.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my chest when I had gotten a nice long scratch across my chest. I was scared that it was going to leave a light scar so I used this on my chest everyday. I would just put some on my scratch and rub it in until I felt like it was &amp;#34;absorbed&amp;#34;. I think it did pretty good considering how easily I scar. There&#x27;s no proof that I even had a cut.</li>
            <li> I been using for 3 weeks now and i havent seen results.</li>
            <li> I wish it didn&#x27;t smell quite so much and that the packaging was a little nicer.  I don&#x27;t use it every day.  But I do use it once or twice a week in the winter time.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received have a little black impurity.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better. I use it on my face and arms and knows.  My skin has become brighter and more even.  Please it makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> This product is useful.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product i read a lot of reviews, however I am asking ...Where are the results&lt;br /&gt;It is very disheartening that I did not have the results that I anticipated, so I console myself by saying what works for others may not be for me.  I hoped that the blemish es would have faded but not at all. So i am looking for another solution that will be my miracle.</li>
            <li> My friend got attacked by a wild cat and had to go to emergency. Cat ripped up her legs pretty bad so she had many deep scars. She said it works...I have seen her legs since (4 months ago or so) and they are greatly improved.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re pregnant you need to buy this product. I&#x27;ve been using this product religiously since 3 months pregnant &amp; have just finished the bottle after 3 months of use often twice/day. For a 3 day mini vacation I used palmers cocoa butter for stretch marks &amp; itched like crazy...it was then that I realised how powerful it really was...&amp; just how amazing this oil is. Absolutely worth the $12!</li>
            <li> I used this throughout my pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get stretchmarks.  I hated the oily feel of it but I just applied it after my shower and it wasn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> Great price for a product I won&#x27;t live without.  I have been using it on my face for years and I have virtually no lines at age 67.  Replaces all the anti-aging creams out there.  I don&#x27;t even wear foundation.  Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops with my face lotion.  Helps keep the lotion moist and my skin feels great.  Recommend.</li>
            <li> I am naturally prone to stretch marks anytime my body grows, but I have now successfully made it through two pregnancies without any new ones. I use Bio-oil at night and St. Ives lotion during the day.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husbands gross scar that he received from a pit bull while on the job. I don&#x27;t think the scar will ever fully go away, but after only a couple weeks of using it not super religiously, it has started to do away with the redness.</li>
            <li> Good moisture without oily feel.</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  I have used during and after both of my pregnancies.  I have used it to diminish my stretch marks.  The recommendation is to use it twice daily to decrease risk of and decrease appearance of stretch marks.  I has made the marks less distinct over time.  I also like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also used this over very dry areas of skin to soften and moisture.</li>
            <li> I got this in hopes of preventing and treating stretch marks (I&#x27;m African-American) during my pregnancy, but it didn&#x27;t work. I like the feel of the oil on my skin, but won&#x27;t buy it anymore. I&#x27;m trying coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Bought this looking to lighten and make some stretch marks less noticeable, I had hope in this product, but hopes were broken... I used this for 5 months applying morning and night liberally and worked it into the affected skin thoroughly, but the skin got only softer and supple, but no change occurred in the stretch marks they remained purple and slivery and deep. I still have some left and am still using it hoping some change might happen. But after applying for so long it feels like a chore, the oil sticks to your hands making you give your hands a good scrub to get the oil off and i have to be careful not to get on clothes due to it can stain and be dangerous in the dryer. I gave this 3 stars because I feel this product could work wonders on dry &amp; scaly skin, wrinkles, small or light scars or deep pores. But deducted 2 stars because it did not meet my needs and it took so long with little to no results. Would I recommend this to someone? Of course I would, just cause it didn&#x27;t work for me it doesn&#x27;t mean it would not work for someone else&#x27;s needs. Thanks for reading and I hope this gives insight to your purchase</li>
            <li> I love it I just had gallbladder surgery and I&#x27;m using it for my scars and its working. Definitely a worthy purchase</li>
            <li> I broke out big time, after using this! I was looking forward to using this product, but should have tested it in a small place on my skin, first. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used it during my pregnancy starting at 3 months. I applied morning and night. I did not get any stretch marks so it worked for me. My mom and sister have tons of stretch marks but I don&#x27;t think they had access to preventative products like this. I also drank lots of water so I&#x27;m sure that helped too. I used after pregnancy to help with scarring from pregnancy acne and I still use it because my skin gets so dry in the winter. It&#x27;s pricey but Amazon has the best deals. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> very nice product i will definitely recommend this to everybody!</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s recommendation is very good, very good product, I very like to use it, it brings me a very good enjoyment</li>
            <li> So far so good! Hoping to prevent stretch marks during pregnancy... Or atleast keep them to a minimum. Either way, it feels amazing!</li>
            <li> I really wish this had worked.  I have extremely deep Stretch marks and have invested tons of money trying to find a product that helps.  I had hoped bio oil would be the one, but it wasn&#x27;t.  After continuous use I noticed no change in my stretch marks.  It makes your skin feel wonderful and, for the price, it&#x27;s a decent deal, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> My wife is using it. It prevents and reduces pregnant wrinkles, and my wife feels much more comfortable than before.</li>
            <li> I have a very big scar, with this moisturizer, it makes my scar looks a bit slighter, and I only use it for 15 days, and it starts to show the effect. It also can make my skin soft and stay hydrated. My friends said my skin looks younger than before, I would recommend this to every one, cause it really is a good product.</li>
            <li> Just love it. Works good especially for little scars!</li>
            <li> Used it for months and so far I haven&#x27;t got any scretch yet but it may be too early to say... Not bad.</li>
            <li> Amazing oil during pregnancy and post partum to help ward off stretch marks. Love how this smells and feels. After finding out I was allergic to cocoa butter, I knew I needed to find something that would help prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy. Not only does it smell and feel better than then cocoa butter- it works better! I saw a huge difference in my skin and hardly got any stretch marks! I truly believe this product made a difference. I am now using it post partum and it is really helping me to regain elasticity in my belly. Hooked on Bio Oil!</li>
            <li> It did not work very well on my acne scars, but is great for the dry winter days. My skin feels very moist when I use it.</li>
            <li> After using this product twice a day for three weeks a thick,ropey scar due to an operation undergone two years ago&lt;br /&gt;has both flattened and faded. I look forward to close to normal skin after 90 days of using it. It is an oil so it takes a&lt;br /&gt;little time to absorb and you have to rub it in as directed but it is very pleasantly scented.</li>
            <li> i have seen my stretch marks go from pink to even with my skin tone. I use it twice a day and its so moist, it makes me super soft. I love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product... make my expectations&lt;br /&gt;love it..</li>
            <li> Bought this for pregnancy. I applied to my stomach, sides and thighs after showering, and my previous stretch marks lightened, and new stretch marks were prevented. I also used the excess oil on my face after rubbing onto my body. The skin on my face is clearer, and less dry. :)</li>
            <li> Wow. Week 1 of usage and I already singled out this oil for causing all my itching misery. I admit I have a sensitive skin but did not expect itchiness or intermittent &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; sensation in each and every body part the oil was applied on. I even accidentally touched my lips with oil residue still on my hands and it burnt like crazy. Skin seems brighter however but I have to stop using it. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use this as a face and body oil. My sensitive skin approves. It helped prevent stretch marks from my second baby and fade the ones from my first.</li>
            <li> Great purchase experience</li>
            <li> I have never posted a review of anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Bio Oil is magical for scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t heal at all (it&#x27;s a whole thing), so everything becomes a scar. A dog bit me in December and the scar was bad - worse, it still hurt through May. Three weeks of non diligent use and it&#x27;s nearly gone.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of using this product I can see the difference on my skin</li>
            <li> Like it so far, a little goes a long way.  Not greasy.  I have acne prone skin and this hasn&#x27;t made it any worse.  Haven&#x27;t seen drastic scar reduction yet in several weeks.</li>
            <li> I used in my first pregnancy. I apply two time a day, every day since I found out I was pregnant. I follow the instructions and I dont have stretch marks in my belly. I still using the oil for everyting. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for some scars. I have been using it once a day after I get out of the shower for about 2 months now and i&#x27;ve already seen a HUGE improvement in my scars. This product works! it&#x27;s easy as heck to use, and it does NOT leave your skin feeling oily or uncomfortable. It&#x27;s basically a completely natural feeling, almost as good as lotion. For scars, I highly recommend this product. My scars were within 7 months old.</li>
            <li> Perfect for scars and stretch marks. Results show up in a few months though. Waiting!</li>
            <li> It did lightened up my stretch marks but they didn&#x27;t completely go away. I used it for about 3 wks total now. It started lightened up in the 1 st wk. If it helps, I had new stretch marks that were red/purplish. Now they&#x27;re extremely lightened. Still there but no where near as noticeable as before.</li>
            <li> This is my opinion of bio oil, I have a lot of  red stretch marks on my thighs and on my chest and exedra I thought this product would get rid of them, it being summer in all, so I was really exited.  it only lasted about a week and then was gone I put it on before bed and it was really uncomfortable. I felt like I had been rolling around in a pizza!! I only used a little and it like I said was gone in a week.&lt;br /&gt;And none of my stretch marks went away! :(</li>
            <li> I have many scars from moles being removed. I have used half the bottle so far and I have seen no difference in the appearance of any of my scars.</li>
            <li> Delivered promptly as expected</li>
            <li> Using it for two months on a large scar I recently acquired through a car accident. It&#x27;s a big job, but  I&#x27;m already seeing improvement in color and feel. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> very good product and delivery is OK</li>
            <li> I have too say I used this for months for my stretch marks did not work at all.</li>
            <li> I love bio oil! I am pregnant and in my 3rd trimester and have been using this since the beginning of my pregnancy. I apply it after I shower each day. You don&#x27;t need to use very much at all. I only have 2 tiny stretch marks, 1 I had before I got pregnant and won&#x27;t go away, the other I just recently got. If I ever notice any marks starting to form on my skin I just apply more oil before I go to bed and my marks are gone by morning. I am going to continue using this product until after I have the baby. Just wash your hands after you apply it because it is oily.</li>
            <li> I use this on my scars and it works very well. The results aren&#x27;t instant and it does take commitment but it really does make a difference.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about a week, but I can notice a very minor improvement so it appears to work well so far.  The ingredients are all pretty good for skin conditions and scarring so I am pretty hopeful that it will work as directed in 3 months.  Like some other reviewers have stated this product does make the skin feel greasy and oil, but that is because it is an oil based product.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product for anyone who needs to use it in a very noticeable area all day, but you could try putting it on and then after it sits for a while take any excess oil off with a paper towel to see how it works.  I will follow up in a few months to give a better review based on the results I see.</li>
            <li> At the lovely young age of 12, I blew up to approximately the size of a small beluga whale in a relatively short period of time. Never mind the impetus or reasoning, the only info you need to be privy to are my resulting stretch marks. I&#x27;m talking hundreds. The most obvious (and embarrassing) of the demon craters litter my upper arms, stomach, and breasts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell ya, it&#x27;s just been super swell dealing with these buggers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After many years passed and many pounds lost, all I really want to do is find something, anything, to help these nasty little suckers fade. The only product in the past that helped in the slightest was the dermaroller, but my results were fairly minuscule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Bio-oil. I happened upon it, looked at the price, scoured the reviews, thought \\&quot;what the hell,\\&quot; and purchased a 4.2 ounce bottle. That bottle of liquid salvation arrived on my doorstep and into my anxious hands just a couple of days ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently entertaining the possibility that my skin is a super mutant sponge or something, because I&#x27;m already seeing results. The stretch marks on both of my arms end right at the antecubital fossa (aka the other side of your elbow for all you non-a&amp;p nerds). The ones in that area have already vastly improved in appearance, looking smaller, less crater-y and even less shiny. The other marks seem to be improving as well, although not nearly to the extent as the ones previously mentioned. However, I must mention that I saw the most improvement after using the oil in conjunction with the dermaroller, but that has so far only been one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the stretchmarks, I&#x27;m also applying the oil to a number of acne scars and ow-I-cut/scraped-myself-scars. I&#x27;ve yet to notice any significant improvement in those areas, but I remain highly hopeful as it&#x27;s only been a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and added perk-my skin is so freaking soft right now. Also, my case of uber-dry winter hands has disappeared. My hands haven&#x27;t felt this awesome in ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;ll try to remember to update ya&#x27;ll with my progress after a larger time period has passed. I&#x27;m simply so excited over the improvements I&#x27;m already seeing that I felt compelled to write this review!</li>
            <li> Not really a fan of the smell so I don&#x27;t use it the twice a day they recommend so it seems like a waste of money to me. Can&#x27;t comment on how well it works since I only use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> This Bio-Oil worked great on my stretch marks. I have had them for over a year and by applying this once a day for a half hour for two weeks they are noticeably lights and softer. I talked with my doctor and she said that applying any oil/moisturizer and rubbing it in will have the same effect... but I like this oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 months now. I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different moisturizers since I&#x27;ve been breaking out  over the past year. I&#x27;m 20 years old and I have combination skin. This helped get rid of dry patches on my skin. I&#x27;ve only broken out once while using this product but that&#x27;s because I was on a really long road trip and my skin didn&#x27;t get the care it deserved over the 12 hour drive. But otherwise, I don&#x27;t break out when I use this product. I use about 4 drops of oil on my face, any more, and it&#x27;s a bit too much oil. If you accidentally use too much oil, use a tissue to dab it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a huge, dry, red rash on the back of my knee and I&#x27;ve been applying bio oil (2 drops) to it twice a day for the past 2-3 weeks and it&#x27;s gotten significantly better. It&#x27;s almost unnoticeable now so I&#x27;m expecting that there won&#x27;t be a scar. I also have really dry hands and I&#x27;ve noticed that my hands have gotten softer from applying the oil to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I recommend it. My only problem with this product is that since I live in Florida, the sun is really harsh so I have to use a light moisturizer with spf over it.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and the oil is too greasy for me, but I can see how it would help someone with dry or very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I had to admit that  I&#x27;ve tried almost every (positively reviewed) product to lessen the stretch (beauty) marks I got after having two precious little ones.  NOTHING REALLY WORKS... but this works the best.  Daily use of this product has visibly reduced the appearance of stretch marks and makes my skin so hydrated.  On the next really dry day I have, I&#x27;m going to try rubbing it all over my body.</li>
            <li> I personally haven&#x27;t used it but my wife has for two pregnancies. This stuff is wonderful!!! It eases the itching of the growing belly. It&#x27;s also great for stretch marks and all that other stuff. And a few drops go a long way!</li>
            <li> I have been using it to keep my skin young.&lt;br /&gt;It is great and meet my expectation.  I think it is effective.</li>
            <li> About 2 weeks ago I got a really nasty sun burn. Well as I was doing some stuff around the house I noticed that some of the skin was loose so instead of having all those dry skin flakes; I figured why not peal it off right now. Well that led to the interesting problem of the skin wasn&#x27;t fully healed and ready for that older skin to come off. So I ended up with pretty much a nice road rash on my stomach; which it did hurt when I sat to long and then stood up. The skin felt like it was dry and trying to stretch every time I stood up. So I talked to a pharmacist, and she recommended this to help keep the skin moist so it didn&#x27;t fill like knives stabbing me when I stood up. So after the first use, it no longer feels like knives are stabbing me when I stand up. I&#x27;m not sure about all the claims the other people made, but if you are finding yourself with a bad sun burn and notice the skin is still moist but you can start to pick at it and pull it off; don&#x27;t peel it off until it is completely dried and flaking off of you. But if you do decide to peel off that skin before it is ready, I would recommend this to help you. Especially when it looks like you have a bad case of road rash that feels like someone is stabbing you with knives.</li>
            <li> Love this product it has almost made surgery scars disappear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Bio Oil for a few days. It&#x27;s a bit greasy and the smell is horrible. It smells almost like public restroom soap. But if there is any chance of it helping out my pregnancy stretch marks I&#x27;m more than willing to stick with it. My skin does feel some what softer after the first couple uses.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this product my unwanted scar in my legs vanish, and I can now go to the beach every time with my sexy and smooth legs minus the scars.</li>
            <li> This is a good product that wears down marks and scars. Highly recommended. You should get some today. You will like it.</li>
            <li> I started using this early in my second trimester to avoid stretch marks.  I am now 33 weeks along and have gained 28lbs (all belly, it&#x27;s huge!) and so far haven&#x27;t gotten any.  I am prone to stretch marks and have several old ones from being overweight for most of my life.  I had lost 70lbs. before getting pregnant and knowing that I had developed stretch marks in the past I was worried about creating new ones. I did get a couple of rather large pimples on my belly (I am also acne prone and my skin has been horrible ever since getting pregnant, so maybe it wasn&#x27;t cause by the oil) but in any case I&#x27;d much rather have a couple breakouts than permanent scarring from stretch marks.  I read a lot about stretch marks being mostly due to genetics so I thought it was inevitable that I&#x27;d get a bunch, but figured I&#x27;d give it a try anyway.  I use this every night after my shower and sometimes in the morning.  I also eat healthy and exercise which is said to help circulation and avoid rapid weight gain which also causes stretch marks.  I think the combination of the oil, exercise, and diet are all keeping me stretch mark free.  I have 7 weeks to go, so far so good, I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> Good so far - i haven&#x27;t had any stretch marks yet...7 months+.  Oil smells good and is light not thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> This bio oil works great on my face and body! it makes my skin soft and lighter. I have stretch marks on my legs and i notice that they are less noticeable but not totally gone. I didnt expect this to be a miracle but it works very well.</li>
            <li> didnt do anything for my scar</li>
            <li> Love it. Organic fresh hint of like a lavender smell but very mild. This is so hydrating with no greasiness.</li>
            <li> I like it really good, i like it very much. And I believe  Tissot is a good brand. Buy it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and it really works.!!! Reduces redness and they become less visible... So far so good, I would recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> After I deliver my baby , I used this product and from all others , I see a lot of changes on my skin . I defiantly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Good product. Thanks.</li>
            <li> i started using this in my second trimester and so far i haven&#x27;t seen any stretch marks on my belly, but apart from that, the oil just sinks into my skin and makes it feel so moisturized, great product and i&#x27;m gonna continue using after pregnancy.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my wife, we don&#x27;t have a baby yet, she became fat at first, and after she lost weight and became slim again, she used this product to  reduce the ugly print on her body. so this product is not only for women who just has a baby, if you become fat at first and slim again, you can also try this product :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this 2 times a day throughout my whole pregnancy and am 38.5 weeks and have no stretch marks (they say they are genetic and my mom had them horribly). It has a pretty perfumy smell but it fades quickly. It is oil so you will have to avoid clothing where you applied it for about an hour which some people complain about but what do you expect from an oil?! I would recommend and will use in the future!</li>
            <li> I used this and Momma Mia oil throughout my entire pregnancy and post partum. It was such a great purchase and I have no stretch marks from my pregnancy (I did have old ones on my hips from puberty) but I didn&#x27;t gain anymore during my pregnancy which was my goal and I attribute it to the bio oil. Great product!</li>
            <li> First off the product description says &amp;#34;Non Greasy&amp;#34; .... extremely greasy, I have stretch marks on my inner thighs and hips so reading all these great reviews saying this product has helped with stretch marks has me wondering .. When will my results show? Overall disappointed, would like a refund because I definitely feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I was applying this product to my freshly appeared scar for 3 months. No effect, zero. Not even a slight change in color, size, texture, etc. It looked exactly the same 3 months later. I ended up buying silicone scar patches that were more expensive, but had a lot more results to show after only 1 month. I felt like I wasted my money and time.</li>
            <li> Ive been using bio oil  for years, smells great,changes the texture of your skin and soften lines, very good product, i use after a bath on my chest and arms, does what it says</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its working the way we had hoped, my daughter has seen some improvement... So that&#x27;s good :)</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this works wonderfully! I noticed a difference in the first few times I used it and I didn&#x27;t even use it as much as I was supposed to. A friend tried it on her scar and overnight it took down the raised look of it and it was less pink looking. Needless to say she bought some right away. I have also used Mederma and that seems to work well too.</li>
            <li> I have scars on my legs from bug bites, scratches, burning myself with hot irons, etc. I applied it and I started noticing them fading away about 3 weeks after starting. It also doesn&#x27;t smell bad and comes in a cute container</li>
            <li> Very happy with the oil. I started using it in my 2nd trimester and not a single stretch mark yet!</li>
            <li> I bought this not really expecting a whole lot but I was pleasantly surprised. A bit expensive but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Started to work after a week, its been a month and I loving the results of my barely noticeable stretchmarks.(I have a lot from weight gain/loss)</li>
            <li> Never in a million years would I put this stuff on my face.  It is a huge pain and stains your clothes.  I bought it to reduce the appearance of postnatal stretch marks.  It may be working, or it could be that the stretch marks fade on their own.  I will continue to use it probably until I use up the bottle and then try something else.</li>
            <li> Im using it on my stretch mark. I have a lot of stretch mark after i gave birth. But when i try this i noticed my stretch marks is not dark than before.</li>
            <li> Shipping: No problems with the shipping. I ordered this on May 17th and received it on May 23rd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product: My skin cannot keep up with my weight loss. It seems like my stomach gets a new stretch mark everyday, my breasts have stretch marks, and I just don&#x27;t enjoy having that on my body. I use this product when I get out of the shower. You have to use this product religiously in order to get the results of less scars and/or stretch marks. They do vanish. The only think I hate about this product when you apply it, your hands always have that nasty, oily feeling from rubbing whatever troubled area you have. Other than that, it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that the first ingredient is mineral oil. I am trying it as an after peel oil for the first time for comparison to other oils. I will report back. I&#x27;m a little worried it will make me break out.</li>
            <li> Bio Oil has worked wonders for me! I have no complaints except that it is a little oily. It definitely helps in preventing stretch marks and fading away old marks.</li>
            <li> This product is soothing and OK. I have not seen any miraculous results for it and probably would not repurchase. The price seemed fair, but I just would not, at this point, consider it sufficiently effective at smoothing skin. I use it on some areas which are quite inflamed and damaged and it feels great - it just doesn&#x27;t do anything other products don&#x27;t do for less money.</li>
            <li> I started using this oil for some stretch marks on my bottom and after 3 weeks of use&lt;br /&gt;i started noticing small zits on my &amp;#34;cheeks&amp;#34;, and of course this was the only different&lt;br /&gt;and new thing i was using! I was also using it on a scar on my back and same thing happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right after i stopped everything came back to normal, so SPARE YOUR MONEY and look for&lt;br /&gt;something else because the side effects of all the oils this thing has are just not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> The reviews calling it greasy are very correct.  It&#x27;s very greasy, but I tell ya.  Using it twice a day for 2 months has really improved how smooth my skin feels.  As far as helping with scars, not so much.  I have cats and commonly get little scraps on my arms playing with them.  This hasn&#x27;t seem to improve the healing or scars left over.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product throughout her pregnancy on her belly, breast, back and hip areas and I haven&#x27;t seen any stretch-marks to date.  We only have 4 weeks to go, so I would recommend this product to all mothers-to-be.</li>
            <li> I bought Bio Oil about 5 Years ago because I had a few brown spots on my face. I stoped by at the pharmacy and  asked the employee what she would recommend for brown spots and she told me Bio Oil is good. I&#x27;m latina and my skin is a little bit oily and dry. I love the oil, never had any brake out, it is really lifting away the brwon spots but very slowly, you got be patient and put on your face 3 times a day. What I love about the oil is because works and I have bought so many products that is being adverstised to fade away the brown spots and it does not, you name it how maany products I have tried. Every skin is different so, for some people will work for others won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and developed stretch marks on my thighs after having my baby four months ago. I have been using Bio-Oil nightly after my shower, and the marks are no longer red and are much less noticeable. I find that is goes on like suntan oil and absorbs into my skin quickly. The smell goes away pretty quickly as well. I have about half of a bottle left and plan to use it all. I also put it on my legs after I shave. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> very very good for scars</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin started to get dry and tight after I took a shower, especially in the winter time.  I used to use expensive creams like Clinique but it didn&#x27;t seem like it was enough.  I saw this at Costco at a very reasonable price compared to what I was paying at Macy&#x27;s so I thought I&#x27;d try it out.  Just a couple of drops and my face immediately felt soft and supple!  This lasted throughout the day and two little drops covered my face and neck area.  Gradually after a few months, friends and acquaintences would comment how pretty my skin was or how I aged well (I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s and Native American).  If you use more than two or three drops on your face and neck, you&#x27;re using too much.  One bottle lasted me 6 months or more.  Costco no longer carries this and after making do with Aveeno facial moisturizer, it is no substitute to what Bio-Oil does for me.  I have to lather the Aveeno on and maybe, just maybe, I feel ok.  It finally occurred to me to look on Amazon and boom here it is!  I can&#x27;t wait until my shipment of this comes in.</li>
            <li> I used this 3 years after I had my son - and it seemed to work back then, however, it was always too pricey for me. Found it again on Amazon, been using it religiously &amp; my skin is looking &amp; feeling SO much better! Skin tone is evening out, stretch marks fading &amp; my skin is feeling softer.</li>
            <li> this product is very greasy.</li>
            <li> Which is better bio oil or coconut oil?</li>
            <li> Love using this for my skin during pregnancy, Unfortunately I have still gotten a ton of stretch marks but definitely makes skin slightly oily and soft.</li>
            <li> It works....Great Transaction, product of great quality, delivery was quick and experience was wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I use it in conjunction with other oils</li>
            <li> This oil is the best, specially if you are pregnant or about to go on a diet and lose some serious weight. It did NOT help with the existing stretch marks but definitely prevented new ones.</li>
            <li> I bought bio-oil for use during pregnancy to avoid stretch marks. I started using it from my second trimester. Well, I haven&#x27;t had any stretch marks on my skin till date. And i am going to use it throughout my pregnancy and even after. I even use it for my face since my facial skin lost all its moisture and became totally lifeless due to cold weather and hormonal changes inside my body. So i dampen my face using a cotton ball with bio-oil everyday. And i have noticed significant changes in my skin. It has regained moisture and is more soft and supple than ever. I have already ordered my second lot of bio oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil because my belly was starting to really itch at about 16 weeks into my pregnancy. I knew the itching was related to dry, stretching skin. I also wanted to protect against getting stretch marks. I am currently 26 weeks pregnant. I have been using the oil once per day after I get out of the shower. The fragrance is light but takes some getting used to. I am super sensitive to smells but this oil has not been a problem. I love the feel of the oil; it glides on smooth and soaks in nicely and is not sticky at all. It easily washes off my hands when done applying. The itching has nearly completely resolved and I have not one stretch mark! I do believe however that stretch marks are hereditary and my mom never got them either. But I also believe that by taking care of your skin you can reduce the severity and number of marks that appear. I have not tried any other products out there as this is the first I bought and so far it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li> I use just once a day, and am pleased with results. The product also smells nice and has a nice feel.</li>
            <li> I was really bummed that this product gave me a rash.  I have slightly sensitive skin, but rarely get rashes from creams or anything.  I love the price and how the oil felt on my skin.  This product will be returned.</li>
            <li> LOVES this stuff, seriously works wonders :) Smells pretty and makes my skin Oh So Soft I use as a daily routine after showering, sometimes I&#x27;ll put a cap full in a hot bath :) Definitely hydrates the skin without leaving the oily feel that most can. The smell is light not too overwhelming giving a natural fresh clean scent lasting all day.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using Bio-Oil as a skin lubricant for a few years now after we saw a demo at a Costco store.&lt;br /&gt;She says the main thing she likes about it is that when applied, it is not greasy and her makeup goes on over it easily, evenly and does not cake.&lt;br /&gt;She has tried other products, more and less expensive, and most caked her makeup.</li>
            <li> Works ok,arrived on time and I might purchase another. I do not have much to say about it but it works to an extent</li>
            <li> LOVE bio oil for stretch marks scars and just for moisturizing dry chapped skin its great I even use it on my face from time to time</li>
            <li> Got to help me with stretch marks I had on my stomach after having my son and I really see a difference only after 2 weeks it smell good amazing love it I&#x27;m ordering more</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s a waste of money and an opportunity of using possibly other alternatives. I had a scar from a surgery. Based on the reviews I purchased this and used it for a year hoping it&#x27;d work. It did not make a slight difference. It may work for stretch marks, but it definitely does NOT work on the scars, at least, not for my case.</li>
            <li> I am 30 weeks pregnant and have no stretch marks. Yay I guess but I am also very tiny so I may not get any. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and my skin is really soft and glowing. I developed a heat rash and it works very well on keeping my skin moisturized. Still have 9 1/2 more weeks to go so hopefully I still see no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Ok I have used allot of creams and oils before, I have very light stretch marks in a few places that are stubborn and a few scars, one being on my forehead from a car accident that still had glass in it from three years ago, bio oil, I honestly can say has reduced the scar on my face, several small pieces of glass have come out while rubbing the bio oil on my eyebrow, which my eyebrow also had a gap from the scar and has now grown back, the scar on my eyebrow has already reduced, stretch marks are not far from non-existent, have been using the bio oil for about a month now, haven&#x27;t even used half of the 4.2 bottle, already used the 1 something ounce bottle, my other scar from a burn has thinned, lightened and has seriously reduced in size. I&#x27;m still using the bio oil in hopes of allot more results in combination with my daily routine of skin creams, bronzer and what not, I recommend it to anyone who reads this, it&#x27;s worth a shot to try it, seriously, added bonus, I put it on my face while applying it and my skin tone all around has evened out allot, my whole body has a glow almost, very nice, I only rated four stars because it consumes allot of time applying it to your entire body and letting it dry, it is pretty oily, but well worth the sacrifice I think</li>
            <li> not good as they said remove scars&lt;br /&gt;but its a good moisturizer before make up and bed time&lt;br /&gt;but dont depend on</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing! im now almost 9 months pregnant and I heard about this stuff from the RN teaching our Lamaze class. she said its better than cocoa butter and I agree completely. ive been using this since the beginning of my 2nd trimester and so far no stretch marks. I rub in all my expanding parts in the morning out of the shower and then again right before bed. ive been rubbing it in to my neck and breastbone as well, sometimes my a little on my face, and ive seen HUGE improvements in the texture, color and overall appearance of my skin tone...im 31 btw and my skin is popping back to mid 20s look. I use to live in southern cali and even tho I always spfd, I have noticed just living there for 5 years really took it out of my skin and was aging me. sooo, I recommend this product for everyone, especially preggers, but all people!</li>
            <li> I read so many positive reviews before buying this. I&#x27;ve been using it almost everyday for 2 months and I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements of stretch marks. Everyone is different. So maybe it&#x27;ll work for the next person.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product as directed for the recommended duration (longer actually). However, it did NOTHING. No fading. No change. And it does not absorb into the skin well at all. This means that you have to be really careful when you put it on (timing wise). Its expensive too. So not worth it! I&#x27;ve had way better luck with Mederma.</li>
            <li> Bought this for stretch marks. Try to apply it at least once a day. And the stretch marks are hardly visible now. This product does work.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a last resort two years ago in my loosing battle with melasma on my face from BC pills. I had several areas of melasma that were very pronounced. After only a couple weeks I noticed a difference. After a couple months the horrible spots that had been plaguing me for two years were gone. I tried everything to get rid of the melasma discoloration and nothing worked until this. I cannot say enough good things about this. It also faded some scars I had on my legs and has diminished fine lines on my face. I love the smell and yes it is a bit greasy, it is an oil after all, but if you use just a little and give it time to absorb you can easily use it under make up. I also have acne prone skin and I have never had a breakout because of this. If you need a product to fade scars, discolorations, even fine lines, this is definitely the product. This size with daily use lasts me more than six months! A great buy.</li>
            <li> I am 16 weeks pregnant and used this product after reading about it reviews online. I would suggest getting smaller quantity and trying it out before buying the huge bottle. I had rashes all over my stomach and legs and its been three weeks since i discontinued using it but the rashes havent healed yet. I dont hve sensitive skin I hve used various products all these years but never had any reaction to any of them but unfortunately this one did&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had lot of expectations from this product but its really disappointing :(</li>
            <li> My wife has used this for years and when I went to Amazon to see if it was sold there I was shocked to find out I could get double the amount for the same price I paid for one locally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this works for stretch marks or not, but I am addicted to the scent. It&#x27;s fabulous. It&#x27;s a very nice oil, it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li> Bio oil just smell great.. I used it to prevent pregnancy birth stretches but lots the baby and discontinued until next chance.. It the period I did use I did indeed lighten my stretch marks very much and smells clean and botanical.</li>
            <li> This product hasn&#x27;t produced any visible changes to my skin. It&#x27;s very oily and you must use a tiny amount. I will continue to use this product but so far I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me following bilateral full knee replacement surgery and I&#x27;m so grateful that I heard about it. My scars are significantly smaller than most others and I know it is due to this -- excellent product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff -- I use it on my face.  No scars but I just wanted more oil for my skin that was starting to get dry as I age.  I put it under my makeup and the dryness is gone.</li>
            <li> I used bio oil every day since I found out I was pregnant. In conjunction with taking vitamin e supplements, I report no stretch marks after delivering a 9 lb 4 oz baby. Here are photos. Before and 1 week after baby delivery.. No stretchies!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I&#x27;m not sure wether or not I was genetically predisposed to having stretch marks as my mother passed away when I was 5 and I have no sisters to compare results to.  But these are my results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would take a star off for the scent but I won&#x27;t. I&#x27;m just very sensitive to scents and considering most pregnant women are, you&#x27;d think they would dampen the scent a bit.</li>
            <li> this works nicely....haven&#x27;t used it very long, but so far I like the way it makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li> Helped with dryness and itching from my skin stretching. I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks either... credit to genetics or bio oil? idk. I think baby oil would have worked just as well and it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li> It smells not bed, but I not sure if it works.</li>
            <li> Love it. I can see already that it is making a difference on a facial scare. We have been using it for about a month.</li>
            <li> A friend with great skin told me about this product.  I use it on my face every night (very dry skin) and I add it to the body lotions that I use after showering daily.  Really saves my skin, especially in the dry winter months.  I also use very expensive department store skin care products and other specialty brands that I buy on-line.  So I guess I&#x27;m a product junkie.  This has become a staple in my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> Not all that thpught it work better cheap should atick with cocoa butter cream oh well well well well qell</li>
            <li> it is nice oil with good smell it soft the skin every day,  I will buy it again soon bye</li>
            <li> It smells really good and I use it for multiple things.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for quite some time and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I slathered this on morning and night from 6 weeks pregnant - I went through a total of three bottles throughout the whole pregnancy - and I don&#x27;t have a single stretch mark. Whether that is genetic and would have happened anyway... Or whether it is the bio oil, I can&#x27;t prove but I would use this product in a heartbeat for the next pregnancy. Better safe than sorry and you&#x27;d never guess I&#x27;ve had a baby from the smoothness and quality of my skin on my stomach. Top tip- make sure you also apply this to your hips, bum and sides as they all grow enormously during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I used this once a day before bed during my first pregnancy on my belly and chest and had NO stretch marks (I started as soon as I started to show). I am now at week 26 with my second pregnancy and still nothing! I don&#x27;t know if its genetics or if this stuff really works, but why risk it? I went through two bottles my first pregnancy and am on track for the same this time around also.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie. I really wanted to go the all natural route. I was doing raw cocoa, raw Shea butter, and coconut oil. I ended up popping really fast so my skin had no choice but to stretch. I&#x27;ll admit I wish I would have used bio oil from the second trimester on as stated on the bottle. I started using it and saw visible results in a few days. I&#x27;ve been a  esthetician for 14 years and I can tell if something is working. I mean I still have a large amount of stretch marks but I.believe this is softening them and will aid in skin elasticity coming back quickly after baby. Again, I wish I would have used it as directed but I believe this is a fantastic product. I also love that it absorbs quickly. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I am currently 5/6 months pregnant with my second child and use this along with a lotion based product for stretch marks.  It&#x27;s super easy to put on, doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and keeps me lathered up to prevent additional stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any results</li>
            <li> Dear, the product is very good I have been buying used, thank you for your enthusiastic service, I would be happy to get your help, will focus on these products. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> We at first got this to help with my sons scar.  I used it too.  Eventually his scar became a little less noticable.  You cant even see it now but that might be because he got older, we gave it some time, and young skin might fix itself better.  However, i love this stuff.  I havent used it in a while because I forgot to get it and you can tell.  My face is duller.  I dont know how it works but it really makes your face brighter looking and younger.  Even my little boy had a glowing complextion.  It kind of makes me get a breakout or two when I first start using it or when I start after I stop for a little bit but then it works itself  out and I have healthier, brighter, younger skin. I dont know why I stopped but I got to get back to it.  I don&#x27;t have money to waste on wrinkle cream or anti aging cream.  I can&#x27;t drop $50 on product but this is like 10 bucks and works maybe better.</li>
            <li> Great product! I would recommend to any pregnant woman.</li>
            <li> Using for two weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement! But I am giving it more time!</li>
            <li> The package arrived as promised. However, the lid of the bio oil wasn&#x27;t properly closed and it spilled on the box.</li>
            <li> used 5 times a day everyday since first trimester. Still got stretch marks around 34 wks. not happy about it.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff. I use it for stretch marks and acne scars, and it&#x27;s cleared up both in a matter of months. It&#x27;s gentle enough for my sensitive and acne prone facial skin and does not appear to cause any breakouts after applied. It smells wonderful and the texture is nice. You&#x27;ll still have the lighter skin where the stretch marks are, but it helped get rid of the ugly purple lines on arms and hips. Totally worth the money and this size has lasted me for years.</li>
            <li> It seemed a little crazy to use oil for my already oily skin, but my sister has beautiful skin and is a Bio-Oil user so I thought I&#x27;d give it a go.Yes, I get the occasional small pimple here and there but I can&#x27;t say that the Bio-Oil is the cause. I CAN say that it makes my skin feel more supple and soft. If anything, I think it makes my face break out a lot less! Even my husband loves to use it because it makes his face soft after he shaves and the scent is so light. I&#x27;m going to use this product for life!</li>
            <li> SMOOTH, NICE SCENT HELPED WITH HYDRATING SKIN - DID NOT SEE TOO MUCH DIFFERENCE WITH STRETCH MARKS</li>
            <li> Good product. Wife loves it and keeps on re-ordering.</li>
            <li> This stuff was amazing while pregnant. I began applying from about 4 months pregnant to about 2 months after delivery.  Never had any itching while pregnant.  Even better: 5 months post-partum I have no stretch marks!</li>
            <li> What can I say about Bio-oil. Few people who have tried it have nothing but good things to say,</li>
            <li> It takes a while to absorb</li>
            <li> Good and good price. will still go on buy it .</li>
            <li> I purchased this and no one has compensated me for &amp;#34;an honest review.&amp;#34; When I was searching for a product I found a lot of reviews were the result of free or discount priced products, which is fine, but kind of left doubt in my mind. Would that person have bought the product if it wasn&#x27;t free? Or reimbursed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this only 5 days ago, but I thought my early impressions were worth noting and I&#x27;ll update in a month or so. (Note: the product recommends using it twice a day for 3 months.) I have scarring on my shoulders, neck, and back from picking at my skin when I&#x27;m stressed. And while I know that I do it, I don&#x27;t necessarily notice it while I&#x27;m doing it. And now that it&#x27;s summer and my skin is tanning I can see the dark discoloration of where I have scratched and picked at blemishes that would have otherwise just gone away if I had left them alone. My goal for this product is two fold: to help alleviate the dark discoloration from my scars and help break my harmful habit by replacing it with a skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells like baby oil - lightly fragrant, floral. It feels a little bit like a really thin vegetable oil except that it absorbs into the skin. However, it doesn&#x27;t absorb immediately, which has been nice. I put it on at night before I go to bed / after a shower and then again in the morning before I go to work. It doesn&#x27;t wear heavy so I don&#x27;t really notice but you can feel it when you touch the skin and that has helped me become immediately aware when I start messing with my skin. I hope that with enough repetition I can break the habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin already feels better and I would venture to say it looks better too: less red and blotchy, softer, and I have not broken out from using it. I&#x27;m not expecting miracles, but having used silicone strips for a small scar from surgery, I do expect something to come of using a product like this for 3 months. And, after 5 days use as recommended, I am seeing changes in the complexion of my skin.nges in the complexion of my skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after getting a nasty curling iron burn on my forearm.  It worked great!  No scar and no ruined wedding photos :-). I applied once every morning after showering. I&#x27;m sure it would have minimized faster if I applied it 3x per day as recommended.</li>
            <li> heard great things about it. haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my skin yet. says to use for 3 months, so hope i can tell if works or not soon!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for your skin.  Not greasy and helps hydrate all parts of the body.  I will continue to use this product because it is natural and shows results.  Just try and I think you will agree.</li>
            <li> It never even occurred to me to look at the ingredients before purchasing Bio-Oil.  I kind of assumed that if it&#x27;s marketed towards pregnant women, it must be legit, right?  Well, maybe not so much....my bad.  It has too much of a fragrancy smell, which I don&#x27;t care for, and the weird pink/orange color of the oil made me look at the ingredients.  There&#x27;s a bunch of big chemically words that I can&#x27;t read, and I certainly don&#x27;t feel safe putting them on my stomach with my baby on the other side of my skin.  That said, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really some miracle cure for scars and stretch marks or not.  I am happy to try it out (if my bottle doesn&#x27;t expire) after I have my baby and after I&#x27;m no longer breast feeding....basically, after my baby is in the clear, I&#x27;ll try this for any lingering marks.  In the meantime, I&#x27;m rolling with Mother&#x27;s Special Blend All Natural Toning Oil, straight coconut oil, and natural cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I use this as all purpose moisturizer. I use some on my face and have been for years and it does not make my face oily, nor does it clog my pores. It helps whenever I get chewed up by mosquitoes and other biting insects. It helps with scarring like you will not believe. The one thing I do not like is the smell, but luckily it is not a horrible smell and it is a light smell.</li>
            <li> i am obsessed with this bio oil syrum.&lt;br /&gt;you can use it for everything! on your hair/scalp as a moisturizer/anti dandruff/anti frizz agent, as a makeup remover &amp; hydrator, gets rid of acne scars, stretch marks &amp; regular scars! has anti aging effects &amp; helps with uneven skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;its soooo amazing.&lt;br /&gt;non oily just soft;perfect.&lt;br /&gt;makes my skin feel goddess like.&lt;3&lt;br /&gt;i have never been into oils &amp; hydrators but this is gold in a bottle.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not so sticky, and it smells good, it can use at skin, hair, face. But the design of the bottle is not so well, it easily get too much than I actually need.</li>
            <li> Someone at Walgreen&#x27;s recommended this product to me early in my pregnancy back in 2009. I have used this product ever since. It certainly is not for facial use because of its thick consistency. I used it exclusively to prevent stretch marks. And two babies later, I have NO stretch marks to show, all because of Bio-oil. I would highly recommend it for the prevention of stretch marks, albeit I am not sure if it works well once you have stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and hydrated. No itching or stretch marks so far. Hope this continues for the rest of the pregnancy</li>
            <li> This stuff works, but it takes at least a year.  I had 40 staples in my face that you can no longer see.</li>
            <li> Does NOT reduce stretch mark appearance. I used it for 3 months twice a day as directed and saw absolutely no improvement. This product is a dud.</li>
            <li> Use this stuff with my 1st pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get stretch marks... Trying again for second pregnant. It give my belly little pimples, but those will go away and stretch marks wouldn&#x27;t, so I&#x27;ll take my chances :) not oily once it&#x27;s rubbed in and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I just got this delivered to me. I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because of how simple it is to apply to the skin &amp; it has a nice scent. I will update it if I do not see improvement.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever for stretch marks! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months and i absolutely love it. I&#x27;m 6 months pregnant and my breasts have had terrible deep stretch marks. Even just using it once overnight i see a huge difference. It Makes the stretch marks lighter and you can even feel a difference. I use it on my belly too to help prevent marks there. I tell everyone about this!</li>
            <li> this stuff smells amazing and does work. I love it.</li>
            <li> I used up a 4.2oz bottle within 3 months, and just purchased a new one.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now 35wks pregnant and haven&#x27;t got any stretch mark yet. Doctor says it&#x27;s all in my genes - It&#x27;s unlikely that I will have stretch marks since my mother didn&#x27;t have. Therefore I really can&#x27;t say if the product is working or not.&lt;br /&gt;I can say this: it doesn&#x27;t have any odor. It&#x27;s easy to apply. It&#x27;s very oily.</li>
            <li> Works great on new and old scars - surprised cosmetic surgeons haven&#x27;t put this in fancy packaging and sold it for 10 x the price!</li>
            <li> Great product. No stretch mark until now.</li>
            <li> Hi. I never leave reviews but had to on this one. I bought this to try to clear up two pimples on my face that no matter what they would just keep breaking open and not heal. I used this and after only three days all the pimples we&#x27;re gone. It also evened out my skin tone. I applied it three times a day and at night for sure. This stuff is amazing. I had a red scar on my face that I&#x27;ve had for over 20 yrs and it&#x27;s almost gone. I highly recommend this product. Not only for stretch marks but for any marks or blemishes you want to get a rid of. And my bottle is still full. It only takes a little bit to work. One bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because a co-worker recommended it. But, still i was skeptical. I saw results in DAYS. I&#x27;ve been using it every day for a month now and my scars are minimal. As a young mother, I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I used this my entire pregnancy.  Granted, in the last month I did get stretch marks (there&#x27;s no controlling that).  I feel like the oil helps.  I&#x27;ve had really dry skin this past winter and the oil works a lot better than any of the lotions I&#x27;ve bought.  Makes my skin soft.  My son is 2 months old, and I still use it on my stomach every day.  It&#x27;s very soothing when the stretch marks itch and I have noticed them fading quicker by using the oil.  With all of the stretch mark oils/lotions/potions out there, just find something that works for you.  Bio-Oil works for me and I recommend it on a daily basis to people.</li>
            <li> This oil does nothing for my scars or skin tone. I have used it for a few months. The smell is weird, is it really&lt;br /&gt;toxic. I is just not for me.</li>
            <li> I can definitely see change and I&#x27;ve only had it for about a month and haven&#x27;t been using it everyday. Very good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it at least once a day  in conjuction with derma-roller treatments to reduce the appearance of stretch marks on my stomach and hips. After about a month there is a noticable differance in the stretch marks and they actually feel far less deep than they did prior to use of the Bio-Oil and micro-needling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very please with the progress and will definitely be buyin more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell... too much perfume ....and I have asthma.... so I did not continue to use it...</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me but unfortunately this bio oil alone did nothing for me. My stretch marks were relatively new still red. I switched to using the bio oil with Vaseline and that did help a bit.</li>
            <li> I love it, it make my skin look so moist.  I love to put it in my water when I soak my feet.  It also helped clear up the spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife after she delivered. Speaking on her behalf, I would say this seems work but very slowly and very effectively. It would have been a smarter idea to start using while she was pregnant but nevertheless it still works like a charm</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not thrilled with this oil, but it has a pleasant, non-sweet smell and seems to at least temporarily nourish skin&lt;br /&gt;dry from winter indoor heat and dry air.  I&#x27;m not sure that Baby Oil or something similar wouldn&#x27;t work as well,&lt;br /&gt;though, especially given the fairly high price of this oil.</li>
            <li> My boss is pregnant. She is worried about getting stretch marks at work.  She is too lazy to apply it on herself.&lt;br /&gt;If she has a bottle of it on her desk but does not want to apply it because of the smell, is it possible that we could wrap her stomach in saran wrap to contain the smell, and then also use a microderm roller (that I&#x27;ve seen here on Amazon!!) to help with stretch marks during the day?  Again she is too lazy to apply this herself and we are wanting to know if we as her employees can help our boss.  Also if this does not work I have read this can help with the \\&quot;crows feet\\&quot; around the eyes which her mom said she has- any input on this?&lt;br /&gt;Ok thank you!</li>
            <li> I was using it to prevent stretch marks throughout pregnancy. Im almost 9 months and just started to get little ones on my tummy. I think it helped. It did fade all my existing ones. Smells good and I like it.</li>
            <li> Although the product claims to diminish stretch marks and reduce appearance of scars, I personally haven&#x27;t seen noticeable benefits. However, this is a great body oil for moisturizing. It is light scented, greasy at first but then the skin absorbs it and the skin is left feeling supple and luscious. I have very dry skin and this oil is lifesaving for me. I sometimes mix it with a little bit of regular body lotion to create an emulsion for lighter hydration or to change the scent. You always need to wait at least 10 minutes before dressing.</li>
            <li> so far so good.  Hopefully there will be results soon :)</li>
            <li> Bio oil is great to use during my pregnancy.  Keeps my skin feeling soft and hydrated. Also diminishes my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I have not seen and effect of this products, but it is ok for my skin ,no irratiation, but did not works for its function,too.</li>
            <li> This is the 1st review I&#x27;ve been compelled to write and its because this product is that good. It was recommended to me by my sister-in law who had just had a baby stretch mark free. I started using it in my 4th month of pregnancy twice a day, from my breasts down to my thighs; my son is about to be 11 wks and I still use it. I assumed I was destined to get stretch marks during pregnancy since I got a lot of them during a weight gain period some years ago - the horrible, dark, big ones, on my hips, thighs and even arms. Those have since faded and are not all that noticeable but Bio Oil made them even less visible in the months I have been using it; it even faded those I had since puberty and I didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark while I was pregnant! Also, my stomach shrunk back to almost normal size and elasticity within the first 2 to 3 wks after my c-section, not sure if bio oil played a part but its definitely worth using this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work any better than olive oil - which does not work.</li>
            <li> I took some bad advice from a couple tall, long torso ladies about stretch marks not being a real problem unless you have multiples and any old moisturizer will keep your belly looking good. Total BS. Got myself a first class ground beef belly after baby number one, discovered Bio Oil a little over a year later. This in conjunction with a slightly messy homemade coffee ground scrub got my belly looking worlds better, and that in turn helped my self esteem and alleviated all the frustration I dealt with daily on account of the scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nine months in to pregnancy number two and not a single new scar, though one of the old ones is looking a little pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure to give this product time to work its magic, I used it for a bit over a year before I decided I was pleased with the results, and then popped it onto our subscribe and save list as soon as we started trying for our 2nd.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it from here anymore. I found it in my local Walgreens for like $3-4 cheaper. Works good enough though. The smell is light and fresh.</li>
            <li> I purchased Bio-oil after my daughters plastic surgeon recommended it.  It has done an excellent job of fading her scar.  It is very good on dry skin.  Smells great too.  It is an oil, so I we use it at night so the oil doesn&#x27;t get on clothing.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any miracles. Used it for over 5 months.</li>
            <li> I think this product does work. It isn&#x27;t a jaw dropping improvement but my stretch marks have improved about 30%. To me that&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> ok to use! but anything wow~</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on pregancy stretch marks, keeping my dry feet moisterized, and now as an anti aging facial moisterizer at night.  Its a bit pricy, but definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> The box is opened when it arrived, and it&#x27;s not eligible for return.  I won&#x27;t recommend it at all!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best cosmetic product I have ever got.&lt;br /&gt;Other than taking care of the skin blemishes, it works great as general moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;It can work wonders on the scars as well. It has replaced all my night care creams.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me during pregnancy to avoid stretch marks. I read other reviews and also used it on my face. I have normal to dry skin, and this product was so good to my skin. I haven&#x27;t got a single stretch marks, and it kept my skin smooth and soft. Recently I used the Bio-oil to treat a burn from kitchen oil, and the scar vanished within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Item was as described in works perfectly</li>
            <li> I bought this product for the stretch marks on my butt (not maternity marks, I don&#x27;t have kids!). I started using this oil the day it arrived (package was good, no leaks). Its been a month now, marks are reduced. But I guess it takes longer time to get natural skin tone. First thing I noticed that it makes my skin very very soft. So I started using on my face and neck. As It makes my skin oily, I apply this at night before I go to bed. I can see my face glowing after I can shower next day. Now I started applying for my whole body. Price of the product is affordable too! I strongly recommand Bio Oil. It does help my skin glow and makes it very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update review after using for 6months.</li>
            <li> Takes good care of the skin, no more expensive creams. All climate oil and thats all I need for my face skin. Reduces spots, scars, wrinkles lines..keeps your skin healthy,smooth, clean and lustrous!!</li>
            <li> Too much hype. There are better brands for cheaper that does more or less the same thing.</li>
            <li> First time I used my bio oil was when I was pregnant and used it to prevent stretch marks. I have no stretch marks at all and I come from a family where all women have HUGE stretch marks. Second time I used my bio oil was when I burned my wrist and hand with hot oil when cooking. I ended up with dark brown patches of several sizes on my hand. I used bio oil and after almost a month the small scars are completely gone and the big darker ones have become very light. Thank you Bio oil!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see what all the hype about bio-oil is. I bought it because a friend recommended it to me. I have several scars that I was hoping the bio-oil could help improve the look of them. I used it for about 2 months and saw no difference. As expected, the product is very oily and actually stained some of my clothes. After 2 moths of use I stopped using the product.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes well, but didn&#x27;t help with my stretch marks at all.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! I&#x27;m on my 29th week of pregnancy, I got one stretch mark &amp; it got rid of it over night! It lasts a long time too!</li>
            <li> I have now been using Bio-oil for two weeks morning and night.  There is a very noticeable difference in my skin, maybe not to others but certainly to me.  More even skin tone, softer and makeup just look so much better after using the bio-oil.  I read other reviews that many though the price is too high.  Are you kidding?  Trying this product at it&#x27;s price is a no-brainer.  I have used products that cost five times as much as Bio-Oil and did not get these results.  Love the product and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> n ice and fast del ivery ！！！！send it to my fri end , they re ally lik e it !</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, absorbs well. She used it after her bat and made her skin feel silky soft. Wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricy, but Amazon is the cheapest we have found!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this item to get rid of some scars I have. But after 2 weeks of daily use and seeing no improvement I stopped using it. A few months later the skin on my face became extremely dry. None of my moisturizers were making even a small difference. Then i found my old bottle of bio oil. After reading the back and seeing it could be used on dry skin i put it on my face and there was instant improvement. I have been using this as a moisturazer ever since and i have been loving it. Although, it would be nice if it could so something about my scars and stretch marks. But for skin, this is the holy grail.</li>
            <li> Yes this product is great for my type of skin and keeping scaliness around my nose under control</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do much for me :(</li>
            <li> great smell and is not grease on skin...</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the oil but it smells like cloves and old women.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister when she was pregnant with twins. She had the babies 6 weeks ago and I saw her in NY last weekend. NO stretchmarks whatsoever. She said, &amp;#34;I think that oil stuff you got me worked.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I use this on my feet. The heels of my feet get dry and cracked and this clears it right up.Also use this on my face and dry spots on body. This stuff actually works. I have tried all sorts of creams and none have worked as good as this.</li>
            <li> Worked great with some marks that I have on my skin. Truly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin problem and my face looks flaky after applying makeup. This oil worked wonders. I use it every day, especially  before applying makeup. It makes my skin looks soft and smooth. I tried many lotions but nothing showed improvement. I really like using this product.</li>
            <li> I bought bio oil for my pregnancy stretch marks. I just started using it this week so I am not sure if its works yet. It has a really pleasant flowery smell to it - it&#x27;s not too strong, which I worried about because I dont like strong scents. It also isnt greasy like other products I&#x27;ve tried. Ill write another review in a few months to update everyone on how well it actually worked on my scars. As far as shipping - I got my bio oil within a week of my purchase! Thanks Amazon for a speedy delivery!</li>
            <li> This oil is great for everything and really does help with scars!</li>
            <li> I started using this product when I was about 20 weeks pregnant (37 weeks now) and I first noticed those dreadful red lines beginning to appear on my thighs. They haven&#x27;t gotten better, but they haven&#x27;t gotten worse either, they sort of stopped in their tracks and seem to not know which way to go. Bio oil keeps then soft and smooth and rather faint in appearance, but despite routine use, I have started just recently to get some very faint marks on my belly. This isn&#x27;t the greatest product, but you get what you pay for I guess... it smells very light and clean, and I love how soft it makes my skin. It&#x27;s also good for my face, just a few drops in the morning after I wash and my skin literally glows and feels wonderful all day. All in all, it&#x27;s an excellent moisturizer, and if you&#x27;re on a budget and have a lot of patience, go ahead and try it for stretchmarks. But if you want faster, more dramatic results, I reccomend splurging a bit, and doing some research on other remedies.</li>
            <li> Helped my stretch marks. I used this with a dermaroller.</li>
            <li> I just got yesterday.....I m happy because it&#x27;s not greasy.....I can&#x27;t  tell about effects. ...I need to wait...</li>
            <li> Used it from 4 month onwards until 9 months of pregnancy, really worked for me. I hardly got any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Very very very good products.</li>
            <li> I used twice a day as recommended and my skin on hips and abdomen don&#x27;t have many obvious stretch marks, but I also think drinking 3-4 liters of water a day helped keep skin healthy as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this before. It is a great non-greasy oil that once rubbed in, absorbs into your skin. It gets very dry during the winters and this oil is used daily.</li>
            <li> My skin feels moistened and soft with very little product used.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping to reduce the severity/number of stretch marks I knew I was going to get during my pregnancy. I applied twice daily (and ruined a few shirts in the process from the greasy residue) and I still have severe stretch marks. I have only gained 25 lbs, and jot quickly, so I don&#x27;t think my weight gain is to blame here.</li>
            <li> love this stuff second bottle I have bought</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t make it without my Bio Oil!!</li>
            <li> I used it for 3 months, nothing changed......I don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> Did not see any results from this product. I spent over $400 buying this over the months and used it consistently...it did nothing for me. Smells nice but does not fade scars.</li>
            <li> Been using this product since my second month of pregnancy. I&#x27;m 3 months postpartum with no stretch marks! It&#x27;s the best stuff during and after pregnancy. Use religiously and you will have great skin. Day and night ladies! Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I have been using this oil for several weeks.  My skin has not broken out.  I only use a little so that it is not too oilly, but my skin is fully moisturized.  I even use it under my tinted moisturizer and it is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have seen such a positive change in my dry skin and it has also helped with the itching.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this a week and can already tell a difference in my skin. I am a clumsy person who has lots of scars and this product makes them less noticeable. I have always had dry/flaky skin and finding something that moisturizes without leaving me greasy or causing breakouts has been a challenge, I think this may be it! I put it on after I shower everyday and give it a few minutes to soak.</li>
            <li> Daughter really likes it.  Goes on easily &amp; doesn&#x27;t stain clothes.</li>
            <li> Still have the marks on my face, using since January. Use it every morning and nite. No results.</li>
            <li> I cant live without bio oil. Excellent for the skin.</li>
            <li> Great product , quick shipment. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> Hello all!&lt;br /&gt;I rarely ever post reviews, however this product is truly legendary, it deserves an award of its own!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a bottle of this a year ago, actually, to work on my stretch marks in my inner thighs. I was sixteen years old at the time, and I was growing too fast for my skin to handle, so I ended up getting stretch marks from the top of my thigh to a bit over half-way down. They were getting longer and redder and I was freaking out trying to find a way to stop their &amp;#34;growth&amp;#34; and to heal the scars. I did a lot of research and found that this oil had the best reviews and testimonials; I didn&#x27;t think it was that expensive (especially considering the posited outcome), so I bought a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I began to apply it (quite liberally, I might add--I was desperate) day and night on my trouble areas. Although, I must confess that I often skipped some days or only applied it once a day. In addition, I stopped after no more than two months. I am lazy, and it honestly took me quite a while to rub in the oil--probably about 30 minutes, which I didn&#x27;t have the patience for. So I just stopped. But after comparing my before-and-after photos (I was skeptical before I had started as to whether or not the bio-oil would really work), I saw evidence that confirmed what I had already learned over those two months--this oil is black magic! In some photos, the lines were invisible! You couldn&#x27;t even tell there were blemishes beforehand, which is truly truly remarkable considering that I had started out using the oil when my marks were constantly a harsh, angry red (I couldn&#x27;t even wear gym shorts, because my stretch marks were so visible past the hem--which is another reason that prompted me to actively find a solution to &amp;#34;removing&amp;#34; them by using this oil). On the worst appearances, they were very faintly red. I am not entirely sure, but I am guessing that they became more visible when blood flow increased around my thighs such as while running and such.&lt;br /&gt;It has been a year now, and I would like to update the status of my inner thigh stretch marks--they are usually &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; (unless, of course, you look closely; but from the outer appearance, they are not visible, so I can wear shorts again!), but sometimes you can see the faintest white sheen. I must also add that I did lose ten pounds along the way, so I think that helped. But really, these marks probably came from my increase in height over the past few years. I was never really fat to begin with, and at my worst I was a size 4/6 in women&#x27;s clothing, which was last summer. And there hasn&#x27;t been much progress in their disappearance since after I stopped using the oil, so I must contribute all of the success in my story to this bio-oil. I am truly, terrifically grateful, I cannot even express how much this oil has done for me!&lt;br /&gt;One final update: I started using this to target the stretch marks on my butt (like the typical &amp;#34;zebra-print&amp;#34;-like white lines I know a lot of other people have) just yesterday (my first use since last summer). I used it once. And today, I found that they have already disappeared quite a bit! Once again, I must stress that I used the oil quite liberally (by the way, this is my second bottle-- after last year&#x27;s usage), so that might go a long way ( I don&#x27;t necessarily smother it all over my skin, but I am certainly not stingy as I admittedly usually am with other products). In addition, as a final parting note, I want to give a brief summary on my results to conclude this review: 1) I only used it for less than two months, even though the instructions say to use it for a minimum of three. Furthermore, I was very incompetent in my application of the oil, as I skipped many days, even successively. So, my amazing results aren&#x27;t even near the best results that I could have gotten-- a true testament to how absolutely remarkable this oil really is. 2) This worked very very well for me. I cannot say with absolute certainty that this will be the case for everyone else, however I can say with 1000% certainty that this is a must buy--an absolute must buy. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to buy one bottle and try it out (in my opinion), and it really does work. I might even go as far as to say that this is a life changer. It has certainly given me back my full confidence with my body image, as I am one of those people who absolutely hate scars, and I was always self-conscious about other people seeing me with those glaring streaks across my skin when I wanted to wear shorts while going out. Now, I can happily wear any shorts I want without a second thought.&lt;br /&gt;To the company of this oil: thank you. Thank you thank you thank you.</li>
            <li> Any one with scabs or burns or scars I strongly recommend using this over Neosporin or Mederma (once a scab is formed don&#x27;t use on open wounds). Full disclosure I used it in conjunction with ASAP365 SilverGel (available on Amazon for $15ish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got some wicked grease burns on my chest 2.5 months ago, used this suggested combo and within three weeks they were healed without scaring. Burned my hand last night and used the combo immediately and I can all ready see that it is going to heal well. Old scars I&#x27;ve had for years are beginning to lighten, too. Nice to find a cheap solution after I spent a bunch of money over the years trying to lighten/soften old scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus way cheaper than prescription or expensive stuff. The Silver Gel and Bio Oil cost that $30 for both medium sized bottles off Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works well so far for applying to scar tissue.</li>
            <li> Using it for almost a week now, switched over from Palmers Tummy Butter after I got a rash from it. I love this stuff… smells great, absorbs quickly…</li>
            <li> I bought this item believing I was receiving 4.2 oz of Bio-Oil for $15 like the product title indicates. After reading multiple reviews on both amazon and other sites I decided to order the product. Unfortunately I failed to read the product description stating that it was \\&quot;One two-ounce bottle\\&quot; as anything more than a simple desire to copy and paste a description from a different sized product. I do not appreciate the inconsistency and will be contacting Amazon (the seller). This was my first bad experience with Amazon after years of great service.</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old &amp; have used Bio Oil on my face for about 10 years now.  It helps even out any redness and those ugly brown spots. I originally started using this on a scar on my neck many years ago. It makes your skin so soft. I now use it on my face &amp; neck and all around my eyes...just a tiny pat around the eye is all you need.</li>
            <li> I had used Bio-Oil before which was purchased at my local drug store, but it was only 2 oz.  This oil is amazing.  I injured my arm on a screw that was protruding from a piece of wood and had a long visible scar (about 1\\&quot;) after it healed.  I would use the bio-oil every day and within two weeks, it started to get smaller.  It has been about 6 weeks now and it is about half-an-inch long and is less visible.  I bought more of the Bio-oil from Amazon for other scars that have been around for a long time.  I will be sure to keep the oil on hand in case I may need it in the future.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin and found this lite weight oil to be a great adjunct to other moisturizers.  I highly recommend prior to applying lotions.</li>
            <li> I rubbed this all over my belly, breasts, thighs and butt while I was pregnant. I never got any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product and highly recommend it.  Really makes a difference in how my neck and the backs of my hads look.  Gives me younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent  product  that  I  can  not  live without  it</li>
            <li> I use bio oil every night.  I&#x27;m 36 weeks and my stretchmarks are minimal. Love the absorption.  Better than lotion!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. It smells ok and doesn&#x27;t seem to be too greasy for too long like some oils can be.</li>
            <li> I used this from the second or third month of pregnancy to prevent stretch marks and guess what they end up being everywhere. I even took it to work to put on three times a day didn&#x27;t do anything. Its a good moisturizer but its oily and gets on clothes. I used this my whole pregnancy still using it now and my daughter is 3 months does absolutely nothing but moisturize and make the skin soft.  I continue to use it because excellent moisturizer but as far as stretch marks purposes does NOT work.</li>
            <li> I was using palmers products and at 38 weeks started noticing stretch marks. I started using bio oil on the stretch marks and they have become lighter after a week of use. I really wasn&#x27;t sure about using the oil thinking it would be really greasy and get on everything but it soaks in pretty well!!</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful for scars, new and old and stretch marks. You will literally have to see to believe the magic it does on aged sun damaged skin. LOVE  THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> I use bio oil all the time now that I&#x27;m pregnant with my second child! With my first I didn&#x27;t use it a lot because I tend to forget, and with that came stretch marks! Now that its done i have many marks and use this oil to help tone it down and to prevent more from coming. Needless to say its working like a charm! It&#x27;s not as dark as it use to be, and though its not all gone its much better than it was before! Totally buy for a great price! And also this company ships in good time frame and is never damaged!</li>
            <li> I brought this product for my wife. She is pregnant and she started complain that her belly was itching at the beginning of the second trimester. We went on line and found this lotion. We then started to search for the best price on line and found it on Amazon. She has been using now for a few weeks and loves it, plus her belly is very soft.</li>
            <li> I use this product for both myself and my daughter. We Spanish and she is also mixed with black but is very fair skinned. I have used this on different marks and blemishes. Since my skin is darker I get dark scars. This has def helped to lighten many fresh scars, but does not really impact or make a make a difference on existing scars that have been there for a long time or scars from deep cuts either.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really make a difference to the skin. Just made skin really wet for a couple of mins, and then went to dry again. Weird that it is also isn&#x27;t non-comedogenic, as most products are nowadays.</li>
            <li> I would have given 3 stars if the product wasn&#x27;t so expensive or hyped up. I used this for 3 months day and night on my face for some slight discoloration and minimal acne scars. I found nothing special or even effective about bio-oil. It did nothing but clog my pores and break me out. It wasn&#x27;t even an effective moisturizer. Save your money!!! All these great reviews must be bogus.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was this oil or a combination of things, but I have no stretch marks and loved using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was about 4 mo pregnant when I got it, and I used it daily in the mornings. I did use a home made mix of cocoa butter/coconut oil at night every day with it. Whatever it was, I had my baby and did not have a single stretch mark. Not sure if it was the oil, the butter mix or working out, but I didnt have any stretchmarks, and I liked how this oil felt on my skin. It wasn&#x27;t greasy to stay on my clothes (i would use it after the shower in the morning, and would soak the excess with papertowell before dressing). Like the smell of it (you know how some smells irritate you during pregnancy). If I ever get pregnant again, this will be the first thing i get.</li>
            <li> I been using this for about 2 months and i have seen little to no results</li>
            <li> love Bio oil. Leaves my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s inexpensive, so you get what you pay for. It has lots of mineral oil which is pretty much just a filler or an ingredient that coats the skin but it does prevent moisture loss. I&#x27;ve been applying it religiously to my thighs during pregnancy. I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s reduced the appearance of my stretch marks, but I do believe it&#x27;s prevented me from getting more.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  I have been using this for several months and I have noticed a difference!</li>
            <li> I love this product and it was a good deal.</li>
            <li> No doubt it works miracle</li>
            <li> Seems to be the only thing that helps my severely dry skin.  Soaks in quickly without leaving a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Ive only used this for two days but what i was most surprised with is that not only is it moisturizing and made my skin instantly look alive and awesome (still need to put on makeup though), but most importantly, it didn&#x27;t break me out!!!!!  And this is an oil!! Anytime i have strayed away from my usual moisturizer even trying natural oils, my chin will be the first to rage when it aint working out and that only takes a few hours. With this oil, no breakout whatsoever. So this rating/review is probably premature but im excited to see the rest of what this miracle oil has to offer!! Hope it will fade my acne scars om my cheeks and chin. Will post an update in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  My sister introduced me to Bio Oil after I commented on how well a scar was fading that she received from surgery.  She told me that the nurses in the hospital told her about Bio Oil and highly recommend it to patients who are left with scars after receiving surgery.  I have been using this product day and night to help keep my skin youthful.</li>
            <li> I have watched  my wife use this product I&#x27;m this pregnancy and it works great .Even  her stretch marks from before are clearing up. Hats off to the developers</li>
            <li> best thing you could ever buy, it really works!</li>
            <li> Good product, but must use every day.</li>
            <li> Some time ago, I was putting this oil on my face and body regularly but I stopped using it because I wasn&#x27;t seeing any results. Tonight, while cleaning out my bathroom cabinet, I found the bottle and came back to Amazon to read reviews to see if I should consider giving it another try or throw it out. With the help of another reviewer of this product, I think I know why a small knot appeared on the side of my nose during the time that I was using this oil or shortly afterwards. The reviewer said that this product caused him/her to get acne nodules, which I had never heard of before tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have problem skin before using this oil, I just wanted to make my skin more even-toned and the product had such great reviews. The little knot on my face appeared out of nowhere; I had never had anything like this on my skin before. After googling for and finding pictures of acne nodules tonight, I can see that this is most likely what I have. According to what I&#x27;ve read online tonight about acne nodules, I&#x27;ll need to go to a dermatologist to have it diagnosed and treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, most reviewers of this product feel it is effective, but I will not use this on my face again. Maybe I&#x27;ll use what&#x27;s left in the bottle on my stomach and legs until it is all gone. If you choose to try this oil, I suggest you pay very close attention to any changes in your face or skin while using it.</li>
            <li> didnt notice that much of a difference in reducing stretch marks but left skin feeling soft</li>
            <li> I have been continuously using this on my legs for stretch marks.  While it does leave my skin soft, it has not improved my stretch marks.  I have almost used the entire bottle.  Will not be using this again.</li>
            <li> Light weight oil, hydrates skin.</li>
            <li> Bio oil lightened my stretchmarks from years ago and now I feel comfortable wearing a bikini !!!!</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to this product.  My chest and neck broke out in a bad rash withing two days of using it.</li>
            <li> So far so good. It&#x27;s smooth light and doesn&#x27;t take a lot to apply a lot of coverage!</li>
            <li> used this my entire pregnancy, 2 a day, not one stretch mark!!! did you hear me, not one!!! this product delivers but must use twice a day, can get expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it, once that kid pops out and your belly return to normal! can&#x27;t rave about this product any more!</li>
            <li> IT DOESNT TAKE AWAY STRETCH MARKS ITS JUST MAKES IT LOOK BETTER , SMELLS GREAT ..IT LAST LONG ..I WOULD BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> I really like this, I&#x27;ve used it on my tummy tuck scar and it&#x27;s definitely helped to fade the scar. Can break out the chest area so be careful but all in all great stuff !</li>
            <li> i was expecting so much more after using this product for a few months, but unfortunately it let me down, no improvements in skin so i give it 3 stars</li>
            <li> I got hit in the lip with a softball this summer and have a nice chunk of scar tissue I have to massage 2x day.  To start, the scar was discolored, mainly red, but after about a month of using this stuff it is now the same color as the rest of my face.  I have used it on other scars on myself, and my husband and have found it is a miracle oil!&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I have always had issues finding the perfect face lotion, as I am 34, I am not oily, but not dry...right in the middle.  I have tried literally 20-30 lotions over the past few years, from the cheap to the expensive, all seemed to have the same issue with starting off good in the first part of the day, but making my face oily by days end.  Although I finally found a face lotion I love, it is almost $100 for a small container, so one day I thought, why not try the bio-oil?  IT IS OFFICIALLY MY FAVORITE FACE \\&quot;LOTION\\&quot; EVER!  Not only does my husband daily tell my how much he loves how my face smells, I love how it does not make my face oily at any point in the day.  In addition, I LOVE the way it makes my skin look when I wear no make-up - it really evens out red spots and sun damage.  LOVE this for scars and daily face oil and will never go back to anything else!</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel really soft and smooth. the price for the size of the bottle is actually not bad and I would buy again once the oil was finished.</li>
            <li> Got immediate headaches as soon as I started using this. They went away as soon as I stopped. Read up on the ingredients. Toxic.</li>
            <li> I rave about this product to anyone who will listen.  I have hideous dry patches on my face and not only were they irritating but kind of embarrassing because they looked so flakey.  After three days of using this they were completely gone.  Like 100%.  This is better than any moisturizing lotion I have ever used.  Use it all over your face right after you wash it and it will just soak into your skin and leave it feeling so soft and smooth.  I can&#x27;t get enough of this.  I would give it as many stars as I could!</li>
            <li> My first time using this but  I like it</li>
            <li> I am already 26 weeks and I don&#x27;t see any scars. So, am loving it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too oily! My skin doesn&#x27;t absorb it that much</li>
            <li> I have been using Bio Oil for the past 6 months and have had great results. I use it alone or under my moisturizer.  Shipment was very quick and efficient</li>
            <li> This was bought for our daughter. She uses this product daily along with several of her friends.  They use it to lighten their stretch marks and it works wonderful. They all love it.  I will be buying more for our daughter in law after she has the baby,  because of course She&#x27;s complaining about stretch marks. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about and it has really cleared up my skin.  It&#x27;s very oily, but I use it instead of lotion on my face.  Love it!</li>
            <li> very good and i love it!</li>
            <li> I just finished using Bio-Oil once a day, every day, for 13 months straight. There was no noticable difference as far as skin improvement goes. The product was far too greasy for me, and my skin didn&#x27;t seem to want to absorb it well, even if I spent several minutes rubbing it into my skin. The product made me break out in some of the areas I applied it, especially on my chest. After I stopped using Bio-Oil, my skin cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend Bio-Oil if you have natually oily skin and are prone to breakouts. If you don&#x27;t have those issues, maybe you should still give this product a try based on the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but this oil makes my hands feel rough.  If I wash them immediately after applying the lotion, it seems to help.  The oil itself is nice because it&#x27;s not oily, but definitely makes my skin feel moisture.  I don&#x27;t know that it helps take away dark spots.</li>
            <li> In terms of stretch marks, it really did not help with ones that I have, but that may be due to the fact that they are old, white stretch marks. I applied twice a day for a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; However, I use this on my face with my face lotion before bed and a little bit in the morning. It helps moisturize my dry skin better, reduce acne scars, and improve general complexion/tone of my skin. It also helps reduce the appearance my forehead wrinkles (I&#x27;m 23) somewhat. However, be careful during the day not too put too much on your face, it will make you face oily for a while and make it hard to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bio Oil on my face for about two years.  I put it on in the morning after showering and wait about 5 minutes before putting on makeup.  It plumps up the skin and makes the texture velvety.  I live in a very dry climate and Bio Oil has made such a difference improving the skin on my face.  An excellent product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell of this product. The oil absorbs well and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> It smoothens your skin and gives you a very beautiful look! My pores lessened and also it made my face brighter. I stopped using it for my stretch mark since i already have no time for the past weeks but i think it is effective.</li>
            <li> have not seen any improvement on my skin. and have to say, do not use it in summer, unless you like oily face.</li>
            <li> First the size is awesome and, not available anywhere else. I used it on my stomach after a hysterectomy...... In which the surgeon needed to open a 33 year old C-Section scar. Works extremely well. Even on the very old stretch marks!</li>
            <li> It seems that it&#x27;s useful</li>
            <li> I decided to use this product when pregnant with my first child because it was highly rated in the United Kingdom and I saw an ad in a baby magazine.  I used this twice a day with my first child and am using it again with my second.  I have about three very faint stretch marks from my 8.5lb first child.  While it&#x27;s super greasy to apply (it is oil after all), it dries quickly and leaves no residue on my clothes.  There is no fragrance too which is nice when your pregnant.  If I feel super full after a meal and feel my skin stretching, I will apply a little oil and my skin is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price in the stores is much higher than on Amazon and if you subscribe and save, you can reduce the price even more.</li>
            <li> I moved from high humidity areas to desert area, and my skin did not liked it. I use Bio-Oil daily before my moisturizer with SPF. And that helps a lot. Despite humidity below 20%, hot winds, and merciless sun, my skin stays moisturized the whole day. Yeah, I pay this with a bit of shine, but I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> While ago I had a severe sun burn on my back, which caused severe back acne problem. I was successful in curing the back acne, however, the acne spots remained there and my back looked terrible like I have a skin disease. I decided to give this a try due to the high ratings and a recommendation from a friend and by using it for two weeks, I&#x27;m seeing tremendous improvement. Some spots are completely removed and overall the redness is quite suppressed. Can&#x27;t believe how well this works!</li>
            <li> I bought this for the large pores on my face and as a moisturizer. My first reaction was uneasiness due to the pink colour, thinking it may not be as \\&quot;natural\\&quot; as it claims. I was right. It smells awful due to the added fragrances, much like some kind of old lady perfume, and I hated having to walk around smelling it for hours after I put it on. Also, both times I applied 1-2 drops as recommended, my skin turned red and started stinging. It was not moisturizing at all but instead dried out my naturally oily skin. The consistency is light and liquidy, not the thick, nourishing oil texture I was wanting. Definitely not worth any benefits with all the side effects, unnatural ingredients, and bad smell. Plus, it&#x27;s pretty pricey. Vitamin E oil smells better, has great healing properties, is all natural, feels better on the skin, and costs $2.</li>
            <li> good for your body and face, it has good feeling and easy to use, many people recommended it to me</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend.She found it reasonable as she have used it before. She have not had any issues and would like to issue it out to all who wants to try.</li>
            <li> I swear by bio-oil! It works so wonderful! I have used it on two pregnancies since discovering it and it really makes a difference. If I had only known about it for my first pregnancy!</li>
            <li> Nice and light oil. Started using when my scars were 7weeks old. Notice improvements weekly! Using with silicone scar sheets for 24hr action</li>
            <li> I have used this every night of my pregnancy to sleep with on since i found out i was pregnant and although i still have a couple months to go i am yet to see a stretch mark. I think this product is awesome and i will continue to use it all over even after my baby comes. One thing i will say is if your like me and you like to layer lotions or oils i do recommend only using it at night and with a tight night shirt on that you don&#x27;t mind messing up a little. I have not destroyed any of my clothing yet but i have heard that people cant get out oil spots when they use this. Ive noticed if i wear a tight shirt to bed the oil is still there in the morning and that is exactly what i was looking for in a stretch mark product I want something that stays.</li>
            <li> The first time I discovered bio-oil was at a local pharmacy. I was skeptical since it&#x27;s very small and pricey but I went for it and I am so glad that I did! Bio-oil works great on all kinds of scarring and stretches. I get acne scars and somewhat blotchy scars that are much darker like scabs when mosquitos bite me because I have sensitive skin. Over time, bio oil has gotten rid of all of them. Make sure to use it daily and where ever you do, it will significantly help-- even with more indented stretch marks or scarring. Buy the big one (this 4.2 oz) and save some money while you&#x27;re at it too. It dries quickly, doesn&#x27;t stain clothes, and has a mild/light smell that I actually quite like. :)</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! Great for Scars, stretch marks etc. Continue to buy this! Works to smoothen out stretch marks &amp; minimizes scars.</li>
            <li> I have heard so much about Bio-Oil so I thought I would try it to get rid of scars and stretch marks I have and I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference yet but I&#x27;m still on my first bottle and it says to use 2 times a day for 3 months. So I will keep using it and hopefully it works.</li>
            <li> I happen to see a commercial on the tv of the oil, so I looked at the reviews on Amazon.  I so wish I had this when I was pregnant instead of cocoa butter which did absolutely nothing for me.  I had so many stretch marks and I decided to buy this oil.  I wouldn&#x27;t typically spend this much on oil, but I am not loving the stretch marks.  In 4 weeks, I am already seeing a huge improvement.  They are so much lighter than they were.  I have already bought a second bottle too.  I have been using it on my c section scar as well and am not seeing much of a difference there, but it works wonders on stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works great. Would work better if I could remember to use it everyday. Ha ha. And it smells great.</li>
            <li> Ii continue to order this because it keeps my dry skin moisturized and soft, without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Since my wife has been pregnant she has been using this stuff every night and I could tell the difference immediately her skin is softer and honestly it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> My legs look super smooth but i don&#x27;t see any scar reduction yet. It&#x27;s only been a few weeks though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had and been using this product about 3 weeks, enjoy that it makes my skin feel smooth.&lt;br /&gt;However, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel any more hydrated than previously; I feel like I should be using a moisturizer as well.&lt;br /&gt;I know I need to use it a little longer for any &amp;#34;visible results&amp;#34; so I will give it a few more weeks to see if there is any noticeable change in my skin texture, the little discolorations that are starting to appear on my face, or a reduction in wrinkles. If not, course I will finish the product, just not purchase more. If there is an improvement, I will certainly update my opinion.</li>
            <li> It is good! It smell good and I used it just a short time so I don&#x27;t know is it work...</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for fresh 1st and 2nd degree burns that I acquired a few months back.  They are on my right arm and right leg in visible areas so I really wanted to get rid of the scarring before it is too late.  I am done with the large size bottle and there is absolutely no difference in the scarring.  I followed instructions and used it twice a day but I can&#x27;t report any progress.  I wish this oil worked but unfortunately I am stuck with the scars until I can find something that I will fade it over time.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this from my local enabler at the cosmetic counter at Walgreens (thanks, MJ) who helps to feed my nail polish addiction.  She&#x27;d said she used it on her face and it had gotten rid of some discolorations and was a great moisturizer besides.  Because of the mineral oil, I can&#x27;t use it on my face but I had wondered out loud if it would do some good for my nails, which can be very dry, have lots of ridges and basically look pretty bad without polish.  MJ gave me two little packets and told me to try it.  I did put the oil in a small bottle so that it was easier to use with as little waste as possible.  I applied this on top and underneath my nails and on my cuticles and massaged it in several times over the next two days then went back to Walgreens to purchase a full 2 oz bottle.  Maybe it&#x27;s my imagination or wishful thinking or whatever but I do believe the ridges in my nails are diminishing.  My cuticles never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I know the &#x27;experts&#x27; out there will probably say that the nail plate itself is dead and won&#x27;t absorb anything (so, explain to me how nails can become water logged then, geniuses) but I really believe this oil is helping my nails look better, even the supposedly dead nail plate.  They now have a slight shine that they never had before.  Polish goes on and looks smooth but the oil does need to be removed first or the polish won&#x27;t adhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is oil so there is some greasiness involved but I just rub the excess into the rest of my hands and am also seeing some good results there.  Sometimes I use lotion and sometimes lotion isn&#x27;t needed at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you can&#x27;t use this on your face as a moisturizer or don&#x27;t have any scarring, try it on your nails.  You might be pleasantly surprised at the results.</li>
            <li> I use this all over in lieu of body lotion after showering. As with any body oil, goes on best when skin is wet not dry, so post shower is optimal. I but this over and over again because I enjoy it that much.</li>
            <li> My favorite product. It really helps soften and clear my skin.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne for about 7 years now and I never knew that my skin could be this clear! I started using this twice a day, applying it morning and night after washing my face. I even put it on under my makeup! My skin seems to love this stuff because my complexion has never been better. It has taken away the redness and cleared the blemishes. This stuff is amazing. ANYONE STRUGGLING WITH ACNE, DO NOT SPEND A TON OF MONEY ON EXPENSIVE TREATMENTS!! The treatment you have always been looking for is right here. Love love love this stuff. It will be a part of my skin care regimen for a long time!</li>
            <li> I Started using the product after i gave birth thats when i began noticing the stretch marks on my tights and so i decided to give it a try, it workssss!!  I currently have no marks at all and my skin is ready to hit the beach and look beautiful</li>
            <li> Did kinda erase my scars on my left knee. Compared to my right one, my left knee is like new-bore. This is great.</li>
            <li> I recently had a baby and had stretch marks that were seriously depressing me. They were dark purple and my skin is very pale so they were obvious. I was sad knowing that at the age of 28, I could never wear a bikini. So I gave this stuff a try. After 3 weeks, I started seeing a difference...slowly but surely. Then I bought a derma roller (look that up) and within a week of using both, they are almost gone!!!!!!! Its truly amazing!!!!!!! I have also used it on sun spots and I got the linea nigra when I was pregnant too and those results are very very slow too. But this stuff works!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work for scars. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now, maybe a month and I don&#x27;t see a difference. It also feels oily even after it &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Friend recommended, should can effect</li>
            <li> I really like this oil!  It&#x27;s the first body oil I&#x27;ve ever used, but other pregnant ladies recommended it.  I don&#x27;t know if it will prevent stretch marks, but I am 8 months pregnant and don&#x27;t have any yet.  It absorbs pretty quickly, has a nice, light scent and moisturizes like crazy.  I have heard that your stomach can get itchy when pregnant due to dryness, but not with this oil!</li>
            <li> Good stuff and nice size bottle for the price!</li>
            <li> This product does not absorb very quickly; do not apply this product and then immediately put on clothes that are good or immediately rest on blankets you care about because this stuff is greasy.  Once the product is absorbed, I found that it actually led to excessive itchiness.  Lastly, the product does not last a very long time.  If using even once a day, it will run out quickly.  Rather than an oil, I strongly prefer creams and Cetaphil has been one of the easiest creams to use and has seemed to be just as effective at keeping stretch marks and blemishes at bay during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Good price and excellent product. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Made me itch like crazy</li>
            <li> This stuff smells very good. When I put it on, I don&#x27;t need anything else. No perfume, nothing. I bought it on a friend&#x27;s recommendation because I have a lot of raised and visible scarring on my arms. It&#x27;s taken about 7 months, but I am starting to see a bit of a difference. Not a lot, but just a little. So yes, I love this Bio-oil and will definitely buy it a 3rd time :)</li>
            <li> Great price, great product. Noticed stretch marks from my pregnancy disappear after 2 months</li>
            <li> I came to know about this oil through my doctor for stretch marks while I was 5 months pregnant. I started using it daily but I am little disappointed because in my final month I got lots of stretch marks even after using this product continuously. But, I hope it help others to improve their skin as it did for me.&lt;br /&gt;I would recomment this product.</li>
            <li> It helps reduces the scar and I had really dark ones, but it gave me a breakout hence the 3 stars.</li>
            <li> It is everything that previous customers have said. Love it, am 76 and at this age have dry skin. Bio-oil has solved my problem and it smells wonderful too!</li>
            <li> Awesome am ordering more</li>
            <li> I took a tumble mountain biking over a month and a half ago and I got a nasty scar on my right elbow.  I get keloidal and thought to get a scar cream/oil to prevent my scar from irregularly healing.  Stopped by at the Walmart to compare scar creams and was amazed at how expensive they were when obviously the only active ingredient most tube scar creams had was sunblock.  I already use sunblock and don&#x27;t need my scar cream to be an overpriced tube of sunblock for my scar so I decided on the bio oil.  It was priced cheaper compared to the scar creams and seemed to have active ingredients that you would want reacting with your skin to heal a nasty scar.  After a month of use, mostly applying once at night after showering, my scar is nearly gone.  There is still a noticeable brown blemish but considering how it looked before bio-oil it is a huge improvement.  And my bottle of 4.2 oz bio-oil does not seem to be getting used at all!!!  It&#x27;s amazing, after a month and a half of use I could probably head back to the Walmart to return this thing because it still looks full to the brim and I assure you I apply this thing liberally to my scar.  It just lasts long I suppose and with the 4.2 oz it will probably last a very very long time with moderate use.  This is a great product.  Did the trick for my scars! It should do magic for you too.</li>
            <li> works wonders i love it super easy to just rub on and go</li>
            <li> It was ok it absorbed well, but is something you have to do everyday for at least a year.</li>
            <li> I bought BioOil for stretch marks. I was a bit weary since the oil is mass marketed, but figured I would try it out. I do like that it absorbs very well and doesn&#x27;t leave much of an oily feel. The smell was a bit strong for me though, I have a strong sensitivity to smells, but some may find it appealing, I thought I smelled a bit like an old lady. I also wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable applying to the face. I feel it may cause breakouts, but I have sensitive skin so it may work wonders for people with darker skin tones. I haven&#x27;t seen much difference with the stretch marks yet, but it does make the skin soft. Conclusion, I would save my money and buy something at an Apothecary or natural pharmacy next time.</li>
            <li> Not one stretch mark and I have genes and Bio oil to thank!!! I applied daily and I loved that it is not greasy, like many other pregnancy oils. I recommend this oil to all my pregnant friends!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used this product to help prevent stretchmarks during and after pregnancy. I&#x27;m not sure if it actually helps, but I like to think so.</li>
            <li> On my 3rd pregnancy and the only thing i have used for all 3 of them! and I don&#x27;t have stretch marks</li>
            <li> hmmm doesnt work for me</li>
            <li> smells good helps scars and stretch marks it is also cheaper on here than i found it in any store</li>
            <li> I like this oil alot ..... can use it all over, is not sticky and makes your skin nice and smooth .</li>
            <li> I love this oil already I just got it yesturday it smells beautiful with a touch of medicine I love it my grandmother uses this and so has others in my family&#x27;s and they receive great results I hope to do the same because I just had a baby girl 2 months ago and has been depressed about my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It a great product I noticed a huge difference as soon as three days after first use</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t use the oil long enough to see my result</li>
            <li> I bought this for reducing stretch marks in pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;I applied at least 2 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;After my pregnancy I had lots of stretch marks. I applied it after my baby was born too.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it reduced it- but I don&#x27;t think it did such a good job.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m now 38 weekspregnant and tried different creams,butters, and oils at first until I decided to try the bio-oil.  It&#x27;s only oily when you first lather it on, but it keeps you moisturized all day.  I only used it twice a day, until just about a week ago I started applying it three times daily as indicated.  No signs of stretch marks and I have old stretch marks in my hips from puberty - so I know I&#x27;m not just one if those lucky women that never get them.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the buzz about it. I have a number of scars from surgery and nothing else worked in clearing them up, figured I would give it a try. I used this for a couple of months and I definitely notice a difference in my scars. It works very very well for that. A+. I will continue to use it and see if the scars continue to improve, but seeing the difference now, I am very happy. I would use this for more skin conditions, but honestly, the fact that I don&#x27;t know what the ingredients are, since most of them are chemicals I can&#x27;t even pronounce, I really don&#x27;t want to put this all over my body. I know the latest beauty research is all about oils, and they are very effective for skin care, so I did some additional research and found [[ASIN:B007VEPVZC Bel Essence - (2oz) 100% All-Natural, Organic Anti-Wrinkle Oil Treatment with Argan, Grapeseed and Avocado Oil]]. This is 5 natural oils, no chemicals, and as far as moisturizing, healing and improving your skin condition - IT WORKS. I feel better about using Bio Oil when I am using the Bel Essence as a regular skin care. Some of the natural oils also help scarring, but so far, the Bio Oil works faster for scars. As far as treating dry skin and some lines and wrinkles, can&#x27;t beat the Bel Essence though.  My skin is smoother, the fine lines are gone, the deeper lines that went across my forehead like crevices are down to short, barely noticeable lines and the dark spots on my skin are mostly faded.  The two products have changed my skin permanently for the better.  I&#x27;m most amazed at the scars - the bio oil did a nice job on them, and the bel essence helped move that along too.  I&#x27;m not turning my face to one side anymore when I talk to people.    UPDATE:  My burn scars are so much less noticeable after a few months.  And the Bel Essence has done wonders for my skin.  I think it also has helped the effects of the Bio Oil too - the scar skin is softer, the scars aren&#x27;t bumpy any more, so I&#x27;m really happy.I found out that some of the natural oils in the Bel Essence help correct scars, so maybe the combination makes everything work better.  Not questioning it, I&#x27;m just going to keep using both!  Really happy with my skin now.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of bio oil and so far this has worked the best. I started using it at the beginning of my second trimester and I already had 3 small strech marks on my breasts. I like the oil because my skin feels lubricated longer throught the day and I do not get the urge to scratch. If used as directed it should continue to do its job. So far I am completely satisfied with my purchase and I will continue to buy it. :)</li>
            <li> The product have the results depicted to have and from word of mouth. The best price I have seen. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have stretch marks but not from pregnancy.  When I was in my teens I had a huge growth spurt that caused stretch marks to form on my waist and thighs.  I decided to try Bio Oil to help with my stretch marks, and I have noticed somewhat of a difference.  I have been using it for about a month now.  Within the first two weeks I noticed that some of my stretch marks were completely fading.  However, the really silvery ones were still there.  I think that if I continue to use this product it will help with those ones as well.  I really like how fast it dries.  The oil quickly absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my legs in hopes to lighten scarring from years of trichotillomaina. I use it once in the morning and wear socks over the application and again in the evening before bed. It has done a good job of lightening the older scars and keeping the skin and current scabs soft. It&#x27;s embarrassing to live with the scars and red, angry marks but this has been doing a good job clearing it up for me. I am almost done with two weeks of daily application and I am looking forward to springtime when I can expose my legs with less shame and less scarring. I would recommend this to anyone suffering from self conscious scarring looking for an answer to clearing up their skin.</li>
            <li> I love the subscription service and the product.  Using BiOil on my face works better than expensive facial creams.  It is so soothing on dry skin.</li>
            <li> After two pregnancies, stretch marks did a small number on my stomach, thighs, and buttocks. I&#x27;ve had stretch marks for just over two years. About four days ago, I began using Bio-oil 2x daily to help fade them away...and it&#x27;s working! My stretch marks have faded from a light purple color to a silvery, barely visible color. I&#x27;ve never seen anything that works so well and so fast! I like how smooth my skin feels after using it. It is a little bit greasy, but I would take that any day over stretch marks! The scent is light and not overwhelming. If you&#x27;re looking to fade scars and stretch marks, then I definitely recommend this for you! Every person&#x27;s skin is different, so I can&#x27;t 100% guarantee that it&#x27;ll work, but I can tell you, it&#x27;s sure worth a try compared to all the other $200 plus stuff out there! :)</li>
            <li> Previously used liquid vitamin E for dark spots, scars and other skin blemishes. Now use this product exclusively. Also makes a great lubricant for deep massage.</li>
            <li> The wife uses it ever day during her pregnancy and is just getting ready to order some more. It is helping keep new marks from appearing and lessening the appearance of the ones she has from previous pregnancies.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.. It makes my skin feel so soft...</li>
            <li> I have been using bio oil under and around my eyes to deal with crows feet (I&#x27;m 30, in good shape, but noticing those little lines). After a few weeks I noticed a difference and softening of the lines. I was using bio oil all over my face and I found that this caused me to break out (not all the time, but enough to put an end to using it anywhere but around my eyes). Anyway, as far as lines go, I&#x27;m not saying the lines magically disappeared or that this is some kind of miracle lotion, but it has helped reduce lines by about 50%. The price isn&#x27;t too bad and worth a try if you are looking for a beauty fix :)</li>
            <li> I use it for my face in the winter and hair for all year i love it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any negative reviews for this product. I&#x27;m still currently in the testing phase, this being my 2nd bottle. I got stretch marks from my pregnancy, mainly around the back of my knees and thighs. After reading the uses for this product I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have a horrible scent, actually it&#x27;s quite pleasing to smell. Leaves my skin feeling moist &amp; oily. I haven&#x27;t noticed any dryness from using it as I did with other oils. It&#x27;s quite a small bottle for the price so after rubbing this continuously over my body during my pregnancy I tend to run out of it soon.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I ran out of leather conditioner and grabbed the bottle of Bio Oil.  It goes on oily but is quickly absorbed into the leather.  I now use it on new handbags and boots before I wear them and apply again two or three times a year.  It restores old leather, enhances the shine, and seems to prevent cracking.  Light color leather may darken some but begins to lighten up about twelve hours later.  I do a second coat on wallets and bags where the leather folds to keep it supple.  If it came in gallon size I would use it on my leather furniture.  I spread it around with my fingers and my hands benefit from the treatment, especially cuticles.  I also rub some on my hands before putting on garden gloves.  I don&#x27;t use it on my face as my skin is oily.  I buy it to use on leather, not on me.</li>
            <li> Great product. Arrived promptly</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to prevent stretch marks during pregnancy. I try to avoid products containing dangerous chemicals, but for some reason I didn&#x27;t do my research with Bio-Oil. I guess I just bought into the idea of simple, nature-based products their ads suggest. What a mistake. After using this daily during my second trimester I found out that it’s full of chemicals, and rated 8 (high concern) by the environmental working group (EWG) database. Among the ingredient concerns they cite there is DEVELOPMENTAL AND REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY. And this product is advertised for pregnant women! If you buy it, particularly if you are pregnant, please be aware that this product contains the following ingredients that are rated as high hazards by EWG: fragrance, retinyl palmitate, amylcinnamaldehyde, benzyl salicylate, geraniol, hydroxycitronellal, eugenol and coumarin. Given that there is NO evidence that stretch marks during pregnancy can be prevented by moisturizing the skin, I&#x27;ve steered well clear from Bio-Oil for the past couple of months and switched to pure coconut oil, which is working just as well.</li>
            <li> Great alternative to Cocoa Butter. I hated the smell of that when I was pregnant and Bio-Oil has virtually no smell at all. Kept my ever growing belly moisturized. I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks during my pregnancy but I&#x27;m sure that was due to a variety of reasons. Not just because I used the oil.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I have deep red marks on my inn re thighs and after putting this on only 3 times, it was already unnoticeable, I am very pleased. Even my family members noticed the difference and asked me what I used. I would recommend this to anybody who has concerns about stretch marks. I was always concerned about my stretch marks and bought an expensive cream but it didn&#x27;t work at all, so this product is great.</li>
            <li> Have used bio oil for years.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I started using this oil since my second trimester, once a day after shower, and I didn&#x27;t see stretch marks appearing until the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy. With my previous 2 pregnancies, I started having stretch marks since the 20th week. It also helps with dryness and itchiness that I experienced throughout the pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still using it after the birth. My daughter is now 7 weeks old. The stretch marks hasn&#x27;t gone away yet. We&#x27;ll see after the bottle is done.</li>
            <li> Bio Oil is the best treatment for your skin - period.  I&#x27;ve had eczema on my hip &amp; thigh area for years.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried every prescription cream there is to get rid of the eczema, but nothing worked, until I tried&lt;br /&gt;Bio Oil.  I rubbed the oil on my skin every day - sometimes twice a day, and within a few weeks, all of the&lt;br /&gt;eczema is gone.  I even went to my dermatologist this morning and told her that Bio Oil is the best.  I use&lt;br /&gt;it every day on various areas of my body.  The other thing that&#x27;s great about Bio Oil is that it truly lightens&lt;br /&gt;and make scars disappear.  It smells wonderful, feels wonderful and acts like a miracle lotion.  I can&#x27;t recommend&lt;br /&gt;this product enough.</li>
            <li> It works great I bought it because I burned my arm and thought I would have a big scar  but within days of using this the burn was almost invisible I&#x27;m very happy I got this</li>
            <li> I started using bio-oil at the start of my third trimester. No stretch marks yet!! I love the consistency of the oil very moisturizing and not too greasy.</li>
            <li> I have scars on my arms from being hit by a tree branch (unlikely situation).  It seems to be clearing them up fairly well.  I really like the scent of the product, too.</li>
            <li> this may have not kept the stretch marks away completely but it did help keep my skin super soft, and with the 3 stretch marks that did appear, it helped them fade super fast. def use it during and after pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like the castor-ish oil smell of this. I haven&#x27;t noticed any scar fading and it seems to clog my pores. However, my husband likes it, so it&#x27;s still in the medicine cabinet for him. I use coconut oil instead now, which smells delicious and sinks into my skin more rapidly.</li>
            <li> I like this Bio-oil 4.2oz . This is not oily,it is easy to get used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fragrant and is somewhat. But,Skin becomes smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Okay , not immediate effects, might be good at the early apply from first tri semester to avoid the stretch marks...</li>
            <li> Shipped very fast nice package great price for the normal size bottle I use just about everyday luv this product looking forward to buying lots more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m VERY mixed about this product. I bought it for help with 10+ year old stretch marks form puberty. I only used it for a month so I can&#x27;t talk about longer term effects. In the month of use I did like how it made my skin feel. But I&#x27;m very mixed due to things I&#x27;ve read about the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how bio-oil smells, I like how it feels on my skin, I like the great reviews. But I DON&#x27;T like the ingredients or the negative assessments of the product. This oil contains things that other products strive to keep OUT of their products (Parabens). And it contains almost no pure natural oils. The ingredient list is honestly a little scary. Especially since they tell you to use it while pregnant. If you look up bio-oil on youtube you find scary videos of people talking about how it is basically mineral oil and how that&#x27;s bad...comes from crude oil etc, but baby oil is also basically mineral oil. So, honestly it&#x27;s all very confusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to all the research I did, I&#x27;ve chosen to switch to natural and 100% pure oils. I&#x27;ve looked up some recipes for skin/stretch mark care blends online (some recipes can be found here: [...]. I just feel better buying 100% natural and pure oils (NOW is a good brand) like, Grapeseed, Argan, JoJoba etc. and mixing my own blend for my skin. People have been using natural oils for thousands of years so I feel safer with those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say, believe what you want about bio-oil...make your own judgements. I&#x27;m certainly not throwing away my bio-oil but I think I might just keep it as something I occasionally use for shoulder massages and things. I&#x27;ve decided not to use it on a daily basis though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if your looking for really good natural products the 100% Pure brand is nice ([...]). They have lotions, soaps, cosmetics, Argan oil...but are a little pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great brand of organic soaps and products is Dr. Bronners. It&#x27;s been around forever and it&#x27;s great. I especially love the Peppermint products.s.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any major scars to worry about, only one which was a cancer spot removed from my fore arm.  It was healing extremely slow and actually had a tiny bubble.  So I started applying vitamin E oil and it was amazing how it quickly healed the scar.  So that is what I use for any cuts or scars.  However, I tried this Bio Oil and I love it.  I use it on the back of my hands, which has sun damage.  I put it on every night and have seen a good improvement in the wrinkles.  I feel that Bio Oil would be too heavy for the face and neck, so I only use it on the backs of my hands.</li>
            <li> It made my girlfriends boob stretch marks go away. Thank you.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen nothing different</li>
            <li> My daughter did some research, convinced me to make an order and now we are fighting over the bottle... But that is okay, I have already ordered two more! A lovely oil and it smells very nice too.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works, since it is still summer.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see when winter comes.</li>
            <li> Still have my marks on face....does not totally heal the skin</li>
            <li> Pros: I purchased this 2 years ago and still have about 1/3 left. It leaves my skin feeling very soft.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: This product does not reduce the look of scars or stretch marks. I used this product religiously for a year and noticed no change in the appearance of my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife while she was pregnant to help prevent stretch marks. I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be 100% effective but hydration is a key factor in preventing them. She was terrible at remembering to use it so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s great at prevention. She would get mad at me if I would remind her to use it, like I wouldn&#x27;t think she was pretty if she didn&#x27;t. But now she&#x27;s mad because she has stretch marks. You can&#x27;t win with women. However you can win with bio-oil. I use this now as a lotion. It especially works well on the face. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily or greasy residue. Great product when used as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I applied this 2x a day during pregnancy and 1x a day after and have yet to see any stretch marks. Make sure that the area is dry before putting clothing on, otherwise you will stain your clothing (similar to any other oil stain).</li>
            <li> mild smells, not so oil, can be adsorbed by skin quickly and wait to see the effect, need to consist using.</li>
            <li> In my experience pregnancy related health care items are overly laden with fragrance, tacky creams and sold with a heavy price.  This does have a distinct scent but not overwhelming to a preggo&#x27;s extreme olfactory nerves. It also feels great on the skin and helped my postpartum stretching and itch. My skin nosedived after pregnancy and was sooo dry. This was a great product. I also use it on my newborn for colic massage. It doesn&#x27;t stay wet long and therefore is great for quick massages where I need to put her clothes back on. Plus it doesnt stain.</li>
            <li> comfortable,Not greasy</li>
            <li> When I ordered it I was expecting it to be quite small but when it arrived it was a lot bigger than I expected so I was really happy about that.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It really works !! Stretch marks have gotten much lighter. I have been using product for about&lt;br /&gt;2 months.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough great things about Bio Oil.  I used it every night during my 2nd and 3rd trimesters.  I never got any strechmarks, but I can&#x27;t credit that to Bio Oil since I think that has more to do with genetics.  Either way, my skin was so moisturized, and it smells really good.  One 4.2 oz bottle lasted me though two trimesters (1X day application), and I had a little leftover.  Also works great after using self tanner.</li>
            <li> too oily to use it daily</li>
            <li> I have bought this before and continue to use.  I&#x27;m 32 weeks and it helps to moisturize my skin for this journey.  It soaks in quickly, moisturizes well, and does the job.  The smell is a little strange, but I don&#x27;t hate it enough to stop using it.  I never notice it once I have applied it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 4 months. I was so surprised its performance in the first month! My acne marks was dark brown color before using biooil. After first month, the acne marks turn to light color. In the 3 months, those acne marks just show very light mark on my face. I am used to use it as moisturizer after the toner. I never write a review, but I just could not leave this product a blank review page in my account. It is a true story about my experiences. I even think it is better than any other famous brand, because it is very natural and gentle. Very recommend it!</li>
            <li> I didnt see any marks go away and I used it as directed and I would try a another product</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t feel like sticky oil. dries fast. third time using it and noticed that my recent scar from over 3 months ago is starting to become less noticeable :)</li>
            <li> This is very good product. Très efficace sur les vergetures, cicatrices et pour la peau du visage avec des cicatrices d&#x27;acné. Super produit, facile à utiliser et très économique. Je le recommande vivement</li>
            <li> Ok this is weird but I&#x27;m in my early 40s and have been using Bio Oil as a facial moisturizer (since I live in the southwest and its so dry). Well, as a facial moisturizer,  it&#x27;s great. It makes my skin look so clear and vibrant and some of my tiny frown lines are diminished. The key is not to use too much because it can have a reverse drying effect if you do. So I put a few drops and mix it with my moisturizer at night. In the morning, my face is vibrant and plumped up from the oil, without any greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what&#x27;s so weird is I started noticing my eyebrows (which had started thinning from aging) became, like bold and thick. I stared at myself in the mirror and thought, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m starting to have Freda eyebrows,&amp;#34; lol. Anywho, it&#x27;s nice to see them back to the way they used to be in my 20&#x27;s. Just be warned that if you use it as a moisturizer, if you struggle as a woman with unwanted facial hair, it can make it grow back faster! :-o. To me this is a small price to pay for younger looking skin and fuller eyebrows. I will pluck and wax what I don&#x27;t want away. Love this stuff. I&#x27;m gonna try it on my thinning hair and see how that goes...</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good things about Bio-Oil so i purchased it for myself. I don&#x27;t use it daily but when I do I use a derma roller on my stretch marks and then the Bio-Oil. It feels a little tingly, like its working. I&#x27;m very optimistic that it will eventually create good results. The very good thing is, all you have to use is a small drop of it at a time.</li>
            <li> This is a very good oil to use for many reasons  on any part of your  body. Excellent for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful for scars! I have extensive scaring on my legs and back that are stiff, ugly, and uncomfortable. My doc suggested I started massaging them with Bio-Oil.  I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for almost 4 months, my scars have noticeably faded and are stretching more comfortably.</li>
            <li> I first saw this in a magazine and it looked so good. I have a few scares on my face and expected it to at least make my face soft. It did not do either and as a matter of fact it broke me out and now I have more dark spots then when I started.</li>
            <li> I have some new stretch marks that WERE deep thick and dark brown (African American brown skin), my friend told me about Bio Oil ( not my first hearing about it) but she said it really worked for her stretch marks and they were damn near invisible. I had nothing to lose and I was really getting self conscious about my skin, so I brought it. I am still on my first bottle ( just ordered two more yesterday) and I swear my darkest thickest stretch marks are lightening up and although it is still stretch marks there it&#x27;s so considerably lighter that some areas doesn&#x27;t even look like I have stretch marks. I am now going to use this all over my skin when my other bottle come and see how they do with old stretch marks. I can say for sure (well almost for sure) if your stretch marks are red ( lighter skin) or brown ( darker skin), it is new stretch marks use this right away ( you don&#x27;t have nothing to lose anyway) and hopefully like me you should see a difference. I thought no creams would work for stretch marks being that stretch marks are scars formed underneath the skin. I didn&#x27;t use a derma roller either and only used this once a day ( the bottle is too damn small is really my only complaint). My skin feels smoother, feels more even and my Stretch marks are disappearing ( not sure about  old ones....I&#x27;ll update but i don&#x27;t really think it will work)</li>
            <li> My partner loves it. It works!</li>
            <li> I use this product on my face and neck as  a moisturizer. It is amazing. My skin is smoother than it has ever been. I am also applying this to old scars and they are fading. My fine line are diminishing  gradually.Would recommend for all women over forty. Your skin will love you for using it.</li>
            <li> Amazing for your skin while pregnant. Kept stretch marks away for me! Used a bottle per month :)</li>
            <li> great for relieving itchy belly due to pregnancy.</li>
            <li> So I exercise ALOT but i still had like lines on my stomach of where my belly rolls were so, I bought this and it worked great! The only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it takes some time to see results (3months at least) but its worth it and it really does hydrate your skin and you can use it anywhere. Im 16 and my friend used this for her acne scars and it got rid of EVERYTHING! I really do recommend this to everyone!!</li>
            <li> Never ever buy this product. It is full of chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;even after the above suggestion if you have bought it, Do not apply to Face. First few days you will feel it is working wonders.&lt;br /&gt;But, according to my experience it will cause uncountable number of pimples on pimples, neck , cheeks. name it.&lt;br /&gt;a few reviewers mentioned not to apply on face. I should have listened to them.</li>
            <li> ive been dealing with acne for about 3 years now and i have managed to get rid of my acne but the scars from even my first pimples have even remained and i finally decided to try this product and it said that i would see improvement in 3 months and it has only been 1 week and the scars are almost completely faded. It has also worked on my stretch marks and plenty of other scars i have. 100% recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using Bio-Oil to fade both new and old stretch marks, and it definitely has had a noticeable effect. You can still see the stretch marks, but at least it&#x27;s not as prominent as before. Some type of surgery (ranging from laser to micro-dermabrasion) is the only method of completely removing the stretch marks anyway. Results also depend on the age of your stretch marks, your genes, how you take care of your skin and health in general, etc. I&#x27;m not sure how permanent the effects of Bio-Oil are, but at least in the short-term it seems to work pretty well. It&#x27;s a much better alternative to most of the stretch mark creams out there, so I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> but have found much cheaper options that do the same things.  You can read my Amazon reviews as I&#x27;m not sure I can mention other products by name here.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife who read about it on internet.  So far she is very pleased with this particular snake oil.  Hard to know if it really makes a difference or not.</li>
            <li> I had lung surgery nine months ago. I had three incisions. Two linear ones under my arm and towards my back, and a big X right on my side (where a camera went.) I wasn&#x27;t too bothered by the linear incisions because they were out of the way, but the big X was very upsetting. Hideous. So I got some Bio-Oil and desperately started applying it every day. That went on for weeks and I didn&#x27;t see a difference so I gave up on it. I just decided not to look any more and that I&#x27;d sure never be able to wear a bikini again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So today I decided to have a good look and I had a hard time finding the X. But the two small linear incisions are dark purple! What can I say? I now believe it works, you just need perseverance and patience. I&#x27;m going to start applying it to the purple marks but it might be too late; can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> I am never disappointed using bio oil my scars are slowly disappearing. I would recommend this product to anyone interested</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and it is a wonderful product goes on kind of greasy but absorbs fast and does not clog pores</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use on my face to heal some scars from the bad acne I used to have. For me, it took a long time to notice results, and by then I was almost out of my first bottle so I had to buy another. It actually did work to lighten up the scars and it smells pretty good. It hasn&#x27;t worked fantastically yet but who knows if there is a product that does completely heal scars? I have had no bad side effects, no burning or anything (I have very sensitive skin so I react to a lot) which I really like. It also keeps my skin moisturized which is a big plus for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep using it and hope it continues to fade my scars. Overall it&#x27;s the nicest and best working I&#x27;ve used so far for scars.</li>
            <li> I am on my 3rd bottle and 7.5 months pregnant. I have yet to see a mark and believe me when I say that if they are hereditary then I should be looking like a zebra by now. I love this stuff. I don&#x27;t put it on my face like some people do because I don&#x27;t feel right putting oil on that area for fear of breakouts. I do put the left over oil from my belly on my elbows and hands to keep them youthful looking and I can see a difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to wait a couple of months to see its effects but I can already feel a change in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and can already see the difference.  I believe I&#x27;ll get desired results, which is to fade dark spots on my hands, if I continue.  It came highly recommended by several friends in the medical field.</li>
            <li> Did not remove the stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Okay soo hello again my first Review was on Feb28,2014&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a bad review but I&#x27;m now fixing it. Soo I have countinued use of this product even though I hated it. But maybe after a week of me washing my face with natural organic  black soap and then putting this bio oil on it moisturizes and gives me radiant glowing skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for stretch marks and it does work quite well.  You can&#x27;t expect a miracle to happen overnight, but the lines have all faded dramatically.  Just remember to use it!!! Like any product it will only work if you use it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got dark spots and you&#x27;re trying to get rid of them &amp;#34;naturally&amp;#34;, RUN. First of all, it&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side, leaves your face extremely greasy no matter how much you apply and does absolutely NOTHING. I used Bio-Oil for months only for my face to look the way it did before. I really do regret buying this product. If you&#x27;re trying to get something useful, buy Ambi. It does what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do it&#x27;s 1/4 of the price. I gave it one star in this review but that was because that was my only option. No stars is more appropriate.</li>
            <li> I love this oil; it is wonderful; helps scars and dry skin.. Helps uneven skin tone also..... You don&#x27;t need much for it help your skin...</li>
            <li> I used it for a month regularly and no changes. This product is just a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Bio-oil makes my skin feel renewed.</li>
            <li> I used this religiously throughout my pregnancy and didnt get one stretch mark.  I have stretch marks from growth spurts on my hips growing up, and I was sure I would get them during pregnancy on my belly.  I credit the absence of stretch marks to Bio Oil!</li>
            <li> I use this with Shea butter as well as multiple oils and supplement to get rid of scars. I see weekly improvement when i use it religiously and with other oils.</li>
            <li> I love it, only the oils make me sweat too much.  Great for sauna!&lt;br /&gt;Delivery fast.  Great product.  The cost of the product is great!</li>
            <li> This body oil feels so good on the skin and mine is very dry. It&#x27;s helped a lot so I&#x27;m pretty happy and will continue to order more</li>
            <li> My small bottle of Bio-Oil has lasted going on five years, however, my wife found she like it for some kinda of makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it because it&#x27;s not oily.  I have scars I can measure by the foot, thanks to potentially dangerous hobbies, however, this stuff, while it does not lessen the look of the scars, definitely keeps irritation to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, because it&#x27;s not oily or greasy, it does not transfer to clothes/furniture/etc.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works just started using it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I mostly use this for my acne scars which are very dark and abundant. I saw results in less than a week! They have faded tramendously. I also used this on my stretch marks and they were basically gone over night! If you haven&#x27;t tried this, BUY IT NOW!!</li>
            <li> I used it for a week,it&#x27;s really working!it makes my skin much more smooth than before!somebody told me it may cause acne in oil skin,but i think it&#x27;s safe for me.I&#x27;ll insist on using it and my scars of acne must be eliminated,I believe!</li>
            <li> Bought to help with stretch marks. Used everyday, twice a day, for nearly 5 months, and there is no difference.</li>
            <li> A must for those with eczema. My 8 month old has been completely cleared of it except for a few tiny patches. It&#x27;s kind of a miracle worker. It smells good, a little goes a long way, and on top of helping his eczema, it&#x27;s cleared up my KP on my arms and faded stretch marks. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It takes time, but it does the job</li>
            <li> Best price, smells wonderful, works  good on my dry skin,very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> it looks nice, and very convenient to use. No problem during the using, highly recommand.</li>
            <li> Not effective to me, never see a change after using this product. Skin felt smoother for sure because it is oil. Absorbing performance is under average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most important is my mom throw it to garbage, because she thought it is expired.</li>
            <li> This product is decent and is taking a long time to heal my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for people with sensitive skin. I have trouble with many products and this is very gentle. Helps moisturize problem skin areas.</li>
            <li> Something good, applied to the body also just good, not very much oil, the oil is very appropriate, no big taste, well, run out will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> My wife used Bio-oil through her entire pregnancy twice daily. At 36 weeks, she got 20+ stretch marks on her lower abdomen and also got PUPPS at the same time. It was helpful for reducing itching, but is not a remedy for stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Use bio oil with my first pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark:) love the smell, absorbs quickly and helps an ichy belly!</li>
            <li> I purchased it from Duane Reade.  I heard that it got a lot of reviews, so I wanted to try it out.  I get acne scarring/hyperpigmentation, etc.  I have oily/combination skin and it made my skin feel greasy and it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil because I&#x27;m in early stages of pregnancy. I used it 2 times a day per it&#x27;s directions and after a couple weeks, I got a rash on my belly. It does feel nice, absorbs okay and makes your skin soft. I&#x27;m still using it, but only once day or every other day along with Palmer&#x27;s coco butter, which my skins seems to agree with better.</li>
            <li> I call this my miracle oil! Ppl need to know that you have to be consistent in using this oil and the thing I love best about this is that the scars or black spots that it fades never return! On my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I love Bio Oil! Works great on stretch marks and scars.</li>
            <li> Great price!  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2-3 weeks now and while I don&#x27;t see a vast improvement in my skin but I don&#x27;t see any side effects either.  It seems to keep my skin moist but the thing I don&#x27;t like about this is the oily feel never goes away no matter how long its on your skin.  So I use this when I know I&#x27;m going to be home all day because I look like sweating or I&#x27;ve been out for a run.  It wasn&#x27;t the most expensive item I&#x27;ve tried to I&#x27;ll use it until I finish the bottle.  If I don&#x27;t see significant difference then I won&#x27;t buy it again.  I recommend you don&#x27;t try this if you&#x27;re trying to treat severe scarring.  There are better products out there for that.</li>
            <li> Its working for my skin!!!! I see a difference in my stretch marks. Really like what I am seeing, SO FAR! I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle and will most likely be on my 3rd soon</li>
            <li> I am in my 9th month of pregnancy. I&#x27;ve gone through bottles and bottles of this stuff….while I LOVE my bio-oil, the product I received when I ordered this on Amazon was sub par. Bio oil typically has a nice light sent to it - the item I received had a funky odor. It smelt bad. I don&#x27;t know if the item was old (there was no expiry date) or was counterfeit. I do NOT recommend purchasing this item from Amazon. Very disappointed...</li>
            <li> I purchased Bio-Oil a few months ago, to use during my dry-brushing skin maintenance routine. I have some problem areas, like most women-just some stretch marks, and surgery scars. I have certainly seen a change in all of those areas.. The Bio-Oil is very moisturizing, and seems to really sink in well. It does take a bit to sink in-you have to be careful, and only put a few drops at a time on, then work it it very well, if you put too much you can be greasy for a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I aso have the common condition, KP/Keratosis Pillaris...many people know how annoying this yucky chicken skin&#x27; can be-and how hard it is to deal with. I have found that, in conjunction with my dry-brushing routine (look on-line for directions how to do this-it really changes your skin for the better), the Bio-Oil has pretty much made the KP go away! Its so much better than using those urea based lotions, that are so gloppy/sticky and stinky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I have noticed that my skin looks better-softer, smoother, &#x27;glowing&#x27;...the stretch marks (which are 9 years old!)  most certainly look better/diminished. The scars (about 8 years old) look softer, not as noticeable, I cant imagine how great they would look if I had begun to use the oil from the very start of my pregnant-I dare say that some of them could have been prevented, outright! I&#x27;m on my second bottle of Bio-Oil, my first lasted a few months, and I used it at least 3x/week. You don&#x27;t need very much. I will most certainly continue using Bio-Oil, hopefully it will continue to make my skin look better. Oh-lastly-I have a little wire-haired dog that gets really dry skin as the weather cools and the heater comes on. He&#x27;s been scratching his back like mad-so a put a few drops of Bio-Oil (just a few!) and rubbed in into his skin/fur, really well. Hasn&#x27;t scratched since, which is fantastic, because he was driving himself and us crazy at night! I am NOT a vet, nor am I saying you should use this on your dog without asking your vet, and making sure that the itching isnt being cause by fleas or another issue. I just took a chance with this, because the ingredients didn&#x27;t indicate anything that would be a danger to my little man, so, if your vet &#x27;ok&#x27;s&#x27; it for use and you have an itchy fur-baby, its certainly worth a chance!  I will (and have) bought and continue to use Bio-Oil regularly, it&#x27;s a great product.making sure that the itching isnt being cause by fleas or another issue.

            <li> I use this in place of (or in addition to ) moisturizer. I keep the bottle in the shower and apply after showering while skin is still wet. It smells really nice and a 4 ounce bottle lasts about 2 months this way.  The price is excellent!</li>
            <li> I thought this product will help improve my skin tone but instead its giving me bumps all over my face</li>
            <li> This oil works wonderfully to hydrate and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. It does, of course, make my face look a tad oily after applying, but a dash of powder takes the shine away. I can&#x27;t speak on the scar-removing or tone-evening properties, because I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference, but it&#x27;s still a great moisturizer and it smells pretty nice too.</li>
            <li> Nice oil .. the fragrance is amazing and I hope there will be no more stretch marks after my pregnancy!!</li>
            <li> After giving up on the Cocoa butter from palmers I switched to Bio-Oil to save me from itchy and dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself is not very greasy. I like this oil and use it twice a day. Can&#x27;t comment on the stretch marks but this helps me keep my belly hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;I use it with Aquaphor Healing ointment as Bio-oil alone is only good for 1-2 hours but when I use it with Aquaphor I have seen a huge difference and both the product together keep my belly hydrated for longer period of time and I don&#x27;t feel itchy all the time as I used to before.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference in my scars but it was recommended by a physician</li>
            <li> I love Bio-Oil, have been using this for years. It penetrates your skin and does not leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li> Definitely like this stuff, but I&#x27;m not so sure it works to reduce appearance of scars. Been using for about 1 month and applying at least 1 to 2 times a day. Great at moisturizing though. Ive used almost half a bottle so well see in another month or so.</li>
            <li> This has almost replaced lotion for me! Makes my skin so smooth and after a couple weeks of using it I can see the improvement in my skin in so many ways. I purchased it to help diminish the appearance of stretch marks,  I don&#x27;t see a big change there yet but it does say you need to use it for at least 3 months to see a difference. A little goes a long way, doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for the past year to get rid of my stretch marks. A friend of mine suggested buying Bio-Oil since it&#x27;s been working for her. I&#x27;m so glad I did. I&#x27;ve been using the product for the past 3 weeks and my skin looks and feel better.</li>
            <li> I am 8 months pregnant and I still don&#x27;t have a new stretch mark. I got some when I was pregnant with my first son I am bigger this time around and my skin looks better. Wish I would of used this my first time I could have saved my belly. If I get any new stretch marks I will update my review.</li>
            <li> Great oil for maturing skin.  Does not feel greasy after application.  Pleasant fragrance.  Has effectively decreased level of flaking and dryness.</li>
            <li> it works superb, My wife really love it and its working perfectly with her dead skin and stretch mark that accrued after post pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I have recently gotten pretty overweight very quickly.. (Darn depo shot..) And I have quite a few fresh stretch marks that are painful! So I ordered this after hearing multiple people rave on it. Now to be fair, I only used bio-oil for about 2 weeks and it says on the package to use it for at least 3 months. I started getting red bumps on my arms, back, and shoulders. Not a rash or anything, but like acne type bumps. My skin scars really easily, I have a lot of acne scars on my face, I had heard that you shouldn&#x27;t use it on your face if you have acne prone skin. Well apparently I can&#x27;t use it on my body either.. Really don&#x27;t like it. Wish I could find something else..</li>
            <li> The ingredients are not shown on the listing. It contains hazlenut oil, which I am very allergic to. This ingredient is mentioned in the description on the box, so I didn&#x27;t even have to open the product. They don&#x27;t accept returns. WHAT A WASTE!!!!  They should be REQUIRED to show the ingredients in the amazon listing.</li>
            <li> Just started using this oil, can&#x27;t really post a review on it yet. Heard good things about it, so we shall see.</li>
            <li> Best oil I have tried so far. Cleared my dry patches and made my arms glow. Top of the line.</li>
            <li> Good experience with seller, but this product hasn&#x27;t done anything for me. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. It purely seems like oil without any special qualities.</li>
            <li> I used this for the second and third trimesters of my pregnancy and have continued to use it since. It soothed the itching of a tightly stretched belly. I never got a single stretch mark (was it only because I used bio-oil??? Probably not. I gained 31 lbs total, evenly distributed throughout my pregnancy). I use it today post shaving as I have found that I am less likely to show razor burn or experience itching when I have used the product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for your skin. It helps to keep your skin moist and soft. Also helps scaring.</li>
            <li> Works great for scars and uneven skin tone! It makes my skin look toned and glowy with consistent use. It doesnt help too much with my stretch marks since my stretch marks are already old, but they look better than before. I dont think stretch marks can ever fully go away without a procedure.You have to be consistent with the product in order for it too work!</li>
            <li> Live in Houston, have oily skin, and still use every night!!! Very absorbing and smoothing...</li>
            <li> Love the smoothness of the skin after using this product.</li>
            <li> I mean, I bought it for stretch marks and didn&#x27;t get the effects over night that I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, in all honesty it is soft and smells good and leaves my skin silky smooth. I rub it on the stretchies in the shower and before bed. I don&#x27;t really know if it&#x27;s made a difference, but my skin feels hydrated. Also, use it to shave your legs if you want skin that is crazy smooth. Works even after you haven&#x27;t shaved for like a month.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought. After looking at the ingredients. I noticed the first ingredients a smineral oil - which is a cheap chemical used as a filler in many products that only clogs pores (as ldocuments in one of many articles I&#x27;ve read:http://www.drfranklipman.com/3-key-reasons-to-avoid-mineral-oil/)  With that, unfortunately I&#x27;ve been using it on my surgical scars for about 2 months and the only thing its done was grease up my scarring nothing more.  I&#x27;m curious as to whether many of these reviews are fabricated by the manufacturer. Especially since my further research on the particular brand of Bio-Oil does not contain any of the TRUE &amp;#34;key&amp;#34; ingredient - Purcellin Oil - that is need for healing!  Big waste of time and very deceptive. Before using do your research and do not rely on the paid ads or fraudulent positive reviews you will see.</li>
            <li> Very few products do what they say. It lightened my stretch marks, removed some fine lines on my face. I get facials once a month and after using this product, the technician always comments how good my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;IT WORKS&lt;br /&gt;Made my face look more youthful&lt;br /&gt;hydrates&lt;br /&gt;corrects years of damage&lt;br /&gt;easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;have to use product twice a day to correct any damage&lt;br /&gt;oily for some time&lt;br /&gt;no real instructions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendation:&lt;br /&gt;At night wash your face or body with your normal regiment. Generously apply oil on face or body. In the morning the same wash regiment with a lighter application of oil so you&#x27;re not so shiny. If you wear make up...it&#x27;s probably best not to apply the oil before you wear your make up. I generally don&#x27;t wear make up so I have no idea how to use product twice a day with makeup use.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I am currently 8 months pregnant with my 3rd child and decided to use Bio Oil as prevention and erasing of any new stretch marks. I use it once or twice per day (started using it at 5 months pregnant) and have no stretch marks! Zero! I plan to continue to use it postpartum because I like the moisturized and suppleness results that it provides for my skin. The only downside perhaps is that it leaves the skin oily when first applied, it&#x27;s a thick oil. However, after about 30 to 45 minutes, the oily appearance diminishes. It does not seem to stain clothes.</li>
            <li> Bio Oil has seriously changed my life. WOW! I use it on my feet to keep calluses away, I use it on my inner thighs and it completely changed the appearance of my skin. It softened the look of my stretch marks too! I use it as a face moisturizer too. It really does absorb super fast and never feels greasy. It also has a very pleasant scent. I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> This oil is so luxurious. I love rubbing it on my expanding belly. More effective than any lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love, love this product. The product is said to help heal scars, stretch marks, etc.. but It smells so good, I put a little bit on my face, neck, shoulders, and then on my stretch mark spots. So far it has not clogged my pores and left pimples or anything,  think this is an amazing product. I will definitely recommend, and I will purchase again!!</li>
            <li> i love this oil more than all of the other popular oils that are being sold presently. the scent is awesome! great seller, great product &amp; good price. I use this oil for just about everything, cuticles, face, even on the bottom of my hair to piece the strands out slightly. just a tiny bit. great for dry areas on the body also. very versatile oil. the best!</li>
            <li> I love rubbing this oil on my belly, butt, thighs and breasts after a bath. The smell is neutral so I don&#x27;t get queasy when I use it. The size is perfect because it looks as though i may have a lot left even after i give birth. So far no stretch marks on my growing belly...</li>
            <li> Started using this within my first 2 months of pregnancy with twins and have been using it for close to 4 months now.  I mix a few drops in with my regular store bought moisturizer 2x a day so it&#x27;s not too greasy and so far, no signs of stretch marks!</li>
            <li> The product works well and seemed to reduce redness around my scar. I was using it on my face to help with it being pretty dry during the winter months. All in all the product is good, but I&#x27;m not sure if the oil caused a bit of a breakout on my skin. I will keep using it in the meantime.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month only and i am already seeing great result. My skin is getting very smooth and soft. My stretch marks on calves are getting lighting and i almost don&#x27;t feel them anymore.</li>
            <li> I used it for the last 4 months of my pregnancy religiously every night. I used body lotion Biotherm in the mornings after showers, but i oiled up my belly every night with Bio Oil before going to bed. I gained 35 lbs total and had an 8lb baby two weeks ago, and I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks!! I think there is no magic lotion for stretch marks, but its about moisturizing as much as possible and gaining weight slowly. I would recommend this oil to anyone that&#x27;s pregnant to PREVENT stretch marks. But use it daily for best results!!!</li>
            <li> It smells ok, so I can put it on the scar in the morning and not worry about it smelling&lt;br /&gt;weird at work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an oil, so I guess it is exactly what you think you are getting! Did nothing for my stretch marks, Palmers Tummy butter and firming lotion worked like a snap! Both are here on amazon too</li>
            <li> My mom recommended this oil to me. She said it worked great on scars. In order to erase some acne marks on my temples and cheeks (They were not very serious.)I bought one for myself. But after I used it for only 3 times, I got seriously allergy on my face. Lots of small red pinples appeared on my face. I have to say maybe it&#x27;s great for the combination skins BUT if you have a sensitive skin, please be careful.</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle. Not sure what the product should have done, but it was smelly with no positive changes.</li>
            <li> Drastically faded scars from a recent reduction. I even use it as moisturizer for my face. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Summer and sandals create the rough heels on your feet.  Well I use a good pumice stone, Bio Oil and a pair of cotton socks overnight a couple of nights a week.  Softest feet I&#x27;ve had for years!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin looking younger and rejuvenated. Nice soft comforting scent. It&#x27;s amazing that it&#x27;s not greasy even if it&#x27;s an oil. Really evens out scars and marks on the skin. Bio-oil leaves you feeling rejuvenated with healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time Mom and by the time I delivered, I had stretch marks all over my tummy and sides.  Foolishly, I didn&#x27;t use any product while I was pregnant. I decided to try bio oil because of the reviews I read on line and I love it! It started to fade my red/purple stretch marks within the first couple of days. I&#x27;m super cheap when it comes to this type of thing too however this stuff is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I used this twice a day morning and night in my second and third trimesters and didn&#x27;t have problems with itchiness and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks. Very very happy!!</li>
            <li> I bought this one for a pregnant co-worker but I have used this oil for years and it will improve the look of the stretchmarks.  It also feels very nice going on and is not super greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a month, but I can already tell a difference in the appearance of my old surgery scar. It&#x27;s lighter in color and not so rough feeling. Love it!</li>
            <li> Best for preventing pregnancy stretch marks</li>
            <li> i had a few light scars and uneven spots i wanted to try to reduce so i figured i&#x27;d get this a try. within just a few days of use my skin broke out into the worse acne/zits/cystic nightmare ive seen in months (never the less my period is as far away as can be, and usually that&#x27;s the only reason i get any). i couldn&#x27;t even bother to use the product for the suggest 2 weeks to see a difference because the zits on my face were going to end up causing more scars at the rate it was going. luckily i stopped using it a couple days ago and my face is healing and on its way to normalcy again, and i gladly switched back to just using my regular trader joe&#x27;s moisturizer(which ive been happily using for like a year without any breakouts)</li>
            <li> we small family of 4 like the smell of this product , after using 1 week on my son&#x27;s 4-year old, his skin turned rough , i am little scared to use this on him .i bought this for him to use it on a small scare from a wound  on the face .&lt;br /&gt;may be this oil do not work on all skin types .&lt;br /&gt;i will update my review after some more days , my daughter  still using it... :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use on a surgical incision but I found the smell to be quite strong and unpleasant. I stopped using it and switched to organic jojoba oil, which has very little smell. I also prefer the texture of the jojoba oil. It&#x27;s a little bit thicker and not quite as slippy and the Bio-Oil.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR 2 TO 3 WEEKS NOW AND I AM NOT SEEING ANY IMPROVEMENT IN THE AREA THAT I WAS HOPING YO SEE FAST RESULTS, BUT IT DOES WORK WELL ON CERTAIN TYPES OF UNEVEN SKIN TONE AND IT IS A GREAT MOSITURERIZER  AND IT SMELLS GOOD AND A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. I GUESS I AM GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT MY ACNE SCARS PERSAY WITH BIGGER GUNS.</li>
            <li> I have dry itchy skin, it&#x27;s so helpful during winter and light enough for summer. I use it all over my body, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was too strong. Gave it away.</li>
            <li> this can be used on hair, face, body, and my tip is mixing with facial mist to be more moist.&lt;br /&gt;love this!</li>
            <li> I use it to supplement my face lotion.  It seems to work pretty well.  I like it anyway, especially because its pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> Perfect..i will buy more when i run out</li>
            <li> I like the product. This is actually not the first time I&#x27;ved used bio-oil. I use it for my stretch mark on my stomach. It does not make them go away but it does make the marks lighter to where they are not as noticable.</li>
            <li> Absorbs really well and makes my skin feel really moisterzied,I still don&#x27;t know if it helped with stretch marks cause I&#x27;m not done yet with my pregnancy,but I sure will report after birth :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update at 37 weeks pregnant:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My belly is full of stretch mark :-(</li>
            <li> I have had this product almost 2 monthand marks are fading away.</li>
            <li> This product worked great on my stretch marks. I was a little hesitant about buying it because I heard people say it didn&#x27;t work at all on stretch marks. But I decided to give it a try and I was glad I did! I had four really dark red stretch marks on my stomach then some white, silvery ones on my upper arm, upper thighs, hips, and breasts. My stretch marks came from rapid weight gain and weight loss.I read before I bought this that you can&#x27;t fade white, silvery stretch marks as they have been there a long time. But this product proved that theory wrong! I have to admit that sometimes I got lazy or forgot to apply the Bio Oil but that didn&#x27;t seem to really affect the treatment of my stretch marks. I bought this product a month ago and I am proud to say my white, silvery stretch marks are almost all gone and my dark red ones are a light pink color so they are fading! I will continue to use this product until my stretch marks are completely faded even if I have to by another bottle. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants their stretch marks faded fairly fast.</li>
            <li> My mom sent this to me for a bad scar I have on my knee that happened about 5 months ago. Maybe it is the fact that its been 5 months but from the reviews and it&#x27;s popularity, although I was hoping for more, I thought it would make at least a little bit of a difference. I applied this oil every day, multiple times a day, making sure I rubbed it into the scar really well. Sadly, it&#x27;s been about 2 months now and nothing has changed. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it smells really good, and also because it seems to have softened and hydrated my cuticles, elbows, ankles and knees. As for the effectiveness of this oil for scars, it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing. I&#x27;m currently using it for scars from a surgery about 5 years ago. And I barely see any scars now!</li>
            <li> Prevented my tummy and hips from getting stretch marks during two pregnancies. Used it twice a day, worked great. Recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is a great item to have around the house. I bought it to help with my sons scar. then I realized that it could also be used as skincare. I used it after washing my face and it would be absorbed easily. It did feel a little greasy at first, but I just had to make sure I didn&#x27;t use too much. A small amount really goes a long way. This is great to keep skin hydrated and soft. Would recommend to others!!</li>
            <li> Too greasy .... Yes I know it says oil but it honestly gets everywhere, not the best smell, I might go with baby oil instead.</li>
            <li> Bio-Oil is a great company and not to mention an amazing product. This is perfect for eczema, acne scarring, stretch marks, and so forth! I wish it was a little cheaper considering how often I use it, but the product is worth it. 10/10 would recommend.</li>
            <li> I used it throughout my pregnancy and I have no stretch marks. I love the way this smells and the way it is absorbed. I tried the bert&#x27;s bees mama butter and I like this stuff much better. I have already been through a few bottles. I use it on dark spots and scars too. Seems to be making an improvement in these areas as well. I recommend this to all my pregnant friends.</li>
            <li> super fast shipping! great product, used it for  stretch marks, and it has faded them a lot, it took about  a month to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Oily and takes time to sink into skin; You have to apply it twice a day to get the benefits; Didn&#x27;t reduce visibility or scar but did lighten it a bit. Stretchmarks get a more even tone due to the moisture but it doesn&#x27;t diminish the appearance to a noticeable degree. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again for stretchmarks just as a tone evener.</li>
            <li> Since discoverying bio-oil I have had the wonderful pleasure of softer more luxuriant skin. Blemishes fade away. My skin sensitivities are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have no problems with this product, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be that impressive, either.  The smell is noticeable but fairly neutral - still, I didn&#x27;t want to use it while I had morning sickness.  It moisturizes my skin and doesn&#x27;t seem to cause oil stains on clothing, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s it&#x27;s more effective than any other lotion or oil I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ll keep using it until it&#x27;s gone, but I&#x27;m not sure whether I&#x27;ll reorder.</li>
            <li> expecting for the effect.</li>
            <li> Almost 9 months pregnant and no stretch marks yet! I don&#x27;t know if this is due to twice daily use of bio-oil or genetics, but it can&#x27;t hurt! We also live at a high elevation in a very dry area, so it helps keeps my skin nice and moist.</li>
            <li> This is my first time used this kind of product.It is good quality and reasonable price. Also my family members like it too</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a couple months but I have heard about how great it was for a couple of years.  I like it so far.  I use if for scars and under my moisturizer.  It gives you a healthy glow but not an oily one.</li>
            <li> great  price. Arrived super quick. We are very happy with this purchase. we hIghly recommend</li>
            <li> This product was delivered to me in an unsealed bottle and the company has a no return policy. I am sure it is not legal to sell personal products like this with an unsealed cap. This product could have been tampered with.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Works and looks just as described.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks have been totally reduced they have started looking great</li>
            <li> I first used Bio-Oil about a year ago. I bought this product hoping it would fade some of my acne scars. I&#x27;m prone to acne scars and I have dark spots or redness from previous acne breakouts. Fast forward to now, I can say that it is the best moisturizer I have ever used. It is a very oily product but it compliments my face well and keeps it from drying. Unfortunately, it has done virtually nothing for my scars, dark spots and redness. I still have the same scars from last year. However, I will continue to use it for its non-breakout moisturizing effects. I&#x27;ve struggled to find a good moisturizer in the past and I&#x27;ve finally found one with Bio-Oil.</li>
            <li> works good on scars from hip replacement</li>
            <li> Very soft and light.  No greasy effect.  I just have to wait for 6 months to see if it reduces my daughter&#x27;s stretch marks.</li>
            <li> On bottle number two now for my third trimester. I so feel like it&#x27;s making my skin appear more smooth and faded. Old stretch marks have less of appearance. No new stretch marks yet with my 3rd pregnancy. Wish I known about this for my first. I&#x27;ve used on my face with no breakouts and I&#x27;m usually sensitive. Love it. Great light scent.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF. WORKS GREAT. IT IS ON MY SUBSCRIBE AND PAY</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and bought this for my skin tags.  The oil is pleasant to smell but I it has not done a thing for any of my skin tags. Big or little ones I see no difference. Very disappointed as I was hoping this would take care of them for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I ever used for stretch marks so far. It&#x27;s not oily, smells really good and WORKS! The lines are fading away really quick.</li>
            <li> No stretch marks here!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of ingrown hair scars on my bikini line and I run this on it everyday after I shower. It takes time, but it does actually work. It was a few months until I saw results. It fades the coloring. You&#x27;ll still have the mark. But you can&#x27;t tell because it blends in with your skin tone.</li>
            <li> This was originally available as a limited item at Costco. We bought and discovered it is really in a class by itself. Literally three drops for face and neck. It is deep penetrating, light, not oily on the surface, awesomely gentle, very light, natural scent. We&#x27;ve found nothing this good, ever. Seemed too expensive to use as a body and hand lotion, but after the results on face and neck, and given its little amount for large areas, we began using it for everything. We rarely give five stars to anything. This deserves every star.</li>
            <li> Another great purvhase from Amazon. I receieved the box sealed and brand new. For those that have acne marks or hyperpigmentation, this helps to fade them and leave yoir skin with its natural undertone glow.</li>
            <li> This product holds true to what it does. Very moisturizing yet not greasy. Absorbs quickly and lasts all day. :)</li>
            <li> Bought this awhile ago and it definately has helped me with acne scars on my body and marks. Must be used consistently to see results. Not the fastest fix but definately helps.</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law introduced me to Bio Oil over Christmas. I have been using it faithfully day &amp; night and am amazed at how quickly it has improved my skin! I have very fair, sensitive skin and was skeptical about trying something new due to the fact that I am allergic to many products. I have only had great results so far... My skin just glows now! For someone who has lived with acne my whole teenage/adult life and has the scars to prove it, I am just thrilled with the results! The redness on my face is evening out, too! I use the oil on my face &amp; neck. Amazon has it for a great price, too! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews for preventing and help to rid your body of stretch marks when I was pregnant.  I used my entire pregnancy by the directions as to how much to apply and how often to apply.  I still got stretch marks and they never went away.</li>
            <li> Product has a weird smell, but that is a personal preference.  Was used for 3 months on a Keloid scar and stretch marks.  While the size  and color have not changed at all the texture has improved  and scars appear softer.</li>
            <li> I am 20 years old, had a baby back in March, and had a lot of stretch marks on my thighs. I bought this product just to see if it would work to help fade them. I wasn&#x27;t too uncomfortable with their appearance, and so I did NOT use bio oil regularly. I used it maybe 4 or 5 times a week, once a day. However, it was still effective at fading my stretchmarks and returning elasticity to my skin! I was pleasantly surprised, and I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to fade their scars, stretchmarks, etc. I am very confident that if you use the product as recommended, it will do more than a satisfactory job at fading the appearance of your scars or stretchmarks. It also smells very pleasant and feels silky smooth. Five stars easy.</li>
            <li> I not only used it for my pregnancy but I still use it for cuts and burns. It works like a miracle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is worth the price. This was my least favorite product of all of the stretch mark prevention oils/creams I used during pregnancy. There are cheaper options that feel the same.</li>
            <li> perfect oil for stretch marks, reduces their visibility</li>
            <li> made my skin feel oily, worked on my face but didnt work for stretch marks. it works best for scars and dry skin. might work for other people but not me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been three days and my stretch marks appear to be visibly less red. Really excited about using this!</li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much in the things I am satisfied with everything good, high quality</li>
            <li> Known for erasing stretch marks but when I tried using it, I didn&#x27;t experience any disappearance of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing and certainly does moisturize, but it doesn&#x27;t offer prevention nor healing of stretch marks. If you want to heal stretch marks I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t pay for the name Bio Oil and just get some vitamin E or coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Ive gained alot of weight these past two years of my life. Obviously i have really bad stretch marks around my body! Bio oil soothes the redness away when i apply it. Second time purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I bought Bio-Oil at the beginning of the summer to lessen the appearance of some purplish/reddish stretch marks on my arms. Now, three months later, my stretch marks are hardly noticeable! One of the great things about this product is that it absorbs very quickly into your skin so you never have that &#x27;oily&#x27; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a great purchase and I still have about 1/4 the bottle left after using it all summer!</li>
            <li> I have been using Bio-Oil in combination with Mederma for 4 months and have seen negligible results. Maybe my scars look a little darker (closer to my skin tone) maybe not. They protrude just as much, no difference in that. One thing that Bio-Oil helps with is the skin dryness and irritation Mederma causes. I use Mederma at night and in the morning my skin is dry and irritated. I put on the Bio-Oil and the dryness and irritation immediately go away. So they compliment each other well, now if only they did their job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if Bio-Oil doesn&#x27;t work, why do I still use it and give it 3 stars? Because I know that scar products can take a LONG time to work. It&#x27;s only been 4 months. If by this time next year I still have no results then I will knock those 3 stars down to a big fat zero :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never be without Bio-Oil.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to several people.  It was first recommended to me by my surgeon--the first time she&#x27;d recommended it to any of her patients.  I&#x27;m so glad she did.  Besides on my scars, I use it on my face.  I bought a bottle for my mother who has very dry skin due to diabetes and her feet and legs now are more hydrated than with lotions.  It&#x27;s not heavy, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t damage clothing.</li>
            <li> Expecting our first baby and my wife is using this every night. She says it is great and the price couldn&#x27;t be beat on Amazon. Not sure she will continue to use it afterwards.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT WORK DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY IVE BEEN USING THIS NON STOP NO IMPROVEMENT.</li>
            <li> Packaging: It is sturdy with a twist on lid. Personallyl, i dont like the peachy-orange packaging because it looks cheap to me, but that  has nothing to do with the quality of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: To me it smells a bit like baby powder and eucalyptus. My family has said it smells pretty good and not anything like baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel: This is a very light oil that smooths on the face nicely. Doesnt feel so much greasy as it does creamy. Hydrated soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Experience: When I first  used this I put it on half of my face I noticed that it imidiatly made my skin start peeling (I had been in the sun the past few days) so I washed my face again and reapplied to the same area. After the 2nd application I could feel my skin drinking it in. My face did turn red (as it does with ANY oil product). Redness goes away in about 45 mins. My skin felt softer. Looked flawless and dewey.My pores are smaller. This product basically helps push all the impurities out of my skin and replaces it with the lovely bio oil for healthy radient skin. LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter - she loves it.  She just had a baby and this Oil sinks into the skin - no oily residue - with a very light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I am not sold on all of the benefits touted for this product.  I am using it in the evening on hands and cuticles. I like the fresh smell, but most other oils do a better job of moisturizing and getting smooth skin results...ex: Neutrogena, baby oil, etc.</li>
            <li> It is ok. My skin is soft afterward, but I don&#x27;t expect to see a difference in texture. I should have read the ingredients first. I would not have bought it if I did. I&#x27;ll use it rather than throw it away, but will buy rose hips oil when it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Used this product after using a derma-roller and after a couple of months, stretch marks are gone. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Smells nice and pleasant. Excellent moisturizing and so far (2 weeks from my due date) has helped prevent stretch marks. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> This oil is AMAZING. i used to use Shea oil to get rid of stretch marks that I&#x27;d had for 26 years. A friend told me about bio oil to remove the stubborn marks that were left AND IT WORKED. Before i had finished using a single 4 oz bottle MOST OF THE MARKS WERE GONE. My skin is sooooo soft and smooth I now enjoy just touching myself.f lol</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Stretch marks run in my family. My mother and all her sisters got them bad while pregnant. I used tho stuff everyday day and got a few but I was ok with it.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! It does make you greasy afterwards. My skin soaks it right up after a little while. I use it after a shower &amp; before bed. I started using it in my first trimester to get in the habit. I&#x27;m almost in my third trimester. Its helped a lot!! I don&#x27;t feel tight or itchy when I use my bio oil!</li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time and have ordered it for two friends, who also love it.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the reviews I read, this oil does not absorb into your skin quickly.  I have found myself having to throw my clothes on before it&#x27;s absorbed, but it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue that makes you feel icky doing so.  You can also use a towel to wipe off any unabsorbed oils prior to putting your clothes on.  I love the way this oil feels on my skin and leaves a nice soft finish.  So far I only have a few stretch marks on my sides from pregnancy and only use this about once every other day.  I dunno if it actually prevents stretch marks, but it sure feels great and gives me peace of mind that I&#x27;m at least trying to avoid those nasty marks.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bio-oil for 3+ years on my face. I have acne scars from childhood and this oil has made a difference. It will not make deep scars go away, but it really does soften them. I also use in on my chest for sun spots and overall discoloring and my skin tone is much more even. I use this in place of expensive face creams and it helps with overall skin aging, in my opinion. I use a few drops every night on face/neck/chest and a bottle will last me 9+ months. Great value for the price! It smells good and my skin in super soft.</li>
            <li> The only product that truely keeps my skin moisturized up in dry climate that I live in.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> l love this product as an all over conditioner. I live on the east coast and my skin really struggles in our winter season here. Even exfoliating and putting lotion on doesn&#x27;t keep me from peeling and flaking -- it&#x27;s just too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil really replenishes moisture to my face and body and a little goes a long way. Much cheaper here than obtaining locally. If you have skin problems or extreme dryness I highly recommend trying this product, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> currently 8 months pregnant with my second child. i have used bio-oil with both pregnancies and i can attest that bright red stretch marks are non-existent. would recommend to any mom-to-be!</li>
            <li> I love this product, however I had to wait over a month for my order to be delievered, and that is just plain stupid. I wish I could find this in stores.</li>
            <li> they sell this everywhere so it is easy to swing by cvs or walgreens and grab a bottle when I see a friend who announced a pregnancy. it feels good but I don&#x27;t think it prevents stretch marks--they are inevitable at least for me after two pregnancys.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this to me for evening out my skin tone and removing the appearence of scars on my stomach. I had two surgeries, and so there are prominent scars along my abdomen there. The stomach was operated on the same place twice in 7 years, so to me it looked as if the marks would be permanent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I started using this for about a week and as far as  my skin tone goes (face) - it is already fairer and almost even now. I also used this on my scars and because they are very prominent keloid scars, so I am sure it will take some time in seeing  any visible changes, or lessening of their appearence, but I am certain that this works...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slight fading of marks can already be witnessed by me. It may take regular application of this oil on the scars for may be a several months, before I completely see them disappear, but I can tell you it works. Slow and steady wins the race, remember?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love its pleasant smell! It totally gets absorbed in my skin, when I use it on my face, and my skin has a glowing effect, without being greasy or anything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has clearly started working for me- someone who has visible surgery marks ( not even just stretch marks ), so I am certain it will definetely help you too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this, but you have to be patient with it, as it may and most certainly will, take time for visible scars to vanish, but trust me, it will pay to stick with it for a while and see the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S - I thought I was never going to be able to flaunt a two-piece after the surgeries, but gradually, I think in the coming months, I will certainly be able to try that out ;)</li>
            <li> I did not see the results I wanted. The marks faded a little bit but nothing like what it was suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Makes skin soft and smooth. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since the very first day of my first trimester during pregnancy.  So far so good...NO STRETCHMARKS but I have 5 weeks left.  I use at night and in the mornings.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I am currently using this product to hopefully prevent pregnancy-induced stretch marks. It&#x27;s too soon to see the results. However, the oil has a nice feel to it. The scent is a bit strong, but it smells clean so that doesn&#x27;t bother me. I also think that the scent doesn&#x27;t last long once it&#x27;s absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li> good quality.Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Too greasy, don&#x27;t use it that often</li>
            <li> Not as good as everyone says it is.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my stretch marks. Won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> i absolutely LOVE IT it smells  wonderful and its so  light but feels so good fresh out the shower i&#x27;m getting a bigger bottle asap !!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Works very well!!</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dermatologist and it worked incredibly on my skin. It prevented stretch marks and  leaves the skin smooth!!! I just love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great! Definitely buying more! I put it on my face every night and there&#x27;s a huge improvement</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in hopes that it would help me with my scar tissue. Once a day I massage it onto my scars and I&#x27;m pleased to say that I think it has been working! A little goes a long way, and although it&#x27;s a little pricey I know it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 2 OZ size. I have used it twice a day for 3 weeks now. I have some deep stretch marks on the sides of my abdomen from pregnancy. I now have a 50% improvement in the depth of it. My lighter stretch marks are visible but feel smooth on the surface and are not a depression in my skin. I am buying another bottle to see how much more improvement I can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have cystic acne and I would not put this on my face.</li>
            <li> After purchasing and using this product for awhile I read that it is not safe for pregnancy. I feel like I was mislead. Instead I went with more natural creams and oils. Maybe after pregnancy I will resume use of bio-oil.</li>
            <li> My skin look much younger and brighter. I love it. I rub it all over just after a shower (even my face) and my skin feels like baby skin now, who would have thought!</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t say it worked wonders but I did see a change</li>
            <li> I got a steal on this product that ordering 2 was a must!. Came on time and I&#x27;m back on my bio oil regimen yippie. Bio oil does wonders for me and I&#x27;ll be ordering more from this buyer thank you!</li>
            <li> This was for my husbands stretch marks, he did not continue to use it so I am not sure if it works to be honest.</li>
            <li> Blegh. This stuff is super oily and greasy; no matter how much I tried to rub it into my skin it still just felt yucky and oily even hours later. I got it to use on my (newer/recent/still red) stretchmarks and it didn&#x27;t help at all, not one bit. It seemed to make them worse, if that&#x27;s even possible! This stuff also smells disgusting, and the smell lingers. I used it twice a day everyday for a few months until I got so frustrated and just threw it out. Total waste of money. This is just overpriced fragranced MINERAL OIL.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I actually bought this product. I love using it. It makes my skin glow, it dried up my acne on my shoulders. It is removing my old scars, tone my skin. It also protects my skin against the sun.</li>
            <li> Bio-oil is not only great for the stretch marks but also amazing for the skin. I put it on my face overnight and during the day under sunscreen. My skin is soft, time lines are softer too.</li>
            <li> I used bio-oil all throughout my pregnancy and got no stretch marks.  I love this product so much!  Now I use them for my face every other day and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts.</li>
            <li> I just received my Order which is more than 10 days later than the expected delivery date.  The product is not too oily and since it said user needs 3 months to see the result, I am still awaiting mine to come.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month now . Not that works ~but I will keep using it .I hope it works after using it up .</li>
            <li> does magic to your skin</li>
            <li> Started using when I noticed stretch marks starting to form and it made them disappear! Use even after your pregnancy. I stopped after I had my son but quickly started again after stomach shrinkage was showing marks again.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! It works so nicely on dry skin. It is not oily like most oils. It settles into skin nicely and leaves you with smooth skin and smelling wonderful. I use this daily on my face and it works wonderfully. My skin glows and does not look even remotely greasy. I have used it for scars and stretch marks but I can&#x27;t say it is perfect. Although I do think it has been helpful in reducing the appearance of scars, uneven skin tones and stretch marks. AND Amazon does offer the lowest prices for this oil that I have seen. (but shipping charges could change that) I have replaced my daily facial moisturizer with this and it is much cheaper then most of the moisturizers on the market and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> No strechmarks during my pregnancy even tho I have a family history of it. I began rubbing this oil on my tummy second trimester. To my surprise it worked!!!!!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Item as described. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have used Bio Oil religiously twice a day for the past 4 months on fresh scars left by the removal of skin cancer. The marks have greatly diminished in size and color and I am very pleased with the results. Would buy again and have recommended this product multiple times.</li>
            <li> Trusted product. What u c is wat u get. I&#x27;m pleased 😊</li>
            <li> they send it to me fast thank u so much&amp;#62;&amp;#62;i am going to try a scond bottle of bio-oil ..i tried one 3 monthes ago..i didnt see much difference in my scars coz i have stubborn scars ..but its so nice as moisturize and for fine lines around moth..i think its good...however it will work well if u use it with other products and natural masks..it may help..i bought it again coz i fall in love with it and want to give it another chance for scars..</li>
            <li> I used Bio Oil daily during most of my pregnancy.  I thought for sure I would be a giant stretch mark after childbirth.  It&#x27;s in my genes. NOT A SINGLE STRETCH MARK with this product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the BEST product I have used for my skin. It has shown remarkable improvement in only a couple of weeks. Will order again!</li>
            <li> My wife uses it and she says it has really worked for her and is the best</li>
            <li> They say stretch marks are hereditary and why bother with oils and creams, but I gave up Palmers tummy butter for this bio oil and i like it. Have used it with all of my pregnancy&#x27;s and no stretch marks to date and my belly does not itch.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the price.  I got hooked on this by my sister when visiting her this summer and people have commented on how nice and young my skin looks.  They have started using it too.</li>
            <li> I use this product along with a dermal roller and some olive oil for stretch marks. My stretch marks are not old (maybe 6 months) and it is making all of them look extremely better! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks, almost daily and already some on my legs have already turned into super skinny, skin tone lines that you would have to look for (or know where they were) to find. The rest have all improved in color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the harsh red stretch marks I extremely recommend this product, it make your stretch marks look better. Before I was so self conscious even around my boyfriend to show my tummy now I&#x27;m running around all the time showing it saying how good it is beginning to look. Self esteem is slowly building!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle may not seem like a lot but it goes a long way, for me the whole bottle will probably last about two months (with daily use and on a couple areas). I love it! Definitely reordering once the bottle is low! Also maybe try it with the derma roller or olive oil (not sure if either affects my results, but not changing the routine that is working for me)</li>
            <li> Cooking burn on my arm needed help...Bio Oil is the way to go after a few Aloe uses..now i use it on my hands to keep them soft and moisturized..OH so helpful...buy some if youve never tried it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving bio oil a 4 star rating for now, only because I haven&#x27;t used it all. Actually, I&#x27;m not even half way through the bottle. I have seen improvement in the color of stretch marks but not a complete fade. I do believe this is helping though. I have been fairly good about using it 2 x a day as directed, after my daily lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I&#x27;ve used the whole bottle I will update review with details.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this to my friends and family that have bad skin and need to look radient.... this product will do it!.. i been using the 2.0 once for 2 weeks and i see a difference in my face. and legs, elbows my face looks youthfull and glowy and my legs are not scally niether is my elbows... GET THIS ASAP :D</li>
            <li> Im 25 weeks pregnant and I have been using bio-oil for about 2 months. I apply it right before bed everynight and I have not gotten a stretch mark yet. It keeps my skin super hydrated and soft. I will probably continue once the baby is born. I also use it after shaving my legs and makes my legs feel great. And for those tired feet after a long day at work, I ask my man to use this on my feet...feels soo good!</li>
            <li> Truly helps pregnancies itchy stomach!  I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I like the  way that the oil smells and feels on my skin so i have started to use it sometimes instead of lotion, but i have not seen a difference in the fading of any scars or the few stretch marks on my side and tummy.</li>
            <li> This oil has been great for me. I feel the difference on my pregnant belly since I&#x27;ve been using it and notice when I don&#x27;t. My belly feels moisturized and way more comfortable than before. This product was recommended to me and it was right on time! Great product!</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this product. Of coarse I use this for my imperfections on areas of my body that we won&#x27;t discuss. It does help with scars, stretch marks, and not so even skin. I bought a bottle for my husband and he uses it for his face. Very dry areas are between eye browse and nose, NOT ANY MORE! This has completely moisturized his face and no more dry skin.</li>
            <li> Bio-Oil moisturizer is not going to give you plastic surgery type results, but it is pretty good. It softened the fine lines on my face a little bit, and made my skin slightly softer. My aunt recommended I try Skingenixx moisturizer [[ASIN:B00VSCKY1E Skingenixx Hyaluronic Acid Facial Moisturizer.]], it is packed with great skin-moisturizing ingredients like green tea and aloe vera that make your skin smoother and softer, smoother and reduce wrinkles – I really love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that actually works and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes</li>
            <li> Great oil. Works wonders on scars. Also using it on dry patches. pretty large bottle that I think will last for years and years.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the effect is as good as the it says. Need 3 months. What can I do know is hoping</li>
            <li> I bought this to ward off stretch marks during my first pregnancy. I&#x27;m 35 weeks and I feel like I see a new stretch mark every couple of weeks these days, despite using the bio oil as directed. Some women swear by this stuff or by cocoa butter etc., but the truth is if you&#x27;re gonna get stretch marks there&#x27;s nothing you can do to stop it. I think a lot of it has to do with genetics. Some women get &#x27;em, some don&#x27;t. I figured since I was not a skinny girl to begin with that I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry as much (since I already had some extra fluff). They&#x27;re not TERRIBLE but they are definitely there. I don&#x27;t mind so much and neither does my husband... my body has made a baby and that&#x27;s something to be proud of... but it would be nice to have it help somewhat. I&#x27;ll continue to use it until the bottle is gone but I don&#x27;t have any real hope that it will fade them more quickly than time itself will.</li>
            <li> I started ordering this when I first got pregnant with my 2nd child. With baby no.1 I used cocoa butter to try to battle belly itch and stretchmarks, all I can say is I wish I had found Bio-Oil earlier! I use it twice a day a day and for me it&#x27;s been working a million times better the cocoa butter ever did. I&#x27;ve noticed my old stretchmarks fading and have maybe one or two new ones. I know there are other creams (mama mio ect.) that specialize in pregnant itchy belly and preventing stretch marks but for me, Bio-Oil really did the trick.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil about 1 month ago. I wanted to wait a bit before a review. I want to say I have bad stretch marks after my two kids. I was 110 before both of them now weighing 120 I gained 50lbs for my 2nd baby, leaving my belly destroyed. I have so many it&#x27;s embarrassing sometimes but I u have learned to live with them. I have tried many products, to try to at least demish them, nothing has work. I have tried this oil and it seams to be doing a good job, they are smoother, and less noticeable, but I will continue using untill I have better results. So far it&#x27;s doing very good. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and it has made a siginificant difference in my face. I also started using it with the skingenixx night time serum  [[ASIN:B00VSL3390 Skingenixx Advanced Age-Reversing Night Time Skin Serum]] and I swear I look 5 years younger after about 3 months of use. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love it... Haven&#x27;t seen result yet just started to use it.. Good price</li>
            <li> Love it! Would recommend to anyone!!</li>
            <li> Tried it only twice so far. They are absolute too oily for summer.</li>
            <li> It seems to be good stuff but I have been lazy and haven&#x27;t been using it as I should...will update when I do</li>
            <li> Wonderful right out of the shower to avoid dry skin! It&#x27;s light and the fragrance is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Smells nice. I haven&#x27;t been using this consistently. I just use it when I remember but I got it to try and get rid of some of my stretch marks on my butt. Will see how it works. I&#x27;ll keep you guys posted.</li>
            <li> still using it, its making my abdominal scar lighten</li>
            <li> Love this thing! I used it from the begining of my pregnancy and I got ZERO stretchmarks :). I used it also for about 3 months postpartum and still no stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> I use this oil when I am pregnant, nothing can compare, it keeps my skin from being itchy. I was recommended this oil when I was pregnant with my first and now using it again with my second. I did not get any stretch mark the first time around so so far so good again. Just remember to use it on the chest as well because that&#x27;s where you can also get stretch marks when pregnant and breastfeeding.</li>
            <li> Have been using this stuff for only a few days and I kid you not, I can see a difference in my skin already!!! I&#x27;m using it on my face because I&#x27;ve been battling with dry skin and spots on my face due to my dry skin. I&#x27;ve tried the most emollient products I can find an nothing was helping, at all!!! Finally decided to buy bio-oil and I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been suffering for so long! Can&#x27;t wait to see the end result!</li>
            <li> I used this product on my darker skin due to shaving and I noticed a good difference with lightning and keeping my skin from irritating and getting darker if that makes sense. I started to use it on my stomach after realizing what is what for since it was my mothers. But my my stomach has a very old surgery scar so I didn&#x27;t expect anything. Although continuing to use it after getting pregnant I switched to palmers just as I would use the oil. Meaning every night after I shower I message it into my skin until it almost is completely absorbed. And I got no stretch marks! I feel like it helped prepare skin to be capable of absorbing the very thick palmers cream. I didn&#x27;t use this during or before my second pregnancy and ended up with a few marks. All in all I would recommend this product for discolored skin more than scarring. And it smells good.</li>
            <li> I just had a baby almost 2 months ago. I have some horrible huge purple red stretch marks. I have been using bio oil all this time and no change. I recently bought mustela double action. Hopefully this works good luck ladies</li>
            <li> Oily skin feels used not in the habit.  The first Amazon shopping is quite satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Oh, my, but this stuff is wonderful. I notice an improvement in my acne-scarred face already. Plus, I am now having dry skin and my skin just soaks it right up. My homemade makeup goes on much smoother with this under it, too. If you have scars you want to eliminate, and you want a safe, skin-friendly way to do that, I highly recommend using this 2 x&#x27;s a day for at least 3 months (what it says on the bottle).</li>
            <li> I have some new-ish burn scars on my legs and have purchased this oil and used twice daily as per the instructions on the box. It is just moisturizing but has done nothing to improve the look of my scars. For the price nowhere near worth it.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift to my friend, she just gave birth and have stretch marks, now the stretch mark didn&#x27;t go away, but it did get lighter, she&#x27;s been using this for almost 7 months now, used about 4 bottles already.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!!! Lightened a huge scar amazingly well!</li>
            <li> I started using this twice a day toward the end of my first trimester. I am 5 foot and gained 20 pounds, and didn&#x27;t get a single stretch mark!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product but I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months now and I have yet to see any difference. Maybe I need to wait longer so I will keep using it for now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this didn&#x27;t do anything after using the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> Great product...results are slow but good</li>
            <li> I use this on scars and to re grow fur on my whippet dogs who sometimes get scratches. Excellent natural product.</li>
            <li> It helps reduce the fine lines on my neck. However, the stretch marks on my chest are still visible. When I apply it it seems to smooth it out however they are still there. Call me hopeful, I&#x27;m still using it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff has improved my skin texture....</li>
            <li> Finally buy it, it is said that is amazing</li>
            <li> Smell is good and can use it every day.</li>
            <li> It is oil, but not greasy at all, love the feel and aroma.</li>
            <li> Used it for 4 months and no results.</li>
            <li> I find no positive result as I am using last about one month. thanks.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks have diminished significantly. I am still using it. I hope it&#x27;ll clear them away for good!</li>
            <li> Added sweet oil essential drops for fragrance is great. And the price was better then any local store.</li>
            <li> I had a baby about 5 months ago and was left with some pretty nasty stretch marks. I used this oil 3 times the day I got it and when I woke up the next morning my stretch marks were WAY lighter!!! Went from a gross brown to a light pink! Cant wait to see what happens after a week!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product, Bio-Oil, after it was given to me as a gift. I liked it so much, I researched it on the internet and found the best deal with Amazon. I&#x27;m in the chlorine pool daily and use it on my shoulders, arms, neck, face and legs. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a visible difference, but it sure feels good.</li>
            <li> It barely helps. At least does not work for me that much.</li>
            <li> I used this before, during and after my pregnancy. It worked really well!! I am still in the process of getting rid all my stretch marks from my pregnancy from almost 6 months ago. But, I think I have been a lot better off using this product since a lot of it is gone and most of it will end up going away. I highly recommend this product. I also used this product on my face every morning after a shower. That seemed to help a lot to get rid of some scarring and helped with acne as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month now and I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my stretch mark appearance. It does smell nice and moisturized the skin but other than that it didn&#x27;t do anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve developed stretch marks while I was pregnant with my son.. They weren&#x27;t very bad but very noticeable.. I came across this product &amp; decided to order a bottle based of the reviews. I used it for about a good 2-3 weeks &amp; noticed my stretch marks getting lighter! I&#x27;ve stopped using it due to being so busy all the time.. I plan on buying another bottle for not only my stretch marks but my scars too.</li>
            <li> I bought this item in the smallest bottle they had in may of 2012 after surgery to my neck it left a pretty bad scar I still actually have some left and use it twice a day my scar has faded to almost nothing i love this product and just bought a bigger bottle about a week ago and use all over my body now it is amazing I recommend to anyone with streatch marcs scars dry flaky skin to try this ive never used anything better!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping that it would be an environmentally safe way to lubricate machinery, but when applied to said machinery, it actually slowed the activity of the machinery.  It was then that I discovered this was actually not organic oil for machinery, but oil for humans.  Be careful of the labeling on a package before buying it!  Having used about half of the bottle attempting to make various appliances around the house work, there wasn&#x27;t a full use left of the bottle, but I was able to use the rest of it on my face, and to my surprise, it worked a lot better there.  Stretch marks and imperfections were cleared away quickly.  Overall, an okay experience--but I wish I&#x27;d known what it was for beforehand!</li>
            <li> it came in time and the price is ok. it is a good deal and worth to have it next time</li>
            <li> Bio oil is a dry oil that doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greased down. I can put it on my hands and don&#x27;t have to wash them before touching anything. It has helped me get rid of &amp;#34;winter skin&amp;#34; (little bumps on thighs and arms) for the past few years with minimal effort. Recommend!</li>
            <li> I saw the great reviews this got and was eager to try it for the acne scars on my face. However, after using it for a week, not only did it not reduce any acne scars, but the oil clogged my pores and caused 7 new acne to form on my cheeks and nose. I am very disappointed, and will not use it again. Seems that it has worked for many other people, so all I&#x27;m saying is take the positive reviews with a grain of salt, and don&#x27;t get your hopes up like I did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a month and my scars have already lightened and started to smooth out.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> When I didn&#x27;t know any better, I purchased Bio-Oil hoping that it would work miracles on the existing stretch marks on my hips.  After applying it daily over the course of three months, I saw no noticeable change.  My expectations were probably too high to begin with, but this product really didn&#x27;t do much for me.  However, it did help with the healing of smaller, more superficial wounds like cuts and abrasions - nothing a little Neosporin can&#x27;t do.  I&#x27;ve since educated myself about what&#x27;s better for skin and have transitioned to using more natural products.  If you&#x27;re not a fan of synthetic products or petroleum-based ingredients such as mineral oil (a distilled product of petroleum), I suggest using more nourishing, natural oils like pure argan oil and rosehip seed oil to help prevent scars and stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and I&#x27;ve seen that my stretch marks have begun to fade.  I will continue to use it to see if or how much more they will fade.</li>
            <li> not one stretch mark and has helped in fading my old growth spurt and stretch marks! have told so many others about it and they are equally happy.</li>
            <li> Does not work well for oilly skin. Give you acne</li>
            <li> I wish there was more in this bottle! Will be buying again for my last trimester.... I started using it at the start of my 2nd trimester. So far so good...even though stretch marks are genetic. I feel like this absorbs well. I also put palmers cocoa butter on top after this was absorbed.</li>
            <li> Just got this and have heard many great things from friends who have used it. So far I love it! Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I had a baby 5 months ago. I started using the product when she was about 2  months old. I only had a few stretch marks on the right side of my tummy. After 3 months of consistent use, the marks are gone!</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with this product! It is exactly as pictured and described. It works to reduce the appearance of scars and stretch marks if you use it 2x daily (at least that&#x27;s what I do). I cannot say whether or not it helps prevent stretch marks because I had already gotten them by the time I started using this during my pregnancy. BUT I didn&#x27;t get any more after I started using it. So it possibly could be a good preventative measure. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. I definitely is speeding up the process of healing my scars and stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product about every other day and i think i notice somewhat of a difference.  It is definitely moisturizing though.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this oil.</li>
            <li> I used this product my entire second and third trimester to try to avoid stretch marks. I applied once after my morning shower and once before bed. It seemed that I would go through about one 4.2oz bottle in 3 or so weeks, but it was well worth it. I have a six month old daughter and NO stretch marks. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> i received a lot of products for use on my growing belly during pregnancy. This is my favorite and Ive used it every day for several months, through winter and warmer weather. Some belly creams, like cocoa butter, are so thick that application is not very easy. Other products, like Kiels etc, are great but feel a bit thick and heavy, particularly as it gets warmer. Bio-oil goes on so easily, it absorbs quickly and smells really nice. It is perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 10+ weeks on my face and  body to eliminate acne and other scars, as well as stretch marks. At first I thought I saw a difference, it looked like the acne scars were beginning to fade, but after a few weeks no further change took place. I&#x27;ve heard from friends who used the product that it worked great, but I didn&#x27;t experience much of an improvement. I am Black with a dark complexion, so maybe it just works better on lighter skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 3/4 through with the bottle, and since I bought it I still use it on my body, but I stopped using it on my face because I felt it gave me a greasy/shinny look. Just not for me.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li> It is working really well so far</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and I Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bio Oil for maybe a little over 6 months now, and I love it! It really helps get rid of stretch marks, and uneven skin tones. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bio-Oil for about a month now, with the hopes of reducing some unsightly stretchmarks on my thighs.  The oil feels nice on my skin, but I really looks like my stretchmarks have gotten worse.  Maybe I just need to use it longer, or perhaps it works best as a preventative measure.  I will keep using it until the bottle is gone though, and perhaps I will find a reason to change my rating.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m 9mo pregnant and have been using this since the beginning and only have stretch marks on my hips. BUT it could be because i only applied it on my stomach i didnt bother to go put it anywhere else. not sure if this is denial but i my stomach looks great otherwise...&lt;br /&gt;i apply this along with my Earth Mama Angel Baby Natural Stretch Oil about 3x a day, my mother and my sister both have pretty severe preg. stretch marks, so i really think that moisturizing has spared my stomach. I only wish i had applied it everywhere (breasts, hips, tummy, butt, and thighs)&lt;br /&gt;on a non-preg note, my skin has become sooo soft where i&#x27;ve been using it, i started using it on my legs after shaving and before going out with skirts or shorts.&lt;br /&gt;there is one negative though, i have had to wear undershirts between my skin and my actual clothes to avoid staining them with oil, but i could have easily just used it at night only. i plan on using it after baby too as i really really like how soft it has made my skin.</li>
