            <li>a must have for natural curly hair!</li>
            <li>i have natural curly hair and live in florida.  </li>
            <li>Yes, this review is for those of you who, like me, are fortunate enough to have grey hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find that is helps with with frizz, and it also gives my hair a slight texture I don&#x27;t enjoy.  </li>
            <li>I blow dry and my hair looks fresh and mangeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much because I live temporary in a not her country and wanted it to last for two years.</li>
            <li>My mom who has colored treated hair saw a huge difference because the color had dried her hair resulting in a lot of shedding.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft and makes your hair shiney</li>
            <li>Made it soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft, shiny.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and shiny after a blowout.</li>
            <li>I mainly got this because I use styling flat irons a lot.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for taming products, especially since I live in a humid part of the country and also exercise every day.  </li>
            <li>They taped to cap to the bottle with VERY STICKY tape so now the ENTIRE bottle is sticky with left over tape residue!</li>
            <li>I like this product line in general.</li>
            <li>I started going grey in my 40s and used to hide that fact, but years later decided it was too much of a bother</li>

            <li> This is a product I have used a long time.</li>
            <li> But grey hair can be dry and wiry</li>
            <li> I put this on after I towel dry.  </li>
            <li> Was trying to find something that would help my hair that gets so dry, sun etc., during summer.  </li>
            <li> After I towel dry my hair, this creme just adds shine and control and smooths out my hair.</li>
            <li> It gave my hair some added nourishment while I lived in a dry climate.  </li>
            <li> I have dry wavy hair, which tends to frizz.  </li>
            <li> Delivered timely and product was as expected and described</li>
            <li> so it helps to apply it when my hair is still quite wet, allowing it to be evenly distributed throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> , for a little extra shine, sometimes apply a little Vinyl Glam.  </li>
            <li> You only need a small nickel size for medium length hair.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist gave me her small sample size of this when my hair was badly damaged and I had to cut most of it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other cream and spray leave-in conditioners and they just do not work!  </li>
            <li> I have dry, frizzy, curly, thick hair and in the summer I swim every day.</li>
            <li> The issue I had was with a little frizz on the sides.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Helps my hair from being so dried out.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not available on Oahu!  </li>
            <li> Takes a small amount.</li>
            <li> And the bottle was all dirty and gross!  </li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s not sticky.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, and textured African-American hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> NOT happy!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my salon no longer sells this</li>

            <li> They taped to cap to the bottle with VERY STICKY tape so now the ENTIRE bottle is sticky with left over tape residue! And the bottle was all dirty and gross!  NOT happy!!</li>
            <li> This is OK. It&#x27;s still not a replacement for Butter Treat which they have eliminated. At least it&#x27;s not sticky.</li>
            <li> Great product, makes my hair manageable without feeling weighed down or heavy.  I have short hair and only need a pea size daily.</li>
            <li> I put this on after I towel dry.  i have natural curly hair and live in florida.  this is a MUST for me</li>
            <li> This is a nice, lightweight hair cream that works well for straightening my curly-ish hair.  It smooths and softens and does not feel stickey. The scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Was trying to find something that would help my hair that gets so dry, sun etc., during summer.  Read a couple reviews on many websites trying to determine if this would help.  Glad I tried it, does not take much.</li>
            <li> Delivered timely and product was as expected and described</li>
            <li> I purchased this from my hair stylist for one of my daughter&#x27;s fine hair as it gets tangled very easily.

It leaves her hair soft, smooth, and it smells good too!  Unfortunately, my salon no longer sells this and I&#x27;ve called all over and it&#x27;s not available on Oahu!  So now I have to resort to buying online.  PERFECT PRODUCT, A MUST BUY!!</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Does nothing to the hair. I send it back.</li>
            <li> Great product. One of the best out their for keeping hair manageable without being sticky or greasy or stiff.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it arrived on time! Great!</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft and makes your hair shiney it&#x27;s super good!</li>
            <li> After I towel dry my hair, this creme just adds shine and control and smooths out my hair. I blow dry and my hair looks fresh and mangeable.&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Seller delivered in 2 days. Kudos.</li>
            <li> Yes, this review is for those of you who, like me, are fortunate enough to have grey hair.  (Means you&#x27;re still alive, right?)  I started going grey in my 40s and used to hide that fact, but years later decided it was too much of a bother and now just pretend I enjoy having a white head.  (Kind people refer to it as \\&quot;platinum\\&quot;.)  But grey hair can be dry and wiry so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for taming products, especially since I live in a humid part of the country and also exercise every day.  The humidity and the exercise give me the frizzies, but 3 Redken products help control this.  I alternate between Outshine and this Crema Care for leave-in conditioner and, for a little extra shine, sometimes apply a little Vinyl Glam.  After using these products, you&#x27;ll even have people saying to you, \\&quot;Oh, if my hair looked like yours, I&#x27;d let myself go grey too.\\&quot;.  (Yeah, right, like I believe that.)</li>
            <li> This product is great for protecting hair from damage done by mousses and gels. As a plus, it smells very good.</li>
            <li> This product worked well for me.  It gave my hair some added nourishment while I lived in a dry climate.  I like this product line in general.</li>

            <li> My hair stylist gave me her small sample size of this when my hair was badly damaged and I had to cut most of it off. The way this stuff has made my hair feel softer and smoother and healthier has been amazing, and I will continue to use and buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  It is best for thick curly hair!</li>
            <li> I mainly got this because I use styling flat irons a lot. I have been using a dime-sized amount of this on my ends. I love it! Doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and it&#x27;s keeping my ends much more healthy looking. Great product.</li>
            <li> This product is great for little girls hair. My daughter hair gets so tangled I have been using this product for 4 year now. Nothing come close. It doesn&#x27;t leave her hair oily looking. It brushes right thru. Great product. I bought so. Much because I live temporary in a not her country and wanted it to last for two years. Which it will. You don&#x27;t have to use much. Awesome product for girls or boys with a lot of thickness and tangles.</li>
            <li> Good product for control.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have thick, curly, and textured African-American hair. I&#x27;ve been regularly using this product for over a year...I hope Amazon.com continues to carry it, so I can stock up. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister and she said this product is just amazing and easily give it five stars.</li>
            <li> Great product. My cousin, who&#x27;s a hair stylist recommended that to me years ago and I love it. My curl are soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I cannot go a day without this product! It is a wonderful leave-in conditioner that offers very flexible and soft styling lotion control. Light pleasant scent. You only need a small nickel size for medium length hair. I apply it before blow drying and it makes my hair soft, conditioned and offers so much control. I love love love this product!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of this product.  It makes my hair so soft and shiny after a blowout.</li>
            <li> My hair is frizzy and super dry. Using this product with moroccan oil makes my curl perfect. I really love it. It&#x27;s my first time that I enjoy my hair curls.</li>
            <li> Great Product! I have very thick hair so it helps to apply it when my hair is still quite wet, allowing it to be evenly distributed throughout my hair. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> a must have for natural curly hair!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find it  in the stores. Love it.</li>
            <li> Another addition to the wonderful line of Redken Real Control Products!  This entire line is new found to me, and EVERYTHING works WONDERFULLY!  Plus cannot beat the PRICE!</li>
            <li> This works really well for my kind of hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or sticky, while providing gentle hold.</li>
            <li> It really gives me control and strength.</li>
            <li> I am a guy with naturally curly hair and keep it short.  The issue I had was with a little frizz on the sides.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and am disappointed.  I don&#x27;t find that is helps with with frizz, and it also gives my hair a slight texture I don&#x27;t enjoy.  I guess my expectations were too high for this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I have very curly hair and it helps me detangle after conditioning.</li>
            <li> My mom was recommend this at a salon in Puerto Rico, and brought home some of it and so I tried it. This stuff is great for after I wash it. I use it if leaving my hair curly or before blow drying. My mom who has colored treated hair saw a huge difference because the color had dried her hair resulting in a lot of shedding. This stuff really works, smells good and more importantly can help keep your hair beautiful :)</li>
