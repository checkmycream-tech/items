            <li>that said, even though it does seem to make my skin soft-ish, I don&#x27;t think it exfoliates any better than a good washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The shape is perfect for holding and using, which I appreciated.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely nice to have in case I need it.  </li>

            <li>My skin feels so smooth after using it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only thing I think would be great is for a range of textures.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times with an oil cleanser and that seemed to be the best use.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>We received this product for review purposes for free.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t really find it something that I can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t deal with; I absolutely love the results of using it and the idea of being able to use an organic beauty product to accomplish something I do</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t really find it something that I can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t deal with; I absolutely love the results of using it and the idea of being able to use an organic beauty product to accomplish something I do</li>
            <li>I am sure that over time I can get down a better method in order to improve this- or even find (or maybe create my own!)</li>
            <li>but this one is super nice and soft so it doesn&#x27;t hurt your face and my skin felt good after the first wash</li>
            <li>My face feels very clean and it seems to look more vibrant!</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I wonder if it holds in bacteria or not because it&#x27;s a sponge, I have fully enjoyed this product and would buy it again at the right price.</li>
            <li>the moment I first saw it!!</li>
            <li>Gives such a great clean with this product.</li>
            <li>Great way to deep clean your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, has a nice texture, and feels very soft against my skin.</li>
            <li>My face felt clean and smooth after I used this product.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and clean after I use this.</li>
            <li>I recommend this, if you want clean, smooth skin.</li>
            <li>After using this sponge, my face feels so clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin looks smooth and shiny clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use</li>
            <li>so I would have like to have a texture more like a very gentle microdermabrasion for me.  </li>
            <li>Loved this product... made my skin feel super soft and it has helped reduce the size of my pores.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After running under warm water in the shower, I use my normal cleanser</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Which I am excited for because it would not have occurred to me to try it.</li>
            <li>Have used this for the past week and my skin feels great!!  </li>
            <li>My skin is naturally pretty oily and this helped me maintain a more matte appearance throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I like how it gets my face clean without being too abrasive.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean after without any harshness.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how clean it got my face.</li>
            <li>manually cleaning it just does not feel 100percent clean to me.</li>
            <li>It allows you to really clean in between your eyes &amp; nose crevices with the point part of the sponge.</li>
            <li>I never thought about the fact that I used a plastic sponge to clean my face before.  </li>
            <li>and I just used it to clean my face with my face wash.  </li>
            <li>Right after the first use my skin felt even more smooth than before.</li>
            <li>Her face is more clear of acne when she uses it - it is not a miracle fix it is a great step in the right direction for having an acne clear face.</li>
            <li>It softened right up!</li>
            <li>Very gentle exfoliator for my sensitive skin- gentle enough to use every day which is great in this warm weather!</li>
            <li>and right away I could tell how clean and smooth my face was.  </li>
            <li>Just re-ordered this again- makes my face feel real smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>My delivery arrived quicker than expected, which was great.</li>
            <li>and I plan to purchase some at full price for gifts.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think I would pay full price for it.</li>
            <li>It is so soft yet extremely effective.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels super clean afterward.</li>
            <li>Really nice and soft but still exfoliates.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference in my skin, but it feels good to wash my face with this sponge.</li>
            <li>I would love to buy another one very soon.</li>
            <li>they leave my face feeling super clean.</li>
            <li>I like the shape and how the string to hang it by goes through a good amount of the sponge, as opposed to a different brand of sponge I tried which ended up breaking where the string went through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for allowing me to test this product for free for review!</li>
            <li>then I added water and like magic it softened up, ready for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to love this product.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft</li>
            <li>This product is great in that I dont have to remember to charge it or create a spot for it among my other face/makeup items.</li>
            <li>Seriously, give this awesome beauty tool</li>
            <li>Seriously, give this awesome beauty tool</li>
            <li>I love how soft and smooth my skin is feeling already.  </li>
            <li>I had the awesome opportunity to review the ClearKonjac Facial Sponge recently.  </li>
            <li>I said it smelled like mold and mildly skunky scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really does a great job exfoliating and deep cleaning.  </li>
            <li>but I just haven&#x27;t been able to justify the high price tag.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on your skin and leaves it feeling smooth and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>It softened quickly and felt quite nice, it was not rough at all.</li>
            <li>It gently exfoliates your skin, and gives it a clean, smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>I use cetaphil for a facial cleanser and this sponge works SO much better at getting my cleanser to lather and really clean my face!</li>
            <li>But I tried this out last night and was so pleased that I used it twice!</li>
            <li>This is highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser, and leaves my skin super smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little cleansing sponge for the face and neck.  </li>
            <li>When it comes to exfoliating you run the risk of harsh/course products which make your face red and rough - not an issue with the ClearKonjac sponge, it was the perfect mix of gentle and effective along with being natural not synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it would be very helpful for this company to team up with a chemical free cleanser company and recommend them with their product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smoother and feels much more naturally moisturized and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But honestly, you&#x27;re not going to send it back!</li>
            <li>This facial sponge is great, it&#x27;s soft on my face</li>
            <li>Worth the discounted price</li>
            <li>, however I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s worth $12.</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural, as well.</li>
            <li>Simple but yet effective.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice addition to my nightly facial washing routine.  </li>
            <li>When they say you skin will feel soft and smooth after using this they are not kidding!</li>
            <li>I use this in the shower and hang it by its handy, built in storage/hanging string until the next time.</li>
            <li>and I love that they are 100% Natural</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product, as an excellent addition to your regular facial routine.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m done my face feels so clean and my skin is actually looking better than before I used it.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, clear and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already planning to get another one right away to have as my back-up</li>
            <li>IT GETS RIGHT UNDER MY EYES</li>
            <li>and this clears it right up.</li>
            <li>I just ran it through some water to soften the sponge and used it right away.</li>
            <li>After running the sponge in water for a few moments as directed it quickly expanded to a much more appropriate size, texture and shape.</li>
            <li>I really felt like I was getting my face clean and</li>
            <li>The Konjac Sponge for Facial Cleansing is soft and feels pleasant on the skin.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how much I ended up liking it :)</li>
            <li>I already used this since the day i got,,  its like a magic from hard to soft,, so far in two days of  using i work good,, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Overall, for the short time that I have had this product it has been much more successful in addressing many of problem areas than other exfoliating scrubs and devices that I have used.</li>
            <li>I am not only getting a deeper clean, but the top layer is gently being exfoliated.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has sensitive acne prone skin, I will be purchasing her one to try as I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Great supplement with my regular facial cleansing routine.</li>
            <li>I LOVE HOW IT IS 100% GENTLE &amp; NATURAL EXFOLIATING.</li>
            <li>I love the gentle, natural exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received emails from the company to let me know the product shipped, and a few days after to make sure I was enjoying the product and to not hesitate to contact them with questions.  </li>
            <li>It is soft on my skin, but I can tell it is exfoliating and making my cleanser really absorb into my skin and work better.  </li>
            <li>Blemishes diminished...leaves skin smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use this very much</li>
            <li>I thought the sponge would be harder more like a pumice, based on it&#x27;s original feel.</li>
            <li>It really made my skin super soft and smooth -</li>
            <li>Super easy to use for someone who does not want any complicated routine daily to look great!</li>
            <li>This also allows for better absorption of my daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>My husband complement me on how pretty my skin looked this morning.  </li>
            <li>and I feel the difference in how much softer and cleaner my face feels!</li>
            <li>When I first opened the package, the sponge felt like a piece of pumice</li>
            <li>This is the first product we have found to remove the paint from his face.</li>
            <li>Definitely will purchase again :)</li>
            <li>My son looked so much brighter after just one use!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in blemishes and overall better feeling skin.</li>
            <li>well this make my face feel smooth and look clear.</li>
            <li>It makes the face feel soft and smooth w/o irritation.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad that I have finally found it!</li>
            <li>Works well,  smells funny though.  </li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s softer than it looks.</li>
            <li>It made my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>But, I really like it!</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>and they suggested I do more to my skin than just a daily cleaner</li>
            <li>It cleanse and leaves the skins feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I really like it and would recommend to others!</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with the Konjac sponges.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first opened the package, I thought, there is no way I am going to use this on my face.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t *love</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>My face has been so clear and smooth since I started using this.</li>
            <li>Love these, bought one for me and one for my teenage daughter.  </li>
            <li>If you are a first time user of this you have to soak this in water before using.</li>
            <li>What I love about Clear Konjac is that it&#x27;s all natural and has bamboo and charcoal - which is great for my skin which breaks out if I&#x27;m stressed or too lazy to remove my make-up at night.</li>
            <li>So with my first use, I give it 5 stars, if that opinion changes for any reason with continued use I will update my review.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it at first, so I couldn&#x27;t write a legit review.  </li>
            <li>it was when you first received it.  </li>
            <li>I just purchased several more to give to my daughters and one to pack in my suitcase for my upcoming trip.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels wonderfully soft and smooth after each cleanse.</li>
            <li>Its good at getting rid of dead skin..</li>
            <li>LOVE MY NEW CLEAR KONJAC SPONGE...</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get this for my teenage daughters.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking high and low for a gentle and effective was to exfoliate my skin</li>
            <li>thing I noticed right away while I was using this Konjac sponge, was how easy it was to use my cleanser and get it evenly and nicely on my entire face.</li>
            <li>leaves skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised as my face did feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>My skin felt clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>My face feels clean and soft after using it.</li>
            <li>My face is always sensitive and easy to get irritated but this sponge is so gentle and make my face really clean/smooth without hurting my skin.</li>
            <li>After using this product my skin felt clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>Mild exfoliating sponge, hydrates easily, hangs to dry.</li>
            <li>BUT, after I allowed it to absorb warm water, it transformed into a soft yet effect facial sponge.</li>
            <li>really like the tapered top for getting into the areas next to my nose which has always been a problem area for me with exfoliating.</li>
            <li>First off, I really don&#x27;t like the musty/sulfury smell it leaves on my face.</li>
            <li>It is proven with sponge that good things come in small packages.  </li>
            <li>Seems like a cool idea to use a natural charcoal infused sponge.</li>
            <li>This facial sponge is gentle enough not to cause any irritation to my sensitive and acne prone skin while still proving a great exfoliating experience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll love that it has that hanger that you can hang it with and leave it to  dry.</li>
            <li>You have to hold it under warm water for a few minutes at first</li>
            <li>Also, the bamboo charcoal is pure marketing gimmick.</li>
            <li>When the water is applied, the sponge is very soft and gentle enough to use every single day and has made a great difference with my skin.</li>
            <li>also really like that it has a string attached to it which makes it easy to hang up and store for the next time you need to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice little handle so that I can hang it up when I&#x27;m done so it doesn&#x27;t get yucky sitting on the counter.</li>
            <li>The little string attached for hanging it up is handy.  </li>
            <li>When I first started to use it, the humidity was high and stayed that way for almost a month.  </li>
            <li>I was  a little worried that it would be rough on my sensitive skin, but it was really gentle and exfoliated perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple yet effective facial sponge that I will be purchasing more of in the near future!</li>
            <li>The string that the sponge hangs on is very flimsy.</li>
            <li>Gently exfoliates .</li>
            <li>felt much smoother but the sponge did nothing.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend buying this product to my friends and family.</li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;ve only used it once my skin was so smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>This is worth the money to have clear skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s working very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this sponge</li>
            <li>I really like the product.  </li>
            <li>and I have pretty normal skin without a ton of issues.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I would get just as much exfoliation from a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>I received it for free to review it, but I will be purchasing it in the future.  </li>
            <li>They really help get makeup off.</li>
            <li>I cleansed my face off really well but</li>
            <li>My face seemed much cleaner and radieant in a way.</li>
            <li>Using this in rotation with my clarisonic, has given me much smoother and nicer skin.  </li>
            <li>In a sponge --- not so much.</li>
            <li>So gentle</li>
            <li>and it will be much like</li>
            <li>Until I researched into finding a better facial sponge, I never really thought about how important it is to have a quality sponge as well as a quality cleanser.</li>
            <li>so they are extremely gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>After rinsing off my face, I could really feel an immediate difference in smoothness, softness, and texture-</li>
            <li>I really found to using the sponge</li>
            <li>The company also offers a 90 day money back guarantee so if you don&#x27;t love it, you&#x27;re covered.</li>
            <li>I liked how it cleaned and exfoliated my skin without being harsh and harming my skin.  </li>
            <li>but I was pleased with how soft it has left my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this little scrubber, it makes your face feel so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I would never have expected this sponge to leave my skin so soft and clean!!</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical at first, but after soaking this in warm running water for just a minute it become a soft and more like a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; sponge.</li>
            <li>but it feels so good soft squishy with just a little feeling of exfoliation !</li>
            <li>It turns out, that the first usage requires a little more than just soaking the sponge for a couple of seconds-</li>
            <li>found this concept unique in itself as it definitely had me fooled!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for anyone that wants to gently cleanse their face.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say yet whether or not this has cleared up any issues long term, but it really makes my skin feel smooth after I use it.</li>
            <li>Actually I felt like it didn&#x27;t clean my face at all.  </li>
            <li>It had been far too long since I had taken care of my skin and since hearing about this sponge from a friend, I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li>It is infused with bamboo charcoal to really deep clean your pores.  </li>
            <li>It comes as a hard little tear drop shaped disc, but once you submerge the sponge in warm water for a minute or two, it fluffs up into a nice size.  </li>
            <li>THE TEAR-DROPPED SHAPE FACIAL SPOUNGE TRULY IS THE RIGHT SIZE &amp; SHAPE!</li>
            <li>Really helped clear my skin!!</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and it gives just the lightest massage/exfoliation that leaves my skin super silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Upon unwrapping this item from the shipping package I was pleasantly surprised by the well sealed item and the easy to view instructions on the back for the sponge.</li>
            <li>Once I used on my entire face and neck area, I rinsed out the sponge and used the attached handy string to hang the sponge to dry.</li>
            <li>Sample was provided for my honest evaluation whether it be positive or negative.</li>
            <li>I just tried it last night, and I do notice that my skin is extra smooth and would be worth the cost if it truly lasts up to three months.</li>
            <li>As I use face wipes as a normal part of my routine, I don&#x27;t see myself using this product as much as I would want to -</li>
            <li>Overall its not a bad sponge if you are looking for something like that.</li>
            <li>A new addiction for me!</li>
            <li>Super happy that I don&#x27;t have to spend on expensive creams now that I have this sponge!</li>
            <li>I read the directions which were easy to understand and proceeded to get it wet.</li>
            <li>The tear drop shape makes it easy to use and the string is useful in hanging it up to dry for the next use.</li>
            <li>It does have a slight odor that I don&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li>I got to try it out and test it at a super low prices.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this at a promotional discount.</li>
            <li>My face felt clean and soft after I was done and not dry and irritated.</li>
            <li>It expands into a nice fluffy soft sponge.</li>
            <li>I love that it is infused with charcoal to give the already deep cleansing sponge an extra power punch to help eliminate acne.</li>
            <li>I then took the wet Konjac sponge and used nice, circular motions to cover my entire face and neck areas and I noticed that there was NO smell with the sponge at all either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus it makes my skin very soft but it is gentle and not abrasive at all.  </li>
            <li>OK, I&#x27;ve used other sponges much like this in the past and love them.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quick, facial cleanser!</li>
            <li>Easy to use just wet and massage face with normal cleaner.</li>
            <li>I will be buying this again and highly recommend purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>So far I have no complaints!!</li>
            <li>I love how it has a little string to hang in the shower.</li>
            <li>and it left my face feeling clean and soft .</li>
            <li>The product comes hard, but softens up nicely into a sponge.  </li>
            <li>Feels soft and gentle leaving you refreshed .</li>
            <li>To my surprise, I was amazed at how gentle and soft the sponge felt as I applied it to my skin.</li>
            <li>Wow im really blown away.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that it was so gentle, yet so exfoliating.</li>
            <li>It comes in a sealed bag and I needed to run the sponge under running water for a minute to make it soft and ready to use.</li>
            <li>Recently, someone suggested that I get one of these exfoliating facial sponges instead - especially to see if I even liked an exfoliating product.</li>
            <li>I also feel that my skin is absorbing my lightening moisturizer better as my acne scars are fading a lot quicker than usual.</li>
            <li>normal teens, she is plagued by pimples and blackheads.</li>
            <li>I washed my face with my normal wash and while I still had the lather on my face</li>
            <li>con for me would be the price, so I&#x27;d order a few to get the volume discount making it more affordable.</li>
            <li>Thank you for letting me test this sponge at a reduced price - I wouldn&#x27;t have tried it normally.</li>
            <li>and not hard on the face.</li>
            <li>I love the attached string which allows me to hang it to dry in the shower for the next day.</li>
            <li>It came hard like a piece of charcaol, but once wet, it is super soft and has been a great addition to my daily routine in the shower.</li>
            <li>Using this sponge along with my face wash daily has made quite an impressive improvement over the past few days.</li>
            <li>It has a nice little string attached to it so you can hang it in a dry place after you gently squeeze it (not wring it out).</li>
            <li>I had seen these cleansing sponges and want to try, but I was unsure about how my skin would tolerate a new product....</li>
            <li>Sometimes she is reluctant to try new things, but seemed eager to give this a try.</li>
            <li>Overall I love this little sponge, and I will definitely be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>It softened up and this sponge is really easy to use, and I feel like I can use less cleanser than if I used my hands.</li>
            <li>I have used it every day and my skin feels soft and smooth, it is cleaner and has helped clear my dry patches.</li>
            <li>Its gentle on my sensitive skin and leaves my face feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>I love these little things!</li>
            <li>I want to buy one for all my friends, thats how much I love this little thing!</li>
            <li>Also, after each use, my skin is very soft.</li>
            <li>but all you need to do is soak it in water and it becomes very soft and squishy.</li>
            <li>The sponge is very very soft.</li>
            <li>It had a very soft feel</li>
            <li>it is very soft.  </li>
            <li>it turned very soft.  </li>
            <li>Felt very soft.</li>
            <li>Also, after being wet, the sponge itself smells pretty strongly of charcoal until dry.</li>
            <li>It takes less than a minute to absorb water and turn into a nice big soft sponge (soft but still has some texture to it).  </li>
            <li>I am in love of Konjac Sponges,this one has a different shape than other ones,making it easier to handle and also is light,perfect to carry with you</li>
            <li>Go ahead and soak it in water before attempting to use it the first time, especially if you intend to use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>At first it left a funky smell but it has dissipated.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that afterwards my face felt noticeable smoother!  </li>
            <li>My teenage daughter has significant facial skin issues and has since she was a pre-teen.</li>
            <li>It surprised me at first, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I was just pressing too hard or what,  but after the following use my skin looked great and is super soft.</li>
            <li>Either way, once it is fully softened, it is very soft and completely scentless.  </li>
            <li>I do have very sensitive skin, and many other products cause my face to become dry or irritated.</li>
            <li>and it did clear a lot of the pregnancy induced redness from my face.  </li>
            <li>it washes away all the dead skin and leaves your face soft and smooth</li>
            <li>My face had some dry or rough areas, but after using the sponge for a few days, my whole face feels smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>I feel that my skin&#x27;s cleaner when I use my wash with the Clear Konjac.</li>
            <li>I tried the Konjac sponge in hopes I could help clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>I like to have clear skin</li>
            <li>It leaves skin soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>My skin felt so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li>It is too soft to exfolite anything.  </li>
            <li>Baby soft skin after I use it.  </li>
            <li>I really like the idea of an activated charcoal infused facial sponge.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and has clogged pores and this sponge cleanses and exfoliates skin without any irritation.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I ordered the Konjac sponge to try on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This sponge is supper soft  and did not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>So far it is working well and it exfoliates my skin.</li>
            <li>I put my cleanser directly on the sponge</li>
            <li>Have only used the sponge a few times, but so far I love it.  </li>
            <li>this extra step in the mornings makes for much smoother skin.  </li>
            <li>sponge is soft and absorbs water to become spongy in a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>There is no smell and its not harsh at all on your skin.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this Konjac Facial tear drop shaped sponge cleanses my face.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that this sponge is one hundred percent natural.  </li>
            <li>This is always a must for me as someone with somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>And I seem to able to use it daily without any trouble.</li>
            <li>maybe it will end up wowing me, but as of right now, sad to say I was expecting more.</li>
            <li>The small size makes it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>After you first get it wet, it takes seconds to get it ready the next time you use it.</li>
            <li>This product seems to work well - have only been using it a few days, but it makes my face feel clean!</li>
            <li>Not a bad little product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this facial sponge!!</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this Konjac Facial Sponge from ClearKonjac!!!</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this Konjac Facial Sponge from ClearKonjac!!!</li>
            <li>I would purchase again if only it costs less as I originally bought it during a promotion.</li>
            <li>and I can say without a doubt after several day&#x27;s use, If you are going to buy an affordable new beauty tool anytime soon-</li>
            <li>Rinse off the sponge really well and let it air dry in a well ventilated area.</li>
            <li>I use an activated charcoal facial soap, so I have no idea if the charcoal in the sponge really does anything or not, but I like it overall.</li>
            <li>She has very sensitive skin so through the years she has utilized numerous products.  </li>
            <li>and it quickly fluffs up and becomes a soft sponge to help exfoliate the extra dead skin.  </li>
            <li>I like how my skin feels scrubbed, but it is not rough or scratchy at all.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for myself, but I ended up giving it to my young teen daughter as her face is showing her age.</li>
            <li>After using this natural Konjac sponge I definitely felt and noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far.  </li>
            <li>Its soft on the skin and takes away all the makeup even with using makeup remover prior to washing.  </li>
            <li>Not sure how long it will last, but I like how it makes my skin exfoliate :-)</li>
            <li>If using face wash is part of your normal routine, this product is definitely the next step!  </li>
            <li>Face felt smoother after using, but not sure I would pay full price, but that&#x27;s me.</li>
            <li>My tired mom to 3 babies face looks and feels so much better.</li>
            <li>The only thing is I find it works better if only damp not completely wet because it tends to get a little soggy if you get it too wet</li>
            <li>This Sponge is also made of high quality 100% Natural Konjac plant fiber and they are also infused with natural bamboo charcoal, which is highly beneficial with helping trouble prone skin!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this sponge to anyone struggling with dry skin and/or acne!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this sponge to anyone struggling with dry skin and/or acne!</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s not harsh on your skin and that it doesn&#x27;t have any weird smells.</li>
            <li>I only used just a little bit of my regular cleanser with it (much less than I usually have to) and it worked great.</li>
            <li>I was asked to provide a review of this product, and at first, I was a little leery, but decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>When I first received the product I thought it was a little pumice stone.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really speak to its ability to clear acne, as I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days now.  </li>
            <li>My skin was a little red after the first use.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is how long it takes with the water running to get them soft...</li>
            <li>In fact, I recommend you do not over-saturate it when you first moisten it, but it will eventually dry down to where you want it in a day or three.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little skeptical at how hard it was to the touch but after reading the easy instructions to run it under water, it became soft and was ready to use.  </li>

            <li> that said, even though it does seem to make my skin soft-ish, I don&#x27;t think it exfoliates any better than a good washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The shape is perfect for holding and using, which I appreciated.  </li>

            <li> but this one is super nice and soft so it doesn&#x27;t hurt your face and my skin felt good after the first wash</li>
            <li> My face feels very clean and it seems to look more vibrant!</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I wonder if it holds in bacteria or not because it&#x27;s a sponge, I have fully enjoyed this product and would buy it again at the right price.</li>
            <li> the moment I first saw it!!</li>
            <li> Gives such a great clean with this product.</li>
            <li> Great way to deep clean your face.</li>

            <li> Loved this product... made my skin feel super soft and it has helped reduce the size of my pores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After running under warm water in the shower, I use my normal cleanser</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Which I am excited for because it would not have occurred to me to try it.</li>
            <li> Have used this for the past week and my skin feels great!!  </li>
            <li> My skin is naturally pretty oily and this helped me maintain a more matte appearance throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I like how it gets my face clean without being too abrasive.</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean after without any harshness.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how clean it got my face.</li>
            <li> manually cleaning it just does not feel 100percent clean to me.</li>
            <li> It allows you to really clean in between your eyes &amp; nose crevices with the point part of the sponge.</li>
            <li> I never thought about the fact that I used a plastic sponge to clean my face before.  </li>
            <li> and I just used it to clean my face with my face wash.  </li>
            <li> Right after the first use my skin felt even more smooth than before.</li>

            <li> Very gentle exfoliator for my sensitive skin- gentle enough to use every day which is great in this warm weather!</li>
            <li> and right away I could tell how clean and smooth my face was.  </li>
            <li> Just re-ordered this again- makes my face feel real smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> My delivery arrived quicker than expected, which was great.</li>
            <li> and I plan to purchase some at full price for gifts.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think I would pay full price for it.</li>
            <li> It is so soft yet extremely effective.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels super clean afterward.</li>
            <li> Really nice and soft but still exfoliates.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference in my skin, but it feels good to wash my face with this sponge.</li>
            <li> I would love to buy another one very soon.</li>
            <li> they leave my face feeling super clean.</li>
            <li> I like the shape and how the string to hang it by goes through a good amount of the sponge, as opposed to a different brand of sponge I tried which ended up breaking where the string went through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for allowing me to test this product for free for review!</li>
            <li> then I added water and like magic it softened up, ready for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to love this product.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft</li>
            <li> This product is great in that I dont have to remember to charge it or create a spot for it among my other face/makeup items.</li>
            <li> Seriously, give this awesome beauty tool</li>
            <li> Seriously, give this awesome beauty tool</li>
            <li> I love how soft and smooth my skin is feeling already.  </li>
            <li> I had the awesome opportunity to review the ClearKonjac Facial Sponge recently.  </li>
            <li> I said it smelled like mold and mildly skunky scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really does a great job exfoliating and deep cleaning.  </li>
            <li> but I just haven&#x27;t been able to justify the high price tag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on your skin and leaves it feeling smooth and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> It softened quickly and felt quite nice, it was not rough at all.</li>
            <li> It gently exfoliates your skin, and gives it a clean, smooth finish.  </li>
            <li> I use cetaphil for a facial cleanser and this sponge works SO much better at getting my cleanser to lather and really clean my face!</li>
            <li> But I tried this out last night and was so pleased that I used it twice!</li>
            <li> This is highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser, and leaves my skin super smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little cleansing sponge for the face and neck.  </li>
            <li> When it comes to exfoliating you run the risk of harsh/course products which make your face red and rough - not an issue with the ClearKonjac sponge, it was the perfect mix of gentle and effective along with being natural not synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it would be very helpful for this company to team up with a chemical free cleanser company and recommend them with their product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smoother and feels much more naturally moisturized and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But honestly, you&#x27;re not going to send it back!</li>
            <li> This facial sponge is great, it&#x27;s soft on my face</li>
            <li> Worth the discounted price</li>
            <li> , however I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s worth $12.</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural, as well.</li>
            <li> Simple but yet effective.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice addition to my nightly facial washing routine.  </li>
            <li> When they say you skin will feel soft and smooth after using this they are not kidding!</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower and hang it by its handy, built in storage/hanging string until the next time.</li>
            <li> and I love that they are 100% Natural</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product, as an excellent addition to your regular facial routine.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done my face feels so clean and my skin is actually looking better than before I used it.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, clear and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already planning to get another one right away to have as my back-up</li>
            <li> IT GETS RIGHT UNDER MY EYES</li>
            <li> and this clears it right up.</li>
            <li> I just ran it through some water to soften the sponge and used it right away.</li>
            <li> After running the sponge in water for a few moments as directed it quickly expanded to a much more appropriate size, texture and shape.</li>
            <li> I really felt like I was getting my face clean and</li>
            <li> The Konjac Sponge for Facial Cleansing is soft and feels pleasant on the skin.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how much I ended up liking it :)</li>
            <li> I already used this since the day i got,,  its like a magic from hard to soft,, so far in two days of  using i work good,, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Overall, for the short time that I have had this product it has been much more successful in addressing many of problem areas than other exfoliating scrubs and devices that I have used.</li>
            <li> I am not only getting a deeper clean, but the top layer is gently being exfoliated.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive acne prone skin, I will be purchasing her one to try as I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Great supplement with my regular facial cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> I LOVE HOW IT IS 100% GENTLE &amp; NATURAL EXFOLIATING.</li>
            <li> I love the gentle, natural exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received emails from the company to let me know the product shipped, and a few days after to make sure I was enjoying the product and to not hesitate to contact them with questions.  </li>
            <li> It is soft on my skin, but I can tell it is exfoliating and making my cleanser really absorb into my skin and work better.  </li>
            <li> Blemishes diminished...leaves skin smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use this very much</li>
            <li> I thought the sponge would be harder more like a pumice, based on it&#x27;s original feel.</li>
            <li> It really made my skin super soft and smooth -</li>
            <li> Super easy to use for someone who does not want any complicated routine daily to look great!</li>
            <li> This also allows for better absorption of my daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My husband complement me on how pretty my skin looked this morning.  </li>
            <li> and I feel the difference in how much softer and cleaner my face feels!</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package, the sponge felt like a piece of pumice</li>
            <li> This is the first product we have found to remove the paint from his face.</li>
            <li> Definitely will purchase again :)</li>
            <li> My son looked so much brighter after just one use!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>

            <li> It makes the face feel soft and smooth w/o irritation.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad that I have finally found it!</li>
            <li> Works well,  smells funny though.  </li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s softer than it looks.</li>
            <li> It made my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> But, I really like it!</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> and they suggested I do more to my skin than just a daily cleaner</li>
            <li> It cleanse and leaves the skins feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like it and would recommend to others!</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with the Konjac sponges.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package, I thought, there is no way I am going to use this on my face.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t *love</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> My face has been so clear and smooth since I started using this.</li>
            <li> Love these, bought one for me and one for my teenage daughter.  </li>
            <li> If you are a first time user of this you have to soak this in water before using.</li>
            <li> What I love about Clear Konjac is that it&#x27;s all natural and has bamboo and charcoal - which is great for my skin which breaks out if I&#x27;m stressed or too lazy to remove my make-up at night.</li>
            <li> So with my first use, I give it 5 stars, if that opinion changes for any reason with continued use I will update my review.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it at first, so I couldn&#x27;t write a legit review.  </li>
            <li> it was when you first received it.  </li>
            <li> I just purchased several more to give to my daughters and one to pack in my suitcase for my upcoming trip.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels wonderfully soft and smooth after each cleanse.</li>
            <li> Its good at getting rid of dead skin..</li>
            <li> LOVE MY NEW CLEAR KONJAC SPONGE...</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this for my teenage daughters.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking high and low for a gentle and effective was to exfoliate my skin</li>
            <li> thing I noticed right away while I was using this Konjac sponge, was how easy it was to use my cleanser and get it evenly and nicely on my entire face.</li>
            <li> leaves skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised as my face did feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> My skin felt clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> My face feels clean and soft after using it.</li>
            <li> My face is always sensitive and easy to get irritated but this sponge is so gentle and make my face really clean/smooth without hurting my skin.</li>
            <li> After using this product my skin felt clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> Mild exfoliating sponge, hydrates easily, hangs to dry.</li>
            <li> BUT, after I allowed it to absorb warm water, it transformed into a soft yet effect facial sponge.</li>
            <li> really like the tapered top for getting into the areas next to my nose which has always been a problem area for me with exfoliating.</li>
            <li> First off, I really don&#x27;t like the musty/sulfury smell it leaves on my face.</li>
            <li> It is proven with sponge that good things come in small packages.  </li>
            <li> Seems like a cool idea to use a natural charcoal infused sponge.</li>
            <li> This facial sponge is gentle enough not to cause any irritation to my sensitive and acne prone skin while still proving a great exfoliating experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll love that it has that hanger that you can hang it with and leave it to  dry.</li>
            <li> You have to hold it under warm water for a few minutes at first</li>
            <li> Also, the bamboo charcoal is pure marketing gimmick.</li>
            <li> When the water is applied, the sponge is very soft and gentle enough to use every single day and has made a great difference with my skin.</li>
            <li> also really like that it has a string attached to it which makes it easy to hang up and store for the next time you need to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice little handle so that I can hang it up when I&#x27;m done so it doesn&#x27;t get yucky sitting on the counter.</li>
            <li> The little string attached for hanging it up is handy.  </li>
            <li> When I first started to use it, the humidity was high and stayed that way for almost a month.  </li>
            <li> I was  a little worried that it would be rough on my sensitive skin, but it was really gentle and exfoliated perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple yet effective facial sponge that I will be purchasing more of in the near future!</li>
            <li> The string that the sponge hangs on is very flimsy.</li>
            <li> Gently exfoliates .</li>
            <li> felt much smoother but the sponge did nothing.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend buying this product to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;ve only used it once my skin was so smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is worth the money to have clear skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this sponge</li>
            <li> I really like the product.  </li>
            <li> and I have pretty normal skin without a ton of issues.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I would get just as much exfoliation from a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I received it for free to review it, but I will be purchasing it in the future.  </li>
            <li> They really help get makeup off.</li>
            <li> I cleansed my face off really well but</li>
            <li> My face seemed much cleaner and radieant in a way.</li>
            <li> Using this in rotation with my clarisonic, has given me much smoother and nicer skin.  </li>
            <li> In a sponge --- not so much.</li>
            <li> So gentle</li>
            <li> and it will be much like</li>
            <li> Until I researched into finding a better facial sponge, I never really thought about how important it is to have a quality sponge as well as a quality cleanser.</li>
            <li> so they are extremely gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> After rinsing off my face, I could really feel an immediate difference in smoothness, softness, and texture-</li>
            <li> I really found to using the sponge</li>
            <li> The company also offers a 90 day money back guarantee so if you don&#x27;t love it, you&#x27;re covered.</li>
            <li> I liked how it cleaned and exfoliated my skin without being harsh and harming my skin.  </li>
            <li> but I was pleased with how soft it has left my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this little scrubber, it makes your face feel so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I would never have expected this sponge to leave my skin so soft and clean!!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first, but after soaking this in warm running water for just a minute it become a soft and more like a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; sponge.</li>
            <li> but it feels so good soft squishy with just a little feeling of exfoliation !</li>
            <li> It turns out, that the first usage requires a little more than just soaking the sponge for a couple of seconds-</li>
            <li> found this concept unique in itself as it definitely had me fooled!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for anyone that wants to gently cleanse their face.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say yet whether or not this has cleared up any issues long term, but it really makes my skin feel smooth after I use it.</li>
            <li> Actually I felt like it didn&#x27;t clean my face at all.  </li>
            <li> It had been far too long since I had taken care of my skin and since hearing about this sponge from a friend, I&#x27;m really glad</li>
            <li> It is infused with bamboo charcoal to really deep clean your pores.  </li>
            <li> It comes as a hard little tear drop shaped disc, but once you submerge the sponge in warm water for a minute or two, it fluffs up into a nice size.  </li>
            <li> THE TEAR-DROPPED SHAPE FACIAL SPOUNGE TRULY IS THE RIGHT SIZE &amp; SHAPE!</li>
            <li> Really helped clear my skin!!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it gives just the lightest massage/exfoliation that leaves my skin super silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Upon unwrapping this item from the shipping package I was pleasantly surprised by the well sealed item and the easy to view instructions on the back for the sponge.</li>
            <li> Once I used on my entire face and neck area, I rinsed out the sponge and used the attached handy string to hang the sponge to dry.</li>
            <li> Sample was provided for my honest evaluation whether it be positive or negative.</li>
            <li> I just tried it last night, and I do notice that my skin is extra smooth and would be worth the cost if it truly lasts up to three months.</li>
            <li> As I use face wipes as a normal part of my routine, I don&#x27;t see myself using this product as much as I would want to -</li>
            <li> Overall its not a bad sponge if you are looking for something like that.</li>
            <li> A new addiction for me!</li>
            <li> Super happy that I don&#x27;t have to spend on expensive creams now that I have this sponge!</li>
            <li> I read the directions which were easy to understand and proceeded to get it wet.</li>
            <li> The tear drop shape makes it easy to use and the string is useful in hanging it up to dry for the next use.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight odor that I don&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li> I got to try it out and test it at a super low prices.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this at a promotional discount.</li>
            <li> My face felt clean and soft after I was done and not dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> It expands into a nice fluffy soft sponge.</li>
            <li> I love that it is infused with charcoal to give the already deep cleansing sponge an extra power punch to help eliminate acne.</li>
            <li> I then took the wet Konjac sponge and used nice, circular motions to cover my entire face and neck areas and I noticed that there was NO smell with the sponge at all either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus it makes my skin very soft but it is gentle and not abrasive at all.  </li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;ve used other sponges much like this in the past and love them.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quick, facial cleanser!</li>
            <li> Easy to use just wet and massage face with normal cleaner.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this again and highly recommend purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended...</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So far I have no complaints!!</li>
            <li> I love how it has a little string to hang in the shower.</li>
            <li> and it left my face feeling clean and soft .</li>
            <li> The product comes hard, but softens up nicely into a sponge.  </li>
            <li> Feels soft and gentle leaving you refreshed .</li>
            <li> To my surprise, I was amazed at how gentle and soft the sponge felt as I applied it to my skin.</li>
            <li> Wow im really blown away.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that it was so gentle, yet so exfoliating.</li>
            <li> It comes in a sealed bag and I needed to run the sponge under running water for a minute to make it soft and ready to use.</li>
            <li> Recently, someone suggested that I get one of these exfoliating facial sponges instead - especially to see if I even liked an exfoliating product.</li>
            <li> I also feel that my skin is absorbing my lightening moisturizer better as my acne scars are fading a lot quicker than usual.</li>
            <li> normal teens, she is plagued by pimples and blackheads.</li>
            <li> I washed my face with my normal wash and while I still had the lather on my face</li>
            <li> con for me would be the price, so I&#x27;d order a few to get the volume discount making it more affordable.</li>
            <li> Thank you for letting me test this sponge at a reduced price - I wouldn&#x27;t have tried it normally.</li>
            <li> and not hard on the face.</li>
            <li> I love the attached string which allows me to hang it to dry in the shower for the next day.</li>
            <li> It came hard like a piece of charcaol, but once wet, it is super soft and has been a great addition to my daily routine in the shower.</li>
            <li> Using this sponge along with my face wash daily has made quite an impressive improvement over the past few days.</li>
            <li> It has a nice little string attached to it so you can hang it in a dry place after you gently squeeze it (not wring it out).</li>
            <li> I had seen these cleansing sponges and want to try, but I was unsure about how my skin would tolerate a new product....</li>
            <li> Sometimes she is reluctant to try new things, but seemed eager to give this a try.</li>
            <li> Overall I love this little sponge, and I will definitely be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> It softened up and this sponge is really easy to use, and I feel like I can use less cleanser than if I used my hands.</li>
            <li> I have used it every day and my skin feels soft and smooth, it is cleaner and has helped clear my dry patches.</li>
            <li> Its gentle on my sensitive skin and leaves my face feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> I love these little things!</li>
            <li> I want to buy one for all my friends, thats how much I love this little thing!</li>
            <li> Also, after each use, my skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> but all you need to do is soak it in water and it becomes very soft and squishy.</li>
            <li> The sponge is very very soft.</li>
            <li> It had a very soft feel</li>
            <li> it is very soft.  </li>
            <li> it turned very soft.  </li>
            <li> Felt very soft.</li>
            <li> Also, after being wet, the sponge itself smells pretty strongly of charcoal until dry.</li>
            <li> It takes less than a minute to absorb water and turn into a nice big soft sponge (soft but still has some texture to it).  </li>
            <li> I am in love of Konjac Sponges,this one has a different shape than other ones,making it easier to handle and also is light,perfect to carry with you</li>
            <li> Go ahead and soak it in water before attempting to use it the first time, especially if you intend to use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> At first it left a funky smell but it has dissipated.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that afterwards my face felt noticeable smoother!  </li>
            <li> My teenage daughter has significant facial skin issues and has since she was a pre-teen.</li>
            <li> It surprised me at first, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I was just pressing too hard or what,  but after the following use my skin looked great and is super soft.</li>
            <li> Either way, once it is fully softened, it is very soft and completely scentless.  </li>
            <li> I do have very sensitive skin, and many other products cause my face to become dry or irritated.</li>
            <li> and it did clear a lot of the pregnancy induced redness from my face.  </li>
            <li> it washes away all the dead skin and leaves your face soft and smooth</li>
            <li> My face had some dry or rough areas, but after using the sponge for a few days, my whole face feels smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> I feel that my skin&#x27;s cleaner when I use my wash with the Clear Konjac.</li>
            <li> I tried the Konjac sponge in hopes I could help clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> I like to have clear skin</li>
            <li> It leaves skin soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> My skin felt so soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li> It is too soft to exfolite anything.  </li>
            <li> Baby soft skin after I use it.  </li>
            <li> I really like the idea of an activated charcoal infused facial sponge.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and has clogged pores and this sponge cleanses and exfoliates skin without any irritation.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I ordered the Konjac sponge to try on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This sponge is supper soft  and did not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> So far it is working well and it exfoliates my skin.</li>
            <li> I put my cleanser directly on the sponge</li>
            <li> Have only used the sponge a few times, but so far I love it.  </li>
            <li> this extra step in the mornings makes for much smoother skin.  </li>
            <li> sponge is soft and absorbs water to become spongy in a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> There is no smell and its not harsh at all on your skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this Konjac Facial tear drop shaped sponge cleanses my face.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that this sponge is one hundred percent natural.  </li>
            <li> This is always a must for me as someone with somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> And I seem to able to use it daily without any trouble.</li>
            <li> maybe it will end up wowing me, but as of right now, sad to say I was expecting more.</li>
            <li> The small size makes it easy to use.  </li>
            <li> After you first get it wet, it takes seconds to get it ready the next time you use it.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work well - have only been using it a few days, but it makes my face feel clean!</li>
            <li> Not a bad little product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this facial sponge!!</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this Konjac Facial Sponge from ClearKonjac!!!</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this Konjac Facial Sponge from ClearKonjac!!!</li>
            <li> I would purchase again if only it costs less as I originally bought it during a promotion.</li>
            <li> and I can say without a doubt after several day&#x27;s use, If you are going to buy an affordable new beauty tool anytime soon-</li>
            <li> Rinse off the sponge really well and let it air dry in a well ventilated area.</li>
            <li> I use an activated charcoal facial soap, so I have no idea if the charcoal in the sponge really does anything or not, but I like it overall.</li>
            <li> She has very sensitive skin so through the years she has utilized numerous products.  </li>
            <li> and it quickly fluffs up and becomes a soft sponge to help exfoliate the extra dead skin.  </li>
            <li> I like how my skin feels scrubbed, but it is not rough or scratchy at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for myself, but I ended up giving it to my young teen daughter as her face is showing her age.</li>
            <li> After using this natural Konjac sponge I definitely felt and noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far.  </li>
            <li> Its soft on the skin and takes away all the makeup even with using makeup remover prior to washing.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how long it will last, but I like how it makes my skin exfoliate :-)</li>
            <li> If using face wash is part of your normal routine, this product is definitely the next step!  </li>
            <li> Face felt smoother after using, but not sure I would pay full price, but that&#x27;s me.</li>
            <li> My tired mom to 3 babies face looks and feels so much better.</li>
            <li> The only thing is I find it works better if only damp not completely wet because it tends to get a little soggy if you get it too wet</li>
            <li> This Sponge is also made of high quality 100% Natural Konjac plant fiber and they are also infused with natural bamboo charcoal, which is highly beneficial with helping trouble prone skin!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this sponge to anyone struggling with dry skin and/or acne!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this sponge to anyone struggling with dry skin and/or acne!</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s not harsh on your skin and that it doesn&#x27;t have any weird smells.</li>
            <li> I only used just a little bit of my regular cleanser with it (much less than I usually have to) and it worked great.</li>
            <li> I was asked to provide a review of this product, and at first, I was a little leery, but decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> When I first received the product I thought it was a little pumice stone.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really speak to its ability to clear acne, as I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days now.  </li>
            <li> My skin was a little red after the first use.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is how long it takes with the water running to get them soft...</li>
            <li> In fact, I recommend you do not over-saturate it when you first moisten it, but it will eventually dry down to where you want it in a day or three.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical at how hard it was to the touch but after reading the easy instructions to run it under water, it became soft and was ready to use.  </li>
            <li> Right out of the box, I gave it a second glance because it&#x27;s rock hard</li>
            <li> I just  threw right in the trash because they were so hard</li>
            <li> but after getting it wet and letting it sit for a few minutes it softened right up</li>
            <li> This product was small enough to use on my face, yet large enough for me to handle.</li>
            <li> The sponge is surprisingly soft not scratchy like the other ones.  </li>
            <li> The string attached allows it to hang dry, it seems like it could be a little frail but has not broken yet.</li>
            <li> This surprised me the most as initially, the sponge was rock-hard and I was afraid of it being too rough.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit worried because it comes really hard.  </li>
            <li> I tried using it to wash my face together with my regular body shop facial wash - and it was so gentle that I hardly felt the sponge scratching my skin.</li>
            <li> but I chose to use it with), and circulate the sponge in small, gentle circles around the face.</li>
            <li> Charcoal has been shown to pull out oil, but I&#x27;m not sure how much the charcoal is the sponge helps.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted you must use them wet (or else they are little rocks), they are very lightweight and look and feel a lot like a lava rock, but when you get them wet they get very soft.  </li>
            <li> After, I notice a slight difference in texture of my skin, soft and smoother than before.</li>
            <li> Once finished, you simply rinse it (don&#x27;t wring it) and let it dry</li>
            <li> there only being one thing I could really find that was negative about the product</li>
            <li> With there only being one thing I could really find that was negative about the product</li>
            <li> I try this facial  cleansing sponge and it makes my skin soft and removed my deadly skin.</li>
            <li> Now when the sponge dries out, it doesn&#x27;t go back to the smaller and harder version, but just dries out as a sponge should.</li>
            <li> while it seems like common knowledge, it surprised me when I walked into my little bathroom that first morning after using it the night before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First impressions was that it was smaller than I&#x27;d imagined and hard as a rock?!?</li>
            <li> This product was a little too soft for me</li>
            <li> When it came out of the package I was pretty weary about it since it was hard as a rock, but as soon as I got it wet</li>
            <li> For a long time, I have wanted to purchase a battery-operated exfoliating system for my skin</li>
            <li> It took a long time to rinse the sponge out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly dealing with rough skin.</li>
            <li> I initially thought the sponge would feel rough on my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks, and I have not had any breakouts or blackheads so far.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive to cleansing products and usually results in breakouts and redness.  </li>
            <li> but once you run it under water for a minute it&#x27;ll be really soft and no it doesn&#x27;t go back to being that hard afterwards, well, as long as you continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Due to the amount I&#x27;d be using this product, was the reason I only gave 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> Upon first receiving the sponge it was very hard</li>
            <li> i have not had it for very long</li>
            <li> Hangs to dry in the shower, seems durable so far.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I noticed that the dry skin on my face was gone, and my skin looked clearer after using.</li>
            <li> You must let it hang dry</li>
            <li> so you can hang it up to dry.</li>
            <li> I do like the size of the sponge and the string they attach for hanging to dry.</li>
            <li> When it dries after use it feels like a normal sponge and does not return to the rock hard state.  </li>
            <li> Normally he never gives this type iof compliment</li>
            <li> have had some dry rough spots and as of this morning--they are gone-</li>
            <li> was that I had to manipulate holding it while applying my cleanser, getting it wet, and also trying to dry it off/</li>
            <li> I typically use a muslin cloth for my daily cleansing routine but find that it can be cumbersome.</li>
            <li> Interestingly enough, my sponge happen to be slightly softer on one side than the other</li>
            <li> so I can hang it nearly instead of leaving it on the sink which would be quite icky.</li>
            <li> UNTIL I GOT IT WET.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times</li>
            <li> After only a few days using it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too harsh and it feels as though the sponge is helping you get a deep cleaning on your face.</li>
            <li> No need to worry though, because just like any sponge, all you need to do it get it wet</li>
            <li> It comes packaged dried, so you need to hold it under water for awhile to turn it back into a sponge.  </li>
            <li> I thought that I would just hold it under the water stream for a few seconds to get it to plump up, but it took a few minutes for it to get completely softened, so I think that soaking it would be easier.  </li>
            <li> It was too humid for my sponge to dry!!</li>
            <li> Not sure how this little sponge that looks like a scouring pad can be so incredibly soft!  </li>
            <li> When you receive it, you wet it down and permit it to re-hydrate and then apply a little facial cleanser and use the sponge to exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> I washed and exfoliated my face, but did not feel it rough like some other exfoliants.</li>
            <li> Smells a little weird but not bad.</li>
            <li> We both expected it to be a little rough on her skin because that&#x27;s what it appears like (feels like when dry).</li>
            <li> I am not positive, but I think it is decreasing my pore size.</li>
            <li> - just get it wet, apply your usual cleanser (you can actually use it with or without cleanser</li>
            <li> Not only does this product work wonders on my lack luster dull dry flakey skin</li>
            <li> I have been using day and night for past several days --I</li>
            <li> The texture is unlike any other sponge I have ever felt.</li>
            <li> (but I can&#x27;t compare to other brands).</li>
            <li> They do only last about 30 days-when used daily, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> so I used one side to absorb the soap and the other for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> It has a little string to hang it from to dry.</li>
            <li> It does arrived in a dehydrated state and you must wet it down in order to use it as intended.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly soft, although it arrives dried and hard as a rock.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t harsh and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling all dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> I wash my face using Konjac Sponges at least twice daily</li>
            <li> I am puzzled as to how it works because once you wet it, it does not have any type of abrasive feeling for removing dead skin like it suggests.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle - I mean, this is only a sponge.</li>
            <li> The charcoal brings out the blackheads and other impurities so well!</li>
            <li> He skin has been less oily, and the amount of pimples has decreased far below the amount she typically has.</li>
            <li> It is on the very small side, both in thickness and overall size.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is typical or if it was just a one off, but I cannot recommend it based on the one that I received.</li>
            <li> Typically has oily, breakout prone skin</li>
            <li> My skin already feels smoother with less breakouts.  </li>
            <li> As someone that is obsessed with Konjac Facial Sponges I had to get this  Facial Sponge</li>
            <li> Just like other reviewers, this arrived and was hard and rough like a rock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if I see the benefits yet of the charcoal bamboo since I only used it for a few days, but it&#x27;s convenient to keep at my sink since it&#x27;s small, so I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and have been having bad skin breakouts.</li>
            <li> My face has been so dry lately...</li>
            <li> Less messy</li>
            <li> WHILE REMOVING DEAD CELLS, I TRULY NOTICED A DIFFERENCE IN THE AMOUNT OF BLACK HEADS ON MY FACE AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> My daughter has issue with a little acne and blackheads---I did not know she was using this as well...</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and learn a little about the konjac sponge.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a week now.</li>
            <li> , I am just not sure of the benefits of this over any other cleansing sponge at this point - maybe i need to keep using longer, will continue to use and see if I get improved results.</li>
            <li> it makes your face smell like charcoal for a little while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering where this little sponge has been all my life.  </li>
            <li> Instead, it&#x27;s a little dehydrated sponge.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like getting a little massage for your face every time you wash.</li>
            <li> I would however point out that it says several times in the promotion about cutting the harmful chemicals from your routine and then in the directions it says use your daily cleanser.  </li>
            <li> After just a few days use, I am noticing a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I felt like it wasted a lot of time and water</li>
            <li> so I can use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Gets all the dead skin off.</li>
            <li> (I have to wash my face a few times after using this to get rid of the smell) but it didn&#x27;t help whatever with my acne.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have or get a lot of acne, but I have oily/dry skin combo also a few blackheads</li>
            <li> I only wash my face with water as we are trying to get away from using unnecessary chemicals</li>
            <li> The jury was still out, but after a few days, the scent was still there</li>
            <li> and then it turns into this fluffy sponge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I need for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It has lasted a few months without losing it&#x27;s form or sponginess.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is one of the few products that has agreed with her skin and has truly shown an improvement when it comes to her acne.</li>
            <li> It was hard and lets face it not pretty.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not sure I would purchase this product again and certainly not at full price</li>
            <li> and I like using it with just plain water even.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a little face massage every time I use it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at what this little sponge can do!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does show up in a little package hard as a rock</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it leaves a faint, odd, earthy odor on my skin.</li>
            <li> allows you to use very little cleanser and wash your skin well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used it with my usual cleanser</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this, but I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift from a friend who knows I&#x27;m obsessed with cleaning my face - since I use makeup daily.</li>
            <li> She has been routinely using this sponge for a few days, and has already noticed an improvements!</li>
            <li> It caused me to have small breakouts.</li>
            <li> I was frankly not terribly impressed by the tiny,grey,tear drop-ish shaped sponge but thinking back</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not offensive or terrible, but it is a bit odd and unique.  </li>
            <li> IT STARTED OUT SMALL AND HARD</li>
            <li> This came to me as a small, hard rock.</li>
            <li> Sponge comes hard but softens up after running under water .</li>
            <li> It also absorbs facial wash like crazy.</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t harsh or irritating.</li>
            <li> However, it has to be in a form where it can slowly absorb the pollutants.</li>
            <li> It comes in a package and is very small and hard.</li>
            <li> I was a little bit skeptical when I got this sponge in.</li>
            <li> Unless I did it wrong way, this product is waste of money.</li>
            <li> When you get it, it&#x27;s very hard</li>
            <li> If you have a tough time with break outs</li>
            <li> I felt my skin is a lot smoother after a few use!!!</li>
            <li> It is a tear-shaped, hard &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; and I will admit I was a bit skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Its rock hard, and seemed as if it may be uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this rather hard lump that came out of the package...</li>
            <li> It made my face break out worse than it did before I started using this sponge</li>
            <li> (at this writing approximately $12 on Amazon).</li>
            <li> There IS science behind charcoal removing pollutants from environments and skin.</li>
            <li> I will admit when I opened the package I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> This not only smells horrible</li>
            <li> It somehow has unpleasant smell and stinks my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I am now addicted!!</li>
            <li> the price would not be as bad.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad about this product except the price tag.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed of the product.</li>
            <li> so I was doubtful</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> THIS IS FANTASTIC!!  IT STARTED OUT SMALL AND HARD UNTIL I GOT IT WET.  THEN IT GOT FLUFFY AND PRODUCED SO MUCH LATHER.  I HAVE NEVER FELT CLEANER!!</li>
            <li> I am in love of Konjac Sponges,this one has a different shape than other ones,making it easier to handle and also is light,perfect to carry with you while travelling.&lt;br /&gt;It could be a great gift for anyone who likes to take care of themselves.</li>
            <li> I received this sponge as a gift in return I needed to write a review.Well I got this sponge yesterday dropped it in a cup of water to soften it up and yes it did I have had so many I just  threw right in the trash because they were so hard but this one is super nice and soft so it doesn&#x27;t hurt your face and my skin felt good after the first wash so if you need a premium Koniac sponge try this one</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when this arrived.  It is a tear-shaped, hard &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; and I will admit I was a bit skeptical.  But oh my word!!  I love the way this makes my skin feel!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After running under warm water in the shower, I use my normal cleanser and I can just feel the softness when I am done.  I am not only getting a deeper clean, but the top layer is gently being exfoliated.  This also allows for better absorption of my daily moisturizer.  My daughter is getting to an age where she needs to start washing her face every day to prevent problem skin.  I will be getting her one of these as well!</li>
            <li> The sponge came with another product I purchased and love the unexpected but wonderful find.</li>
            <li> For a long time, I have wanted to purchase a battery-operated exfoliating system for my skin but I just haven&#x27;t been able to justify the high price tag. Recently, someone suggested that I get one of these exfoliating facial sponges instead - especially to see if I even liked an exfoliating product. Right out of the box, I gave it a second glance because it&#x27;s rock hard and you wonder what it&#x27;s going to do to your skin. After using it for a couple of weeks now, I call it my &amp;#34;miracle sponge&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s super easy to use - just get it wet, apply your usual cleanser (you can actually use it with or without cleanser but I chose to use it with), and circulate the sponge in small, gentle circles around the face. Then, rinse off the cleanser.  Rinse off the sponge really well and let it air dry in a well ventilated area. When the water is applied, the sponge is very soft and gentle enough to use every single day and has made a great difference with my skin. It&#x27;s smoother and feels much more naturally moisturized and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to being an amazing product, I love it that has no chemicals, pollutants or irritants and isn&#x27;t tested on animals. The company also offers a 90 day money back guarantee so if you don&#x27;t love it, you&#x27;re covered. But honestly, you&#x27;re not going to send it back! I&#x27;m already planning to get another one right away to have as my back-up so I never have to be without this sponge in my daily skincare routine.</li>
            <li> I have been using day and night for past several days --I have had some dry rough spots and as of this morning--they are gone-I love how soft and smooth my skin is feeling already.  My daughter has issue with a little acne and blackheads---I did not know she was using this as well...as of this morning, and only after using a few days--her skin is very noticeably clearer...she loves this as well.  Will Definitely order again...one for each of us!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about this spong, but my skin feels wonderful. I am very happy with this product, I love that it is so easy to use. just great.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and the receiver said it was wonderful.  Since I didn&#x27;t use it myself I can only go by what my friend told me.</li>
            <li> Very soft and leaves skin feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a few times so I can&#x27;t say yet whether or not this has cleared up any issues long term, but it really makes my skin feel smooth after I use it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this premium Konjac Sponge for Facial  is absolutely beautiful how my face feel better after I use I definitely recommended this product.</li>
            <li> This facial sponge is great, it&#x27;s soft on my face and I use it daily. I like that it has a string to hang it. I have left mine in the shower and have used it every morning for 2 weeks and my face feels refreshed!</li>
            <li> My husband complement me on how pretty my skin looked this morning.  Normally he never gives this type iof compliment so I just have to give it five stars.</li>
            <li> I like how it gets my face clean without being too abrasive. I&#x27;m not really sure if I see the benefits yet of the charcoal bamboo since I only used it for a few days, but it&#x27;s convenient to keep at my sink since it&#x27;s small, so I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!! My face feels very clean and it seems to look more vibrant!</li>
            <li> This sponge drastically helped the problem I have with blackheads. Also, after each use, my skin is very soft. I have been recommending this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It leaves skin soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle - I mean, this is only a sponge. But I tried this out last night and was so pleased that I used it twice! My skin felt so soft afterwards. I used it once with cleanser, and then later in the shower by itself. It&#x27;s easy to use, has a nice texture, and feels very soft against my skin.</li>
            <li> LOVE!! So glad I had the chance to try this sponge...I love it! Its good at getting rid of dead skin..I&#x27;ve used it for about a week now and I feel the difference in how much softer and cleaner my face feels!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product.  When I first opened the package, the sponge felt like a piece of pumice and I wondered what I was in for, but it softened up beautifully under water and is quite refreshing to use.  After just a few days use, I am noticing a difference in my skin.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product. I have only been using it for about a week and I can see the difference in my skin. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This sponge works so well at cleaning my skin! It&#x27;s easy to use and provides awesome results. My face felt clean and smooth after I used this product. It did not irritate my skin and wasn&#x27;t too abrasive.</li>
            <li> I will admit when I opened the package I was skeptical. It was hard and lets face it not pretty. It softened up and this sponge is really easy to use, and I feel like I can use less cleanser than if I used my hands. My skin feels clean after without any harshness. My daughter has sensitive acne prone skin, I will be purchasing her one to try as I love it so much.</li>
            <li> It claims that this sponge is exfoliating, it is actually quite slimy feeling. I feel like a wash cloth would get my face cleaner than using this sponge. It took a long time to rinse the sponge out and I felt like it wasted a lot of time and water getting it all rinsed. I won&#x27;t be using this sponge again. The string that the sponge hangs on is very flimsy.</li>
            <li> This works so nice. My husband is a spray painter who gets paint all over his face.This is the first product we have found to remove the paint from his face.We are in awe of this product. We have tried many products to clean his face and all were failures.Not this #facial #sponge#cleanser.We love this and recommend it to the males who work in the painting business.</li>
            <li> The sponge feels good on my face! Smells a little weird but not bad.</li>
            <li> Nice for gentle exfoliation. leaves skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I like the sponge ok, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything fabulous though.  Worth the discounted price and I am glad that I tried it.  I don&#x27;t think I would purchase it at regular price, but I would if I received another discount.  It is nice to have it hanging in the shower so I can use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I am loving this!! It is so easy to use and I can feel and see the difference after I use it! I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great product!  It&#x27;s very gentle on your skin and leaves it feeling smooth and refreshed.  The product comes hard, but softens up nicely into a sponge.  The shape is easy to hold as well.  I like being able to use it with my existing products and that it stores away easily.</li>
            <li> Gives such a great clean with this product. Afterwards it felt like I just received a facial. Easy to use just wet and massage face with normal cleaner. A new addiction for me!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this sponge !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great sponge for your face! When you get it, it&#x27;s very hard but all you need to do is soak it in water and it becomes very soft and squishy. The texture is unlike any other sponge I have ever felt. The sponge is very very soft. It won&#x27;t feel like you are scrubbing your face when you scrub your face with it. They say you can use the sponge without soap, however, I use mine with Tea tree castile soap. It makes for a great skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE MY NEW CLEAR KONJAC SPONGE...Not only does this product work wonders on my lack luster dull dry flakey skin but it keeps me glowing for days. Matter of fact I ran nd bought one for my body and another for my face. AMAZING RECOMMENDED FOR ALL</li>
            <li> I love this Konjac Sponge! I use it everyday and it gives just the lightest massage/exfoliation that leaves my skin super silky smooth. I&#x27;ve heard a lot of great things about the konjac sponge, but this is the first one I&#x27;ve tried and so far I love it (but I can&#x27;t compare to other brands). I&#x27;ve also noticed that the blackheads on my nose is not as prominent as they used to be. Definitely will purchase again :)</li>
            <li> I love how this leaves my skin looking and feeling so clean. My son looked so much brighter after just one use! Great beauty product.</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample and I wasn&#x27;t that impressed.  The exfoliation factor just isn&#x27;t there.  It is too soft to exfolite anything.  It also absorbs facial wash like crazy.</li>
            <li> My face feels really smooth after using this sponge.  I can&#x27;t really speak to its ability to clear acne, as I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days now.  I like how it is lightweight and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this sponge! I received it very quickly and i began using it immediately. Right after the first use my skin felt even more smooth than before. By the next day it was clearer. I have hormonal cystic acne so anything that can help i will be completely on love with. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I like this sponge . I&#x27;ve used it with and without a cleanser and it left my face feeling clean and soft . It exfoliates and removes dirt and makeup .</li>
            <li> This has worked fabulously to exfoliate.  I not prefer it to exfoliatin cream.  Less messy and I like using it with just plain water even.  Baby soft skin after I use it.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I received this sponge 2 days ago and already I can tell a difference in my skin! It is smoother and clearer after just 2 uses. I highly recommend this sponge to anyone struggling with dry skin and/or acne!</li>
            <li> Just re-ordered this again- makes my face feel real smooth and soft. They do only last about 30 days-when used daily, unfortunately. I noticed no breakouts with my monthly cycle this time which was a huge plus to me!</li>
            <li> This will be a part of my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> Sponge comes hard but softens up after running under water . Gently exfoliates . Helps later face cleaner for even application . Feels soft and gentle leaving you refreshed .</li>
            <li> Perfect facial sponge. It exfoliates well while not being overly abrasive on skin.</li>
            <li> these are so gentle yet effective! I love these little things! The only drawback is how long it takes with the water running to get them soft...</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and learn a little about the konjac sponge.  I was pleased with this product and enjoyed using it.  I will be a customer in the future.  To read more, please see my full review: http://www.raisethemnatural.com/2015/05/clearkonjac-facial-cleaning-sponge.html</li>
            <li> I really like the idea of an activated charcoal infused facial sponge.  It is incredibly soft, although it arrives dried and hard as a rock.  Go ahead and soak it in water before attempting to use it the first time, especially if you intend to use it in the shower.  I thought that I would just hold it under the water stream for a few seconds to get it to plump up, but it took a few minutes for it to get completely softened, so I think that soaking it would be easier.  Either way, once it is fully softened, it is very soft and completely scentless.  My skin does feel very nice after using it.  I use an activated charcoal facial soap, so I have no idea if the charcoal in the sponge really does anything or not, but I like it overall.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge. Very gentle exfoliator for my sensitive skin- gentle enough to use every day which is great in this warm weather! I love the attached string which allows me to hang it to dry in the shower for the next day. Strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> ooooooh feels so nice on my skin i have not had it for very long so i don&#x27;t know the effect on my skin but it feels so good soft squishy with just a little feeling of exfoliation !</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used anything like this before, so wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. To my surprise, I was amazed at how gentle and soft the sponge felt as I applied it to my skin. It wasn&#x27;t abrasive at all and easy to rinse off and store. After, I notice a slight difference in texture of my skin, soft and smoother than before. I would buy and recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Great product!!! It is proven with sponge that good things come in small packages.  Prior to using the sponge, my skin just didn’t seem to look any different when using my Oil of Olay facial cleanser.  Now, with the sponge and cleanser, I can see a difference in my skin.  It actually looks cleaner and the blackheads seem to come to surface.  My skin is sensitive and has clogged pores and this sponge cleanses and exfoliates skin without any irritation. I love the smoothness of the sponge as well.  This is highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I love this sponge!  It&#x27;s a gentle cleanser, and leaves my skin super smooth.  I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in blemishes and overall better feeling skin.</li>
            <li> i got this for free in return of bias reviews. well this make my face feel smooth and look clear. i will stick to this product</li>
            <li> Great exfoliater. Leaves my skin feeling amazing!</li>
            <li> Love this little scrubber, it makes your face feel so clean and soft. Gets all the dead skin off. I use it then put my moisturizer on for the night. Looks good in the morning.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It makes the face feel soft and smooth w/o irritation.</li>
            <li> My fiancé and I like it. He feels it made his acne go away where he shaves and I&#x27;ve found it has made my occasional acne diminish faster, however I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s worth $12. I would purchase again if only it costs less as I originally bought it during a promotion.</li>
            <li> Received this sponge and found it interesting to the touch, and was intrigued. I read the directions which were easy to understand and proceeded to get it wet. I thought the sponge would be harder more like a pumice, based on it&#x27;s original feel. It softened quickly and felt quite nice, it was not rough at all. I washed and exfoliated my face, but did not feel it rough like some other exfoliants. I wasn&#x27;t sure how it would do because it didn&#x27;t feel much more than a sponge, and this claimed to be an exfoliating sponge. I was pleasantly surprised as my face did feel clean and refreshed. I as happy with this sponge and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> What a great product!</li>
            <li> Great tool for gentle exfoliation of your face.  I have been using it for over two weeks and my skin looks brighter and feels cleaner than just using cleanser with a washcloth. Hangs to dry in the shower, seems durable so far.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a discount on this item to post a review, but I am continuing to use it daily and I plan to purchase some at full price for gifts.</li>
            <li> Tried the sponge twice a day for 4 days now, I like the smoothness it leaves and it did clear a lot of the pregnancy induced redness from my face.  Love that it has its own string to hang from for easy drying.  Downside is the replacing factor package says every 2-3 months to replace and for me personally that is a higher cost than I would usually do for a beauty routine.  If the sponge was all in one use aka you are not buying/using your own cleanser the price would not be as bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many things to cleanse my face but this beats them all. Gentle but very effective and provides great exfoliation!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a gift for my girlfriend.  She has used this product for about a month consistently and has been surprisingly impressed!  She has very sensitive skin so through the years she has utilized numerous products.  She would consider purchasing this product again in the future!</li>
            <li> This not only smells horrible (I have to wash my face a few times after using this to get rid of the smell) but it didn&#x27;t help whatever with my acne. My face didn&#x27;t feel any smoother. I used regular salt (and sea salt or sugar) with olive oil and my face felt much smoother but the sponge did nothing.</li>
            <li> Mild exfoliating sponge, hydrates easily, hangs to dry. Works well with organic gel cleansers. My face, neck and dec feel smooth using this sponge morning and evening.</li>
            <li> This product works great on my skin. I don&#x27;t have or get a lot of acne, but I have oily/dry skin combo also a few blackheads and this helps control some of the shine.</li>
            <li> I had seen these cleansing sponges and want to try, but I was unsure about how my skin would tolerate a new product....I have to say I am very pleased with my results! I have used it every day and my skin feels soft and smooth, it is cleaner and has helped clear my dry patches. Will buy more!!</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and clean after I use this. I have sensitive skin and it isn&#x27;t harsh or irritating.</li>
            <li> This product works great. It was even better then I had anticipated. It has helped my skin in just the one week I have used it I can already see and feel a difference. The only thing is I find it works better if only damp not completely wet because it tends to get a little soggy if you get it too wet and it doesn&#x27;t work as well. Other then that awesome product quick and easy to use with great result what I look for being a mom who doesn&#x27;t have alot of time to spend on herself.</li>
            <li> I have been looking high and low for a gentle and effective was to exfoliate my skin and I am so glad that I have finally found it! This facial sponge is gentle enough not to cause any irritation to my sensitive and acne prone skin while still proving a great exfoliating experience. It&#x27;s like a little face massage every time I use it! I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts recently either, so time will tell but I believe it&#x27;s helping with that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It has a nice little handle so that I can hang it up when I&#x27;m done so it doesn&#x27;t get yucky sitting on the counter. I want to buy one for all my friends, thats how much I love this little thing!</li>
            <li> Works well,  smells funny though.  And the smell stays.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product. I was  a little worried that it would be rough on my sensitive skin, but it was really gentle and exfoliated perfectly. I love that you use it with your own face wash, which is great because I found one that I like so it&#x27;s nice to pair it together.  So far I have no complaints!!</li>
            <li> This is great - I would never have expected this sponge to leave my skin so soft and clean!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this sponge on my face for about a month now and I can definitely see a difference in my complection. My skin is clearer and brighter. I&#x27;m amazed at what this little sponge can do!</li>
            <li> Not a bad little product. Face felt smoother after using, but not sure I would pay full price, but that&#x27;s me. I don&#x27;t spend big money on beauty products. Overall, for the price I paid, I&#x27;ll happily use it.</li>
            <li> I was less than impressed with this cleansing sponge. It does arrived in a dehydrated state and you must wet it down in order to use it as intended. I attempted to use this one time and had to trash the item. It smelled, and after having scrubbed my entire face with it, I had to wash my face again to get rid of the smell. I don&#x27;t know if this is typical or if it was just a one off, but I cannot recommend it based on the one that I received.</li>
            <li> This is such a neat product!  First, it&#x27;s softer than it looks. It is a fantastic make-up remover. I couldn&#x27;t believe how clean it got my face. Plus it makes my skin very soft but it is gentle and not abrasive at all.  I would buy this again. I am going to get a couple for gifts, too.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to try one of these. Im so glad i got ti now. I love the way my face looks and fells after i use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a week now. I got to try it out and test it at a super low prices.  Its OK but I don&#x27;t think I would pay full price for it. I do like how it gets much softer after soaking under warm water, and it does appear to give a better lather on my skin that without using it. I used it with a glycol cleanser that I love.  I have sensitive skin and it didnt irritate my skin at all, I am just not sure of the benefits of this over any other cleansing sponge at this point - maybe i need to keep using longer, will continue to use and see if I get improved results.</li>
            <li> Bought this after several of my beauty loving friends swore by it, and I love it!  Perfect for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> This sponge really does help exfoliate that dead layer of skin. I like how my skin feels scrubbed, but it is not rough or scratchy at all. In fact, I recommend you do not over-saturate it when you first moisten it, but it will eventually dry down to where you want it in a day or three.</li>
            <li> I try this facial  cleansing sponge and it makes my skin soft and removed my deadly skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use this very much but I like that I can use it with my own cleanser and it has made my skin softer</li>
            <li> Wow im really blown away. This is the best konjac sponge ive used to date. It is so soft yet extremely effective. My face feels very clean and smooth.  Since I&#x27;ve been using it, ive also noticed i have fewer breakouts. Its simply amazing!! You need to try it!</li>
            <li> Love it! Really helped clear my skin!!</li>
            <li> Was suprised by this product. Works well and my skin feels super clean afterward.</li>
            <li> allows you to use very little cleanser and wash your skin well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that when it dries the sponge shrinks a little&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;still to see results -just been used twice now</li>
            <li> I love this product, it has done wonders for  my skin.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work well - have only been using it a few days, but it makes my face feel clean!</li>
            <li> Really nice and soft but still exfoliates. It made my skin smooth and soft. You can add your favorite cleanser to the sponge for great results.</li>
            <li> I received the coupon to buy this sponge for $1. I just tried it last night, and I do notice that my skin is extra smooth and would be worth the cost if it truly lasts up to three months. I love that it is all natural, as well. I&#x27;m going to pick some up around Christmastime for stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this at a promotional discount. Which I am excited for because it would not have occurred to me to try it. But, I really like it! It makes my skin feel so smooth after I wash with it. I am not positive, but I think it is decreasing my pore size. It is a great shape for all the various nooks and crannies of a face. It dries well and does not smell.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try one of these sponges because I&#x27;ve read great things about the many benefits they possess. My delivery arrived quicker than expected, which was great. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out! I do have very sensitive skin, and many other products cause my face to become dry or irritated. But I am very impressed with this facial cleansing sponge. My face feels so soft and smooth. no dryness. I love the shape too. makes it easy to exfoliate everywhere. I would absolutely recommend buying this product to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this cleaning sponge is a great help with exfoliation! My skin feels soft and smooth. Great supplement with my regular facial cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Konjac sponge to try on my sensitive skin.  My skin is very sensitive to cleansing products and usually results in breakouts and redness.  I thought I would give this product a try.  I was amazed with the results.  This sponge is supper soft  and did not irritate my skin.  My skin felt clean and soft.  I have been using it for 6 days in a row-twice a day.  I will be buying this again and highly recommend purchasing this product.  Thank you for letting me review this product. It is great,</li>
            <li> A MUST HAVE! I HAVE NEVER FOUND A BETTER PROTECT TO USE WITH MY CLEANSER TO APPLY TO MY SKIN, THAN THIS PRODUCT. THE TEAR-DROPPED SHAPE FACIAL SPOUNGE TRULY IS THE RIGHT SIZE &amp; SHAPE! IT GETS RIGHT UNDER MY EYES IF NEEDED OR THE LARGER AREAS CAN BE USED ON CHEEKS. I LOVE HOW IT IS 100% GENTLE &amp; NATURAL EXFOLIATING. INFUSED WITH BAMBOO AND CHARCOAL TOP THE CAKE FOR ME, MAKING IT A MUST HAVE---EXPOLIATING MY SKIN WHILE REMOVING DEAD CELLS, I TRULY NOTICED A DIFFERENCE IN THE AMOUNT OF BLACK HEADS ON MY FACE AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT. I RECIEVED THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE FOR MY UNBIASED OPINION, AFTER TRIAL, I FEEL ITS AWESOME &amp; I WILL SURELY REORDER!</li>
            <li> So far it is working well and it exfoliates my skin. I love how it has a little string to hang in the shower. I actually prefer using this to my Clarisonic brush.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference in my skin, but it feels good to wash my face with this sponge.</li>
            <li> This product is simply awesome! Simple but yet effective. It make my skin smoother after a using it.</li>
            <li> I got this at discount price for my review.  Well, I used it twice and now have thrown it away.  First, the smell!!! It somehow has unpleasant smell and stinks my bathroom.  And after each use, i don&#x27;t feel any difference. Actually I felt like it didn&#x27;t clean my face at all.  Unless I did it wrong way, this product is waste of money.</li>
            <li> purchased for my husband and he loves it. Typically has oily, breakout prone skin and this clears it right up.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge! The shape makes it easy to hold while you wash your face. My face felt clean and soft after I was done and not dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> I received this sponge 2 days ago and already I can tell a difference in my skin!  It is smoother and clearer after just 2 uses.  I highly recommend this sponge to anyone struggling with dry skin and/or acne!</li>
            <li> I recently went and had a facial and they suggested I do more to my skin than just a daily cleaner, so I bought this facial cleansing sponge. It came hard like a piece of charcaol, but once wet, it is super soft and has been a great addition to my daily routine in the shower. I use it to massage the facial soap all over my face, then hang it from its string.  Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quick, facial cleanser!</li>
            <li> I tried the sponge in the shower this morning after receiving it in the mail yesterday and let me tell you this is an awesome product. Even though I&#x27;ve only used it once my skin was so smooth afterwards. I will definetely be purchasing this again and recommending it to my friends and family. This is worth the money to have clear skin. I did receive a great deal on this to try and even without having a great deal again I would purchase this sponge in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> I really love this sponge! My tired mom to 3 babies face looks and feels so much better. It had been far too long since I had taken care of my skin and since hearing about this sponge from a friend, I&#x27;m really glad I got it. At first it left a funky smell but it has dissipated.</li>
            <li> Loved this product... made my skin feel super soft and it has helped reduce the size of my pores.</li>
            <li> I had the awesome opportunity to review the ClearKonjac Facial Sponge recently.  At first I was a little skeptical at how hard it was to the touch but after reading the easy instructions to run it under water, it became soft and was ready to use.  I used it with my usual cleanser and right away I could tell how clean and smooth my face was.  I liked how it cleaned and exfoliated my skin without being harsh and harming my skin.  The tear drop shape makes it easy to use and the string is useful in hanging it up to dry for the next use. Overall, it works great on my skin.  It&#x27;s a simple yet effective facial sponge that I will be purchasing more of in the near future!</li>
            <li> I LOVE my Konjac sponge, it cleans and exfoliates without damaging my skin. So easy to use.... Highly recommended...</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week now.  My skin already feels smoother with less breakouts.  The sponge is surprisingly soft not scratchy like the other ones.  Only drawback is the cost. ..</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. It&#x27;s working very well. I would love to buy another one very soon.</li>
            <li> This sponge left a noticeable difference on my face. I was pleasantly surprised that it was so gentle, yet so exfoliating. I noticed that the dry skin on my face was gone, and my skin looked clearer after using. I recommend this!</li>
            <li> I really like this sponge, I use it a few times a day and it makes my skin feel great!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for myself, but I ended up giving it to my young teen daughter as her face is showing her age. I can definitely tell when she is using it and when she isn&#x27;t. Her face is more clear of acne when she uses it - it is not a miracle fix it is a great step in the right direction for having an acne clear face. I would highly recommend this product for anyone that wants to gently cleanse their face.</li>
            <li> Just like other reviewers, this arrived and was hard and rough like a rock. I just ran it through some water to soften the sponge and used it right away. It cleanse and leaves the skins feeling soft and smooth. I really like it and would recommend to others!</li>
            <li> Love this sponge! It&#x27;s a product I won&#x27;t go without!</li>
            <li> Worked better then I hoped. I&#x27;m constantly dealing with rough skin. Nothing ever seems to work as well as it says or I hope. This did! I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> My skin was a little red after the first use. I&#x27;m not sure if I was just pressing too hard or what,  but after the following use my skin looked great and is super soft.</li>
            <li> I had this delivered on time and I haved used it and I just love it.  I put my cleanser directly on the sponge and you can feel it working as you are using it.  When I&#x27;m done my face feels so clean and my skin is actually looking better than before I used it.  I was given a discount to give my honest opinion.  Try this you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
            <li> I love it, it work as described!</li>
            <li> I really like the product.  Its gentle on my sensitive skin and leaves my face feeling soft.  It does have a slight odor that I don&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and her acne prone skin it seems to be helping well in the exfoliating process!</li>
            <li> Great product once you figure out how to use it properly :)</li>
            <li> Have only used the sponge a few times, but so far I love it.  My face feels clean and soft after using it.</li>
            <li> I felt my skin is a lot smoother after a few use!!! My face is always sensitive and easy to get irritated but this sponge is so gentle and make my face really clean/smooth without hurting my skin. Love it :)</li>
            <li> Awesome. Have used this for the past week and my skin feels great!!  Can definitely tell a difference in my skin in just a weeks time. Opinion is that of my own and has not been swayed by others..</li>
            <li> Love it!  My face has been so dry lately...this extra step in the mornings makes for much smoother skin.  I would highly recommend this product, as an excellent addition to your regular facial routine.</li>
            <li> It made my face break out worse than it did before I started using this sponge</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with the Konjac sponges.  I really love how porous the sponge is and how well it has lasted in the weeks I have been using it.  I have been using it with an acne face wash and my face has felt softer with improved skin tone.  I will definitely be purchasing these on an ongoing basis!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge is soft and absorbs water to become spongy in a couple minutes. The sponge came with a hanging string which worked perfectly on our razor holder for leaving the sponge in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a high quality konjac sponge and a great deal.</li>
            <li> I love Konjac sponges. they leave my face feeling super clean.</li>
            <li> Upon first receiving the sponge it was very hard and I wasn&#x27;t sure how it was going to work but after getting it wet and letting it sit for a few minutes it softened right up and I was able to use.  I only wash my face with water as we are trying to get away from using unnecessary chemicals and I have pretty normal skin without a ton of issues.  I like the way it provides a gentle exfoliation without being harsh.  It does feel like it leaves my face cleaner than my regular rinses.  When it dries after use it feels like a normal sponge and does not return to the rock hard state.  It also does not have any kind of smell which is nice.  The string attached allows it to hang dry, it seems like it could be a little frail but has not broken yet. Overall I am pleased with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product (at a discounted price) in exchange for my honest review. All opinions stated are that of my own and have in no way been swayed.</li>
            <li> After using this product my skin felt clean and soft.  The small size makes it easy to use.  I have issues with the movement in my fingers.  This product was small enough to use on my face, yet large enough for me to handle.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this, but I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.&lt;br /&gt;My husband said it smelled like nothing.  I said it smelled like mold and mildly skunky scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t dislike it on my skin, it seemed OK.  The jury was still out, but after a few days, the scent was still there and I tossed it.&lt;br /&gt;(disclosure: I was given a discount on this item and bought it for something like $1)</li>
            <li> I like this product. I like the shape and how the string to hang it by goes through a good amount of the sponge, as opposed to a different brand of sponge I tried which ended up breaking where the string went through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that the product helped me A LOT with blackheads, and somewhat with blemishes. I love the gentle, natural exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you exfoliate with this product it makes your face smell like charcoal for a little while. It surprised me at first, but it&#x27;s not a big deal. Also, after being wet, the sponge itself smells pretty strongly of charcoal until dry. Again, no big deal, but while it seems like common knowledge, it surprised me when I walked into my little bathroom that first morning after using it the night before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any break outs since I used it and I enjoy the way it feels. Doesn&#x27;t remove makeup also I got this for my wife I don&#x27;t use make up ima dude.</li>
            <li> Seems like a cool idea to use a natural charcoal infused sponge. You still use face wash with the sponge but on days when I need to scrub my face this helps. You must let it hang dry or it will stink like an old wet rag.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the package, I thought, there is no way I am going to use this on my face. BUT, after I allowed it to absorb warm water, it transformed into a soft yet effect facial sponge. I used to use a washcloth for my face, I now use this sponge!</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this sponge!!! After only a few days using it I saw a BIG difference in my skin. Blemishes diminished...leaves skin smooth and soft! Im hooked!!</li>
            <li> it washes away all the dead skin and leaves your face soft and smooth</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but I was expecting this to be..rougher, I guess? I feel like I would get just as much exfoliation from a wash cloth. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week, so maybe it will end up wowing me, but as of right now, sad to say I was expecting more.</li>
            <li> Works nicely! My skin feels great. My only complaint is that it leaves a faint, odd, earthy odor on my skin. This doesn&#x27;t stop me from using it, though. After I apply my toner and moisturizer, the odor is gone. I recommend this, if you want clean, smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering where this little sponge has been all my life.  The instructions are very clear, the shape and texture are perfect, and it seems fairly durable.  The little string attached for hanging it up is handy.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t *love* is the scent ...it&#x27;s not offensive or terrible, but it is a bit odd and unique.  I&#x27;m used to it now, after a week of using it, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  Overall I love this little sponge, and I will definitely be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! I received it for free to review it, but I will be purchasing it in the future.  My face had some dry or rough areas, but after using the sponge for a few days, my whole face feels smooth and clean.  It&#x27;s so easy to use, the instructions on the package are wonderful.  The customer service is great too.  I received emails from the company to let me know the product shipped, and a few days after to make sure I was enjoying the product and to not hesitate to contact them with questions.  All in all, so great experience with the Premium Konjac Sponge!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! It comes in a package and is very small and hard. You have to hold it under warm water for a few minutes at first and then it turns into this fluffy sponge. There is no smell and its not harsh at all on your skin. I use cetaphil for a facial cleanser and this sponge works SO much better at getting my cleanser to lather and really clean my face! The charcoal brings out the blackheads and other impurities so well! After you first get it wet, it takes seconds to get it ready the next time you use it. My face has been so clear and smooth since I started using this. I refuse to go without it now. Thank you so much for allowing me to test this product for free for review! I am now addicted!!</li>
            <li> Great sponge. Exfoliates my skin well!</li>
            <li> This is such wonderful sponge to exfoliation your skin. The over all look of my skin has improved!</li>
            <li> Love these, bought one for me and one for my teenage daughter.  They really help get makeup off. As other reviewers have noted you must use them wet (or else they are little rocks), they are very lightweight and look and feel a lot like a lava rock, but when you get them wet they get very soft.  The texture against my skin is almost silk-like, very smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this Konjac Facial tear drop shaped sponge cleanses my face.It does a great job at gettng dirt that you can feel but cannot see off.I cleansed my face off really well but manually cleaning it just does not feel 100percent clean to me.After using this natural Konjac sponge I definitely felt and noticed a difference.My face seemed much cleaner and radieant in a way.If you are a first time user of this you have to soak this in water before using.It expands into a nice fluffy soft sponge.When you squeeze the water out you have to press it against your hands and not actually &#x27;squeeze&#x27; with your fingers like you would a sponge or you can damage it.After that you can start cleaning your face with it, it really gets those dead skin cells adn dirt off that you missed when manually washing.The sponge feels great with my skin and I love the tear drop shape.It allows you to really clean in between your eyes &amp; nose crevices with the point part of the sponge.The charcoal in the sponge pulls all the toxins out from your pores which is why I really enjoy using it.Great way to deep clean your face.It is easy to use and easy to maintain the sponge.&lt;br /&gt; Sample was provided for my honest evaluation whether it be positive or negative.All opinons stated are solely my own experiences with this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that I needed a facial cleansing sponge, until I used this product!  It gently exfoliates your skin, and gives it a clean, smooth finish.  I am very excited and very happy to have received this product.  The added charcoal in the sponge that draws out impurities, is an added bonus.  Using this in rotation with my clarisonic, has given me much smoother and nicer skin.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift from a friend who knows I&#x27;m obsessed with cleaning my face - since I use makeup daily. What I love about Clear Konjac is that it&#x27;s all natural and has bamboo and charcoal - which is great for my skin which breaks out if I&#x27;m stressed or too lazy to remove my make-up at night. It comes in a sealed bag and I needed to run the sponge under running water for a minute to make it soft and ready to use. This surprised me the most as initially, the sponge was rock-hard and I was afraid of it being too rough. I tried using it to wash my face together with my regular body shop facial wash - and it was so gentle that I hardly felt the sponge scratching my skin. It&#x27;s just what I need for everyday use. I feel that my skin&#x27;s cleaner when I use my wash with the Clear Konjac. I like that it comes with a string so I can hang it nearly instead of leaving it on the sink which would be quite icky. It&#x27;s been 7 days since I started using it and my skin&#x27;s bumps have cleared up. I also feel that my skin is absorbing my lightening moisturizer better as my acne scars are fading a lot quicker than usual. Super happy that I don&#x27;t have to spend on expensive creams now that I have this sponge!</li>
            <li> I love konjac sponges anyway, but this one works awesomely. I love that it is infused with charcoal to give the already deep cleansing sponge an extra power punch to help eliminate acne. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the size. It is on the very small side, both in thickness and overall size. If it was bigger, I would be sold for life!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a reduced price to give an honeat opinion. My daughter is a teenager with blemished skin and nothing was working. After a week of using this sponge my daughter&#x27;s skin is almost blemish free! Great product!</li>
            <li> I was a little bit skeptical when I got this sponge in. Its rock hard, and seemed as if it may be uncomfortable to use. After reading and following the directions, I added water. It softened right up! Before I had a chance to use it, my teenage daughter stole it from me. She loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like normal teens, she is plagued by pimples and blackheads. She has been routinely using this sponge for a few days, and has already noticed an improvements! He skin has been less oily, and the amount of pimples has decreased far below the amount she typically has. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> Why have I never tried this! My skin feels fantastic. Smooth, clear and clean.</li>
            <li> I love konjac sponges and this one is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried.  My skin always feels so much better after I use this to wash my face.  It really does a great job exfoliating and deep cleaning.  It is infused with bamboo charcoal to really deep clean your pores.  If you have a tough time with break outs I would definitely recommend this as part of your skin care regiment.  Sample provided for testing, evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> Great buy!  Love what it does for my skin!  It isn&#x27;t harsh and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling all dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> Great value - reminds me a lot of the Julep and Boscia konjac sponges with the same quality and a lower price.</li>
            <li> I got the Konjac Sponge for testing and reviewing purposes and I am so thrilled that I got to try this sponge! It&#x27;s one of the easiest skin care product I&#x27;ve ever used! I love that it&#x27;s not harsh on your skin and that it doesn&#x27;t have any weird smells. My skin feels so smooth after using it!&lt;br /&gt;I also really like that it has a string attached to it which makes it easy to hang up and store for the next time you need to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does show up in a little package hard as a rock but once you run it under water for a minute it&#x27;ll be really soft and no it doesn&#x27;t go back to being that hard afterwards, well, as long as you continue to use it. I would highly recommend this facial sponge!! You will NOT regret it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this sponge about 5 times and overall I liked this product. It&#x27;s not too harsh and it feels as though the sponge is helping you get a deep cleaning on your face.</li>
            <li> 3 stars - It&#x27;s OK.  The Konjac Sponge for Facial Cleansing is soft and feels pleasant on the skin. I&#x27;ve been using it every evening for about a week. My skin feels soft afterwards.  However, I&#x27;m not sure I would purchase this product again and certainly not at full price (at this writing approximately $12 on Amazon). I received a discounted price (paid $1) in return for writing a review on Amazon.  To be fair, the sponge is nice - no negative effects. That said the claims of &amp;#34;AMAZING&amp;#34; that are on the packaging are a bit of an exaggeration. Also, the bamboo charcoal is pure marketing gimmick. Yes, it is very popular in Asia (Japan &amp; Korea in particular which are known for advanced skin care). There IS science behind charcoal removing pollutants from environments and skin. However, it has to be in a form where it can slowly absorb the pollutants. In the case of skin care, it makes the most sense in the form of face masks, pore strips, even pillows and clothing. In a sponge --- not so much. Bottom line: Nothing bad about this product except the price tag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far.  I initially thought the sponge would feel rough on my skin, but it doesn&#x27;t.  I washed my face with my normal wash and while I still had the lather on my face I massaged it with the sponge.  It had a very soft feel so I was doubtful I would notice any difference.  I was surprised that afterwards my face felt noticeable smoother!  So with my first use, I give it 5 stars, if that opinion changes for any reason with continued use I will update my review.</li>
            <li> I love this charcoal sponge. So gentle but it is a great exfoliator. I will definitely buy again and recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> I like this sponge it is very soft.  When it came out of the package I was pretty weary about it since it was hard as a rock, but as soon as I got it wet it turned very soft.  I don&#x27;t feel like I am exfoliating enough and i like to feel like im getting all my ghrim off my face.  Overall its not a bad sponge if you are looking for something like that. It does help you save on soap, i put a tiny bit on and its still in the sponge even after I finished washing my face.</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;ve used other sponges much like this in the past and love them. This one is somehow more gentle on my face, which is great because I have the most easily irritated skin in the world. I think it&#x27;s the bamboo that is in the sponge somehow softens the sponge? I don&#x27;t know but love if for my easily irritated skin.  Like the teardrop shape to it as well, it&#x27;s great for nosing into corners of the face! And I seem to able to use it daily without any trouble. That&#x27;s great for me.  I did get this product sent to me to be reviewed, but this is hanging in the shower and used every day. I do love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and have been having bad skin breakouts. I tried the Konjac sponge in hopes I could help clear up my skin. I&#x27;ve inly had it for a short time but I was pleased with how soft it has left my skin. I still have some breakouts but in looking forward to seeing how well the sponge clears it up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Christopher&#x27;s wife, Eden.</li>
            <li> Adjust your thinking on first impressions because the ClearKonjac might seem unassuming coming out of the package, but you&#x27;ll quickly warm up to this lil&#x27; power house sponge. I was a bit skeptical about this rather hard lump that came out of the package...then I added water and like magic it softened up, ready for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the tapered top for getting into the areas next to my nose which has always been a problem area for me with exfoliating. When it comes to exfoliating you run the risk of harsh/course products which make your face red and rough - not an issue with the ClearKonjac sponge, it was the perfect mix of gentle and effective along with being natural not synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you need not worry about the &amp;#34;where do I put it&amp;#34; dilemma I always run into with sponges (i.e. stinky mold in no time) because this inspired design has a build-in string so you can hang it up to dry. After lots of effortlessly cleaning my face is smoother and brighter....and it is still holding up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con for me would be the price, so I&#x27;d order a few to get the volume discount making it more affordable.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge ...the string to hang it by GENIUS</li>
            <li> I love how smooth my skin feels after using it!  I love how gentle and kind it is to my skin!  It doesn&#x27;t have a chemical smell and works like a champ!</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful sponge.  After using this sponge, my face feels so clean and smooth. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I think this is a pretty good product.  I used it a couple of times and it&#x27;s easy.  The shape is nice and manageable.  The only thing I think would be great is for a range of textures.  This product was a little too soft for me so I would have like to have a texture more like a very gentle microdermabrasion for me.  Otherwise, its a good item.</li>
            <li> This little sponge is great, it softens right up when you add water and works great with my cleanser and exfoliates my face nicely. It has a little string to hang it from to dry.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to love this product. I am sure that it is great for some people, but my skin is sensitive to many products. First off, I really don&#x27;t like the musty/sulfury smell it leaves on my face. I can smell it all day after using it. I used it faithfully for 4 days before I made my decision. It caused me to have small breakouts. I like to have clear skin and this did not do that. I am puzzled as to how it works because once you wet it, it does not have any type of abrasive feeling for removing dead skin like it suggests. Felt very soft. I do like the size of the sponge and the string they attach for hanging to dry.</li>
            <li> Very unique, works well with all of my cleanser.</li>
            <li> I already used this since the day i got,,  its like a magic from hard to soft,, so far in two days of  using i work good,, easy to clean. and not hard on the face.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this for my teenage daughters.  They have used it for a week now and like the results.  Nothing fancy just a nice cleaning sponge.  I would however point out that it says several times in the promotion about cutting the harmful chemicals from your routine and then in the directions it says use your daily cleanser.  I think it would be very helpful for this company to team up with a chemical free cleanser company and recommend them with their product.  Otherwise a nice &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice addition to my nightly facial washing routine.  At first I was a bit worried because it comes really hard.  No need to worry though, because just like any sponge, all you need to do it get it wet and it quickly fluffs up and becomes a soft sponge to help exfoliate the extra dead skin.  Nice and easy to use!</li>
            <li> This came to me as a small, hard rock. I was a bit skeptical at first, but after soaking this in warm running water for just a minute it become a soft and more like a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; sponge. I only used just a little bit of my regular cleanser with it (much less than I usually have to) and it worked great. I love the way it makes my skin feel. Nice and soft and it cleanses so well. I did think it had a bit of a charcoal-like smell, but not enough for me to not recommend this sponge. Thank you for letting me test this sponge at a reduced price - I wouldn&#x27;t have tried it normally. But I truly loved it.</li>
            <li> I received a discount code in exchange for a review of this product.  I didn&#x27;t use it at first, so I couldn&#x27;t write a legit review.  When I first started to use it, the humidity was high and stayed that way for almost a month.  The amount of rain that month set records.  It was too humid for my sponge to dry!! Once the weather cleared up, I started using it more often.  Charcoal has been shown to pull out oil, but I&#x27;m not sure how much the charcoal is the sponge helps.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times with an oil cleanser and that seemed to be the best use.&lt;br /&gt;With that said, even though it does seem to make my skin soft-ish, I don&#x27;t think it exfoliates any better than a good washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the shape, feel, and ease of use this sponge provides.  It has lasted a few months without losing it&#x27;s form or sponginess.&lt;br /&gt;While I wonder if it holds in bacteria or not because it&#x27;s a sponge, I have fully enjoyed this product and would buy it again at the right price.</li>
            <li> Wow, I am so impressed with this product! My teenage daughter has significant facial skin issues and has since she was a pre-teen. I am always looking around to find something that will ease her acne and oily skin problems. Sometimes she is reluctant to try new things, but seemed eager to give this a try. We both expected it to be a little rough on her skin because that&#x27;s what it appears like (feels like when dry). It was the exact opposite--very comfortable on the skin, smooth even, yet exfoliates beautifully. She used it with her neutrogena products. She said it leaves her face feeling smoother, cleaner and more refreshed than she can remember ever feeling. It has a nice little string attached to it so you can hang it in a dry place after you gently squeeze it (not wring it out). We are sold on this great product!</li>
            <li> This sponge was surprising great and has changed my beauty routine for the better. Upon unwrapping this item from the shipping package I was pleasantly surprised by the well sealed item and the easy to view instructions on the back for the sponge. Removing the sponge I was frankly not terribly impressed by the tiny,grey,tear drop-ish shaped sponge but thinking back, what was I expecting it is a sponge! After running the sponge in water for a few moments as directed it quickly expanded to a much more appropriate size, texture and shape. This item is scentless and very basic....no guessing required which is a plus! Using this sponge along with my face wash daily has made quite an impressive improvement over the past few days. My skin is naturally pretty oily and this helped me maintain a more matte appearance throughout the day. When they say you skin will feel soft and smooth after using this they are not kidding! My skin has been suffering from numerous areas of patchiness and varying texture and this appears to be evening out my textures a bit. Overall, for the short time that I have had this product it has been much more successful in addressing many of problem areas than other exfoliating scrubs and devices that I have used. This product is great in that I dont have to remember to charge it or create a spot for it among my other face/makeup items. I use this in the shower and hang it by its handy, built in storage/hanging string until the next time. Super easy to use for someone who does not want any complicated routine daily to look great!</li>
            <li> I was asked to provide a review of this product, and at first, I was a little leery, but decided to give it a shot.  It comes packaged dried, so you need to hold it under water for awhile to turn it back into a sponge.  The shape is perfect for holding and using, which I appreciated.  I used it to wash my face while in the shower, and after applying my face wash, I used the sponge as the directions suggested.  It really made my skin super soft and smooth - I was impressed!  It definitely helped my complexion, I felt.  If using face wash is part of your normal routine, this product is definitely the next step!  As I use face wipes as a normal part of my routine, I don&#x27;t see myself using this product as much as I would want to - but it&#x27;s definitely nice to have in case I need it.  Due to the amount I&#x27;d be using this product, was the reason I only gave 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> When I first received the product I thought it was a little pumice stone.  Instead, it&#x27;s a little dehydrated sponge.  It&#x27;s fantastic.  When you receive it, you wet it down and permit it to re-hydrate and then apply a little facial cleanser and use the sponge to exfoliate.  It feels absolutely lovely.  My skin was smooth and glowing and I really liked that I was able to exfoliate with the need for a product with microbeads.  Once finished, you simply rinse it (don&#x27;t wring it) and let it dry and it will be much like it was when you first received it.  I love it.  It&#x27;s like getting a little massage for your face every time you wash.</li>
            <li> This is a great little cleansing sponge for the face and neck.  It comes as a hard little tear drop shaped disc, but once you submerge the sponge in warm water for a minute or two, it fluffs up into a nice size.  It is soft on my skin, but I can tell it is exfoliating and making my cleanser really absorb into my skin and work better.  My face feels refreshed and scrubbed, but not red or blotchy.  Until I researched into finding a better facial sponge, I never really thought about how important it is to have a quality sponge as well as a quality cleanser. I like the fact that this sponge is one hundred percent natural.  I never thought about the fact that I used a plastic sponge to clean my face before.  I never knew there was a better option until now.  I have been using this for a few weeks, and I have not had any breakouts or blackheads so far.  So far, so good !  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like it was doing anything. I tried it several times and always ended up using my regular face wash. I am disappointed of the product.</li>
            <li> I received my konjac facial sponge today and I just used it to clean my face with my face wash.  Its soft on the skin and takes away all the makeup even with using makeup remover prior to washing.  It takes less than a minute to absorb water and turn into a nice big soft sponge (soft but still has some texture to it).  I&#x27;ll love that it has that hanger that you can hang it with and leave it to  dry.</li>
            <li> Works just fine; leaves my skin feeling smooth. Not sure how long it will last, but I like how it makes my skin exfoliate :-)</li>
            <li> As someone that is obsessed with Konjac Facial Sponges I had to get this  Facial Sponge the moment I first saw it!! I wash my face using Konjac Sponges at least twice daily and I love that they are 100% Natural so they are extremely gentle on your skin. This is always a must for me as someone with somewhat sensitive skin. This Konjac Sponge does an excellent job at removing dirt, oils and dead skin cells leaving your skin exfoliated and feeling fresh and clean!! This Sponge is also made of high quality 100% Natural Konjac plant fiber and they are also infused with natural bamboo charcoal, which is highly beneficial with helping trouble prone skin!! I absolutely love this Konjac Sponge by ClearKonjac and I would definitely recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li> ClearKonjac gave me the awesome opportunity to try out this product and I can say without a doubt after several day&#x27;s use, If you are going to buy an affordable new beauty tool anytime soon- make THIS product by ClearKonjac your NEXT score! I was very surprised at how much I ended up liking it :) First impressions was that it was smaller than I&#x27;d imagined and hard as a rock?!? I wondered if I&#x27;d been sent to correct item (lol!), but I had! It turns out, that the first usage requires a little more than just soaking the sponge for a couple of seconds- it took about a minute or so of good soaking under the running faucet in order to get the sponge to &amp;#34;loosen&amp;#34;up and go from hard-as-a-rock to a wonderful softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this concept unique in itself as it definitely had me fooled! Now when the sponge dries out, it doesn&#x27;t go back to the smaller and harder version, but just dries out as a sponge should. After soaking the sponge and getting it to a nice softness and fullness, I was able to apply my cleanser on my face and leave it on my skin as directed. I then took the wet Konjac sponge and used nice, circular motions to cover my entire face and neck areas and I noticed that there was NO smell with the sponge at all either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed right away while I was using this Konjac sponge, was how easy it was to use my cleanser and get it evenly and nicely on my entire face. I really felt like I was getting my face clean and the ergonomic design made it a cinch to use! Once I used on my entire face and neck area, I rinsed out the sponge and used the attached handy string to hang the sponge to dry. After rinsing off my face, I could really feel an immediate difference in smoothness, softness, and texture- and I could SEE it too! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY drawback I really found to using the sponge was that I had to manipulate holding it while applying my cleanser, getting it wet, and also trying to dry it off/hang it up- all while I still had cleanser on my face. I am sure that over time I can get down a better method in order to improve this- or even find (or maybe create my own!) a good holder that&#x27;s nearby to place the sponge on during and after the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With there only being one thing I could really find that was negative about the product, I don&#x27;t really find it something that I can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t deal with; I absolutely love the results of using it and the idea of being able to use an organic beauty product to accomplish something I do every day is super rewarding! I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this Konjac Facial Sponge from ClearKonjac!!!

            <li> We received this product for review purposes for free. It has turned out to be one of the best sponges my wife has used. It is one of the few products that has agreed with her skin and has truly shown an improvement when it comes to her acne.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  Not sure how this little sponge that looks like a scouring pad can be so incredibly soft!  It is the best cleaning tool I have ever used on my face.  Non abrasive but gently and very effectively exfoliates.  My skin looks smooth and shiny clean.  I just purchased several more to give to my daughters and one to pack in my suitcase for my upcoming trip.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> One of the softest sponges I have used for facial cleansing. I typically use a muslin cloth for my daily cleansing routine but find that it can be cumbersome. I have to wash the cloth often. I love the Konjac sponge often and have one by my shower and another by my sink. Interestingly enough, my sponge happen to be slightly softer on one side than the other so I used one side to absorb the soap and the other for exfoliation. My skin feels wonderfully soft and smooth after each cleanse. Simply amazing!</li>
