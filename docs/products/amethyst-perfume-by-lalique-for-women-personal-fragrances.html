            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Amazing smell.</li>
            <li>The drydown is so yummy as I definitley pick up on the musk and the pepper that intermingle with the berries so nicely, it&#x27;s a reminder to me of a spiced fruit pie at Christmas.</li>
            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>just as the body cream...paid for a beautiful bottle, beautiful jar of cream and inauthentic or not properly stored product&#x27;s lacking fragrance in both...</li>
            <li>I have to say that I have a very strong sense of smell</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!</li>
            <li>It is exotic, spicy but not medicinal and no hints of floral or citrus, very clean, warm and inviting fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first in Paris, after feeling the fragrance in a free sample and loved!</li>
            <li>I adore this parfume and so do my admirers :-)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with my Lalique Amethyst 3.3 oz.</li>
            <li>There is a bit of dryness to it, which I like much more than fruity florals you can find all over the place.</li>
            <li>I would classify this as a daytime scent most suited to summer and spring wear, although I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be enjoying it throughout the year.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>and fragnatica.com.&lt;br /&gt;I am in love.</li>
            <li>This has become one of my favorite scents.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with my purchase and will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li>Everyone who smells it love it on me.</li>
            <li>I really love Lalique Amethyst.</li>
            <li>I get soooooooooo many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Lovely packaging</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this fragrance</li>
            <li>I loved the smell at first.</li>
            <li>Worth it though, great scent and great compliments should be expected.</li>
            <li>It is chic, light, fruity and memorable.</li>
            <li>It really smells good and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>It would be easy to do.</li>
            <li>and it can very quick as promised</li>
            <li>A friend first gifted me the product and I instantaneously fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I am a HUGE Jo Malone fan, but at over $100 a bottle, I couldn&#x27;t afford it anymore.  </li>
            <li>At full price this is still worth it and loved by everyone i know who has smelled it, particularly my girlfriend.</li>
            <li>I love the original citrusy fresh smell, but this smells like something super flowery, sweet and cheap.</li>
            <li>It is different and kind of sexy.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not overly sweet at all.</li>
            <li>Silage is a good 12-24 inches and lasting power is about four hours on my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Non, unless the sale ends and you have to pay full price.</li>
            <li>This smelled like sweet pesticide.  </li>
            <li>If you think all those blackberry fragrances aimed at teenagers are too sweet, this might be up your alley.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy its scent..;)</li>
            <li>It is fast becoming one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>I discovered this scent in a Saks or Neimans catalog and was so happy to find the fragrance on Amazon for wayyyy less.</li>
            <li>Men wanna lick me : ) and women wanna bite me ;-) haha</li>
            <li>It smells like fresh berries</li>
            <li>Nice but does not last</li>
            <li>The price is right too.</li>
            <li>The scent lingers too, which I like very much.  </li>
            <li>It smell a little musky and has a very sweet and sexy berry smell.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care for this scent although it is a fresh clean scent but a bit too masculine smelling for me.</li>
            <li>It smells more of alcohol than the actual scent.</li>
            <li>Shipping was swift, and I received exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>My first bottle of Amethyst by Lalique was purchased at a hefty price of over $100 at Neiman Marcus.  </li>
            <li>I first smelt this on a friend of mine ......</li>
            <li>But interesting thing about this item is the smell has been changed suddenly (like an expired perfume).</li>
            <li>There is a hint of a masculine quality that I enjoy so much.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal and at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I found it on Amazon for a whole lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really care for it after I received it.  </li>
            <li>Do not buy this item, the fragrance is completely different from the original one.</li>
            <li>I find Lalique Amethyst to be such a wonderfully unique fragrance</li>
            <li>At first I thought maybe I get used to it, but when my husband and my close friend said the same thing I just realized that I am right.</li>
            <li>Fresh, sensual, reminiscent of home....</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance, not overwhelming very suttle smell.</li>
            <li>I have found over the years that layering your fragrance really makes it last much, much longer.  </li>
            <li>It is a little strong.</li>
            <li>I only gave 4 stars because it does not last a full workday.</li>
            <li>Bought this from Amazon direct.</li>
            <li>help the sweet scent to last a long time.i</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance for a very reasonable price...better than expensive department stores.</li>
            <li>I am now using my second bottle and this is my favorite scent of the past year.</li>
            <li>Large bottle, it will easily last an entire year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i have purchased this product direct from Lalique and it smelled very different.</li>

            <li> i have purchased this product direct from Lalique and it smelled very different.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last for very long.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Lasts long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too heavy for me, but scents are different on people and perceived differently on people, so one cannot take another&#x27;s review to heart.  </li>
            <li> Every single time I wear it I get complimented.</li>
            <li> It is similar to black one, which is for men.</li>
            <li> It is hard to describe something so subtle and unique, I&#x27;ve never come across a scent that parallels Amethyst.  </li>
            <li> Lalique gives you expensive smelling scents at a very reasonable and affordable price!</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the two  negative reviewers from Amazon got when they ordered this perfume, but it couldn&#x27;t possibly have been the same product that the other reviewers and I purchased.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I still had a small amount left when I ordered this bottle from Amazon</li>
            <li> Watered down...</li>
            <li> I got it within a few days.</li>
            <li> Not as subtle as expected.  </li>
            <li> Lalique Amethyst  has a serious, concentrated scent of lilacs with a smoky, mysterious scent of something behind it.  </li>
            <li> They could charge a small amount for it and then credit the buyer if they made a full-product purchase.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to put into words.</li>
            <li> I am sad because the smell used to be irresistible.</li>
            <li> This was a highly disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible ...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> You don&#x27;t find this perfume everywhere. It is the best I ever had and all people talk about as soon as the scent touches them. I got it within a few days. Great !!</li>
            <li> Amazing smell. Lasts long time. Give it a try. Everyone asks &amp;#34;hamm what are you wearing ?, it smells amazing!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The scent is wonderful. I have people asking me all the time what I am wearing and then they go to Amazon to look it up. I Got to smell it in a magazine ad and kept going back to sniff it. Decided I had to have it.  It is a little strong. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this item, the fragrance is completely different from the original one. I love the original citrusy fresh smell, but this smells like something super flowery, sweet and cheap. This was a highly disappointing purchase. Especially since fragrances are not returnable items on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I loved the scent. it is perfect    one of the best perfumes</li>
            <li> lalique amethyst smells great the blackberry,vanilla,blackcurrant,floral bouquet &amp; musk notes in it help the sweet scent to last a long time.i get numerous compliments about it &amp; the viberncy is awesome i will recommend to all my family &amp; friends!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this online. The scent is diluted. It smells more of alcohol than the actual scent. I recommend buying this at the department store. You pay for what you get.</li>
            <li> I adore this parfume and so do my admirers :-)  It fills the room but does not over power the nose and even lingers when you leave the room.  I only gave 4 stars because it does not last a full workday. You will need to re-apply some in the afternoon, so you might as well  keep a bottle at the office. Worth it though, great scent and great compliments should be expected.</li>
            <li> The scent is so beautiful people stop and ask what I am wearing.The price is right too.The only perfume I wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with my Lalique Amethyst 3.3 oz. that I received through Amazon. Shipping was swift, and I received exactly what I was hoping for. I&#x27;m very happy with this transaction! Love, love, love! I find Lalique Amethyst to be such a wonderfully unique fragrance it&#x27;s hard to put into words. I get a wonderful berry freshness, although not like a juicy blackberry. There is a hint of a masculine quality that I enjoy so much. I smell a wonderful development while wearing Amethyst. The drydown is so yummy as I definitley pick up on the musk and the pepper that intermingle with the berries so nicely, it&#x27;s a reminder to me of a spiced fruit pie at Christmas. Fresh, sensual, reminiscent of home.... quite varied feelings I know, but they are all there and this works! May become my current signature fragrance! I just might pick up a second bottle!</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting.  i have purchased this product direct from Lalique and it smelled very different.</li>
            <li> Wifey here. I discovered this scent in a Saks or Neimans catalog and was so happy to find the fragrance on Amazon for wayyyy less. This fragrance is so delicious! It smells like fresh berries but it&#x27;s not overly sweet at all. There is a bit of dryness to it, which I like much more than fruity florals you can find all over the place. Silage is a good 12-24 inches and lasting power is about four hours on my skin. I would classify this as a daytime scent most suited to summer and spring wear, although I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be enjoying it throughout the year. Comes in a giant bottle that will probably outlive me, but if I happen to use it up I&#x27;d be more than happy to buy it again here.</li>
            <li> One of the fragrances I have ever found. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume without testing based on review on basenote.com and fragnatica.com.&lt;br /&gt;I am in love. And the price is very good. It is definitely going to be my signature scent. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am now using my second bottle and this is my favorite scent of the past year. I believe that scents affect our behavior to some degree and this one definitely &amp;#34;makes me happy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This has become one of my favorite scents.  I am a HUGE Jo Malone fan, but at over $100 a bottle, I couldn&#x27;t afford it anymore.  Lalique gives you expensive smelling scents at a very reasonable and affordable price!</li>
            <li> Love it!  It&#x27;s my birthstone.  It&#x27;s a light scent, just perfect.</li>
            <li> Nice smell. Excellent price. Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Try it in stores or smell it on a friend. This is the real deal and at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, looks great, amazing price. Large bottle, it will easily last an entire year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Non, unless the sale ends and you have to pay full price. At full price this is still worth it and loved by everyone i know who has smelled it, particularly my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the two  negative reviewers from Amazon got when they ordered this perfume, but it couldn&#x27;t possibly have been the same product that the other reviewers and I purchased.  My first bottle of Amethyst by Lalique was purchased at a hefty price of over $100 at Neiman Marcus.  I still had a small amount left when I ordered this bottle from Amazon and I&#x27;ve been comparing them now for a week to see if there was any difference.  I have to say that I have a very strong sense of smell and I cannot tell the difference at all.  I will say this, I only buy perfume that has a body lotion or cream of the same fragrance.  I have found over the years that layering your fragrance really makes it last much, much longer.  I have had a number of people stop and ask me what I was wearing.  I am very happy with my purchase and will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> Purchased this initially in Canada, but could not find it once I returned to the States. I was so happy when I found it again. Everyone who smells it love it on me. I use it sparingly, but it will soon be time to reorder.</li>
            <li> I bought my first in Paris, after feeling the fragrance in a free sample and loved! It is chic, light, fruity and memorable. makes you want to eat it!</li>
            <li> Horrible ... Watered down...does not smell&lt;br /&gt;Anything like the NM Catalog I sniffed of&lt;br /&gt;The amethyst perfume..</li>
            <li> This was not the Amethyst I purchased at Neimans.  This smelled like sweet pesticide.  Total waste of money.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> For those days or nights when you want a heavier scent.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful scent-received compliments.</li>
            <li> I really love Lalique Amethyst. I have purchased in the store and I found it on Amazon for a whole lot cheaper. It smell a little musky and has a very sweet and sexy berry smell. The only problem is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last for very long.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant smelling perfume that I bought for my wife. She loves it and will repurchase again. Bought this from Amazon direct.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this scent although it is a fresh clean scent but a bit too masculine smelling for me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for it after I received it.  It&#x27;s a bit too heavy for me, but scents are different on people and perceived differently on people, so one cannot take another&#x27;s review to heart.  I wish purveyors would send out a sample of a scent before one buys.  It would be easy to do. They could charge a small amount for it and then credit the buyer if they made a full-product purchase.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. I also enjoy its scent..;)</li>
            <li> bought for my sister, who loves this stuff. Good price, came as-advertised in a timely way. It&#x27;s got a berry scent to it, but not in a candyfloss-sweet way. If you think all those blackberry fragrances aimed at teenagers are too sweet, this might be up your alley.</li>
            <li> Not as subtle as expected.  From the sample, I anticipated a &amp;#34;blackberry cobbler meets vanilla&amp;#34; scent.  I no longer wear it.</li>
            <li> I recently forgot my aftershave when we traveled..yes you guessed it I used Amethyst Lalique and received several compliments on it. Yum</li>
            <li> Excellent gift for my girlfriend without being one of her favorite perfume. Good product, good service from amazon on delivery.</li>
            <li> I first smelt this on a friend of mine ......then to find out the name was the same as my birthstone, I just had to get me one. It really smells good and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance for a very reasonable price...better than expensive department stores.</li>
            <li> Nice but does not last</li>
            <li> No fragrance st all...just as the body cream...paid for a beautiful bottle, beautiful jar of cream and inauthentic or not properly stored product&#x27;s lacking fragrance in both...</li>
            <li> Lalique Amethyst  has a serious, concentrated scent of lilacs with a smoky, mysterious scent of something behind it.  It is different and kind of sexy.  The scent lingers too, which I like very much.  It is fast becoming one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!! I get soooooooooo many compliments on it. Men wanna lick me : ) and women wanna bite me ;-) haha</li>
            <li> Light and delicious scent. Great for summer.  It doesn&#x27;t last very long. Lovely packaging and it can very quick as promised</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance</li>
            <li> I bought it about 2 month ago and just opened it about one week ago. I loved the smell at first. It is similar to black one, which is for men. But interesting thing about this item is the smell has been changed suddenly (like an expired perfume). At first I thought maybe I get used to it, but when my husband and my close friend said the same thing I just realized that I am right. I am sad because the smell used to be irresistible.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, not overwhelming very suttle smell.</li>
            <li> It is hard to describe something so subtle and unique, I&#x27;ve never come across a scent that parallels Amethyst.  A friend first gifted me the product and I instantaneously fell in love with it.  It is exotic, spicy but not medicinal and no hints of floral or citrus, very clean, warm and inviting fragrance.  Every single time I wear it I get complimented.</li>
