            <li> Helped prevent the heat rash I get in the summer.</li>
            <li> After 2 years in nursing school - well, just imagine.  This &amp;#34;itch&amp;#34; included excoriation - but two days of BAZA cleared it up - no itch, and the welt is going away as well.  A very good product!!</li>
            <li> When all else fails, this product is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what they use at wound care it works as advertised .</li>
            <li> Works well, good price.</li>
            <li> Best stuff out there for fungal or yeast infection on feet groin or other external skin. Apply twice a day. For at least a week. You will see a big difference. Better than the top brands you get at the store. Plus it moisturizes your skin.</li>
