            <li>These pills were amazing...</li>

            <li>I have more energy through the day &amp; feel good.</li>
            <li>I tried this product and it seems that it works nicely and effectively but needs to wait some times to get the result you are looking for nice product and recommended</li>
            <li>I find this product to be effective.</li>
            <li>But I will still continue to take them because I am thrilled with the results I have had.</li>
            <li>Over all I like this product, It gave my bursts of energy, but not the jittery kind.</li>

            <li>They are my new best friend!</li>
            <li>I am delighted with this product and give it a strong recommendation.</li>
            <li>find that&#x27;s a very good result, considering that I didn&#x27;t do much changes in my diet and life</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay with my own money.. used an Amazon gift card.</li>
            <li>Well, my honest opinion is that I love the Raspberry Ketone Platinum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m three week into my testing and so far I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li>Of all the Raspberry Ketone products out there, I feel this is the best, and now I have my own personal proof.</li>
            <li>It increasing becomes more and more effective as you take them.</li>
            <li>Awesome seller, with super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The product was shipped quick and was a good price.</li>
            <li>even greater results.</li>
            <li>AND I DO FEEL MORE ENERGETIC.</li>
            <li>Ok, So, I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and have been on diets most of my life since I was</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t been able to lose weight with any over the counter meds.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have more energy like I want to do more.</li>
            <li>I began taking this product about 2 months ago, I can say i have much more energy</li>
            <li>I feel more motivated in the gym</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also making it a point to get more exercise.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my dietary changes have impacted him because I do all the cooking.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the product solely on hearsay and Amazon reviews, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my decision.</li>
            <li>but my clothes are fitting better and my stomach has gotten flatter.</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>but sure it takes awhile for it to get into my system.</li>
            <li>You will not be able to eat 15lbs of chocolate a day and lose weight.</li>
            <li>and I was glad that it was working so well.</li>
            <li>It gives me outstanding energy and keeps me motivated on my tasks throughout my day.</li>
            <li>I give this product 5 stars, because the price is fair, and it delivers powerful results.  </li>
            <li>I love that it does smell and taste like raspberries</li>
            <li>I have noticed a loss of inches more so than pounds.</li>
            <li>I take one when I wake up and seem to have more energy and one before each meal.</li>
            <li>and I have been able to lose about 16 pounds on it.</li>
            <li>and I noticed that it works better the longer</li>
            <li>I am losing more every week.</li>
            <li>I noticed that I feel more awake during the day</li>
            <li>I sure wish it worked.</li>
            <li>No side effects, increased energy, and better motivation to keep going in the gym.</li>
            <li>what so ever if anything I am eating MORE.</li>
            <li>as you might guess, it is very hurtful and can lower your confidense greatly.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to get better results.</li>
            <li>I had heard a lot about this product but wasn&#x27;t really sure if it would work or not.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love my Raspberry Ketones Platinum.  </li>
            <li>In conclusion, I do feel these pills have influenced my appetite for sure and for that alone</li>
            <li>I love Insanity</li>
            <li>It took two weeks to see any visual results, but they are working great!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still inclined to give the product the benefit of the doubt - maybe it WOULD work on people who have to lose more.</li>
            <li>Over all I am quite pleased and would recommend this product to another customer.</li>
            <li>These are just a lot better for your body and no additional chemicals are in the pill except for the gelatin caseing its in.</li>
            <li>I eat fairly healthy, greens, pasta, fruits and meats.</li>
            <li>and she noticed that she has reduced her weight by 2 pounds in 2 weeks which is still better than gaining more weight.</li>
            <li>She also feels like she&#x27;s more energetic now.</li>
            <li>and I felt like I was burning more calories during my workout.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I love the results I have seen and I will continue to support the benefits from using this product.</li>
            <li>Im looking forward to more results.</li>
            <li>Once I stoped I felt better.</li>
            <li>but I was missirable most of the time.</li>
            <li>I tried another brand of raspberry ketone, but this one is much better-</li>
            <li>Just love the product</li>
            <li>I took them for a week and the longer I took them, the more nervous I got.  </li>
            <li>I did Medi Weight Loss and was able to drop another 25 lbs and once again, was at a standstill.</li>
            <li>Love this product and will continue to purchase more.</li>
            <li>There are no side effects, I have more energy, and I&#x27;ve lost weight and inches a lot faster than just working out alone.  </li>
            <li>and I have a lot more energy.</li>
            <li>Both parties thought it was more hype than substance.</li>
            <li>mode and is working more efficiently.  </li>
            <li>However, I am really glad I did.</li>
            <li>I am pleased :)</li>
            <li>I found this product after hearing about raspberry ketone and its role in weight loss, and although I was hesitant to purchase yet another weight-loss supplement, I am SO GLAD I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, some of which are advertised on TV.</li>
            <li>The latest I took them was 5 pm though.</li>
            <li>I feel much more energetic with this product.  </li>
            <li>If this can help me stop my night snack, I am confident this will result in weight loss.</li>
            <li>I love that this product helps to curb my appetite in the morning, afternoon and evening.</li>
            <li>:) I definately would recommend these pills.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using these for sure.</li>
            <li>Granted I haven&#x27;t lost as much as most people did</li>
            <li>And don&#x27;t cheap out and buy the non-clinical strength versions and expect amazing results.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to take 2 day (per instructions).</li>
            <li>Pleased with the results.</li>

            <li>&gt;&gt; between meals and feel a bit more energetic,more by just my change in diet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend any one looking for a better product to give this one a try, I&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the energy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure no harm...</li>
            <li>It has deinitely helped with portion control and food cravings- even with raging pms :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see more progress with additional use!</li>
            <li>I read a lot about this product but wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work for me.</li>
            <li>My legs looked more toned!!!&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>Luck :)</li>
            <li>but I will still take them and push myself to exercise more.</li>
            <li>Anyway I feel better and much more energized.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great working weight loss supplement.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the outcome of using this product and will continue to use it as long</li>
            <li>Pretty good lost 25pd</li>
            <li>My experience has been pretty good with the product.  </li>
            <li>Many of my friends had suggested that I give this product a try and the reviews of this specific brand looked very good, so I placed my opening order.</li>
            <li>I can stay away from sweets and junk food much more easily.</li>
            <li>This allows me to more easily stick to a calorie restricted diet.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no longer waiting for that healthy choice as I feel more free to eat practically anything in sequence with this pill.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the good results and lack of negative side effects.</li>
            <li>Great so far!</li>
            <li>I am on day 5 now and feel great and have lost 2lbs so far.!</li>
            <li>I wonder how many of these reviews are genuine.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly I have not changed my diet</li>
            <li>This product answers that problem for me and lets me eats more freely as it blocks the fat content in the food.</li>
            <li>My clothes fit a bit better and i will continue to take these.</li>
            <li>Best money I have ever spent on any sort of supplement.</li>
            <li>After being able to workout and exercise again, I was able to lose 25lbs easily on my own, but I&#x27;m not allowed to workout as intensely as I used to and &#x27;hit a wall&#x27;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am going to try and bump it up to the recommended two pills per day dosage, but so far I&#x27;m really happy.  </li>
            <li>My clothes fit better, my face looks thinner and exercise</li>
            <li>If my pants fit better, then I&#x27;m doing</li>
            <li>I rated them 4 star because they do what they say, and you don&#x27;t feel as hungry and it will let you know when you are full!</li>
            <li>I have recommended the product to many co workers who are also excited to start the supplement  Hurray for Raspberry Ketone</li>
            <li>The other wonderful thing is no side effects!!</li>
            <li>RECEIVED EVERYTHING VERY QUICK.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product with the Nature Wise Green Coffee Bean Extract with GCA for about a month now with great results.</li>
            <li>Its easy to take</li>
            <li>They have no taste, no smell, and can be easily swallowed.</li>
            <li>I recieved this very quickly, I have used it for a week &amp; have already lost 7 lbs.</li>
            <li>These pills are 600mg so its as strong as it gets.</li>
            <li>So far so good, I&#x27;ll update with more results.</li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s way too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>They are quite strong.</li>
            <li>The first thing I felt after taking these was a nice surge of energy.</li>
            <li>It has helped my weight loss by curbing my appetite and helping me feel full most of the time.</li>
            <li>sure to drink full glass of water</li>
            <li>and you will feel more full</li>
            <li>but I feel more full after I eat</li>
            <li>I thought i would have better results if I followed through w/ the full 2 months</li>
            <li>I leave the restaurants full and satisfied, so everything is fine.</li>
            <li>Also, I have tried 3 other brands of Raspberry Ketone and this one is clearly the most effective and the best!  </li>
            <li>But after taking them I was very surprised the result was as good as the pills</li>
            <li>/&gt;The pills are powerful and super effective and once you start to see yourself lose 10 pounds in just a week</li>
            <li>my friends are super excited w. the results!</li>
            <li>and I see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>All the products worked to &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; degree, but the potency and quality of the brand also makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Losing my appetite is absolutely HUGE for me.</li>
            <li>This is much stronger and the stuff really works great.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use the product in order to get to the weight I am comfortable</li>
            <li>have recommended it to many people friends and family, and they like the effects too!&lt;br /&gt;well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic</li>
            <li>I have been looking for some genuine raspberry keytones for some time now to lose the weight gained from antidepressants.</li>
            <li>and I combined this with the Raspberry Ketone Platinum and have had fabulous results.  </li>
            <li>But overall its a great weight loss aid.  </li>
            <li>and I can see why this one has gotten such great reviews.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several months and it works great</li>
            <li>I looked at all of the products available and selected this one because it was billed as Clinical Strength.  </li>
            <li>but I know what an important part of my decision making they are</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I just started taking this product and so far, it&#x27;s good...</li>
            <li>but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>And i really think after a month it will be even better, then I will write more.</li>
            <li>So far, So good - I have been taking these for about a week.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t lost so much so quickly and easily since I was in my 30&#x27;s .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>best part is I don&#x27;t feel jittery at all after taking this the first thing in the morning on empty stomach and have loads of energy for my workouts.</li>
            <li>They are super easy to take and being a Type 1 diabetic, they have no adverse effects on my blood sugars.</li>
            <li>Along with all supplements diet is a huge part in weight loss, so If you are doing that and are also taking these pills the weight will come right off!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m SOO excited.  </li>
            <li>My husband has noticed a significant decrease in appetite.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>Excited to see the end result after using this for a while.</li>
            <li>i am so excited.</li>
            <li>Am excited to continue using the Raspberry Ketones.</li>
            <li>After taking as directed for over a month, I have not seen any significant drop in weight or decrease in belly fat as this product claims.</li>
            <li>I was excited to learn of the product.  </li>
            <li>They are well worth the price!</li>
            <li>&gt; the best of all I have tried over the past year.</li>
            <li>I am not angry because I was the &amp;#34;Guinea Pig&amp;#34; for many of my friends as to whether this product works and</li>
            <li>Already during the first weeks I was able to notice an effect and lost some pounds.</li>
            <li>What really has impressed me about the product is I loose even when I over eat during holidays and special occasions.  </li>
            <li>Simply the best Ketone I tried so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s best to take it upon waking, and mid to early afternoon.  </li>
            <li>are amazing so far!</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you want to loose weight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many diet products in the last 15 years and found this product ranks one of the highest in the ability to help me loose weight and feel good about myself!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too soon to rate the effect but being pure where many brands have additives I chose this brand.  </li>
            <li>I will test this product and its results thoroughly and report my positive findings to others who seek assistance in losing weight quickly and safely.</li>
            <li>When I do eat I find myself getting full faster than before.</li>
            <li>The weight is coming off slowly which is the best way.</li>
            <li>so you have to add a good workout routine and diet to your daily activities.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t completely sure if taking this product was really benefiting me...until I stopped.  </li>
            <li>well and exercise to get the full effects.  </li>
            <li>She still eats the food she likes but she feels that she gets full faster</li>
            <li>Koreans for the most part, are very thorough in their research.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen any weight loss, but definitely have good energy.</li>
            <li>I never have been a chocolate or sweet eating person just food loaded with calories and fat.</li>
            <li>I eat fairly healthy, lots of fruits, veggies, whole grains, etc.  </li>

            <li>Taking this, eating healthier and daily exercise has made me feel a lot better!</li>
            <li>Even after you reach your target weight or BMI, it is even more important to keep them, so “long term” is also important.</li>
            <li>Be aware that they affect your liver!</li>
            <li>I kind of think this is a scam with no scientific proof or clinical trials, and we are the little with mice:)</li>
            <li>the morning and one in the afternoon and amazingly, hunger is the last thing that comes to my mind.</li>
            <li>I have heard such amazing things about this raspberry ketone.</li>
            <li>I have been able to lose 24 lbs so far</li>
            <li>I have been able to lose 12 pounds with this product so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just started using this product and so far I love it.  </li>
            <li>even if I do not see any weight loss or more inches lost, I will continue for the natural energy.</li>
            <li>Raspberry Ketones from these guys are my best friend and secret weapon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also felt I was able to really push through an intense workout easier than before.</li>
            <li>All items fresh and sealed.</li>
            <li>love the natural energy.  </li>
            <li>Consequently, I loss most of my sculpted muscles and what developed was &amp;#34;bunches&amp;#34; in my thighs that looked like someone had poured globs of fat into a sack (my thigh).  </li>
            <li>From other peoples comments make sure you use this 1/2 hour before eating to get the most effect from it.  </li>
            <li>I was  convinced that she was making a wise choice; due to my lack of knowledge of this product.  </li>
            <li>Right now I am taking two pills a day.</li>
            <li>(you know you&#x27;re getting the right concentration of Ketone)</li>
            <li>I take the recommend amount of 1 pill right as I get out of bed and one 30 minutes before lunch.</li>
            <li>My biggest weight loss problem is finding the time to eat right.</li>
            <li>Yes, you read that right.</li>
            <li>Do it the right way and you will have results.</li>
            <li>started by taking one pill right when I wake up (5:30 AM)</li>
            <li>I take 1 right after I wake up</li>
            <li>it was fast shipping and a GREAT product, in 7 days I lost 7 pounds and still going down.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product, I highly recommend to all!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I feel more energetic and am eating less.</li>
            <li>Have had great results with raspberry ketones in the past.  </li>
            <li>It is still too early for me to know if it will continue, but I will let you know my results later, good or bad.&lt;br /&gt;Jack</li>
            <li>After trying other Raspberry Ketone products  and having some effect, I decided to try this brand because it is stronger and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and exactly as described!  </li>
            <li>First week I lost 7 pounds with no change in diet.</li>
            <li>I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN LOSING WEIGHT OR JUST FEELING HEALTHIER.</li>
            <li>ALMOST FINISHED MY FIRST BOTTLE OF RASPBERRY KETONE.</li>
            <li>would definitely buy this stuff again :)</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase more when done with my bottles.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I take one capsule first thing in the morning</li>
            <li>At first I was upset because it was capsules, not pills.</li>
            <li>I take one first thing in the morning</li>
            <li>/&gt;These obviously aren&#x27;t magic</li>
            <li>It also has done great a job at suppressing my appetite and helping my with those late afternoon cravings.</li>
            <li>First thing in the morning I take 1 pill</li>
            <li>I only started with one pill a day to make sure it agreed with me.</li>
            <li>I did this for a total of 3 weeks just to make sure.  </li>
            <li>I think 500mg and higher with a &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; version is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products over the last 2 years none proving to help me lose the weight I was looking to.</li>
            <li>After the first week of using the product I had begun to lose weight.</li>
            <li>But then I decided, since I have to take thyroid medicine first thing in the morning, I would start taking 1 before lunch and 1 before dinner....</li>
            <li>so I think this product is working pretty well.</li>
            <li>I like the convenience of taking it first of all</li>
            <li>have lost 5-6 pounds in the first month while taking this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks,</li>
            <li>I have lost 5 pounds and my daughter has lost 10 pounds after the first bottle.  </li>
            <li>I expect that I will experience more weight loss as I increase my physical activity.</li>
            <li>I took it first thing in the morning and again before lunch.</li>
            <li>I participate two hours a week in cardio exercise &amp; eat a pretty well balanced diet.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>At first two weeks, it did nothing</li>
            <li>After the first bottle, I lost 8 pounds.</li>
            <li>I first heard about this product on Dr. Oz and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I continue to work-out regularly and eat healthy.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Lost one pound the first two days so will keep taking.  </li>
            <li>As others have stated, the pills do not provide miraculous results, but can definitely aid with weight loss, particulary when used with a healthy diet.</li>
            <li>- I was more worried about possible side effects of feeling jittery or nervous.</li>
            <li>first heard about Raspberry Ketones and its effect through the Dr. Oz show and was intrigued, so I began researching.</li>
            <li>My appetite has lessened, I&#x27;m in a much better mood almost always, my sleep has improved, and lastly, the numbers just keep dropping.</li>
            <li>It may do more for you especially if you workout as I must say I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Overall, I recommend this product and will continue to use it till I reach my goal of 20 lb :)</li>
            <li>I lost 4 pounds in the first week</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing for me!</li>
            <li>Was really hoping that this would work but for some reason it didn&#x27;t do a thing for me!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>I combined it with a low cal diet and more exercise</li>
            <li>I took, 1 pill, first thing in the morning with 8oz of water.</li>
            <li>And I didn&#x27;t lose a pound and I am avid gym rat.</li>
            <li>Within the first week of taking the ketones I dropped 3lbs.  </li>
            <li>No poor feelings, just lots of energy!</li>
            <li>always starving when I first wake up)then</li>
            <li>I lost 4 lbs in the first week.</li>
            <li>I am now going to my second bottle, I haven&#x27;t lost much more yet</li>
            <li>but, since I&#x27;m a positive person - I&#x27;ll give the product another chance and keep using until the first bottle will be finished.</li>
            <li>The pills also gave me some heartburn and a feeling of being full (the \\&quot;I overate\\&quot; kind of full), which was not pleasant at all.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results I have not experienced any side effects like jitters or increased heart rate, I have a more attuned mental focus and a lot more energy to help me power through my workout.</li>
            <li>/&gt;If does give you more energy and helps me to eat less and feel full.  </li>
            <li>Works really well lost 5 lbs in first week.</li>
            <li>I was very thirsty during the first couple of weeks</li>
            <li>A year and a half prior to taking the Raspberry Ketones, I had done 3 rounds of the HcG diet (pregnancy hormone/500 calories), with great results - weight loss and sculpted muscles - for the first two rounds.  </li>
            <li>Again, safe, high and timely dosage is the key, and this product meets all my criteria.</li>
            <li>I tend to easily get dizzy from medication, so this is definitely a plus!</li>
            <li>easy to get into shape using these simple steps.</li>
            <li>I like the easy to swallow capsules and the lasting effects produce by the fat burning formula.</li>
            <li>So far so good, i  notice my appetite going down and combined with exercise I&#x27;ve seen a lost in weight.</li>
            <li>Started using this product on March 1, was very hopeful from all the positive feedback found all over the Internet.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical reading up on this new craze but have been impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>I hope that I will loose more weight</li>
            <li>I know it helped me loose more because my weight dropped slower without the pills.</li>
            <li>I received the product right away, I just started using them and like it so far!  </li>
            <li>I do not feel as hungry and have noticed that I seem to have a higher energy level too, which has made it easier to avoid eating as much and helps with being more active.</li>
            <li>Everything fits better than last summer, I lost my little “muffin top” and my stomach is flat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I noticed in just a few days that I had a great amounts of extra energy.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t lost much weight</li>
            <li>This product is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>everyone wants.</li>
            <li>I have to remind myself to eat because I never seem to be hungry as much anymore.</li>
            <li>Now, not so much.</li>
            <li>, I feel it is definitely a gentle weight loss solution.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very affordable when you are running low.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have not seen much results.</li>
            <li>I am a stay at home mother of two who doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of me time.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything for weight loss.</li>
            <li>thanks....</li>
            <li>Thanks for the opportunity to try this for this cost.</li>
            <li>You can find me on facebook for proof that I&#x27;m real.  </li>
            <li>My appetite has decreased a great deal.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li>which is really a lot for me.</li>
            <li>They seem to really help when I slip off my diet; keep me where I was before pigging out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try them.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 5 stars because it really worked on me...</li>
            <li>Including these with my cardio and strength workouts, showing fast results.</li>
            <li>and then it really does what it promises which to increase one&#x27;s metabollism.  </li>
            <li>it is a real appetite suppressant and energy enhancer.</li>
            <li>I stick with whole grains and lean protein for dinner.</li>
            <li>It has really helped me to burn off fat.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really been doing any formal exercise, just trying to park farther away, etc.</li>
            <li>With what I have read limiting carbs and giving your body lean protein helps burn fat and this product really increases the effect.  </li>
            <li>I am feeling a difference in metabolism and my hunger is not as much.</li>
            <li>I lost fifteen pounds during November despite Thanksgiving and really believe this product helps my metabolism.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much, and I look forward to losing another 20 lbs with your help.</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t like the jittery feeling because it was too much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It actually really works.</li>
            <li>You really do need the 600mg to see a difference.</li>
            <li>My weight loss and fitness proceed sometimes fast</li>

            <li>For people who want fast results, like me, it is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I heard about this product and ordered it not expecting much .This</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This product by far has the most grams of actual ketone ingredient.</li>
            <li>Okay so I am 15 years old and female.</li>
            <li>I love that I now get more tired at night.</li>
            <li>My appetite definitely went down pretty good.  </li>
            <li>My appetite is much less than it was before taking these, and I feel like I am more alert and have more energy than I have in a long time.!</li>
            <li>Compared to other similar products, the price is also good.</li>
            <li>I finished both bottles for good measure and still did not see results other than those from proper nutrition and exercise.</li>
            <li>Generally, with good diet and lots of exercise I can only lose about 1 pound a week, so these have definitely helped!</li>
            <li>I do exercise 2-3 times a week and eat a low carb diet - but I&#x27;m very impressed and have already ordered my second round!  </li>
            <li>Reading up on products like this and hearing that they normally come with these types of effects was a little nerve racking, so it was nice to be using one that did not.</li>
            <li>I was so excited and stoked to receive this product in the mail, hoping it&#x27;ll change my life instantly.  </li>
            <li>Raspberry Ketone Platinum is the little extra boost I need to help me be successful in my weight loss.</li>
            <li>After trying other weight loss products this one was reccommended to me and i am so glad it was.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t eating as much and with a steady workout routine</li>
            <li>I eat relatively healthy, exercise actively about twice a week, and weigh around 125 lbs now, after stopping the pills.</li>
            <li>The energy helps me stay more active and workout.</li>
            <li>I am a member of the Armed Forces so weight control is always important and sometimes you need a quick way to drop a few pounds.</li>
            <li>I also took longer walks, only about 2.5 miles half of that is up hills(thats good for me for now).</li>
            <li>I take the recommended amount  of 1 pill upon waking up with a full glass of water and one before lunch in the same manner.</li>
            <li>They are much purer and stronger than the others resulting in less hunger pains and more steady loss of weight and fat.</li>
            <li>style.&lt;br /&gt;I can say that so far I am very satisfies with the results!</li>
            <li>I waited until I completed a full 30 day bottle of this product because I know that it takes at least that long to see results... to be fair.</li>
            <li>and you will lose like 20lbs in a month..not true for me but enough for me to keep trying.</li>
            <li>Because I track my daily weight &amp; body fat on a digital WiFi Scale and track my daily activity on a WiFi body monitor I am in a pretty good position to see if this really makes any difference in my general weight loss &amp;#34;Slope&amp;#34; on my monthly graph.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a burst of energy but last week was the first time in months that instead of walking for exercise, I am now running!</li>
            <li>I have noticed less headaches and also more appetite.</li>
            <li>I am drinking more water and feel less hungry.  </li>
            <li>and i have also not only passed my plateau but lost an extra 4 pounds on top of that.</li>
            <li>I suggest just eating smaller meals, muuuuch smaller and eat more veggies. :</li>
            <li>I have been on weight watchers for almost one year and had been steadily losing weight until about Feb.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this Raspberry Ketone product and will order again before my supplies run low.</li>
            <li>I would highly refer anyone looking to lose weight to give this product</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t meet the highly expectations....</li>
            <li>Then I began experiencing headaches and high anxiety.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend trying this product to assist in your weight loss efforts.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I high hopes for this product</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product and will highly recommend it to all my friends.  </li>
            <li>high concentration, 3.</li>
            <li>After doing additional&lt;br /&gt;&gt; research on Raspberry Ketone&#x27;s the importance of having high grade clinical&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly reccemmended</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who is wanting to lose weight and looking for a little more energy.</li>
            <li>I just feel a little better,</li>
            <li>I would suggest to up the dose for those of you who have more to lose and work out a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>For the first few days I didn&#x27;t notice any weight loss, but that was fine</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical about using this product at first, mainly because once something has become popular cheap versions of it are distributed</li>
            <li>And even better, my fiance has noticed a slimmer waist since it has gone down 1 1/2 inches!  </li>
            <li>I have been busy to get in as much exercise as I would like, but I can already see an increase in weight loss.</li>
            <li>Will continue to take it and see what the result will be in a few more months.</li>
            <li>Curves your appetite and you can&#x27;t eat the portions you normally consume&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>No negative side effects.</li>
            <li>only downside is I am still on the Guaifenesin protocol for Fibromyalgia, it worked great for a long time, after a couple months on this product I am starting to get some symptoms back and</li>
            <li>I used these for a while, they help you reduce a few pounds like most things, but after that they didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
            <li>I started drinking healthy shakes in the morning, preceded by the raspberry ketones and a green tea supplement.</li>
            <li>Normally, with exercise, I could lose about 2 lbs.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally suffer from an acid stomach</li>
            <li>On my normal days where I exercised and watched my calorie intake, I lost lbs.</li>
            <li>I am giving these pills more time but as of now, taking together with the Green Coffee Bean, I have had no results.</li>
            <li>strength is the key to the success of taking this product.</li>
            <li>don’t normally leave feedbacks</li>
            <li>I wasn’t as hungry during the day as I normally would&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>and so far I&#x27;m down 2 pant sizes and weighed in today at an astonishing 175.6 lbs.</li>
            <li>These three conditions allow us to take high and timely dosage for long term, which is the key to enjoy the full potential of raspberry ketone.</li>
            <li>and therefore my body absorbs the fat content like a sponge because I dumbly waited too long in between my meals (mostly because I prefer to wait and eat healthy and healthy choices are never easy to find).</li>
            <li>but after I pluto it goes right back on in time.</li>
            <li>If you exercise and eat right while taking this you will see results sooner than later!</li>
            <li>My wife and I are getting ready for several endurance events and this product is showing positive results combined with our mindful lifestyle choices - it&#x27;s not all in a pill</li>
            <li>It is definitely not easy I eat as healthy as I can and go to the gym 6 days a week.</li>
            <li>but as with anything, a little effort goes a long way when you have such a great helper.  </li>
            <li>I am NOT interested in quick weight loss programs, but more of the 1 pound a week on average sort.</li>
            <li>As long as you are keeping yourself active then it will show nice results.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have the energy boost of other products like thermogenics, but the appetite suppression is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Im always trying something new to lose weight.</li>
            <li>Very Natural product.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to caffeine and never drink it or take it any form.  </li>
            <li>I have tried 5 other various diet solutions, most of them either leaving me with the shakes or increased heart rate some with no effects at all never lost a pound.</li>
            <li>I began taking it shortly after I received my first bottle.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I lost about 3 lbs in the first week and 2 every following week.</li>
            <li>I took the first bottle and started the second one.</li>
            <li>I exercise more than usual, 2)</li>
            <li>I am definitely going to continue to take this and recommending it to my sister!&lt;br /&gt;PS: shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>I saw no change for the first two weeks taking only ONE pill in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I started researching about raspberry ketones few months ago and zeroed on this product as this was the only clinical strength raspberry ketone available on Amazon and also manufactured right here in USA.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is the only pure raspberry keytone supplement on the market with a 100% keytones at such a high dosage (which is what you want - less pills to take and more effective).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not be impatient and expect great results in a week, this is a supplement and not a magic potion.</li>
            <li>I typically go by the way my clothes fit.</li>
            <li>On average I was losing 3-5 lbs per week, but that was with a healthy diet (1 cheat day per week) and regular exercise (750-1000 calories burned per day).</li>
            <li>I think thats pretty good, the only things I slightly changed was, I ate a little less, but the raspberry ketones made me feel full faster.(I never felt hungry soon after I ate).</li>
            <li>Healthy FAT loss should only be done at a rate of 2-3 or less pounds a week.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product alongside with mild regular exercises and lost weight (6 lbs on the fourth</li>
            <li>( - 5 pounds / week ), and slower in other times (- 2 pounds / month), yet most importantly, never stop improving and became significantly more efficient after I switched to this product from other Raspberry Ketone product(s).</li>
            <li>I am older so maybe it is for younger folks with high matabolism.</li>
            <li>I am now looking at ordering this from a different company, I think it will be pure health</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the first time i ordered these pills, and i highly recommend getting these if your looking for getting into shape without worrying too much about gaining a few pounds here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin &amp; complexion are clear.</li>
            <li>I am careful about too much junk but really have not changed diet too drastically.  </li>
            <li>a child.&lt;br /&gt;It was much easier when I was younger to lose weight that it is now of course.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have tried similar ones sold in nutrition stores \\&quot;claiming to be the real deal\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>A sensible, conscious diet is also a must.</li>
            <li>I actually started to skip my morning coffee because of how much these energize me.</li>
            <li>I started looking for an all natural product and found this one.</li>
            <li>it contained all natural ingredients and did not come with any side effects or unwanted reactions.</li>
            <li>I have lost 15 lbs so far in 6 weeks along with this supplement (2 capsules a day) and of course strict diet and exercise.</li>
            <li>This product so far has reduced my appetite and given me the strength to stop eating when I should.  </li>
            <li>I have been taking the Raspberry Ketone pills for the last 3 weeks and can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve gone through one bottle and about 1/3 way through the second one, I have to say that this product does absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>There are no side effects and for me with a sensitive stomach</li>
            <li>and I have lost 2 lbs so far.</li>
            <li>I have lost 16 pounds with the help of these in about a months time so far.</li>
            <li>This one you have to give it a chance, but when it kicks in, Wow, the energy I had</li>
            <li>Well, nothing happened so far</li>
            <li>have zero side effects and at the same time I have so much energy and stamina throughout the day.</li>
            <li>B0093OHLM4 Raspberry Ketone Platinum (2 Bottles) - Clinical Strength - All Natural Fat Burning, Weight Loss, Diet Supplement, 60 capsules]]</li>
            <li>So far that combination is working for me.</li>
            <li>I noticed a complete loss of appetite, I am not hungry</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by these pills.</li>
            <li>I did start my exercise routine which includes Yoga and requires some sustained energy to complete 1.5 hrs.</li>
            <li>I am a mature woman and have struggled with my weight for years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural supplement with no side effects.</li>
            <li>In terms of weight loss, I think it&#x27;s early to tell but given that it&#x27;s suppressing my appetite, I can see how this will probably work.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve lost about 9 pounds.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it is an all natural product.</li>
            <li>and I have lost 4lbs so far.</li>
            <li>I have to say it really does work because I have not changed my diet and work out the same amount of days in the week.</li>
            <li>so I know I am sensitive to just about anything .  </li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve taken 1 pill a day, sometimes skipping it solely because I forget to in the morning</li>
            <li>(I hit the snooze button far too often).  </li>
            <li>100 percent natural, 2.</li>
            <li>if you try it, I hope it works for you, like it has worked for me so far.</li>
            <li>I have been taking this for a week and it has completely stopped my hunger.</li>
            <li>so far NO problems to report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve lost about 15 pounds.</li>
            <li>I was amazed that it gave me so much natural energy.  </li>
            <li>part is the natural energy.</li>
            <li>Without changing anything else, it took about a month, but suddenly my thighs began to appear firmer and smoother, the bunches were gone and I was much relieved.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say, this has actually decreased my appetite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a little under 165</li>
            <li>Strong energy bust and much less appetite especially for sweets and carbs.</li>
            <li>I received these earlier than expected and was pleasantly surprised when I opened them and noticed a nice smell (unlike other capsules) and even a Raspberry taste when swallowing them.!</li>
            <li>I know the all powerful OZ said it works with no side effects but my daughter and myself both experenced side effects of swollen cartalege and extreme pain in all our joints.</li>
            <li>Was excited to receive the product within a few days of placing my order.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not sure about the weight loss part, but this definitely gives me more energy.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I can contribute this all to the Raspberry keytones or from the medications no longer holding back my metabolism but the Ketones were sure to be a contributing factor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I lost only 2 pounds on the first week and the following week</li>
            <li>When I finally do get the time to eat it is often not as healthy as I would like it to be (usually I&#x27;m starving at this point)</li>
            <li>Raspberry Ketone Platinum satisfies all my criteria above, and I take it regularly - in particular</li>
            <li>Its not just this particular company its the product overall.  </li>
            <li>, i have seen a definate weight loss which is really only a bonus as the main reason i take it now is that i feel so productive in my life.</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest this product to anyone looking to get a little help burning the extra pounds.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommended this product to anyone looking to put a boost tint the weight loss and actually have it work.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li>In addition, raspberry is a fruit common in American and many other countries’ diet, and a person like me who are skeptical about taking high dosage of natural but uncommon fruits and herbs found in jungles.</li>
            <li>before eating breakfast.. I noticed that it gives me energy the whole day,and as a nurse I&#x27;m on my feet all day,and still have energy to go to the gym after long hours of work.</li>
            <li>and so far I have no regrets of my purchase.</li>
            <li>But if you eat like a normal person and exercise, they will help you maintain your weight, especially if you are over 40.</li>
            <li>went back to normal.</li>
            <li>After the first 2 bottles ran out I tried raspberry ketones premium and did not loose a single pound.</li>
            <li>I am only looking to lose about 8-10 lbs total and do not have much to lose</li>
            <li>No other reviews have commented on this, so maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li>I took 2 pills in the morning and 2 in the afternoon before my main meals starting next week.</li>
            <li>Slow and steady wins MY weight loss race.</li>
            <li>My advice for anyone who is thinking of trying this weight loss product is to religiously take it for a complete month and then evaluate the results.</li>
            <li>Apparently my system is resistant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been 9 days, but so far I haven&#x27;t had any results.</li>
            <li>So far, with the help of this product, I&#x27;ve lost over 35 pounds; starting at 200</li>
            <li>I noticed a complete loss of appetite in the first few days.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t see obvious results except that i wasn&#x27;t as hungry, but after a week or two of taking the Raspberry Ketone and exercising I started to loose weight around my stomach and back.</li>
            <li>I have reduced my food intake slightly and have lost about 4 pounds in the first week.</li>
            <li>I guess a person could open the capsule and just use half, but right now I&#x27;m too scared to even touch it.</li>
            <li>really had any affect one way or the other.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other weight loss supplements,  but didn&#x27;t like that they made me feel really jittery.</li>
            <li>I think the really wonderful thing about this pill is that you really feel numb inside when it comes to food and that helps a lot when you don&#x27;t want to eat the wrong foods.</li>
            <li>I have not experienced any kind of jitters or other adverse effects while using this product</li>
            <li>This product gives a steady energy unlike other products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Do</li>
            <li>Be careful with such a high dosage of the product.</li>
            <li>I have never had any success with &amp;#34;diet pills&amp;#34; before so I was pretty skeptical</li>
            <li>I have only just received my first bottle of Raspberry Keytone Platinum, but wanted to leave a few opening comments.</li>
            <li>Other weight loss products would cause me to be wide awake at night or feel funny.</li>
            <li>We started dieting and exercising in mid-January with slow results; a friend recommended taking Keytone as a supplement and we noticed a difference within the first week!</li>
            <li>I will admit I was a little bit skeptical when my friend tried it, but after seeing how much weight she had lost using the Creative Bioscience Raspberry Ketones, I decided to give them a try.</li>
            <li>It was all I wanted, I didn&#x27;t want Peanut butter, or Bologna or Cheese sandwiches, I just wanted something simple, I ate all the good things before, and all the bad things also.</li>
            <li>This ratio tends to reflect a higher level of truth to the reviews, given people who post negative reviews generally aren&#x27;t the fakers, in-fact this is how I buy all my products.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Well, my honest opinion is that I love the Raspberry Ketone Platinum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m three week into my testing and so far I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Of all the Raspberry Ketone products out there, I feel this is the best, and now I have my own personal proof.</li>
            <li> It increasing becomes more and more effective as you take them.</li>

            <li> even greater results.</li>
            <li> AND I DO FEEL MORE ENERGETIC.</li>
            <li> Ok, So, I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and have been on diets most of my life since I was</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t been able to lose weight with any over the counter meds.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have more energy like I want to do more.</li>
            <li> I began taking this product about 2 months ago, I can say i have much more energy</li>
            <li> I feel more motivated in the gym</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also making it a point to get more exercise.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my dietary changes have impacted him because I do all the cooking.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the product solely on hearsay and Amazon reviews, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my decision.</li>
            <li> but my clothes are fitting better and my stomach has gotten flatter.</li>
            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> but sure it takes awhile for it to get into my system.</li>
            <li> You will not be able to eat 15lbs of chocolate a day and lose weight.</li>
            <li> and I was glad that it was working so well.</li>
            <li> It gives me outstanding energy and keeps me motivated on my tasks throughout my day.</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars, because the price is fair, and it delivers powerful results.  </li>
            <li> I love that it does smell and taste like raspberries</li>
            <li> I have noticed a loss of inches more so than pounds.</li>
            <li> I take one when I wake up and seem to have more energy and one before each meal.</li>
            <li> and I have been able to lose about 16 pounds on it.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that it works better the longer</li>
            <li> I am losing more every week.</li>
            <li> I noticed that I feel more awake during the day</li>
            <li> I sure wish it worked.</li>
            <li> No side effects, increased energy, and better motivation to keep going in the gym.</li>
            <li> what so ever if anything I am eating MORE.</li>
            <li> as you might guess, it is very hurtful and can lower your confidense greatly.</li>
            <li> but I wanted to get better results.</li>
            <li> I had heard a lot about this product but wasn&#x27;t really sure if it would work or not.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love my Raspberry Ketones Platinum.  </li>
            <li> In conclusion, I do feel these pills have influenced my appetite for sure and for that alone</li>
            <li> I love Insanity</li>
            <li> It took two weeks to see any visual results, but they are working great!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still inclined to give the product the benefit of the doubt - maybe it WOULD work on people who have to lose more.</li>
            <li> Over all I am quite pleased and would recommend this product to another customer.</li>
            <li> These are just a lot better for your body and no additional chemicals are in the pill except for the gelatin caseing its in.</li>
            <li> I eat fairly healthy, greens, pasta, fruits and meats.</li>
            <li> and she noticed that she has reduced her weight by 2 pounds in 2 weeks which is still better than gaining more weight.</li>
            <li> She also feels like she&#x27;s more energetic now.</li>
            <li> and I felt like I was burning more calories during my workout.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I love the results I have seen and I will continue to support the benefits from using this product.</li>
            <li> Im looking forward to more results.</li>
            <li> Once I stoped I felt better.</li>
            <li> but I was missirable most of the time.</li>
            <li> I tried another brand of raspberry ketone, but this one is much better-</li>
            <li> Just love the product</li>
            <li> I took them for a week and the longer I took them, the more nervous I got.  </li>
            <li> I did Medi Weight Loss and was able to drop another 25 lbs and once again, was at a standstill.</li>
            <li> Love this product and will continue to purchase more.</li>
            <li> There are no side effects, I have more energy, and I&#x27;ve lost weight and inches a lot faster than just working out alone.  </li>
            <li> and I have a lot more energy.</li>
            <li> Both parties thought it was more hype than substance.</li>
            <li> mode and is working more efficiently.  </li>
            <li> However, I am really glad I did.</li>
            <li> I am pleased :)</li>
            <li> I found this product after hearing about raspberry ketone and its role in weight loss, and although I was hesitant to purchase yet another weight-loss supplement, I am SO GLAD I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, some of which are advertised on TV.</li>
            <li> The latest I took them was 5 pm though.</li>
            <li> I feel much more energetic with this product.  </li>
            <li> If this can help me stop my night snack, I am confident this will result in weight loss.</li>
            <li> I love that this product helps to curb my appetite in the morning, afternoon and evening.</li>
            <li> :) I definately would recommend these pills.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using these for sure.</li>
            <li> Granted I haven&#x27;t lost as much as most people did</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t cheap out and buy the non-clinical strength versions and expect amazing results.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to take 2 day (per instructions).</li>
            <li> Pleased with the results.</li>

            <li> I am very happy with the outcome of using this product and will continue to use it as long</li>
            <li> Pretty good lost 25pd</li>
            <li> My experience has been pretty good with the product.  </li>
            <li> Many of my friends had suggested that I give this product a try and the reviews of this specific brand looked very good, so I placed my opening order.</li>
            <li> I can stay away from sweets and junk food much more easily.</li>
            <li> This allows me to more easily stick to a calorie restricted diet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer waiting for that healthy choice as I feel more free to eat practically anything in sequence with this pill.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the good results and lack of negative side effects.</li>
            <li> Great so far!</li>
            <li> I am on day 5 now and feel great and have lost 2lbs so far.!</li>
            <li> I wonder how many of these reviews are genuine.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly I have not changed my diet</li>
            <li> This product answers that problem for me and lets me eats more freely as it blocks the fat content in the food.</li>
            <li> My clothes fit a bit better and i will continue to take these.</li>
            <li> Best money I have ever spent on any sort of supplement.</li>
            <li> After being able to workout and exercise again, I was able to lose 25lbs easily on my own, but I&#x27;m not allowed to workout as intensely as I used to and &#x27;hit a wall&#x27;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am going to try and bump it up to the recommended two pills per day dosage, but so far I&#x27;m really happy.  </li>
            <li> My clothes fit better, my face looks thinner and exercise</li>
            <li> If my pants fit better, then I&#x27;m doing</li>
            <li> I rated them 4 star because they do what they say, and you don&#x27;t feel as hungry and it will let you know when you are full!</li>
            <li> I have recommended the product to many co workers who are also excited to start the supplement  Hurray for Raspberry Ketone</li>
            <li> The other wonderful thing is no side effects!!</li>
            <li> RECEIVED EVERYTHING VERY QUICK.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product with the Nature Wise Green Coffee Bean Extract with GCA for about a month now with great results.</li>
            <li> Its easy to take</li>
            <li> They have no taste, no smell, and can be easily swallowed.</li>
            <li> I recieved this very quickly, I have used it for a week &amp; have already lost 7 lbs.</li>
            <li> These pills are 600mg so its as strong as it gets.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I&#x27;ll update with more results.</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s way too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> They are quite strong.</li>
            <li> The first thing I felt after taking these was a nice surge of energy.</li>
            <li> It has helped my weight loss by curbing my appetite and helping me feel full most of the time.</li>
            <li> sure to drink full glass of water</li>
            <li> and you will feel more full</li>
            <li> but I feel more full after I eat</li>
            <li> I thought i would have better results if I followed through w/ the full 2 months</li>
            <li> I leave the restaurants full and satisfied, so everything is fine.</li>
            <li> Also, I have tried 3 other brands of Raspberry Ketone and this one is clearly the most effective and the best!  </li>
            <li> But after taking them I was very surprised the result was as good as the pills</li>
            <li> /&gt;The pills are powerful and super effective and once you start to see yourself lose 10 pounds in just a week</li>
            <li> my friends are super excited w. the results!</li>
            <li> and I see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> All the products worked to &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; degree, but the potency and quality of the brand also makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Losing my appetite is absolutely HUGE for me.</li>
            <li> This is much stronger and the stuff really works great.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use the product in order to get to the weight I am comfortable</li>
            <li> have recommended it to many people friends and family, and they like the effects too!&lt;br /&gt;well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic</li>
            <li> I have been looking for some genuine raspberry keytones for some time now to lose the weight gained from antidepressants.</li>
            <li> and I combined this with the Raspberry Ketone Platinum and have had fabulous results.  </li>
            <li> But overall its a great weight loss aid.  </li>
            <li> and I can see why this one has gotten such great reviews.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months and it works great</li>
            <li> I looked at all of the products available and selected this one because it was billed as Clinical Strength.  </li>
            <li> but I know what an important part of my decision making they are</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I just started taking this product and so far, it&#x27;s good...</li>
            <li> but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> And i really think after a month it will be even better, then I will write more.</li>
            <li> So far, So good - I have been taking these for about a week.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t lost so much so quickly and easily since I was in my 30&#x27;s .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> best part is I don&#x27;t feel jittery at all after taking this the first thing in the morning on empty stomach and have loads of energy for my workouts.</li>
            <li> They are super easy to take and being a Type 1 diabetic, they have no adverse effects on my blood sugars.</li>
            <li> Along with all supplements diet is a huge part in weight loss, so If you are doing that and are also taking these pills the weight will come right off!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m SOO excited.  </li>
            <li> My husband has noticed a significant decrease in appetite.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Excited to see the end result after using this for a while.</li>
            <li> i am so excited.</li>
            <li> Am excited to continue using the Raspberry Ketones.</li>
            <li> After taking as directed for over a month, I have not seen any significant drop in weight or decrease in belly fat as this product claims.</li>
            <li> I was excited to learn of the product.  </li>
            <li> They are well worth the price!</li>
            <li> &gt; the best of all I have tried over the past year.</li>
            <li> I am not angry because I was the &amp;#34;Guinea Pig&amp;#34; for many of my friends as to whether this product works and</li>
            <li> Already during the first weeks I was able to notice an effect and lost some pounds.</li>
            <li> What really has impressed me about the product is I loose even when I over eat during holidays and special occasions.  </li>
            <li> Simply the best Ketone I tried so far.</li>

            <li> I kind of think this is a scam with no scientific proof or clinical trials, and we are the little with mice:)</li>
            <li> the morning and one in the afternoon and amazingly, hunger is the last thing that comes to my mind.</li>
            <li> I have heard such amazing things about this raspberry ketone.</li>
            <li> I have been able to lose 24 lbs so far</li>
            <li> I have been able to lose 12 pounds with this product so far</li>

            <li> even if I do not see any weight loss or more inches lost, I will continue for the natural energy.</li>
            <li> Raspberry Ketones from these guys are my best friend and secret weapon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also felt I was able to really push through an intense workout easier than before.</li>
            <li> All items fresh and sealed.</li>
            <li> love the natural energy.  </li>
            <li> Consequently, I loss most of my sculpted muscles and what developed was &amp;#34;bunches&amp;#34; in my thighs that looked like someone had poured globs of fat into a sack (my thigh).  </li>
            <li> From other peoples comments make sure you use this 1/2 hour before eating to get the most effect from it.  </li>
            <li> I was  convinced that she was making a wise choice; due to my lack of knowledge of this product.  </li>
            <li> Right now I am taking two pills a day.</li>
            <li> (you know you&#x27;re getting the right concentration of Ketone)</li>
            <li> I take the recommend amount of 1 pill right as I get out of bed and one 30 minutes before lunch.</li>
            <li> My biggest weight loss problem is finding the time to eat right.</li>
            <li> Yes, you read that right.</li>
            <li> Do it the right way and you will have results.</li>
            <li> started by taking one pill right when I wake up (5:30 AM)</li>
            <li> I take 1 right after I wake up</li>
            <li> it was fast shipping and a GREAT product, in 7 days I lost 7 pounds and still going down.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product, I highly recommend to all!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I feel more energetic and am eating less.</li>
            <li> Have had great results with raspberry ketones in the past.  </li>
            <li> It is still too early for me to know if it will continue, but I will let you know my results later, good or bad.&lt;br /&gt;Jack</li>
            <li> After trying other Raspberry Ketone products  and having some effect, I decided to try this brand because it is stronger and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and exactly as described!  </li>
            <li> First week I lost 7 pounds with no change in diet.</li>
            <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN LOSING WEIGHT OR JUST FEELING HEALTHIER.</li>
            <li> ALMOST FINISHED MY FIRST BOTTLE OF RASPBERRY KETONE.</li>
            <li> would definitely buy this stuff again :)</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase more when done with my bottles.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I take one capsule first thing in the morning</li>
            <li> At first I was upset because it was capsules, not pills.</li>
            <li> I take one first thing in the morning</li>
            <li> /&gt;These obviously aren&#x27;t magic</li>
            <li> It also has done great a job at suppressing my appetite and helping my with those late afternoon cravings.</li>
            <li> First thing in the morning I take 1 pill</li>
            <li> I only started with one pill a day to make sure it agreed with me.</li>
            <li> I did this for a total of 3 weeks just to make sure.  </li>
            <li> I think 500mg and higher with a &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; version is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products over the last 2 years none proving to help me lose the weight I was looking to.</li>
            <li> After the first week of using the product I had begun to lose weight.</li>
            <li> But then I decided, since I have to take thyroid medicine first thing in the morning, I would start taking 1 before lunch and 1 before dinner....</li>
            <li> so I think this product is working pretty well.</li>
            <li> I like the convenience of taking it first of all</li>
            <li> have lost 5-6 pounds in the first month while taking this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks,</li>
            <li> I have lost 5 pounds and my daughter has lost 10 pounds after the first bottle.  </li>
            <li> I expect that I will experience more weight loss as I increase my physical activity.</li>
            <li> I took it first thing in the morning and again before lunch.</li>
            <li> I participate two hours a week in cardio exercise &amp; eat a pretty well balanced diet.</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> At first two weeks, it did nothing</li>
            <li> After the first bottle, I lost 8 pounds.</li>
            <li> I first heard about this product on Dr. Oz and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I continue to work-out regularly and eat healthy.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Lost one pound the first two days so will keep taking.  </li>
            <li> As others have stated, the pills do not provide miraculous results, but can definitely aid with weight loss, particulary when used with a healthy diet.</li>
            <li> - I was more worried about possible side effects of feeling jittery or nervous.</li>
            <li> first heard about Raspberry Ketones and its effect through the Dr. Oz show and was intrigued, so I began researching.</li>
            <li> My appetite has lessened, I&#x27;m in a much better mood almost always, my sleep has improved, and lastly, the numbers just keep dropping.</li>
            <li> It may do more for you especially if you workout as I must say I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Overall, I recommend this product and will continue to use it till I reach my goal of 20 lb :)</li>
            <li> I lost 4 pounds in the first week</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing for me!</li>
            <li> Was really hoping that this would work but for some reason it didn&#x27;t do a thing for me!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I combined it with a low cal diet and more exercise</li>
            <li> I took, 1 pill, first thing in the morning with 8oz of water.</li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t lose a pound and I am avid gym rat.</li>
            <li> Within the first week of taking the ketones I dropped 3lbs.  </li>
            <li> No poor feelings, just lots of energy!</li>
            <li> always starving when I first wake up)then</li>
            <li> I lost 4 lbs in the first week.</li>
            <li> I am now going to my second bottle, I haven&#x27;t lost much more yet</li>
            <li> but, since I&#x27;m a positive person - I&#x27;ll give the product another chance and keep using until the first bottle will be finished.</li>
            <li> The pills also gave me some heartburn and a feeling of being full (the \\&quot;I overate\\&quot; kind of full), which was not pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results I have not experienced any side effects like jitters or increased heart rate, I have a more attuned mental focus and a lot more energy to help me power through my workout.</li>
            <li> /&gt;If does give you more energy and helps me to eat less and feel full.  </li>
            <li> Works really well lost 5 lbs in first week.</li>
            <li> I was very thirsty during the first couple of weeks</li>
            <li> A year and a half prior to taking the Raspberry Ketones, I had done 3 rounds of the HcG diet (pregnancy hormone/500 calories), with great results - weight loss and sculpted muscles - for the first two rounds.  </li>
            <li> Again, safe, high and timely dosage is the key, and this product meets all my criteria.</li>
            <li> I tend to easily get dizzy from medication, so this is definitely a plus!</li>
            <li> easy to get into shape using these simple steps.</li>
            <li> I like the easy to swallow capsules and the lasting effects produce by the fat burning formula.</li>
            <li> So far so good, i  notice my appetite going down and combined with exercise I&#x27;ve seen a lost in weight.</li>
            <li> Started using this product on March 1, was very hopeful from all the positive feedback found all over the Internet.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical reading up on this new craze but have been impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> I hope that I will loose more weight</li>
            <li> I know it helped me loose more because my weight dropped slower without the pills.</li>
            <li> I received the product right away, I just started using them and like it so far!  </li>
            <li> I do not feel as hungry and have noticed that I seem to have a higher energy level too, which has made it easier to avoid eating as much and helps with being more active.</li>
            <li> Everything fits better than last summer, I lost my little “muffin top” and my stomach is flat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed in just a few days that I had a great amounts of extra energy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t lost much weight</li>
            <li> This product is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> everyone wants.</li>
            <li> I have to remind myself to eat because I never seem to be hungry as much anymore.</li>
            <li> Now, not so much.</li>
            <li> , I feel it is definitely a gentle weight loss solution.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very affordable when you are running low.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not seen much results.</li>
            <li> I am a stay at home mother of two who doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of me time.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything for weight loss.</li>
            <li> thanks....</li>
            <li> Thanks for the opportunity to try this for this cost.</li>
            <li> You can find me on facebook for proof that I&#x27;m real.  </li>
            <li> My appetite has decreased a great deal.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect.</li>
            <li> which is really a lot for me.</li>
            <li> They seem to really help when I slip off my diet; keep me where I was before pigging out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try them.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because it really worked on me...</li>
            <li> Including these with my cardio and strength workouts, showing fast results.</li>
            <li> and then it really does what it promises which to increase one&#x27;s metabollism.  </li>
            <li> it is a real appetite suppressant and energy enhancer.</li>
            <li> I stick with whole grains and lean protein for dinner.</li>
            <li> It has really helped me to burn off fat.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really been doing any formal exercise, just trying to park farther away, etc.</li>
            <li> With what I have read limiting carbs and giving your body lean protein helps burn fat and this product really increases the effect.  </li>
            <li> I am feeling a difference in metabolism and my hunger is not as much.</li>
            <li> I lost fifteen pounds during November despite Thanksgiving and really believe this product helps my metabolism.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much, and I look forward to losing another 20 lbs with your help.</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t like the jittery feeling because it was too much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It actually really works.</li>
            <li> You really do need the 600mg to see a difference.</li>
            <li> My weight loss and fitness proceed sometimes fast</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I would like to say thank you to Fast Shipping Supplements on their timely&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thanks for the prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> For people who want fast results, like me, it is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I heard about this product and ordered it not expecting much .This</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> This product by far has the most grams of actual ketone ingredient.</li>
            <li> Okay so I am 15 years old and female.</li>
            <li> I love that I now get more tired at night.</li>
            <li> My appetite definitely went down pretty good.  </li>
            <li> My appetite is much less than it was before taking these, and I feel like I am more alert and have more energy than I have in a long time.!</li>
            <li> Compared to other similar products, the price is also good.</li>
            <li> I finished both bottles for good measure and still did not see results other than those from proper nutrition and exercise.</li>
            <li> Generally, with good diet and lots of exercise I can only lose about 1 pound a week, so these have definitely helped!</li>
            <li> I do exercise 2-3 times a week and eat a low carb diet - but I&#x27;m very impressed and have already ordered my second round!  </li>
            <li> Reading up on products like this and hearing that they normally come with these types of effects was a little nerve racking, so it was nice to be using one that did not.</li>
            <li> I was so excited and stoked to receive this product in the mail, hoping it&#x27;ll change my life instantly.  </li>
            <li> Raspberry Ketone Platinum is the little extra boost I need to help me be successful in my weight loss.</li>
            <li> After trying other weight loss products this one was reccommended to me and i am so glad it was.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t eating as much and with a steady workout routine</li>
            <li> I eat relatively healthy, exercise actively about twice a week, and weigh around 125 lbs now, after stopping the pills.</li>
            <li> The energy helps me stay more active and workout.</li>
            <li> I am a member of the Armed Forces so weight control is always important and sometimes you need a quick way to drop a few pounds.</li>
            <li> I also took longer walks, only about 2.5 miles half of that is up hills(thats good for me for now).</li>
            <li> I take the recommended amount  of 1 pill upon waking up with a full glass of water and one before lunch in the same manner.</li>
            <li> They are much purer and stronger than the others resulting in less hunger pains and more steady loss of weight and fat.</li>
            <li> style.&lt;br /&gt;I can say that so far I am very satisfies with the results!</li>
            <li> I waited until I completed a full 30 day bottle of this product because I know that it takes at least that long to see results... to be fair.</li>
            <li> and you will lose like 20lbs in a month..not true for me but enough for me to keep trying.</li>
            <li> Because I track my daily weight &amp; body fat on a digital WiFi Scale and track my daily activity on a WiFi body monitor I am in a pretty good position to see if this really makes any difference in my general weight loss &amp;#34;Slope&amp;#34; on my monthly graph.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a burst of energy but last week was the first time in months that instead of walking for exercise, I am now running!</li>
            <li> I have noticed less headaches and also more appetite.</li>
            <li> I am drinking more water and feel less hungry.  </li>
            <li> and i have also not only passed my plateau but lost an extra 4 pounds on top of that.</li>
            <li> I suggest just eating smaller meals, muuuuch smaller and eat more veggies. :</li>
            <li> I have been on weight watchers for almost one year and had been steadily losing weight until about Feb.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this Raspberry Ketone product and will order again before my supplies run low.</li>
            <li> I would highly refer anyone looking to lose weight to give this product</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t meet the highly expectations....</li>
            <li> Then I began experiencing headaches and high anxiety.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend trying this product to assist in your weight loss efforts.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I high hopes for this product</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product and will highly recommend it to all my friends.  </li>
            <li> high concentration, 3.</li>
            <li> After doing additional&lt;br /&gt;&gt; research on Raspberry Ketone&#x27;s the importance of having high grade clinical&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly reccemmended</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is wanting to lose weight and looking for a little more energy.</li>
            <li> I just feel a little better,</li>
            <li> I would suggest to up the dose for those of you who have more to lose and work out a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> For the first few days I didn&#x27;t notice any weight loss, but that was fine</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about using this product at first, mainly because once something has become popular cheap versions of it are distributed</li>
            <li> And even better, my fiance has noticed a slimmer waist since it has gone down 1 1/2 inches!  </li>
            <li> I have been busy to get in as much exercise as I would like, but I can already see an increase in weight loss.</li>
            <li> Will continue to take it and see what the result will be in a few more months.</li>
            <li> Curves your appetite and you can&#x27;t eat the portions you normally consume&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> No negative side effects.</li>
            <li> only downside is I am still on the Guaifenesin protocol for Fibromyalgia, it worked great for a long time, after a couple months on this product I am starting to get some symptoms back and</li>
            <li> I used these for a while, they help you reduce a few pounds like most things, but after that they didn&#x27;t seem to do anything.</li>
            <li> I started drinking healthy shakes in the morning, preceded by the raspberry ketones and a green tea supplement.</li>
            <li> Normally, with exercise, I could lose about 2 lbs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally suffer from an acid stomach</li>
            <li> On my normal days where I exercised and watched my calorie intake, I lost lbs.</li>
            <li> I am giving these pills more time but as of now, taking together with the Green Coffee Bean, I have had no results.</li>
            <li> strength is the key to the success of taking this product.</li>
            <li> don’t normally leave feedbacks</li>
            <li> I wasn’t as hungry during the day as I normally would&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> and so far I&#x27;m down 2 pant sizes and weighed in today at an astonishing 175.6 lbs.</li>
            <li> These three conditions allow us to take high and timely dosage for long term, which is the key to enjoy the full potential of raspberry ketone.</li>
            <li> and therefore my body absorbs the fat content like a sponge because I dumbly waited too long in between my meals (mostly because I prefer to wait and eat healthy and healthy choices are never easy to find).</li>
            <li> but after I pluto it goes right back on in time.</li>
            <li> If you exercise and eat right while taking this you will see results sooner than later!</li>
            <li> My wife and I are getting ready for several endurance events and this product is showing positive results combined with our mindful lifestyle choices - it&#x27;s not all in a pill</li>
            <li> It is definitely not easy I eat as healthy as I can and go to the gym 6 days a week.</li>
            <li> but as with anything, a little effort goes a long way when you have such a great helper.  </li>
            <li> I am NOT interested in quick weight loss programs, but more of the 1 pound a week on average sort.</li>
            <li> As long as you are keeping yourself active then it will show nice results.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the energy boost of other products like thermogenics, but the appetite suppression is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Im always trying something new to lose weight.</li>
            <li> Very Natural product.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to caffeine and never drink it or take it any form.  </li>
            <li> I have tried 5 other various diet solutions, most of them either leaving me with the shakes or increased heart rate some with no effects at all never lost a pound.</li>
            <li> I began taking it shortly after I received my first bottle.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> I lost about 3 lbs in the first week and 2 every following week.</li>
            <li> I took the first bottle and started the second one.</li>
            <li> I exercise more than usual, 2)</li>
            <li> I am definitely going to continue to take this and recommending it to my sister!&lt;br /&gt;PS: shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I saw no change for the first two weeks taking only ONE pill in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I started researching about raspberry ketones few months ago and zeroed on this product as this was the only clinical strength raspberry ketone available on Amazon and also manufactured right here in USA.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is the only pure raspberry keytone supplement on the market with a 100% keytones at such a high dosage (which is what you want - less pills to take and more effective).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not be impatient and expect great results in a week, this is a supplement and not a magic potion.</li>
            <li> I typically go by the way my clothes fit.</li>
            <li> On average I was losing 3-5 lbs per week, but that was with a healthy diet (1 cheat day per week) and regular exercise (750-1000 calories burned per day).</li>
            <li> I think thats pretty good, the only things I slightly changed was, I ate a little less, but the raspberry ketones made me feel full faster.(I never felt hungry soon after I ate).</li>
            <li> Healthy FAT loss should only be done at a rate of 2-3 or less pounds a week.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product alongside with mild regular exercises and lost weight (6 lbs on the fourth</li>
            <li> ( - 5 pounds / week ), and slower in other times (- 2 pounds / month), yet most importantly, never stop improving and became significantly more efficient after I switched to this product from other Raspberry Ketone product(s).</li>
            <li> I am older so maybe it is for younger folks with high matabolism.</li>
            <li> I am now looking at ordering this from a different company, I think it will be pure health</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the first time i ordered these pills, and i highly recommend getting these if your looking for getting into shape without worrying too much about gaining a few pounds here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin &amp; complexion are clear.</li>
            <li> I am careful about too much junk but really have not changed diet too drastically.  </li>
            <li> a child.&lt;br /&gt;It was much easier when I was younger to lose weight that it is now of course.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried similar ones sold in nutrition stores \\&quot;claiming to be the real deal\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> A sensible, conscious diet is also a must.</li>
            <li> I actually started to skip my morning coffee because of how much these energize me.</li>
            <li> I started looking for an all natural product and found this one.</li>
            <li> it contained all natural ingredients and did not come with any side effects or unwanted reactions.</li>
            <li> I have lost 15 lbs so far in 6 weeks along with this supplement (2 capsules a day) and of course strict diet and exercise.</li>
            <li> This product so far has reduced my appetite and given me the strength to stop eating when I should.  </li>
            <li> I have been taking the Raspberry Ketone pills for the last 3 weeks and can really tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve gone through one bottle and about 1/3 way through the second one, I have to say that this product does absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> There are no side effects and for me with a sensitive stomach</li>
            <li> and I have lost 2 lbs so far.</li>
            <li> I have lost 16 pounds with the help of these in about a months time so far.</li>
            <li> This one you have to give it a chance, but when it kicks in, Wow, the energy I had</li>
            <li> Well, nothing happened so far</li>
            <li> have zero side effects and at the same time I have so much energy and stamina throughout the day.</li>
            <li> B0093OHLM4 Raspberry Ketone Platinum (2 Bottles) - Clinical Strength - All Natural Fat Burning, Weight Loss, Diet Supplement, 60 capsules]]</li>
            <li> So far that combination is working for me.</li>
            <li> I noticed a complete loss of appetite, I am not hungry</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by these pills.</li>
            <li> I did start my exercise routine which includes Yoga and requires some sustained energy to complete 1.5 hrs.</li>
            <li> I am a mature woman and have struggled with my weight for years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural supplement with no side effects.</li>
            <li> In terms of weight loss, I think it&#x27;s early to tell but given that it&#x27;s suppressing my appetite, I can see how this will probably work.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve lost about 9 pounds.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it is an all natural product.</li>
            <li> and I have lost 4lbs so far.</li>
            <li> I have to say it really does work because I have not changed my diet and work out the same amount of days in the week.</li>
            <li> so I know I am sensitive to just about anything .  </li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve taken 1 pill a day, sometimes skipping it solely because I forget to in the morning</li>
            <li> (I hit the snooze button far too often).  </li>
            <li> 100 percent natural, 2.</li>
            <li> if you try it, I hope it works for you, like it has worked for me so far.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this for a week and it has completely stopped my hunger.</li>
            <li> so far NO problems to report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve lost about 15 pounds.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that it gave me so much natural energy.  </li>
            <li> part is the natural energy.</li>
            <li> Without changing anything else, it took about a month, but suddenly my thighs began to appear firmer and smoother, the bunches were gone and I was much relieved.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say, this has actually decreased my appetite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a little under 165</li>
            <li> Strong energy bust and much less appetite especially for sweets and carbs.</li>
            <li> I received these earlier than expected and was pleasantly surprised when I opened them and noticed a nice smell (unlike other capsules) and even a Raspberry taste when swallowing them.!</li>
            <li> I know the all powerful OZ said it works with no side effects but my daughter and myself both experenced side effects of swollen cartalege and extreme pain in all our joints.</li>
            <li> Was excited to receive the product within a few days of placing my order.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not sure about the weight loss part, but this definitely gives me more energy.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I can contribute this all to the Raspberry keytones or from the medications no longer holding back my metabolism but the Ketones were sure to be a contributing factor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I lost only 2 pounds on the first week and the following week</li>
            <li> When I finally do get the time to eat it is often not as healthy as I would like it to be (usually I&#x27;m starving at this point)</li>
            <li> Raspberry Ketone Platinum satisfies all my criteria above, and I take it regularly - in particular</li>
            <li> Its not just this particular company its the product overall.  </li>
            <li> , i have seen a definate weight loss which is really only a bonus as the main reason i take it now is that i feel so productive in my life.</li>
            <li> I strongly suggest this product to anyone looking to get a little help burning the extra pounds.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommended this product to anyone looking to put a boost tint the weight loss and actually have it work.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product and will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> In addition, raspberry is a fruit common in American and many other countries’ diet, and a person like me who are skeptical about taking high dosage of natural but uncommon fruits and herbs found in jungles.</li>
            <li> before eating breakfast.. I noticed that it gives me energy the whole day,and as a nurse I&#x27;m on my feet all day,and still have energy to go to the gym after long hours of work.</li>
            <li> and so far I have no regrets of my purchase.</li>
            <li> But if you eat like a normal person and exercise, they will help you maintain your weight, especially if you are over 40.</li>
            <li> went back to normal.</li>
            <li> After the first 2 bottles ran out I tried raspberry ketones premium and did not loose a single pound.</li>
            <li> I am only looking to lose about 8-10 lbs total and do not have much to lose</li>
            <li> No other reviews have commented on this, so maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I took 2 pills in the morning and 2 in the afternoon before my main meals starting next week.</li>
            <li> Slow and steady wins MY weight loss race.</li>
            <li> My advice for anyone who is thinking of trying this weight loss product is to religiously take it for a complete month and then evaluate the results.</li>
            <li> Apparently my system is resistant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been 9 days, but so far I haven&#x27;t had any results.</li>
            <li> So far, with the help of this product, I&#x27;ve lost over 35 pounds; starting at 200</li>
            <li> I noticed a complete loss of appetite in the first few days.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t see obvious results except that i wasn&#x27;t as hungry, but after a week or two of taking the Raspberry Ketone and exercising I started to loose weight around my stomach and back.</li>
            <li> I have reduced my food intake slightly and have lost about 4 pounds in the first week.</li>
            <li> I guess a person could open the capsule and just use half, but right now I&#x27;m too scared to even touch it.</li>
            <li> really had any affect one way or the other.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other weight loss supplements,  but didn&#x27;t like that they made me feel really jittery.</li>
            <li> I think the really wonderful thing about this pill is that you really feel numb inside when it comes to food and that helps a lot when you don&#x27;t want to eat the wrong foods.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any kind of jitters or other adverse effects while using this product</li>
            <li> This product gives a steady energy unlike other products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Do</li>
            <li> Be careful with such a high dosage of the product.</li>
            <li> I have never had any success with &amp;#34;diet pills&amp;#34; before so I was pretty skeptical</li>
            <li> I have only just received my first bottle of Raspberry Keytone Platinum, but wanted to leave a few opening comments.</li>
            <li> Other weight loss products would cause me to be wide awake at night or feel funny.</li>
            <li> We started dieting and exercising in mid-January with slow results; a friend recommended taking Keytone as a supplement and we noticed a difference within the first week!</li>
            <li> I will admit I was a little bit skeptical when my friend tried it, but after seeing how much weight she had lost using the Creative Bioscience Raspberry Ketones, I decided to give them a try.</li>
            <li> It was all I wanted, I didn&#x27;t want Peanut butter, or Bologna or Cheese sandwiches, I just wanted something simple, I ate all the good things before, and all the bad things also.</li>
            <li> This ratio tends to reflect a higher level of truth to the reviews, given people who post negative reviews generally aren&#x27;t the fakers, in-fact this is how I buy all my products.  </li>
            <li> If you are willing to put in just a little effort this product will help you loose weight a lot faster than just sitting around and will exercise it works even faster.</li>
            <li> I purchased this few months ago (February 24, to be exact), and it helped me loose some pounds...</li>
            <li> I am an active 37 year old male.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is all natural &amp; stronger than other brands too.</li>
            <li> My weight loss was not sudden or dramatic, but it has been very noticeable and steady.</li>
            <li> the occasions of likely overeating and fewer choices of food, such as party, long flight, trip and etc</li>
            <li> I want to start off first by stating that I am a very active 34 year old woman who consumes no more than 1270 calories a day.</li>
            <li> For reference, I am 5&#x27;2, now 113 lbs, and a 24 year old pastry chef who only gets exercise from going up and down stairs.  </li>
            <li> Once I am less busy, I can&#x27;t wait to see the increased benefits!</li>
            <li> I have not lost any weight, but it usually takes me quite a bit longer than most people to loose due to a metabolic disorder, but I will continue to keep taking them because there don&#x27;t seem to be any side effects, and I think they make me less hungry throughout the day.</li>
            <li> So did my husband who can usually lose weight much easier than I can.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 120 capsules that will last you a long time and considering the price tag</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much weight loss in pounds because I only wanted to loose the last 10+lbs of post baby weight</li>
            <li> Down eight pounds so far.</li>
            <li> and I feel it helped me loose some 35 pounds of the 60 total I&#x27;ve lost.</li>
            <li> It does not have all the other added fillers that some similar products have and the difference is definitely noticeable when taking it.</li>
            <li> I am ready to take a break from working and have a beer or two, hell if I am sweating hard</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on Raspberry  Ketone for a few weeks now, and I am pleasantly  surprised</li>
            <li> Have been taking this for just a few days so far</li>
            <li> I saw all results promised and looking to be a long time user of raspberry ketone platinum.</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to being a long term user of Raspberry Ketone Platinum.</li>
            <li> and it is working, just not fast enough for me and my lifestyle.  </li>
            <li> Looking forward to long term results with patience.</li>
            <li> I presently take a beta-blocker and must be careful with OTC medications.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to take it for as long as I can get it.</li>
            <li> I will continue using these long term.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical abput many weight loss products but it seems like this one is actually working.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I take 1 pill prior to breakfast and another prior to eating lunch and have noticeably cut down on my portions.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this just to try it out thinking it may be the same as the other &amp;#34;popular, trendy&amp;#34; fat burning supplement.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my friends were having terrific results - one lost 15 lbs and the other 7 without effort.  </li>
            <li> so instead of my refund I held on to the  hope that maybe in the second month the lbs. would melt off like a lot of other &amp;#34;consumers&amp;#34; on Amazon reviews had claimed.</li>
            <li> only gave this a 3 star because other things I have read say you dont have to change anything</li>
            <li> The anxiety was real and it was serious.</li>
            <li> Gives me extra energy and motivation to stay active.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m definitely seeing the results, getting a few extra pounds off.</li>
            <li> when used with green coffee extract it has helped me lose weight and inches in only a short time without having to add excess exercising.</li>
            <li> I get busy and a bit tired of being health conscious.</li>
            <li> Slow and steady but progress seams to be made.</li>
            <li> Looks like it is a slow and steady weight loss not overnight.  </li>
            <li> and I did not lose a single pound.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t loose a pound on it and it didn&#x27;t curb my appetite either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking 3 capsules per day, as advised, and I didn&#x27;t loose any kilo (didn&#x27;t gane any ehither)....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to loose appetite, just curb my hunger.  </li>
            <li> I know a lot of people want a miracle that will just allow them to eat what they want and still loose.</li>
            <li> After having several surgeries and being on steroids and having to cut my workouts down to almost nothing, I gained about 60lbs within 9 months.</li>
            <li> I recommend that you drink a lot of water, the capsules are bigger than Im used to so washing it down with lots of water helps.</li>
            <li> Since around September I am down a total of 45 lbs.</li>
            <li> If you take it later, expect a lot less results  </li>
            <li> I was actually pretty skeptical that this would help with weight loss but after using the product for several months now I am a believer!  </li>
            <li> I had previously noticed a discomfort prior to taking two capsuls.  </li>
            <li> I only watched what I ate and cut my serving size by half.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for those serious about weight loss.</li>
            <li> , I was a little less tired after exercising, cleaning, etc,a little more alert.  </li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for a little over a month now and have lost ten pounds!!</li>
            <li> Hoping to loose 15 lbs !</li>
            <li> One immediately&lt;br /&gt;upon waking up and the other a half hour prior to lunch.</li>
            <li> i have been taking this product now for several months and it has been helping me to lose the pounds;  I had tried other versions previously</li>
            <li> I am on a low calorie, low fat, hardly any carb.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be using this for the next few months and will update if there are any slimming results.</li>
            <li> I have only lost a few pounds</li>
            <li> Absolutely no benefit was obtained from this product.  </li>
            <li> My order of Raspberry Keytone Platinum was shipped promptly and seems to work as expected.</li>
            <li> Additionally, taking it &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; meals, about 30 mins, on an empty stomach, drastically improves the appetite suppressing effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received my shipment and they were exactlly what I expected been</li>
            <li> I took as directed on the bottle, and saw absolutely no change in my weight or in my appetite.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using this for a few months and in my opinion this supplement has definitely helped both of us lose and keep weight off!</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected.</li>
            <li> every day I go to eat at some restaurant, no fast foods, I change restaurants every day.</li>
            <li> After 1 week I lost 6 pounds, that may not sound like a earth shattering loss to you but for me it is a start, I don&#x27;t know if it will continue, but I can tell you it curbed my appetite at night, which was a big problem for me.</li>
            <li> not sound like 2-3 lbs is a big deal.</li>
            <li> The third round proved harder on my body than expected</li>
            <li> Sure, it will make you not want to eat because you&#x27;re too sick and scared.  </li>
            <li> And by natural, I mean that there were no physical symptoms of an energy burst, but I just felt that things were a little less tasking</li>
            <li> I found absolutely no positive results from Raspberry Keytone.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using them for a few days, so I will post again in a month, however they do seem to make me feel less bloated and give me some energy.</li>
            <li> I take one in the morning and the other before lunch.</li>
            <li> #34;it isn&#x27;t an overnight weight loss&amp;#34;, but if you continue to do due diligence and exercise and watch your calories.........</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product with no weight loss after one month of use but will continue taking the pills until I run out of the product hoping for better results.</li>
            <li> I have not been real regular with taking the product and have not dieted as well as I had in the past.  </li>
            <li> so.... any other recommendations???</li>
            <li> I recommended it to my sister and some other friends.</li>
            <li> This was extreme.</li>
            <li> The product arrived extremely fast.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been taking it for over 8 months now along with a couple other supplements and it has helped me to lose over 40 lbs since July.  </li>
            <li> so I know it is due to the pills.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no adverse side effects like I did on the other product</li>
            <li> This product worked for other people</li>
            <li> I dont have time to exercise and it has all been due to the raspberry&lt;br /&gt;keatone platinum.</li>
            <li> Almost immediately I notice a sharp pain in my abdomine.  </li>
            <li> Nothing like other reviews..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking it 2x a day for the last few weeks and can&#x27;t wait to continue with it!</li>
            <li> and she has been at a stand still on her weight the last couple of months until this past 9 days.</li>
            <li> from some foreign country.  </li>
            <li> Around noon I grab a snack of potato chips, pretzels, peanuts, or in other words junk food.</li>
            <li> /force myself to eat due to nutrients I was going to miss for the day.</li>
            <li> a little lighter and physical activity has become a little easier- all without caffeine or other addictive/harmful additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> or so I feel charged with extra energy, and my pants already got at least one inch loose.</li>
            <li> I find that it helps me loose a little weigh this way.</li>
            <li> With the others the scale would go up and down every other day no matter what was eaten.</li>
            <li> Raspberry Ketone is now widely accepted supplement, and due to its abundance in the market, it is very, very hard to identify good ones from ordinary and even bad ones.</li>
            <li> I would have rated 5 stars, but it is hard to measure if I am actually loosing weight.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t think of a thing outside off nitpicking that is negative about these.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but these pills really work.  </li>
            <li> Not worth my money.</li>
            <li> No worth it.</li>
            <li> and it has helped me trim down my tummy.  </li>
            <li> I feel as if this product has owned up to all i thought it should do and will continue to use it as my aid in weight loss and to keep my weight down.</li>
            <li> After I started Rasberry Keytones for a couple months I weighed myself, I was down to 200.</li>
            <li> It also felt like my food would not go down, like something was stuck in my esophagus.</li>
            <li> I have been up and down the ladder with products, until I started taking this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m down 10 lbs and have lots of energy.  </li>
            <li> By taking 2 pills a day I am down a pound or so in 1 week.  </li>
            <li> Went down a size.</li>
            <li> I set down about 7:pm and start watching tv, that&#x27;s when I get hungry again and start eating everything</li>
            <li> My appetite is a little curbed due to the product.  </li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s body is different, the number on the scale does not always mean its not working.</li>
            <li> I find that I crave sugars much less which is my downfall.</li>
            <li> I took the advice to take one less pill to begin with</li>
            <li> so you eat less.</li>
            <li> Went from 170-220 in a matter of 6 months or less from the combination.</li>
            <li> one half hour before a meal.</li>
            <li> Anytime, I eat less, I always lose weight.</li>
            <li> Eat less, exercise and then you will shed weight... end of story.</li>
            <li> I take 2 one half hr.</li>
            <li> before breakfast and 1 a half hr.</li>
            <li> I have approx 1 bottle and one half of unused product.</li>
            <li> I took these pills for less than a month</li>
            <li> Less stomach troubles since taking Rasberry Keytone.  </li>
            <li> Feel less hungry during the day as well.  </li>
            <li> I am less fatigued after my visit to the gym in the morning.</li>
            <li> Its been less than two weeks</li>
            <li> I took this product half hour before my workout and before dinner.</li>
            <li> You would think after two and a half weeks, I&#x27;d see something...</li>
            <li> (esp cardio) is easier and fluctuation is much less.</li>
            <li> you take it with the meal, or after - expect poor results generally.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product a few months ago in an effort to trim down for summer.</li>
            <li> Slowly I have been seeing results, will continue to take on the long run!</li>
            <li> Finally, a product that makes losing weight a little easier!!!  </li>
            <li> Anyway to make a long story short, I thought I would give it a try, it wasn&#x27;t that expensive, and wasn&#x27;t going to hurt me if it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> But it did help me a little</li>
            <li> I do realize there is no miracle to weight loss, however, I feel like this helps a little bit.</li>
            <li> I eat a little bit.  </li>
            <li> so you have to put a little effort forth</li>
            <li> I like the burst of energy, without the ADHD that usually comes with other products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles but a little weight loss would have made me feel some encouragement.  </li>
            <li> Yes it is a little pricey</li>
            <li> so thought that the Ketones would help a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of how other people are saying this product works, but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> not waste time with products that are less expensive and loaded with fillers.</li>
            <li> I do experience the occasional raspberry burp and my appetite has decreased slightly.  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed a decreased appetite, but the weight is definitely coming off.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t do nothing waste of money</li>
            <li> I got this product a few months ago and is using it.</li>
            <li> Waste of money,</li>
            <li> A waste of money...</li>
            <li> a waste of time....</li>
            <li> I stopped taking the product for a few days to get it out my system.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on diet pills.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, just go on a stricter eating plan and exercise some.</li>
            <li> I did lose a few pounds</li>
            <li> I may try out the green coffee bean capsules in addition to the raspberry ketones but that depends if I can&#x27;t reach my target weight solely with them.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I will post a follow up of my findings after taking for a few weeks to let you know how it goes.  </li>
            <li> I wasted my money, and I&#x27;m not going to bother finishing it.  </li>
            <li> After seeing the results after a month and half; I&#x27;m now a believer in the power of Raspberry Ketone!</li>
            <li> husband already told me I have less fat thighs than before taking it!</li>
            <li> Not sure how to explain the sickness, its a little bit of nausea, chest congestion, etc.</li>
            <li> The first handful of products I had tried  didn’t work that well for me and some of them gave me bad side effects.</li>
            <li> I have been using this supplement for past few week</li>
            <li> I am not sure why.</li>
            <li> and I usually do well until around 10:30 AM.  </li>
            <li> not sure I should be taking this supplement with the protocol.</li>
            <li> However, I about finishing the 1st week (taking 2 pills a day) and notice a weird emotional feeling</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s now eating in small portions</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have the usual junk food craving I usually get around 10pm-11pm.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly a healthy lifestyle, but its a job</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if its the ketones or me.&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking 2 a day for about 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> ... not sure this does anything</li>
            <li> After loosing 25 lbs I hit a sticking point and couldn&#x27;t seem to go past it.</li>
            <li> or you may have a little trouble getting to sleep, because you don&#x27;t get so tired.  </li>
            <li> No magic pill or DVD will replace common sense.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s often hard to tell which is which.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time losing weight this product delivered.</li>
            <li> Hard to beat for the money and purity/dosing.</li>
            <li> reviews are a problem I&#x27;ve noticed, but I&#x27;ve also noticed that if you look for a ratio of at least 10 to 1.  </li>
            <li> So look for a lot of reviews (at least 100), and look for the one with the smallest 1 star reviews.  </li>
            <li> Now you have to exercise four or five days a week for at least 45 minutes and eat sensibly to lose weight, but you don&#x27;t have to starve.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t take too late in the evening</li>
            <li> I have nothing negative to say about this product at this time.</li>
            <li> I am retired and spend at least 4 hours a day studying the stock market and investing.</li>
            <li> But I am also a sucker for cheeseburgers and girl scout cookie</li>
            <li> It seems to help with curbing my appetite and I am slowly losing the weight without going to the gym.</li>
            <li> I recommend taking one a day and slowly working your way up to two or three.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for the past 3 months and have lost about 30 pounds!</li>
            <li> My metabolism is ridiculous and my appetite way out of control.</li>
            <li> I found my metabolism seriously increased after about 10 days.</li>
            <li> , I actually feel slightly sick.  </li>
            <li> First I will tell you my eating habits are horrible.</li>
            <li> I have started exercising but very slowly since I am so out of shape.</li>
            <li> These are my secret weapon in the battle to stay in the clothes</li>
            <li> I am not happy with the product and have discontinued using it as has my husband.  </li>
            <li> I lose weight at a rate of approximately 1 lb.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointing to to waste money on falsely advertised products.</li>
            <li> So if you have 100 reviews, there should be no more than 10 unhappy 1 star customers.  </li>
            <li> You wont be sad you did.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry.  </li>
            <li> So where did I go wrong?...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> that I haven´t done unfortunately).</li>
            <li> Before taking this product i was always very tired and had no motivation to even work out.  </li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have had one unpleasant side effect which is why I gave this product a 4 star rating.</li>
            <li> Because I have a toddler at home, I find it very difficult to find time to exercise</li>
            <li> I wanted to lose weight extremely badly</li>
            <li> I am not a expert about this or have any connections to this company, but if it worked for me it should work for anyone, no one could have all the bad habits I have.</li>
            <li> I have a bad immune system, I have not been sick while taking them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t gotten dizzy or sick.</li>
            <li> Disappointed no end.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> No suppression of appetite, no increased energy, no weight loss. :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> You still have to work at it just like any weightloss base pills.</li>
            <li> It was horrible and horrifying, assuming I&#x27;d never put on another bathing suit.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t get a disgusting after taste.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They would either stop working or they would come with nasty side effects.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product definitely curbs my appetite, especially helps me avoid carbohydrates. Gives me extra energy and motivation to stay active. I haven&#x27;t lost much weight but I feel more energetic and am eating less.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and exactly as described!  I take one when I wake up, and one before meals. First week I lost 7 pounds with no change in diet. Will definitely be using this product  to help get back in shape this summer!</li>
            <li> I have been taking one pill 30 minutes prior to each meal for just over two weeks now, and have lost about 3 pounds each week. I  currently weigh 130 (began at 136) and am 5&#x27;1&#x27;&#x27;. Generally, with good diet and lots of exercise I can only lose about 1 pound a week, so these have definitely helped!</li>
            <li> This product is the real deal.  It is the only pure raspberry keytone supplement on the market with a 100% keytones at such a high dosage (which is what you want - less pills to take and more effective).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been taking this as directed 30 mins before lunch and dinner and it has helped me trim down my tummy.  I went from a size 10/12 to an 8 and I&#x27;m SOO excited.  I do exercise 2-3 times a week and eat a low carb diet - but I&#x27;m very impressed and have already ordered my second round!  Do yourself the favor and give this a try!  You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Well, I have been utilizing the Raspberry Ketones for a couple of weeks now and&lt;br /&gt;have not added any exercise to my routine and I have already noticed that I have&lt;br /&gt;lost about 3-4 lbs. I plan on incorporating some physical activity and hope to&lt;br /&gt;see even greater results. Right now I am taking two pills a day. One immediately&lt;br /&gt;upon waking up and the other a half hour prior to lunch. It makes me feel fuller&lt;br /&gt;and I have noticed I have been eating smaller portions as well. I look forward&lt;br /&gt;to continued weigh loss and can&#x27;t wait to see what happens as I add in a daily&lt;br /&gt;exercise routine. I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about using this product at first, mainly because once something has become popular cheap versions of it are distributed and it&#x27;s often hard to tell which is which.  After reading many reviews about which is the best, I found Raspberry Ketone Platinum. This product has been the very first dietary supplement that has ever worked for me, I saw immediate results within weeks, and have since then still been seeing gradual weight loss.  I&#x27;ve noticed that it also seems to suppress my appetite aiding in my diet, the supplement also comes with no dietary restrictions and fits perfectly into my eating schedule. I haven&#x27;t had any side effects,or complications, I look forward to the rest of my progress!</li>
            <li> I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN LOSING WEIGHT OR JUST FEELING HEALTHIER. I&#x27;VE ALMOST FINISHED MY FIRST BOTTLE OF RASPBERRY KETONE. I AM LOSING WEIGHT AND I DO FEEL MORE ENERGETIC.</li>
            <li> So greatful have finally found a product that has given me the results I was looking for in a weight loss product. I have tried 5 other various diet solutions, most of them either leaving me with the shakes or increased heart rate some with no effects at all never lost a pound. I started taking this formula about 2 months ago and I have lost 8 pounds already with my diet and exercise program. Which was very nice cause I didn&#x27;t have to do anything but add this product to my daily routine. I am very happy with the outcome of using this product and will continue to use it as long it keeps working as it has. I will be telling everyone about my great experiences with this product.</li>
            <li> RECEIVED EVERYTHING VERY QUICK.  HAVE BEEN USING IT SINCE I RECEIVED IT.  I SEE THE ENERGY BUT HAVEN&#x27;T NOTICED THE WEIGHT LOSS YET.</li>
            <li> Ok, So, I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and have been on diets most of my life since I was a child.&lt;br /&gt;It was much easier when I was younger to lose weight that it is now of course.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to lose weight with any over the counter meds. Nothing seemed&lt;br /&gt;to work.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been on Raspberry  Ketone for a few weeks now, and I am pleasantly  surprised how&lt;br /&gt;well this works. I take one in the morning before breakfast and one before diner.&lt;br /&gt;I have lost 18 Lbs.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t lost so much so quickly and easily since I was in my 30&#x27;s .&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this stuff again :)</li>
            <li> I have been working out for about 5 years now trying to get that beach body look everyone wants. It is definitely not easy I eat as healthy as I can and go to the gym 6 days a week. I still some how can&#x27;t seem to shake this excess fat around my tummy area. I decided it was time to try a supplemental solution, I began taking this product 1 month ago and already lost 4 lbs I am very pleased with the results I have not experienced any side effects like jitters or increased heart rate, I have a more attuned mental focus and a lot more energy to help me power through my workout. I would highly recommended this product to anyone looking to put a boost tint the weight loss and actually have it work.</li>
            <li> Have been taking this for just a few days so far and it has curbed my appetite without giving me the jitters and it even tastes good.! Looking forward to seeing more weight loss.! It also gives me lots of energy without any side affects.!</li>
            <li> This product works and helped me to not eat in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> These are awesome. I take one in the morning and the other before lunch. I have to remind myself to eat because I never seem to be hungry as much anymore. There are no side effects for me at all. I feel like I have more energy like I want to do more. I don&#x27;t have any food cravings anymore which is great when your trying to watch what you eat. When I do eat I find myself getting full faster than before. The weight is coming off slowly which is the best way. I do try and exercise 4 times a week. I think the really wonderful thing about this pill is that you really feel numb inside when it comes to food and that helps a lot when you don&#x27;t want to eat the wrong foods. Will definitely purchase more when done with my bottles.</li>
            <li> Simply the best Ketone I tried so far. Strong energy bust and much less appetite especially for sweets and carbs.</li>
            <li> This product works great would buy again. I hope this help the people who do not think that it does.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the weight loss part, but this definitely gives me more energy. I&#x27;m going to be using this for the next few months and will update if there are any slimming results.</li>
            <li> I have been on a elevator of weight loss and gain, it seems like I get on a good diet and workout routine I lose some weight but after I pluto it goes right back on in time. I need something that could not only help me lose weight but surpass my plateau as well. I began taking this product about 2 months ago, I can say i have much more energy I feel more motivated in the gym and i have also not only passed my plateau but lost an extra 4 pounds on top of that. I take the recommended amount  of 1 pill upon waking up with a full glass of water and one before lunch in the same manner. I feel as if this product has owned up to all i thought it should do and will continue to use it as my aid in weight loss and to keep my weight down. I would highly refer anyone looking to lose weight to give this product a try it works well.</li>
            <li> My husband and I started on these capsules and both of us are losing weight. My husband has noticed a significant decrease in appetite.  I have not noticed a decreased appetite, but the weight is definitely coming off.  In addition to taking the capsules, I&#x27;ve cut out bread, sugar, and dairy.  I&#x27;m also making it a point to get more exercise.  My husband hasn&#x27;t made any &amp;#34;on purpose&amp;#34; changes but I&#x27;m sure my dietary changes have impacted him because I do all the cooking.  We both like the fact that the pills don&#x27;t cause side effects.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any nervousness, irritability, etc.</li>
            <li> I am have been extremely satisfied with the Raspberry Ketone that I have used from this company!!  I have seen weight loss that was a concern for me, as I had surgery this summer that didn&#x27;t allow me to exercise, but with the use of the Raspberry Ketone&#x27;s I actually lost weight, without any exercise except walking!  I haven&#x27;t gained any of the weight back and I am a very, very satisfied customer.....I will continue to use the product in order to get to the weight I am comfortable with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What my husband noticed was that my clothes were fitting me better than before using the Raspberry Ketones, and that I looked and felt trimmer and slimmer than I had in years!!!  The one thing that I will say to anyone wanting to use this product is that - &amp;#34;it isn&#x27;t an overnight weight loss&amp;#34;, but if you continue to do due diligence and exercise and watch your calories.........You will get the results that you are looking for!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a total believer in this product and am &amp;#34;EXTREMELY HAPPY&amp;#34; and have no problem FULLY ENDORSING it!!!</li>
            <li> i have been taking this product now for several months and it has been helping me to lose the pounds;  I had tried other versions previously and none of them worked.  I am delighted with this product and give it a strong recommendation.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this supplement has been a big help and also helps keep the weight off! My husband and I started exercising and changing our lifestyle and a friend recommended taking Keytone as a supplement.  I noticed a difference within the first week! To date I have lost over 20 pounds with the help of your supplement. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> No effect whatsoever !! Even after following a religious 3 mile regimen alongside. Disappointed no end. Maybe it&#x27;s my individual constitution or something. That&#x27;s the only thing I can think of.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything for me.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t do nothing waste of money</li>
            <li> Raspberry Ketone Platinum is very effective!  I have lost weight and gained energy with this product.  I take one capsule first thing in the morning and then one thirty minutes before lunch.  What really has impressed me about the product is I loose even when I over eat during holidays and special occasions.  I&#x27;ve tried many many diet products in the last 15 years and found this product ranks one of the highest in the ability to help me loose weight and feel good about myself! Also, I have tried 3 other brands of Raspberry Ketone and this one is clearly the most effective and the best!  I sincerely believe you will be satisfied with the RK Platinum, I sure am!!  Bec</li>
            <li> I had tried other Raspberry Ketones, but now this one is more effective for my wife. I wonder if I can get faster shipping and discount with bulk order.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product solely on hearsay and Amazon reviews, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my decision. Doesn&#x27;t have the energy boost of other products like thermogenics, but the appetite suppression is fantastic. Very pleased. Buy with confidence, and buy this brand because it&#x27;s made in the USA (you know you&#x27;re getting the right concentration of Ketone)</li>
            <li> I rated them 4 star because they do what they say, and you don&#x27;t feel as hungry and it will let you know when you are full!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product with the Nature Wise Green Coffee Bean Extract with GCA for about a month now with great results. I&#x27;m not sure how much weight loss in pounds because I only wanted to loose the last 10+lbs of post baby weight I couldn&#x27;t get off but my clothes are fitting better and my stomach has gotten flatter. No problems with jitters. I find that I crave sugars much less which is my downfall.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with this product. I have tried similar ones sold in nutrition stores \\&quot;claiming to be the real deal\\&quot;. Although I had some results with those, I can definitely feel the difference upon using these. They are much purer and stronger than the others resulting in less hunger pains and more steady loss of weight and fat. With the others the scale would go up and down every other day no matter what was eaten. By no means are any of these products a miracle on their own. A sensible, conscious diet is also a must. Not to say you can&#x27;t indulge every so often, but when you do, this supplement is a great help.</li>
            <li> Works like a Charm, like a virtual slip and slide for the Colon.  I would recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like to have to push out those logs, they slide out</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product, I highly recommend to all!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, the amazing results!! Finally a product that aides in weightless with about of exercise, I dropped weight.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and it has been helpful. I have been busy to get in as much exercise as I would like, but I can already see an increase in weight loss. Once I am less busy, I can&#x27;t wait to see the increased benefits! I took the advice to take one less pill to begin with and I haven&#x27;t gotten dizzy or sick. I tend to easily get dizzy from medication, so this is definitely a plus! I plan on taking all of the pills each day soon.  Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> At first I was upset because it was capsules, not pills. But after taking them I was very surprised the result was as good as the pills and I could feel the difference that the &amp;#34;Platinum&amp;#34; in the name of the product could do.</li>
            <li> It was ok. But made me bloated and constipated I am not sure why. But it did help me a little I guess</li>
            <li> I ordered the Raspberry Ketone and have been taking them about a month. My skin &amp; complexion are clear. I have more energy through the day &amp; feel good. It helped my appetite so not hungry through the day. I take one before each meal about 30 minutes before. I have been eating very healthy with lots of veggies &amp; only grass fed meats too. I have only lost a few pounds but sure it takes awhile for it to get into my system. I also workout 4 days a week with strength training &amp; some cardio too. I like that it is all natural &amp; stronger than other brands too. I tried another brand but was only 200mg per tablet.  I will keep taking  Raspberry Ketone Platinum even for the health benefits. I have recommended the product to many co workers who are also excited to start the supplement  Hurray for Raspberry Ketone</li>
            <li> The first thing I felt after taking these was a nice surge of energy. I actually started to skip my morning coffee because of how much these energize me. One before breakfast and another before lunch is all it takes to keep me moving all day. I’ve been hitting the gym daily and watching my sugar intake. I’ve lost 9 lbs after two weeks of being on this. I like the way this keeps me motivated and  look forward to continued results. I would recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and it seems that it works nicely and effectively but needs to wait some times to get the result you are looking for nice product and recommended</li>
            <li> Awsome helps keep my metabolism in check</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. I didn&#x27;t loose a pound on it and it didn&#x27;t curb my appetite either. what a wast e of money. I suggest just eating smaller meals, muuuuch smaller and eat more veggies. :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks for NOTHING raspberry Ketones!!</li>
            <li> These pills will not lose the weight for you. You will not be able to eat 15lbs of chocolate a day and lose weight. But if you eat like a normal person and exercise, they will help you maintain your weight, especially if you are over 40. When I was younger, I could lose weight like a champ and keep it off. Now, not so much. These are my secret weapon in the battle to stay in the clothes I already own.&lt;br /&gt;If you up the intensity of your exercise regime and take 3 tabs a day, you will lose weight.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried others and these are the best, even though they are not prime eligible.</li>
            <li> I ordered this just to try it out thinking it may be the same as the other &amp;#34;popular, trendy&amp;#34; fat burning supplement.  I take one first thing in the morning and I usually do well until around 10:30 AM.  I may try taking one before dinner since my vacation in around the corner.  This seller shipped my product three days before the tracking said I would receive it also.  Great purchase for me.</li>
            <li> I like how quickly I started noticing signs that this product was working. I noticed in just a few days that I had a great amounts of extra energy. My athletic performance has improved a great deal since I have been taking this product as well. This product has done an excellent job of suppressing my appetite to I don&#x27;t find myself running for that snack area of the break room. I have not experienced any kind of jitters or other adverse effects while using this product, I feel it is definitely a gentle weight loss solution. Reading up on products like this and hearing that they normally come with these types of effects was a little nerve racking, so it was nice to be using one that did not. I have been able to lose 24 lbs so far and I have only been using this product for about 2 months. For me this was awesome and I was glad that it was working so well.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the first time i ordered these pills, and i highly recommend getting these if your looking for getting into shape without worrying too much about gaining a few pounds here and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These obviously aren&#x27;t magic so you have to add a good workout routine and diet to your daily activities. Taking these pills and dieting properly will maximize your weight lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to get into shape using these simple steps. Take 1 pill when waking up followed up another one 30 minutes prior to your lunch. If you want to add another to the mix 30 minutes before dinner you can do so as well. These pills are 600mg so its as strong as it gets. I recommend starting off with 2 pills a day then stepping up to 3 a day after 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t think of a thing outside off nitpicking that is negative about these. It&#x27;s 120 capsules that will last you a long time and considering the price tag it&#x27;s very affordable when you are running low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pills are powerful and super effective and once you start to see yourself lose 10 pounds in just a week you will look forward to seeing what your body will look like in 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> I got this product a few months ago and is using it. I have not seen much results. Maybe lost 2-3 pounds. I am older so maybe it is for younger folks with high matabolism. Will continue to take it and see what the result will be in a few more months.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It has helped my weight loss by curbing my appetite and helping me feel full most of the time. You still have to exercise to get results, but with this product you will have the confidence knowing that weight will definitely come off. I highly recommend this product for those serious about weight loss.</li>
            <li> I have lost a inch a week! If you exercise and eat right while taking this you will see results sooner than later!</li>
            <li> I wanted to lose weight extremely badly but I also didn&#x27;t like the idea of consuming a ton of chemicals just to do so. I started looking for an all natural product and found this one. I began taking it shortly after I received my first bottle. I like that it contained all natural ingredients and did not come with any side effects or unwanted reactions. I have been able to lose 12 pounds with this product so far and I will continue to take this product and buy it until my needs in weight loss are met. I take the recommend amount of 1 pill right as I get out of bed and one 30 minutes before lunch. It gives me outstanding energy and keeps me motivated on my tasks throughout my day. It also has done great a job at suppressing my appetite and helping my with those late afternoon cravings.I would have to say this product had definitely met all my expectations and I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a great working weight loss supplement.</li>
            <li> It did nothing for me.  I was using this while doing Zumba and on a reduced calorie diet and I did not lose a single pound.  It wasn&#x27;t until I stopped using it that I started to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.</li>
            <li> I began with Raspberry Ketone one month ago. I take 2  a day before breakfast and lunch. I&#x27;m not hungry any more!&lt;br /&gt;I lost 5 lbs without workout</li>
            <li> They send you two bottles, but it tasted like pickles. So, I don&#x27;t like it. If you like pickles...then, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month or so and it seems to be working. Along with a diet and some exercising in that time I have lost fifteen pounds. Slow and steady but progress seams to be made.</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars, because the price is fair, and it delivers powerful results.  I love that it does smell and taste like raspberries so you don&#x27;t get a disgusting after taste.&lt;br /&gt;I took it for a month and i lost about 30 pounds.(combined w. exercise)&lt;br /&gt; Bottom line I will recommend this product, as a matter of fact I did and my friends are super excited w. the results!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and based on that I bought the product. I exercise at leadt 4 times a week and follow a low calorie diet but I did not lose any weight.  Waste of money,</li>
            <li> I give it a 5 star because it works wonders&lt;br /&gt;1.) I took 2 bottles and lost 30lbs, 2 months later still haven&#x27;t gained it back&lt;br /&gt;2.)used it as an energy boost&lt;br /&gt;3.) I have a bad immune system, I have not been sick while taking them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended it to many people friends and family, and they like the effects too!&lt;br /&gt;well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic I saw all results promised and looking to be a long time user of raspberry ketone platinum. This product by far has the most grams of actual ketone ingredient. I am looking forward to being a long term user of Raspberry Ketone Platinum. This expedited my weight loss and I was already fit and tone, but with this product I have been able to loss access weight that I didn&#x27;t even know that I could loss!!! Recommended to all, no matter your size, this product WILL help in your immediate weight loss!!! Also there are NO side effects like nausea or vertigo, because I was experiencing those with others supposed ketone products. This is the ideal pill!!!</li>
            <li> Works great!  Curves your appetite and you can&#x27;t eat the portions you normally consume&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to drink full glass of water otherwise you will belch raspberries.&lt;br /&gt;Not a wonder drug, but I did see a difference in my belly substantially flatter.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t completely sure if taking this product was really benefiting me...until I stopped.  I won&#x27;t make that mistake again!  Of all the Raspberry Ketone products out there, I feel this is the best, and now I have my own personal proof.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product with no weight loss after one month of use but will continue taking the pills until I run out of the product hoping for better results.</li>
            <li> I am a stay at home mother of two who doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of me time. I have been taking this product for a little over a month now and have lost ten pounds!! I have not changed anything about my daily activity. The other wonderful thing is no side effects!!</li>
            <li> Took as directed; ate healthier; exercised...don&#x27;t feel taking the Rasberry Ketone really had any affect one way or the other.  Felt no difference when taken vs when did not.  Didn&#x27;t really do anything for weight loss.</li>
            <li> This Product is Awesome! it was fast shipping and a GREAT product, in 7 days I lost 7 pounds and still going down. I will recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Have had great results with raspberry ketones in the past.  Ordered this product but have yet to attain the same results.  May not be the products fault.  I have not been real regular with taking the product and have not dieted as well as I had in the past.  Intend on doing so in the future.  Will update if rating changes.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for some genuine raspberry keytones for some time now to lose the weight gained from antidepressants. These pills came as described, white powder in capsule, and do smell like raspberry. I have only been using them for a few days, so I will post again in a month, however they do seem to make me feel less bloated and give me some energy. No negative side effects. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t meet the highly expectations.... I&#x27;m taking 3 capsules per day, as advised, and I didn&#x27;t loose any kilo (didn&#x27;t gane any ehither).... but, since I&#x27;m a positive person - I&#x27;ll give the product another chance and keep using until the first bottle will be finished. so.... any other recommendations??? anyone? thanks....</li>
            <li> I find that it helps me loose a little weigh this way. But I have only used any of these for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical abput many weight loss products but it seems like this one is actually working.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only being a week since I started taking it (I take 3 pills a day) and I already lost 5 pounds.&lt;br /&gt;I find that&#x27;s a very good result, considering that I didn&#x27;t do much changes in my diet and life style.&lt;br /&gt;I can say that so far I am very satisfies with the results!</li>
            <li> This product works and I have experienced no side effects. Just two capsules before a meal and you will feel more full so you eat less.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product. I have noticed a loss of inches more so than pounds. And am beging to feel vonfident in my weight loss because of this product!</li>
            <li> A waste of money...a waste of time....I would not ever buy this again or tell anyone else to get it</li>
            <li> Absolutely no benefit was obtained from this product.  Not recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been using this supplement for past few week and I see a huge difference. My weight is going down, I am so happy about that. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I was put on Antidepressants and Anticonvulsants for Fibromyalgia in April of this year. Went from 170-220 in a matter of 6 months or less from the combination. After getting back on Track from Fibromyalgia with the Guaifenesin Protocol, I stopped the meds and after exercising constantly and not shedding a pound I decided I needed help. After I started Rasberry Keytones for a couple months I weighed myself, I was down to 200. Not sure if I can contribute this all to the Raspberry keytones or from the medications no longer holding back my metabolism but the Ketones were sure to be a contributing factor.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is I am still on the Guaifenesin protocol for Fibromyalgia, it worked great for a long time, after a couple months on this product I am starting to get some symptoms back and not sure I should be taking this supplement with the protocol. But if I need it, I know where to find it.</li>
            <li> My order of Raspberry Keytone Platinum was shipped promptly and seems to work as expected. I take one when I wake up and seem to have more energy and one before each meal. I have reduced my food intake slightly and have lost about 4 pounds in the first week.</li>
            <li> I used these for a while, they help you reduce a few pounds like most things, but after that they didn&#x27;t seem to do anything. I went through 3 bottles at the recommended dosage. After I stopped using them the 20lbs came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a temporary fix.</li>
            <li> I have been using this supplement for 5 weeks now and I have been able to lose about 16 pounds on it. It was recommended to me by a friend and her strict advice was to take it as directed. I did just that and I noticed that it works better the longer you take it. I lost only 2 pounds on the first week and the following week it was 3 pounds. I am losing more every week. My advice for anyone who is thinking of trying this weight loss product is to religiously take it for a complete month and then evaluate the results. Do not be impatient and expect great results in a week, this is a supplement and not a magic potion.</li>
            <li> I have about 2 weeks taking this product and I am starting to see results.  I don&#x27;t have graving like I use to.  Its easy to take and I haven&#x27;t had any side effects.  First thing in the morning I take 1 pill and I follow up with some exercises I started doing the rockin body by shaun t .  I am starting to feel more energetic to me it&#x27;s awesome I recommended it to my sister and some other friends. I will keep you posted on my progress in about a month.</li>
            <li> I was shopping around for Raspberry Ketones and started reading the reviews and check on the reviewers as well. I wonder how many of these reviews are genuine.  There was 1 reviewer who wrote for the same product by different suppliers on the same day. I have added the pictures see it for yourselves.</li>
            <li> I got the product on time. It was as pictured. I started taking it as directed. I noticed a complete loss of appetite in the first few days.  Which did consequently result in weightloss.. Then I began experiencing headaches and high anxiety.  This was extreme. I ended up in e.r. With a anxiety attack. I stopped taking the product for a few days to get it out my system. Then I restarted by opening the capsules and pouring out about a third of the supplement and then reclosing the capsule and taking it. I have noticed less headaches and also more appetite. Be careful with such a high dosage of the product. The anxiety was real and it was serious. You may experience a rapid heartbeat or feel like your heart is pounding. Be sure to listen to your body !</li>
            <li> I purchased recently the Rasberry Ketone Platinum  capsules. The product arrived extremely fast.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is a well balanced and efficient formulation, as after using it only a week or so I feel charged with extra energy, and my pants already got at least one inch loose. No hints of side effects at all, and pleasant rassbery flavor. Compared to other similar products, the price is also good.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in a week! My exercise and eating routine was the same...even while going to the gym regularly.  I noticed that I feel more awake during the day and that&#x27;s without caffeine and no bad side effects.  So far so good, I&#x27;ll update with more results.</li>
            <li> I only started with one pill a day to make sure it agreed with me. You are supose to take it 2&#x27;x per day. I took it with a glass of water one half hour before a meal. When I took it, it felt like my digestive system was burning or on fire. It also gave me indigestion. It also felt like my food would not go down, like something was stuck in my esophagus. It also caused lower abdominal cramps and gas. I tried it for 5 days, stopped for 2, then tried it again for another 5 days. I did this for a total of 3 weeks just to make sure.  The reason I did this was because regular diet and exersize was not working. I still saw no weight loss. I sure wish it worked.</li>
            <li> This product definitely improved my energy levels. I am refilling my order. Thanks for the opportunity to try this for this cost.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me; no noticeable difference to encourage continue use.  Apparently my system is resistant.  Will need redirect my thinking.</li>
            <li> You can find me on facebook for proof that I&#x27;m real.  This product does work, it reduces appetite and stimulates weight loss.  The problem I&#x27;ve run into with trying different brands (I tried Eden Pond, RazTrim, and now this), is that &amp;#34;when&amp;#34; you take the product makes the difference between it working and not working.  All the products worked to &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; degree, but the potency and quality of the brand also makes a huge difference.  I&#x27;m not a fan of the smaller doses (100mg or 250mg).  I think 500mg and higher with a &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; version is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fake reviews are a problem I&#x27;ve noticed, but I&#x27;ve also noticed that if you look for a ratio of at least 10 to 1.  So if you have 100 reviews, there should be no more than 10 unhappy 1 star customers.  This ratio tends to reflect a higher level of truth to the reviews, given people who post negative reviews generally aren&#x27;t the fakers, in-fact this is how I buy all my products.  So look for a lot of reviews (at least 100), and look for the one with the smallest 1 star reviews.  Platinum currently holds this profile, and that&#x27;s why I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s best to take it upon waking, and mid to early afternoon.  If you take it later, expect a lot less results  You must eat &amp;#34;reasonably&amp;#34; well and exercise to get the full effects.  Additionally, taking it &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; meals, about 30 mins, on an empty stomach, drastically improves the appetite suppressing effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you take it with the meal, or after - expect poor results generally.  If you take it at bedtime, expect sleep difficulities as well though it wasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;consistently&amp;#34; a problem when I did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now remember, this is based only on my body.  You may have different results, but it seems a lot of people are reporting the same thing with this brand.</li>
            <li> I have been up and down the ladder with products, until I started taking this product. I have tried so many products over the last 2 years none proving to help me lose the weight I was looking to. They would either stop working or they would come with nasty side effects. My current goal is to lose around 40 pounds. The first handful of products I had tried  didn’t work that well for me and some of them gave me bad side effects. After taking this product for about 2 weeks i could feel it working the way I was expecting from a product like this. No side effects, increased energy, and better motivation to keep going in the gym. By the end of the 3 month I was up to 25 pounds loss. I am happy that I was able to find a product that worked for me and I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I was so excited and stoked to receive this product in the mail, hoping it&#x27;ll change my life instantly.  I read every review and did keep in mind that it is NO miracle pill ... However, I about finishing the 1st week (taking 2 pills a day) and notice a weird emotional feeling and I also don&#x27;t feel 100%, I actually feel slightly sick.  Not sure how to explain the sickness, its a little bit of nausea, chest congestion, etc. I havent felt or seen any results and I&#x27;m so disappointed.  On some days I did forget to take the 2nd pill through out the day but I&#x27;m hoping to see weight loss, energy, etc. like everyone else by the end of the 2nd week!  Something I did notice is loosing appetite, which is slightly a good thing.  I didn&#x27;t want to loose appetite, just curb my hunger.  Hoping to loose 15 lbs ! *CROSSED FINGERS*</li>
            <li> This is no miracle weight loss pill BUT it does work. I have lost 4 lbs in 1 week with no effort. Most importantly I have not changed my diet what so ever if anything I am eating MORE. They have no taste, no smell, and can be easily swallowed. My biggest weight loss problem is finding the time to eat right. When I finally do get the time to eat it is often not as healthy as I would like it to be (usually I&#x27;m starving at this point) and therefore my body absorbs the fat content like a sponge because I dumbly waited too long in between my meals (mostly because I prefer to wait and eat healthy and healthy choices are never easy to find). This product answers that problem for me and lets me eats more freely as it blocks the fat content in the food. I&#x27;m no longer waiting for that healthy choice as I feel more free to eat practically anything in sequence with this pill.</li>
            <li> Okay so I am 15 years old and female. Yes, you read that right. I have always been called fat or overweight and as you might guess, it is very hurtful and can lower your confidense greatly. I tried looking around for something to help me lose weight, and i came across these capsules. I was amazed that they actually worked! Just in the first 2-3 weeks i have lost 8 pounds! My clothes fit a bit better and i will continue to take these. I would recomend this product to anyone who would like to lose weight.</li>
            <li> I have been on weight watchers for almost one year and had been steadily losing weight until about Feb. In February I had come into a slump where I wasn&#x27;t losing weight. I decided to order Raspberry Ketone Platinum. After the first week of using the product I had begun to lose weight. I have lost 3 lbs already. Raspberry Ketone Platinum is the little extra boost I need to help me be successful in my weight loss. I highly recommend this product. No crash or side effects with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been 9 days, but so far I haven&#x27;t had any results. I already work-out but I wanted to get better results. No suppression of appetite, no increased energy, no weight loss. :(</li>
            <li> I started researching about raspberry ketones few months ago and zeroed on this product as this was the only clinical strength raspberry ketone available on Amazon and also manufactured right here in USA.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is I don&#x27;t feel jittery at all after taking this the first thing in the morning on empty stomach and have loads of energy for my workouts. I have lost 15 lbs so far in 6 weeks along with this supplement (2 capsules a day) and of course strict diet and exercise.</li>
            <li> I have used this product now for 2 weeks and have noticed a difference. My appetite has decreased a great deal. When I need that extra energy boost this pill gives that to me. I have no side affects from taking this at all. I would recommend this product to anyone who is wanting to lose weight and looking for a little more energy. Excited to see the end result after using this for a while. Taking this, eating healthier and daily exercise has made me feel a lot better!</li>
            <li> I am one of those dieters who has tried everything out there but my problem is simply that I lack willpower and portion control. This product so far has reduced my appetite and given me the strength to stop eating when I should.  I take 1 pill prior to breakfast and another prior to eating lunch and have noticeably cut down on my portions.  I also have noticed an increase in energy which has helped me begin to work out again.</li>
            <li> I had heard a lot about this product but wasn&#x27;t really sure if it would work or not. I really didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I was taking 1 in the morning and 1 at lunch and I didn&#x27;t feel any different. I was eating just like I always ate. But then I decided, since I have to take thyroid medicine first thing in the morning, I would start taking 1 before lunch and 1 before dinner.... I can honestly say, this has actually decreased my appetite. Anytime, I eat less, I always lose weight. So I am looking forward to some great results.</li>
            <li> I have has 2 c-sections back to back and was stuck at 155 for ever and didn&#x27;t lose a pound. I have been taking these for 4 days and have already lost 2 pound i am so excited. I also do a 5 minute ab video and a 14 minute cardio and thats it.. I cant wait to see the results after a month.. Good by size 13 hello size 5..</li>
            <li> I received the product right away, I just started using them and like it so far!  happy I found it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a few months ago in an effort to trim down for summer. At first I didn&#x27;t see obvious results except that i wasn&#x27;t as hungry, but after a week or two of taking the Raspberry Ketone and exercising I started to loose weight around my stomach and back. I lost about 4 lbs. a week and wasn&#x27;t hungry. The only drawback is that you have to wait about 30 min. to eat so therefore some planning is involved. This is a great product if you want to loose weight. I know a lot of people want a miracle that will just allow them to eat what they want and still loose. I don&#x27;t know if that exist and is a pretty lazy thought process. If you are willing to put in just a little effort this product will help you loose weight a lot faster than just sitting around and will exercise it works even faster.</li>
            <li> I got this after seeing all the rave reviews online and on Dr. Oz (who I love!!) and I have had no problems and results are amazing so far! I have been taking this as directed, twice a day 30 minutes before meals and after two weeks lost about 5 pounds with no big change in diet and exercise. Will update with end results after I finish both bottles. I do realize there is no miracle to weight loss, however, I feel like this helps a little bit. Crossing fingers and will continue taking this supplement!</li>
            <li> I received my shipment and they were exactlly what I expected been tak&lt;br /&gt;ing for a while and have seen great results.will order again.thank you</li>
            <li> I started to use raspberry Ketones two months ago.EXCELLENT!!!!! I didn&#x27;t change my diet or exercise commitment, but I lossed inches. I could feel the difference in my clothes. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I was actually pretty skeptical that this would help with weight loss but after using the product for several months now I am a believer!  I started using this product a couple of months ago and have now lost 22lbs and am feeling great.  Because I have a toddler at home, I find it very difficult to find time to exercise so I decided I would just try eating healthier and I combined this with the Raspberry Ketone Platinum and have had fabulous results.  I would highly recommend trying this product to assist in your weight loss efforts.  I take one capsule when I get up and 1 capsule 30 minutes before lunch and I continue to have great results.  I plan to continue using this product along with healthier eating until I meet my weight loss goal (18lbs to go)!</li>
            <li> I have been taking the Raspberry Ketone pills for the last 3 weeks and can really tell the difference. It seems to help with curbing my appetite and I am slowly losing the weight without going to the gym. I strongly suggest this product to anyone looking to get a little help burning the extra pounds.</li>
            <li> I love my Raspberry Ketones Platinum.  I have been taking it for over 8 months now along with a couple other supplements and it has helped me to lose over 40 lbs since July.  With no exercise at all.  I have only been taking my vitamins and watching with I eat a little bit.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Just recently ordered some for my mother in law to try and I will review that once I hear how she likes it.  But overall its a great weight loss aid.  Its not a miracle pill so you have to put a little effort forth but as with anything, a little effort goes a long way when you have such a great helper.  Get your skinny on and order yourself a bottle of Raspberry Ketones today.  You wont be sad you did.</li>
            <li> I waited to evaluate this product.  I thought I would give it some time to work.  Now that I&#x27;ve gone through one bottle and about 1/3 way through the second one, I have to say that this product does absolutely nothing.  I took as directed on the bottle, and saw absolutely no change in my weight or in my appetite.  I did not change my eating or exercise habits, testing to see if this product would do anything.  It doesn&#x27;t.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Stick with a good diet and an exercise plan instead.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my friends were having terrific results - one lost 15 lbs and the other 7 without effort.  I am just beginning to use the product but already feel the effects.  I am drinking more water and feel less hungry.  Am excited to continue using the Raspberry Ketones.</li>
            <li> My wife and I are getting ready for several endurance events and this product is showing positive results combined with our mindful lifestyle choices - it&#x27;s not all in a pill but it is a valuable tool.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and I&#x27;m definitely seeing the results, getting a few extra pounds off. Be patient! Awesome seller, with super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This product made me feel like I had to go to the hospital.  I thought I was having a heart attack.  I got dizzy, rapid heartbeat, weakness.  I only took one.  I believe it&#x27;s way too strong for me.  Sure, it will make you not want to eat because you&#x27;re too sick and scared.  I guess a person could open the capsule and just use half, but right now I&#x27;m too scared to even touch it.</li>
            <li> Before taking this product i was always very tired and had no motivation to even work out.  When I started taking raspberry ketone platinum I could immediately feel the difference.  I wasn&#x27;t eating as much and with a steady workout routine i can feel the difference.  All you have to do is have balanced meals and a semi exercise schedule and the ketones do the rest.</li>
            <li> I find this product to be effective. I have a lot working against me - am on antidepressants which made me gain 40 lbs and I have been in menopause for over 10&#x27;years. My metabolism is ridiculous and my appetite way out of control. I started drinking healthy shakes in the morning, preceded by the raspberry ketones and a green tea supplement. I suddenly realized that I was not hungry for dinner and had no sugar cravings. ( a miracle) I have started exercising but very slowly since I am so out of shape. It has been two weeks and I have lost 10 lbs. which is really a lot for me. Normally, with exercise, I could lose about 2 lbs. a month. In conclusion, I do feel these pills have influenced my appetite for sure and for that alone I am grateful. I will see how the weight loss goes as I continue on the same regimen. I have had one unpleasant side effect which is why I gave this product a 4 star rating. I find the pills cause a lot of acidity in my stomach. I have had to take Pepcid to get some relief. If you notice any stomach discomfort, it could be acidity. No other reviews have commented on this, so maybe it&#x27;s just me. I don&#x27;t normally suffer from an acid stomach so I know it is due to the pills. They are quite strong. But I will still continue to take them because I am thrilled with the results I have had. Losing my appetite is absolutely HUGE for me. Try it, give it a chance, then decide.</li>
            <li> I have been doing Insanity for a few months but haven&#x27;t been the happiest with how fast the weight is coming off.  I love Insanity and it is working, just not fast enough for me and my lifestyle.  So I tried these and am very pleased with them,  It took two weeks to see any visual results, but they are working great!  They seem to really help when I slip off my diet; keep me where I was before pigging out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try them.  You will not be sorry.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on diet pills.  These are all you need.  I take three per day, one before/with every meal.  Best money I have ever spent on any sort of supplement.</li>
            <li> Faithfully took it - 2 capsules per day - for a month . Did not do a thing! I didn&#x27;t drop even a pound, at the end of the trial I have actually gained a pound. The pills also gave me some heartburn and a feeling of being full (the \\&quot;I overate\\&quot; kind of full), which was not pleasant at all. Since I&#x27;ve stopped taking them, I have actually dropped around 3-4 pounds, without changing my routine. I eat relatively healthy, exercise actively about twice a week, and weigh around 125 lbs now, after stopping the pills. I decided to try the ketones after reading rave reviews about them burning fat, and being over 40, I had some stubborn winter fat to get rid of. I&#x27;m still inclined to give the product the benefit of the doubt - maybe it WOULD work on people who have to lose more. But I would not bet on it. I kind of think this is a scam with no scientific proof or clinical trials, and we are the little with mice:) Don&#x27;t waste your money, just go on a stricter eating plan and exercise some. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Worked good. I did not disturb stomach or have any jittery effects. Seemed to help with appetite and energy levels.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using this for a few months and in my opinion this supplement has definitely helped both of us lose and keep weight off! We started dieting and exercising in mid-January with slow results; a friend recommended taking Keytone as a supplement and we noticed a difference within the first week! So far, with the help of this product, I&#x27;ve lost over 35 pounds; starting at 200 I&#x27;m not a little under 165 and I feel great; my wife has lost close to 20 pounds too. I highly recommend this awesome weight loss aid!</li>
            <li> I really love this product! Will purchase again! It does help you lose weight. Ive lost 2-3 this week. Im going to continue using this product</li>
            <li> I have a hard time losing weight this product delivered. On the days I overate I didn&#x27;t gain tons of weight. On my normal days where I exercised and watched my calorie intake, I lost lbs. There are no side effects and for me with a sensitive stomach it was great. I would recommend this product to everyone - and already have.</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because it really worked on me... I purchased this few months ago (February 24, to be exact), and it helped me loose some pounds... I take it only once a day,immediately when I wake up in the morning and wait 30mins. before eating breakfast.. I noticed that it gives me energy the whole day,and as a nurse I&#x27;m on my feet all day,and still have energy to go to the gym after long hours of work. It does curve my appetite as well.. I recommend this product to anyone who wishes to lose some pounds..</li>
            <li> Pretty good lost 25pd</li>
            <li> All this product did for me is give me the runs. It doesn&#x27;t seem the be the biggest fad anymore anyway.</li>
            <li> I have begun using this product and seeing progress with diet and exercise. Looking forward to long term results with patience.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for about 2 weeks now and I have lost 2 lbs so far. I am only looking to lose about 8-10 lbs total and do not have much to lose so I think this product is working pretty well. It does not have all the other added fillers that some similar products have and the difference is definitely noticeable when taking it. Over all I am quite pleased and would recommend this product to another customer.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with product!  I used to have cravings for food throughout the day but with this I actually don&#x27;t have any afternoon cravings!</li>
            <li> This is a good product and it has worked for me. when used with green coffee extract it has helped me lose weight and inches in only a short time without having to add excess exercising. Imagine what would come off if I stepped it up and took a walk on a treadmill or outside. may not work for everyone, but it has worked for me!</li>
            <li> I got these about a month ago. Including these with my cardio and strength workouts, showing fast results. I recently started to take one when i wake up in the morning and then one before lunch and dinner. I recommend taking one a day and slowly working your way up to two or three. Seems to help your body adjust easier. These are stronger than what you can buy at a Walgreens or a grocery store. As long as you are keeping yourself active then it will show nice results. Dont expect it to change you overnight. You still have to work at it just like any weightloss base pills. These are just a lot better for your body and no additional chemicals are in the pill except for the gelatin caseing its in. Very Natural product. I have lost 16 pounds with the help of these in about a months time so far. I eat fairly healthy, greens, pasta, fruits and meats. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I like the convenience of taking it first of all and then it really does what it promises which to increase one&#x27;s metabollism.  Regular exercise helps also, but it the product is an adjunct to a weight control program.</li>
            <li> Product was received promptly and I have been using it for about 1 month.&lt;br /&gt;I have lost 5-6 pounds in the first month while taking this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks,</li>
            <li> My experience has been pretty good with the product.  I have lost 5 pounds and my daughter has lost 10 pounds after the first bottle.  I didn’t feel any anxiety or jitters at all.  My appetite is a little curbed due to the product.  I expect that I will experience more weight loss as I increase my physical activity. Looks like it is a slow and steady weight loss not overnight.  Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this product and so far I love it.  I had tried a lesser strength and didn&#x27;t get the results I had hoped.  This strength is great and very easy to maintain.  I&#x27;ve had no adverse side effects like I did on the other product and I can see why this one has gotten such great reviews.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. She and I noticed that she has reduced her appetite. She still eats the food she likes but she feels that she gets full faster hence she never finishes the food. She&#x27;s now eating in small portions and she noticed that she has reduced her weight by 2 pounds in 2 weeks which is still better than gaining more weight. She also feels like she&#x27;s more energetic now.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product. It gives you energy and controls your appetite, also the pills don&#x27;t have any after tastes</li>
            <li> I have taken alot of different products to help me lose weight and this seems to work the best. It helps to keep me from being so hungry and having those cravings between meals. I took it first thing in the morning and again before lunch. If I was going to be working out I would take one before working out and I felt like I was burning more calories during my workout. I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Eat less, exercise and then you will shed weight... end of story. No magic pill or DVD will replace common sense.</li>
            <li> I jump from Raspberry Ketones different brands. This one you have to give it a chance, but when it kicks in, Wow, the energy I had and it helped me to get over that &amp;#34;i&#x27;m stuck&amp;#34; hurddle. I would reccommend anyone that is trying to lose weight to try this. I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> After taking as directed for over a month, I have not seen any significant drop in weight or decrease in belly fat as this product claims. I&#x27;ve only lost about three pounds in 4 weeks, and my waist line has not changed. I participate two hours a week in cardio exercise &amp; eat a pretty well balanced diet. The pills do seem to keep my craving for sweets to a minimum. There are no side effects, shakes, or after taste.</li>
            <li> Started using it two weeks ago and have lost 3 pounds. I like the burst of energy, without the ADHD that usually comes with other products.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Started using this product on March 1, was very hopeful from all the positive feedback found all over the Internet. Well, nothing happened so far, I think I&#x27;ve even gained a pound or so.</li>
            <li> After two months use of this product, I have lost a total of 30 lbs!!!I have zero side effects and at the same time I have so much energy and stamina throughout the day. I love the results I have seen and I will continue to support the benefits from using this product. If you want to get over your weight plateau, you need to use this product! You will be amazed!!</li>
            <li> I recieved this very quickly, I have used it for a week &amp; have already lost 7 lbs. Im looking forward to more results. I will be ordering this again</li>
            <li> I high hopes for this product but all I had were headachs days. Once I stoped I felt better. I did lose a few pounds but I was missirable most of the time. This product worked for other people it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I tried another brand of raspberry ketone, but this one is much better- it is a real appetite suppressant and energy enhancer. It does have an effect on fat absorption and I will be buying this again, until I&#x27;ve lost the weight I want.  Recommended.  I am exercising and watching my diet.  [[ASIN:B0093OHLM4 Raspberry Ketone Platinum (2 Bottles) - Clinical Strength - All Natural Fat Burning, Weight Loss, Diet Supplement, 60 capsules]]</li>
            <li> I was already on a low cal diet and when I started this product. It did not do anything to aid in my weight loss.</li>
            <li> I know the all powerful OZ said it works with no side effects but my daughter and myself both experenced side effects of swollen cartalege and extreme pain in all our joints. this after two weeks became so severe we finally stoped taking it and the symptoms went away, no weight loss. Buyer be ware.</li>
            <li> Works really well lost 5 lbs in first week. Going to start working out with it and should drop more!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have lost 21 lbs In 2 months. I dont have time to exercise and it has all been due to the raspberry&lt;br /&gt;keatone platinum. After the first 2 bottles ran out I tried raspberry ketones premium and did not loose a single pound. I haven&#x27;t gained any either thankfully. So after 2 1/2 weeks of no results with the raspberry keatone premium I reordered the&lt;br /&gt;raspberry keatone platinum.  I have never had any success with &amp;#34;diet pills&amp;#34; before so I was pretty skeptical but I have had amazing results with this supplement. And NO I DO NOT WORK FOR THE COMPANY!</li>
            <li> I have been taking it for three weks.  No change in diet.  Still excercising and I have managed to GAIN three pounds.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles but a little weight loss would have made me feel some encouragement.  I am not a junk food eater.  I stick with whole grains and lean protein for dinner. Oatmeal for lunch and yogurt for breakfast. So where did I go wrong?...Expecting a pill to give my extra ten pounds the push I was hoping for.  What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> This product really works! I will admit I was a little bit skeptical when my friend tried it, but after seeing how much weight she had lost using the Creative Bioscience Raspberry Ketones, I decided to give them a try. My weight loss was not sudden or dramatic, but it has been very noticeable and steady. I do not feel as hungry and have noticed that I seem to have a higher energy level too, which has made it easier to avoid eating as much and helps with being more active. I would highly recommend this product and will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! Gives me energy and suppresses my appetite.The energy helps me stay more active and workout. I have definitely seen a differnce on the scale as well. I take a capsule when I wake up, one 30 mins before lunch, and then one again 30 mins before dinner. I highly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe what others said about this product working without exercising but it does.  Do NOT expect miracles, but it does change your desire for food. I can stay away from sweets and junk food much more easily. When you add physical exercise to the program, you will see results.  I have received my second order. They are my new best friend! I take 2 one half hr. before breakfast and 1 a half hr. before dinner. The effects last all day &amp; nite. So far that combination is working for me.</li>
            <li> I was excited to learn of the product.  I started with taking 1 capsul in the morning and 1 in the evening.  I did not notice any substantial difference in my appitite or in weight loss.  I read the reviews and it appeared that perhaps I should increase my capsul intake in the morning to two.  Almost immediately I notice a sharp pain in my abdomine.  I had previously noticed a discomfort prior to taking two capsuls.  When I stopped using the Keytones the pain went away.  I tried to send the ununsed portion of the capsuls back for a credit but the time had expired.  I have approx 1 bottle and one half of unused product.</li>
            <li> I noticed a complete loss of appetite, I am not hungry which is very good for me. I am taking it 10 days , I lost 2.2 pounds and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> At first two weeks, it did nothing and I didn&#x27;t lose a pound. I almost wanted to quit but then I saw my weight and my appetite reducing. After the first bottle, I lost 8 pounds. No side effects and my friend also bought these after I recommended them. Just love the product and I&#x27;m going to buy it whenever I want to lose weight!</li>
            <li> It was like taking caffeine.  I threw them away.  I took them for a week and the longer I took them, the more nervous I got.  I presently take a beta-blocker and must be careful with OTC medications.  This is not a product I would recommend.</li>
            <li> wow! is understatement..didn&#x27;t work for me at all&lt;br /&gt;maybe for some but not for me if anything&lt;br /&gt;wish i could get my money back</li>
            <li> I first heard about this product on Dr. Oz and decided to give it a try.  I felt &amp;#34;stalled&amp;#34; in my weight loss even though I work-out regularly.  I started by taking one pill before breakfast and lunch.  My appetite was suppressed and I lost inches.  I continue to work-out regularly and eat healthy.  I increased to one pill before each meal, and continued to see weight loss results and inches lost.  I now take one pill before breakfast and lunch and two before dinner.  This is working for me.  Will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> After having several surgeries and being on steroids and having to cut my workouts down to almost nothing, I gained about 60lbs within 9 months. After being able to workout and exercise again, I was able to lose 25lbs easily on my own, but I&#x27;m not allowed to workout as intensely as I used to and &#x27;hit a wall&#x27;. I did Medi Weight Loss and was able to drop another 25 lbs and once again, was at a standstill. I took these pills for less than a month and I am now below my pre-surgery weight. These pills were amazing...despite the fact that I tend to cheat on my diet from time to time. On average I was losing 3-5 lbs per week, but that was with a healthy diet (1 cheat day per week) and regular exercise (750-1000 calories burned per day). Love this product and will continue to purchase more.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by these pills. I have not lost any weight, but it usually takes me quite a bit longer than most people to loose due to a metabolic disorder, but I will continue to keep taking them because there don&#x27;t seem to be any side effects, and I think they make me less hungry throughout the day. Not like an appetite suppressant, just seem to burn though my food slower. No jitters.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 4 1/2 months.  It has really helped me to burn off fat.  I&#x27;ve been using it along with a low carb/high protein (lean) diet and have lost 4 pants sizes.  I haven&#x27;t really been doing any formal exercise, just trying to park farther away, etc. With what I have read limiting carbs and giving your body lean protein helps burn fat and this product really increases the effect.  People that haven&#x27;t seen me in a couple of months often don&#x27;t recognize me!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only one I will buy.  For me this is the only one that works.  It keeps my metabolism moving quicker...and I love that!</li>
            <li> I recieved it yesterday and started using it. I can already tell the difference between this product and a 15$ bottle of raspberry ketones I had brought earlier on amazon. This is much stronger and the stuff really works great. I am feeling a difference in metabolism and my hunger is not as much. looking forward to using this product in future as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered the product and it came within the delivery dates specified.  I started taking 1 capsule in the morning and one at night before bed. I lost about 4 lbs in 1.5 weeks.  Its been about 1 month now and I&#x27;m down 10 lbs and have lots of energy.  I did start my exercise routine which includes Yoga and requires some sustained energy to complete 1.5 hrs. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this Raspberry Ketone product and will order again before my supplies run low.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months and it works great</li>
            <li> After trying other Raspberry Ketone products  and having some effect, I decided to try this brand because it is stronger and am very pleased with the results.  I lost fifteen pounds during November despite Thanksgiving and really believe this product helps my metabolism.  I am a mature woman and have struggled with my weight for years. Now you have to exercise four or five days a week for at least 45 minutes and eat sensibly to lose weight, but you don&#x27;t have to starve. If occasionally  you overindulge, it helps from gaining any weight back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If does give you more energy and helps me to eat less and feel full.  I take three capsules a day about an hour before meal time.&lt;br /&gt;But don&#x27;t take too late in the evening or you may have a little trouble getting to sleep, because you don&#x27;t get so tired.  Have cut way back on any caffeine or energy drinks, because I don&#x27;t need them anymore.  I will continue to use and recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product. I would not recommend it. Save your money. Did not work as expected. Ended up throwing the product out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last 3 months and I love it!  There are no side effects, I have more energy, and I&#x27;ve lost weight and inches a lot faster than just working out alone.  It ships quickly and is always packaged well.  I will continue to use this product and will highly recommend it to all my friends.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have. Less stomach troubles since taking Rasberry Keytone.  I will continue to take it for as long as I can get it.</li>
            <li> I have now been taking these for about 2 weeks and man I&#x27;m already starting to see the difference. I have changed my diet quite a bit also but I feel more full after I eat and I have a lot more energy. Definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Bought for 2 people.  Neither was impressed or continued using it. Both parties thought it was more hype than substance.</li>
            <li> Can feel an increase in energy level after taking one capsule a day.  Feel less hungry during the day as well.  Take it in the morning after breakfast to prevent any digestive problems.  Lost one pound the first two days so will keep taking.  Feel like my metabolism has been raised noticeably.  No jitters or difficulty sleeping.  Just actually feel like my body has switched to &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; mode and is working more efficiently.  Great so far!</li>
            <li> I added these pills (taken as directed on the bottle) along with Vitamin D3 to my daily regiment at around the same time.  I can definitely say that the Raspberry Ketone has reduced or eliminated my body&#x27;s tendency to retain a lot of water and, thus, my mid-section has noticeably flattened.  Combined with Vitamin D3, I&#x27;ve had a tremendous boost in my energy level.  As others have stated, the pills do not provide miraculous results, but can definitely aid with weight loss, particulary when used with a healthy diet.</li>
            <li> I am giving these pills more time but as of now, taking together with the Green Coffee Bean, I have had no results.</li>
            <li> I was a bit leery to try yet another weight-loss product. However, I am really glad I did. I don&#x27;t ever weight myself. I typically go by the way my clothes fit. After using one bottle, I have noticed the mound in my stomach is actually shrinking! Plus, my appetite has definitely curbed. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a burst of energy but last week was the first time in months that instead of walking for exercise, I am now running! I am taking 2 pills a day (one in the morning and one during lunch). It&#x27;s a natural supplement with no side effects. I am pleased :)</li>
            <li> I like this product. I have been using already 3 days and I lost 0,7 kilograms. I hope that I will loose more weight</li>
            <li> This is a great product that I was originally recommended to by my neighbor. I am a member of the Armed Forces so weight control is always important and sometimes you need a quick way to drop a few pounds. Well in one month of use I lost 18 pounds and two inches off my waist. I was completely impressed so now I continue to use the product hoping to soon hit my goal weight.</li>
            <li> I love this product.! I will continue to order...I didn&#x27;t necessarily see the weight drop but I saw the inches lost.! I like the energy that I have throughout the day with no crash....even if I do not see any weight loss or more inches lost, I will continue for the natural energy.</li>
            <li> I have noticed an increase in my energy levels and a reduction in appetite since I started taking this supplement twice a day - one when I wake up with a glass of water and one before lunch. I am less fatigued after my visit to the gym in the morning.</li>
            <li> I found this product after hearing about raspberry ketone and its role in weight loss, and although I was hesitant to purchase yet another weight-loss supplement, I am SO GLAD I did. For the first few days I didn&#x27;t notice any weight loss, but that was fine - I was more worried about possible side effects of feeling jittery or nervous. Not only did I experience none of the side effects I usually have with weight-loss supplements, but I actually started to see results before the end of the first week. I am now into my 3rd week and am going shopping for smaller-sized jeans today!!</li>
            <li> So I have tried several companies&#x27; weight loss supplements since last summer, and let me tell you what. Raspberry Ketones from these guys are my best friend and secret weapon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first heard about Raspberry Ketones and its effect through the Dr. Oz show and was intrigued, so I began researching. After finding the best type of RK formula, I purchased the duo bottle set here. My wife and I have been taking these supplements together (1 bottle each) and after 1 month of taking them twice a day, she has dropped 10.5 lbs, and I have dropped 21 lbs. I have also measured my body before and just recently after running out of supplements, and have lost 6.5 inches total off my body. My appetite has lessened, I&#x27;m in a much better mood almost always, my sleep has improved, and lastly, the numbers just keep dropping. When I started taking these pills (March 22nd) I weighed in at 196.6 lbs and so far I&#x27;m down 2 pant sizes and weighed in today at an astonishing 175.6 lbs. Thank you so much, and I look forward to losing another 20 lbs with your help.</li>
            <li> Koreans for the most part, are very thorough in their research.  A very good friend of mine requested this for her birthday. I was  convinced that she was making a wise choice; due to my lack of knowledge of this product.  After seeing the results after a month and half; I&#x27;m now a believer in the power of Raspberry Ketone! Second time to purchase a Raspberry Ketone product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  This product did absolutely nothing for me.  Not recommended.&lt;br /&gt;(then again, what do you expect . . . if it came in a bottle everyone would be doing it).</li>
            <li> The following is a statement from my personal experience when trying the product. I have a body that rebels every dieting pill. I&#x27;ve tried many, some of which are advertised on TV. Some of them worked but I didn&#x27;t like the jittery feeling because it was too much. With this one I didn&#x27;t have the same feeling of being awake all the time especially when I went to bed. The latest I took them was 5 pm though. I took 2 pills in the morning and 2 in the afternoon before my main meals starting next week. I lost about 3 lbs in the first week and 2 every following week. Once again, this is how \\&quot;my\\&quot; body works. It may do more for you especially if you workout as I must say I didn&#x27;t. I only watched what I ate and cut my serving size by half. I took the first bottle and started the second one. It&#x27;s not a miracle pill and you should watch what you eat if you want the pills to work. I know it helped me loose more because my weight dropped slower without the pills. Overall, I recommend this product and will continue to use it till I reach my goal of 20 lb :)</li>
            <li> I have heard a lot of good things about Raspberry Ketones so I decided to try them. I took them according to the directions including the 3rd pill before dinner. It definitely gave me energy throughout the day and curbed my appetite in the afternoon/evening. I also felt I was able to really push through an intense workout easier than before. Been using these for two weeks and starting to see results! I would recommend these!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only a week and I already feel and see changes in my body. I lost 4 pounds in the first week and I did not make any changes to my diet or lifestyle.</li>
            <li> Down eight pounds so far. This product gives a steady energy unlike other products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste time with products that are less expensive and loaded with fillers. Buy the best. This is it.</li>
            <li> Product has no side effects.  It is starting to work and am losing weight.  Smells good too....I feel much more energetic with this product.  Will use both bottles and leave a follow up</li>
            <li> I just started taking this product and so far, it&#x27;s good...no side effects whatsoever.  My appetite definitely went down pretty good.  In terms of weight loss, I think it&#x27;s early to tell but given that it&#x27;s suppressing my appetite, I can see how this will probably work.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been taking these raspberry ketones for a month now. So far I&#x27;ve lost about 9 pounds. I definitely feel it suppresses my appetite.</li>
            <li> Just started on this for a couple of days so too soon to give a review on its effect on weight reduction.  However, I have noticed in the last couple of nights, since I started taking one pill in the evening (6pm or so), I don&#x27;t have the usual junk food craving I usually get around 10pm-11pm.  If this can help me stop my night snack, I am confident this will result in weight loss. YMMV</li>
            <li> I love that this product helps to curb my appetite in the morning, afternoon and evening. I also like the fact that it is an all natural product. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I started taking this product about 3weeks ago and I have lost 4lbs so far. I have to say it really does work because I have not changed my diet and work out the same amount of days in the week. I believe the pills got me over my plateau that I was stuck in for 2 months at the same weight. Also I like the fact there are no side effects at all except for loosing weight :) I definately would recommend these pills.</li>
            <li> I waited until I completed a full 30 day bottle of this product because I know that it takes at least that long to see results... to be fair. This did absolutely nothing for me! Nothing like other reviews.. no splurge of energy.. no appetite serpresant ... no weight loss what so ever! I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay with my own money.. used an Amazon gift card. Was really hoping that this would work but for some reason it didn&#x27;t do a thing for me! Won&#x27;t be making future purchases! If I could give No Stars I would!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 10 days and have already noticed a difference. I have lost 5 pounds.  It has given me more energy too! I will continue using these long term. They smell great and I have had no side effects.  I would highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I have only just received my first bottle of Raspberry Keytone Platinum, but wanted to leave a few opening comments. I am a Low-Carb dieter who lost 45 pounds in 2012 and is working on another 25 this year. I am NOT interested in quick weight loss programs, but more of the 1 pound a week on average sort. Slow and steady wins MY weight loss race. Many of my friends had suggested that I give this product a try and the reviews of this specific brand looked very good, so I placed my opening order. Because I track my daily weight &amp; body fat on a digital WiFi Scale and track my daily activity on a WiFi body monitor I am in a pretty good position to see if this really makes any difference in my general weight loss &amp;#34;Slope&amp;#34; on my monthly graph. In 30 days I will report back and update this post with actual results.</li>
            <li> By taking 2 pills a day I am down a pound or so in 1 week.  I was skeptical but so far so good.  I am careful about too much junk but really have not changed diet too drastically.  No jitters or side effects and coffee bothers me so I know I am sensitive to just about anything .  May be the perfect thing for stubborn 5 or 10 lbs !!!&#x27;m</li>
            <li> So far so good, i  notice my appetite going down and combined with exercise I&#x27;ve seen a lost in weight. I highly recommend this product! I&#x27;ve been taking it 2x a day for the last few weeks and can&#x27;t wait to continue with it!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any weight loss, but definitely have good energy. The product was shipped quick and was a good price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for one week while starting an exercise program and I&#x27;ve lost 3 lbs. I&#x27;ve tried other weight loss supplements,  but didn&#x27;t like that they made me feel really jittery. I believe this is helping with my weight loss goals.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Well, my honest opinion is that I love the Raspberry Ketone Platinum. I was actually amazed&lt;br /&gt;that it actually works! I was skeptical reading up on this new craze but have been impressed with the results. It increasing becomes more and more effective as you take them. I found my metabolism seriously increased after about 10 days. I&#x27;ll keep using these for sure.</li>
            <li> It actually really works. Granted I haven&#x27;t lost as much as most people did but I have been losing weight . Also it does help with your appetite. I would def buy again</li>
            <li> We received this Raspberry Keytone 9 days ago on April 1st. My wife has lost 2.6 lbs in these 9 days. My wife has been on Weight Watchers for awhile now and she has been at a stand still on her weight the last couple of months until this past 9 days. We are hoping this is going to help jump start her weight lose again where she will be at her goal weight.  From other peoples comments make sure you use this 1/2 hour before eating to get the most effect from it.  I have nothing negative to say about this product at this time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product alongside with mild regular exercises and lost weight (6 lbs on the fourth bottle)&lt;br /&gt;I can fairly say that this product works and would recommend it to anyone who would like to lose weight healthily.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping is very fast! Awesome product!</li>
            <li> For reference, I am 5&#x27;2, now 113 lbs, and a 24 year old pastry chef who only gets exercise from going up and down stairs.  I eat sugar all day!  Not exactly a healthy lifestyle, but its a job I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve taken 1 pill a day, sometimes skipping it solely because I forget to in the morning (I hit the snooze button far too often).  Its been less than two weeks but I&#x27;ve actually dropped four pounds already!  And even better, my fiance has noticed a slimmer waist since it has gone down 1 1/2 inches!  For a guy to notice something like that is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try and bump it up to the recommended two pills per day dosage, but so far I&#x27;m really happy.  Yes it is a little pricey and I was leery of having to buy two bottles in case they didn&#x27;t work out.  I may try out the green coffee bean capsules in addition to the raspberry ketones but that depends if I can&#x27;t reach my target weight solely with them.  I do experience the occasional raspberry burp and my appetite has decreased slightly.  No change in energy levels though.  Maybe once I take two-three pills a day I&#x27;ll notice something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try these out!  And don&#x27;t cheap out and buy the non-clinical strength versions and expect amazing results.  You really do need the 600mg to see a difference.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but these pills really work.  They slim like promised.  Be sure to take 2 day (per instructions).</li>
            <li> I received these earlier than expected and was pleasantly surprised when I opened them and noticed a nice smell (unlike other capsules) and even a Raspberry taste when swallowing them.! I am on day 5 now and feel great and have lost 2lbs so far.! My appetite is much less than it was before taking these, and I feel like I am more alert and have more energy than I have in a long time.! I would definitely recommend these and I will be continuing to purchase more.!</li>
            <li> Im always trying something new to lose weight. I took this product half hour before my workout and before dinner. I drank nothing but water and ate a sensible diet. I did see some results but nothing drastic as they claim. No side effects which is a plus. I recommend that you drink a lot of water, the capsules are bigger than Im used to so washing it down with lots of water helps.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and it helped with loosing weight.  It also functions as a motivator to stay on track.  Took the pills 2 times a day as directed.  Pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I can feel this products  superior ingredients working moments after taking them. I have not weighed since I started training, but I noticed and feel the difference in my waist line and physical appearance. I like the easy to swallow capsules and the lasting effects produce by the fat burning formula. I will test this product and its results thoroughly and report my positive findings to others who seek assistance in losing weight quickly and safely. I&#x27;m three week into my testing and so far I&#x27;m impressed. I will continue report and recommend based on my findings! I feel this product works great for me and plan to tell my friends to give it a try!</li>
            <li> Raspberry Ketone is now widely accepted supplement, and due to its abundance in the market, it is very, very hard to identify good ones from ordinary and even bad ones. Good ones are defined by 1. 100 percent natural, 2. high concentration, 3. safe production process. These three conditions allow us to take high and timely dosage for long term, which is the key to enjoy the full potential of raspberry ketone. Even after you reach your target weight or BMI, it is even more important to keep them, so “long term” is also important. In addition, raspberry is a fruit common in American and many other countries’ diet, and a person like me who are skeptical about taking high dosage of natural but uncommon fruits and herbs found in jungles. Raspberry Ketone Platinum satisfies all my criteria above, and I take it regularly - in particular I make sure I take it before 1) I exercise more than usual, 2) the occasions of likely overeating and fewer choices of food, such as party, long flight, trip and etc... 3) the weight loss or BMI drop reach plateau, 4) I get busy and a bit tired of being health conscious. These four are the moments when you should make most of your diet motivation, or when you should avoid the risk of rebound. My weight loss and fitness proceed sometimes fast ( - 5 pounds / week ), and slower in other times (- 2 pounds / month), yet most importantly, never stop improving and became significantly more efficient after I switched to this product from other Raspberry Ketone product(s). Again, safe, high and timely dosage is the key, and this product meets all my criteria. I recommend this product to all health-conscious people.</li>
            <li> I took this product faithfully for 5 weeks, and gained weight and inches.  So did my husband who can usually lose weight much easier than I can.  I am not happy with the product and have discontinued using it as has my husband.  I looked at all of the products available and selected this one because it was billed as Clinical Strength.  Not worth my money.</li>
            <li> I combined it with a low cal diet and more exercise so I am not sure if its the ketones or me.&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking 2 a day for about 5 weeks. Went down a size.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!  It has improved my energy and I&#x27;m on my way to substantial weight loss!  Finally, a product that makes losing weight a little easier!!!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am a male and overweight 5ft 7 &amp; 266 pounds. I like you have seen all the stuff on Tv about how great this stuff is, the doctor Oz, newspaper, radio, etc. I thought another weight loss hype story to sell another herb. from some foreign country.  Anyway to make a long story short, I thought I would give it a try, it wasn&#x27;t that expensive, and wasn&#x27;t going to hurt me if it didn&#x27;t work. First I will tell you my eating habits are horrible. I don&#x27;t eat breakfast, just 4 cups of coffee. Around noon I grab a snack of potato chips, pretzels, peanuts, or in other words junk food. About 1pm I am ready to take a break from working and have a beer or two, hell if I am sweating hard it might be 6 beers. I do exercise about 30 minutes a day, elliptical, rowing machine, &amp; weights. I am retired and spend at least 4 hours a day studying the stock market and investing. Next I don&#x27;t cook, about 2:30 every day I go to eat at some restaurant, no fast foods, I change restaurants every day. I leave the restaurants full and satisfied, so everything is fine. I set down about 7:pm and start watching tv, that&#x27;s when I get hungry again and start eating everything, I can find, like peanut butter, Bologna or Cheese sandwiches. I never have been a chocolate or sweet eating person just food loaded with calories and fat. I started taking this Raspberry keytone 1 week ago. I took, 1 pill, first thing in the morning with 8oz of water. I took a second pill at 7:pm with 8oz of water, and guess what I didn&#x27;t get hungry or raid the refrigerator, instead I ate a apple, or orange, watermelon, strawberries, stuff that was good for me. It was all I wanted, I didn&#x27;t want Peanut butter, or Bologna or Cheese sandwiches, I just wanted something simple, I ate all the good things before, and all the bad things also. After 1 week I lost 6 pounds, that may not sound like a earth shattering loss to you but for me it is a start, I don&#x27;t know if it will continue, but I can tell you it curbed my appetite at night, which was a big problem for me. Also I didn&#x27;t give up my beer or junk snacks in the middle of the day, I am working on that. I am not a expert about this or have any connections to this company, but if it worked for me it should work for anyone, no one could have all the bad habits I have. Have a great day and if you try it, I hope it works for you, like it has worked for me so far. It is still too early for me to know if it will continue, but I will let you know my results later, good or bad.&lt;br /&gt;Jack</li>
            <li> I took one n the morning and one in the afternoon and amazingly, hunger is the last thing that comes to my mind. This was not the case before!</li>
            <li> I have been taking this for a week and it has completely stopped my hunger. I had to remind/force myself to eat due to nutrients I was going to miss for the day. Over all I like this product, It gave my bursts of energy, but not the jittery kind. Along with all supplements diet is a huge part in weight loss, so If you are doing that and are also taking these pills the weight will come right off!</li>
            <li> I have been using these for the past 3 months and have lost about 30 pounds! I take 3 a day, 30 minutes before my meals, as it suggests! They are well worth the price! I do not get jittery and I am not hungry! They are super easy to take and being a Type 1 diabetic, they have no adverse effects on my blood sugars. I walk daily and watch what I eat and these have enhanced my weight loss! I love them and am very happy with my purchases! They arrive in a timely manner and I can&#x27;t \\&quot;weight\\&quot; to see how much more I can lose!</li>
            <li> I would like to say thank you to Fast Shipping Supplements on their timely&lt;br /&gt;&gt; and just as promised description of this product. I think this product is&lt;br /&gt;&gt; the best of all I have tried over the past year. After doing additional&lt;br /&gt;&gt; research on Raspberry Ketone&#x27;s the importance of having high grade clinical&lt;br /&gt;&gt; strength is the key to the success of taking this product. You do not&lt;br /&gt;&gt; receive an abundance of energy but the appetite suppressing and fat loss&lt;br /&gt;&gt; are a definite deal by using this product. I have dropped 2 pounds in just&lt;br /&gt;&gt; one week simply by taking as prescribed, walking and not feeling hungry all&lt;br /&gt;&gt; the time. I have cut out snacks, because I have not had any cravings in&lt;br /&gt;&gt; between meals and feel a bit more energetic,more by just my change in diet.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; I recommend any one looking for a better product to give this one a try, I&lt;br /&gt;&gt; did and so far I have no regrets of my purchase. Happy fat loss!</li>
            <li> Helps me delay a meal which helps me lose weight.  A meal delayed is a meal missed!</li>
            <li> Its not just this particular company its the product overall.  was on them for three weeks. Went for an overall check up with blood work.  The blood worked showed an increase in alkaline phosophate.  I stopped the ketones and levels went back to normal. Be aware that they affect your liver! And I didn&#x27;t lose a pound and I am avid gym rat. No worth it. Just diet and exercise and wait patiently. The weight will come off.</li>
            <li> I want to start off first by stating that I am a very active 34 year old woman who consumes no more than 1270 calories a day.I use the My Fitness Pal app on the Iphone to log the calories that I eat,I walk 45 minutes a day 5 days per week,I am on week 4 of Jillian Michael&#x27;s get Ripped In 30 after completing Jillian Michael&#x27;s 30 Day Shred and I hit the gym every Sunday.I DID NOT lose weight any faster with this product than I did before I took this product.Since around September I am down a total of 45 lbs.I lose weight at a rate of approximately 1 lb. per week but have issues w/ Plateauing so thought that the Ketones would help a little but I was wrong.I finished both bottles for good measure and still did not see results other than those from proper nutrition and exercise.I am not angry because I was the &amp;#34;Guinea Pig&amp;#34; for many of my friends as to whether this product works and now we all know that it does not.I tried to get a refund from the seller but was informed that a refund is only provided when a full,unopened bottle can be returned.I thought i would have better results if I followed through w/ the full 2 months so instead of my refund I held on to the  hope that maybe in the second month the lbs. would melt off like a lot of other &amp;#34;consumers&amp;#34; on Amazon reviews had claimed.Nope.Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.Do it the right way and you will have results.Also,these gave me searing heartburn.Beware.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I am an active 37 year old male.  I eat well and exercise.  Currently I am trying to decrease my body fat to below ten percent.  Diet and exercise have allowed me to lose weight up to a point.  The Raspberry Ketone Platinum allowed me to break through a weight loss plateau.  I was stuck at 188 (already had lost 7lbs but could not seem to get the weight to drop further despite calorie restriction and strenuous exercise.  I added the ketones to my arsenal and the weight starting coming off again.  Within the first week of taking the ketones I dropped 3lbs.  They help curb my appetite and give me a feeling of satiety.  This allows me to more easily stick to a calorie restricted diet.  I am very impressed with my results.  The ketones are a nice ADDITION to a correct diet and exercise program for weight loss.  I am happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I have taken this product for a month and find that it provides me extra energy without feeling hyped as with caffeine. I have also experienced gradual, but noticable weight loss without upping my workout time. I take one in the morning and a second one in the afternoon. I love that I now get more tired at night. I also take l-carnitine, l-tyrosine, and a good probiotic. I have not noticed any adverse effects. Love the energy.</li>
            <li> I would have rated 5 stars, but it is hard to measure if I am actually loosing weight.  I have been taking them for over a month and have only lost about 5 pounds.</li>
            <li> AWESOME product.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> After trying other weight loss products this one was reccommended to me and i am so glad it was. I have been using it for around three weeks and have just purchased it again, i have seen a definate weight loss which is really only a bonus as the main reason i take it now is that i feel so productive in my life. i have that \\&quot;get up and go\\&quot; attitude that i so lacked before. I have experianced no side effets at all. Highly reccemmended</li>
            <li> Thanks for the prompt shipping. All items fresh and sealed. I have heard such amazing things about this raspberry ketone. I am on day 3 and im loving it.</li>
            <li> I just received and have only used 2 days.  Smells very good, easy to take.  It&#x27;s too soon to rate the effect but being pure where many brands have additives I chose this brand.  I will post a follow up of my findings after taking for a few weeks to let you know how it goes.  I am taking for assistance in weight control and health.  My husband weight control and diabetic, hoping to help with his blood glucose.  Received within a couple days of ordering and came packaged well.  so far NO problems to report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update ... not sure this does anything...... I&#x27;m sure no harm... no weight loss to report.</li>
            <li> So far, so good! A pound in a week! For people who want fast results, like me, it is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 5&#x27;10\\&quot; and was stuck in 154 lbs since forever. Now i&#x27;m closer of my target, that is 149 lbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband already told me I have less fat thighs than before taking it! And i really think after a month it will be even better, then I will write more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been excercising and taking these for about two month now. So far I&#x27;ve lost about 15 pounds. These help control my appetite and I do not get as hungry as before I started taking them. I have not noticed any side effects whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I found absolutely no positive results from Raspberry Keytone.  I could not recommend the use of them to anyone.  It&#x27;s disappointing to to waste money on falsely advertised products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of how other people are saying this product works, but it doesn&#x27;t.  They must work for the company, or something like that.  I wasted my money, and I&#x27;m not going to bother finishing it.  You would think after two and a half weeks, I&#x27;d see something... but nothing... I&#x27;ve even been doing the P90X program and weight watchers at the same time!</li>
            <li> lengthy review- but totally honest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Raspberry Ketone Platinum for 13 days now.  I honestly had no idea what to expect- all I knew was that I really wanted to lose a few last pounds that I have carried since pregnancy- 4 years ago!  I am very sensitive to caffeine and never drink it or take it any form.  It makes me shakey and lightheaded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started by taking one pill right when I wake up (5:30 AM) and then another around noon about 30 mins before lunch.  I was amazed that it gave me so much natural energy.  And by natural, I mean that there were no physical symptoms of an energy burst, but I just felt that things were a little less tasking, I was a little less tired after exercising, cleaning, etc,a little more alert.  I exercise moderately 3 -4 days a week.  I eat fairly healthy, lots of fruits, veggies, whole grains, etc.  But I am also a sucker for cheeseburgers and girl scout cookie season!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fluctuated from 108-112 literally for years now.  Since I have been taking this WITHOUT altering my exercise or eating habits, I have remained at 105-107 lbs.  I can tell that I am losing fat too- not just water weight or muscle.  My clothes fit better, my face looks thinner and exercise (esp cardio) is easier and fluctuation is much less. It has deinitely helped with portion control and food cravings- even with raging pms :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May not sound like 2-3 lbs is a big deal. But I am fairly short, (5&#x27;3) and have a petite frame.  So even a pound makes a difference on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the natural energy.  I don&#x27;t worry that I could be doing anything harmful to my body.  There have been NO digestive/bowel changes either.  All around- I just feel a little better, a little lighter and physical activity has become a little easier- all without caffeine or other addictive/harmful additives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you truly have a weight/obesity problem- this may help you kick start something, but it&#x27;s not going to makeyou drop 10 lbs a week- but that&#x27;s a good thing. Healthy FAT loss should only be done at a rate of 2-3 or less pounds a week.&lt;br /&gt;Best part is the natural energy. I am definitely going to continue to take this and recommending it to my sister!&lt;br /&gt;PS: shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I was 265 when I started my diet. After loosing 25 lbs I hit a sticking point and couldn&#x27;t seem to go past it. When I heard about this product and ordered it not expecting much .This is my second order I&#x27;ve placed and I feel it helped me loose some 35 pounds of the 60 total I&#x27;ve lost. I&#x27;m now 15 lbs from my total goal weight. Thanks.</li>
            <li> A year and a half prior to taking the Raspberry Ketones, I had done 3 rounds of the HcG diet (pregnancy hormone/500 calories), with great results - weight loss and sculpted muscles - for the first two rounds.  The third round proved harder on my body than expected and I did not follow the routine.  Consequently, I loss most of my sculpted muscles and what developed was &amp;#34;bunches&amp;#34; in my thighs that looked like someone had poured globs of fat into a sack (my thigh).  It was horrible and horrifying, assuming I&#x27;d never put on another bathing suit.  I found a video online of the Dr. Oz Show about Raspberry Ketones and decided to give them a try.  I bought the 500mg, took 2 a day and waited it out.  Without changing anything else, it took about a month, but suddenly my thighs began to appear firmer and smoother, the bunches were gone and I was much relieved.  I was very thirsty during the first couple of weeks so increased my water intake.  Otherwise, I&#x27;ve been very happy with the product and will continue taking it as I also continue to improve my health.</li>
            <li> So far, So good - I have been taking these for about a week.  Slowly I have been seeing results, will continue to take on the long run!</li>
            <li> We have had excellent results using Raspberry Ketones and this PLATNUM edition is no exception. Perfect dosing size and fair price this is a great choice. Hard to beat for the money and purity/dosing.</li>
            <li> Saw a segment on Dr. Oz regarding this supplement.  He raved about it and provided a demo of how it works to shrink fat cells.  Was excited to receive the product within a few days of placing my order.&lt;br /&gt;I was initially concerned about possibly side effects (feeling jittery, headaches, etc).  But there were none!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the product for about a week now and have noticed a progressive decline on my bathroom scale!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m excited to see more progress with additional use!</li>
            <li> I read a lot about this product but wasn&#x27;t sure how it would work for me. Other weight loss products would cause me to be wide awake at night or feel funny. This one did neither. Took one on the morning and one before lunch. No poor feelings, just lots of energy! Very happy with the good results and lack of negative side effects.</li>
            <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;I don’t normally leave feedbacks but I know what an important part of my decision making they are so I decided to change it. I am only 5’3” and weight about 113lbs so you can’t call me overweight by any standards but wanted to lose about 5-8 lbs to look perfect!&lt;br /&gt;1. I saw no change for the first two weeks taking only ONE pill in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;2. I wasn’t as hungry during the day as I normally would&lt;br /&gt;3. I had no side effects what so ever&lt;br /&gt;4. After a month of taking these pills I tried on all my summer clothes and was in shock!&lt;br /&gt;  Everything fits better than last summer, I lost my little “muffin top” and my stomach is flat.&lt;br /&gt;  My legs looked more toned!!!&lt;br /&gt;Only ONE pill a day in the morning with a glass of water! That’s it. Lost about 5lbs but that all I needed. I would suggest to up the dose for those of you who have more to lose and work out a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck :)</li>
            <li> I take 1 right after I wake up around 8 a.m.and eat about 20 min later(Im always starving when I first wake up)then another one 30-45 min before I eat lunch,usually around 12:30ish, and the third before dinner. I lost 4 lbs in the first week. I think thats pretty good, the only things I slightly changed was, I ate a little less, but the raspberry ketones made me feel full faster.(I never felt hungry soon after I ate). I also took longer walks, only about 2.5 miles half of that is up hills(thats good for me for now). I am now going to my second bottle, I haven&#x27;t lost much more yet but I will still take them and push myself to exercise more. Everyone&#x27;s body is different, the number on the scale does not always mean its not working. If my pants fit better, then I&#x27;m doing good.&lt;br /&gt;I only gave this a 3 star because other things I have read say you dont have to change anything and you will lose like 20lbs in a month..not true for me but enough for me to keep trying.</li>
            <li> I  take the capsules for 1.5 months now, they seem to stimulate metabolism and burn fat. Already during the first weeks I was able to notice an effect and lost some pounds. However don´t expect miracles. You can be successful when you switch to a healthy diet and/or do some workout (that I haven´t done unfortunately). Anyway I feel better and much more energized. I will continue to order.</li>
            <li> Well I tried these, and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.  Once I take one, I do feel a bit of bubbles in the tummy, like noises, but I am not noticing, any lose of appetite, or weight lose.  I am on a low calorie, low fat, hardly any carb.  I do not drink soda, and I exercise about 3 times a week.  I am now looking at ordering this from a different company, I think it will be pure health</li>
