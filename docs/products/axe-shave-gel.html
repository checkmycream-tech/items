            <li>of this was nice too.</li>
            <li>It makes me legs feel very smooth, and the scent is mild, dissipating quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There seem to be a nice amount of vitamins, anti-irritants and antioxidants in this formulation, so I feel great allowing the foam to sink into my skin.</li>

            <li>Both my son and my husband love Axe and all their products.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s an interesting choice of ingredients.</li>

            <li>I love that there are no PEGs or parabens in this product.</li>
            <li>i was a skeptic because these cost more BUT all in all</li>

            <li>had friends say they look better</li>
            <li>/&gt;it felt better as i was shaving</li>
            <li>In addition, this Axe shave gel delivers a very very manly and pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I shaved it did a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong perfume/cologne like smell like most Axe products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still, overall, a very good shaving product.</li>

            <li>Easy to apply and helps the razor glide across the face easily.</li>
            <li>This shaving gel is not bad, it&#x27;s just that the Nivea Q10 and Dove Shaving Gels are better.</li>
            <li>Goes on very smoothly for a fresh and close shave.</li>
            <li>think the shaving cream/shaving gel a man uses is as important as the razor.</li>
            <li>Nothing more to say other than Axe has great products.</li>
            <li>It is a light fragrant smell, almost a bit sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>It left his face feeling baby soft and he said it felt great on his skin and foams up nicely.</li>
            <li>Has a nice and pleasant manly scent that is not to strong over overpowering (I am highly sensitive to chemical smells and things and for some reason I seem to be immunie to AXE and that&#x27;s something for the plus column) - I also have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>And the ingredents are great such as jojoba seed, grape seed, and cucumber extract and other great ingrendents.</li>
            <li>super  smooth  </li>
            <li>It feels great on my face and does feel a little cool.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant without being overly strong (though because it is subtle you may find the women in your house taking it to use for shaving their legs) and the can is comfortable to hold when dispensing.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than Edge sensitive skin and gives a better shave than Barbasol.</li>
            <li>Either you like Axe products or you don&#x27;t, but this is worth checking out.</li>
            <li>I used edge before and this is much better very smoth and very close and after 4 months of not shaving</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy to report that this product&#x27;s scent is not strong or dizzying.</li>
            <li>packaging has a nice design with slight indents in the sides making it easy to grip.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty pricey compared to other shave gels and I think those work just as good as this.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well.</li>
            <li>but this is pretty good.&lt;br</li>

            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s first time using Axe shave gel.</li>
            <li>The scent has a distinct scent which he says is \\&quot;masculine\\&quot; and hard to describe but pleasant.  </li>
            <li>He is very picky but no complaints from him with this version of Axe.</li>
            <li>Try it if you like your products gentle.</li>
            <li>I think that the scent is a bit much</li>
            <li>- Duh!? :P</li>
            <li>I have used other shave gels that I like better</li>

            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>They could get a better valve and stop the waste</li>
            <li>My husband felt that his regular brand was just as good if not better than this shave gel by Axe.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to buy there new line on products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally very sensitive to fragrances in beauty products</li>

            <li>I recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>

            <li>The other half was happy to try out this new Axe shaving product, especially since he&#x27;s a big fan of their other products such as shower gels, deodorant sprays (and now face wash - thanks to Amazon).  </li>
            <li>It also did not seem to rinse off perfectly clean and left a slight residue.  </li>
            <li>and I found it fine on mine though no more hydrating than other sensitive skin shaving foams or gels</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first but sold on it after the very first use.</li>

            <li> He says the gel doesn&#x27;t foam up as much as shaving products from other brands that he&#x27;s used in the past</li>
            <li> Axe is making some fantastically high quality products lately, and I am now a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended even for girls.</li>
            <li> but my next purchase will be something less wasteful.</li>

            <li> He likes it and will continue to use this shaving gel along with his other Axe favorites.</li>
            <li> The gel creates a thick lather for shaving; thick enough for several days growth, so a little goes a long way if you shave every day.  </li>
            <li> and i have oddly shaving-sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I estimate about half of shave gel gets wasted by discharging inside the cover after use.</li>

            <li> Traditionally I have not been a fan of shave gels, finding them a bit sloppy to use.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for the past 30 days.</li>
            <li> Axe Shave gel is amazingly slick.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Hubby likes it for his sensative face and I steal some for my legs. He is very picky but no complaints from him with this version of Axe. He usually uses Edge gel for sensative skin actually says this protects better without the burn.</li>
            <li> Nothing more to say other than Axe has great products. And the Axe shave gel is no exception ... It is great.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than Edge sensitive skin and gives a better shave than Barbasol. I use a safety razor with imported blades.</li>
            <li> For  some  reason  the  pharmacy  near  my  house  doesn&#x27;t  carry  this  product  anymore, i  love  this shaving  cream,  my  skin  feels  super  smooth  after  shaving. I  highly  recommend  it.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is good for price. Spend about $10 or more and get a product containing glycerin and I can assure you that you will have an excellent shave. Check out Taylor of Old Bond Street!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. A little goes a long way. It smells so good! And the ingredents are great such as jojoba seed, grape seed, and cucumber extract and other great ingrendents. Axe has done a lot to atcually make some good face products for men. I will continue to buy there new line on products.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Only problem is that the valve does not close enough to stop the flow.I estimate about half of shave gel gets wasted by discharging inside the cover after use. They could get a better valve and stop the waste but that might cause them to lose sales. As in it would last twice as long before reordering. Wish they had it in a squeeze tube. It really is nice to shave with but my next purchase will be something less wasteful.</li>
            <li> This shave gel is excellent. I used Gillette shave gel before and this Axe is just as good. The Gillette has a minty feeling, and this Axe even has a nicer minty feeling. In addition, this Axe shave gel delivers a very very manly and pleasant smell. It&#x27;s almost like a perfume. I took a shower after shaving. Walking out of the shower, I still smelled it. One hour after that, the smell still lingered. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I am used to using the .99 cans of shaving gel and now I know what I have been missing. I have used this for the past 30 days. It has left my skin smoother and with fewer irritations or nicks. Either you like Axe products or you don&#x27;t, but this is worth checking out.</li>
            <li> Both my son and my husband love Axe and all their products. It keeps them smelling good which is always important. They both loved the shave gel and both found it worked well and protected their skin without any harsh reactions. A+</li>
            <li> Axe Shave gel is amazingly slick.  My unscientific guess is that is almost half again as slippery as the gel foam that I have been using for the last 20 years.  As I am retired I don&#x27;t have the time to shave every day.  Maybe I get to it once a week.  But when I do the shave is utterly painless as the blades slides across my beard. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This Axe Shave Gel (Shield) is not as moisturizing as the Nivea for Men Q10 Shaving Gel or the Dove Shaving Gel.  This shaving gel is not bad, it&#x27;s just that the Nivea Q10 and Dove Shaving Gels are better.</li>
            <li> Well it took awhile because I grow a beard for winter so after 4 months of not shaving I used the AXE and I must say it worked great I used edge before and this is much better very smoth and very close and after 4 months of not shaving it was real nice. GREAT SHAVE and a very nice sized can. I will be using this from now on.</li>
            <li> A nice refreshing shave gel that works great. Easy to apply and helps the razor glide across the face easily. Has a nice smell and leaves the face feeling refreshed. This is pretty pricey compared to other shave gels and I think those work just as good as this.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and works in well. Has a nice and pleasant manly scent that is not to strong over overpowering (I am highly sensitive to chemical smells and things and for some reason I seem to be immunie to AXE and that&#x27;s something for the plus column) - I also have pretty sensitive skin and I have no quirks about this product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Rich Lather&lt;br /&gt;Smells Nice&lt;br /&gt;Leaves Skin Feeling Revived&lt;br /&gt;The Female Attention&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None - Duh!? :P</li>
            <li> This is a nice shave gel that foams as soon as I put it in my hand. It feels great on my face and does feel a little cool. It has a strong perfume/cologne like smell like most Axe products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I shaved it did a pretty good job.  There were no burns or cuts on my face but I had to shave over the same areas once ot twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the shaving cream/shaving gel a man uses is as important as the razor. This works pretty well. I have used other shave gels that I like better but this is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the Axe brand I think you will like this product. Even if you never heard of the Axe brand this is a nice shave gel.</li>
            <li> Traditionally I have not been a fan of shave gels, finding them a bit sloppy to use.  The Axe Shave Gel was an unexpected surprise. The gel creates a thick lather for shaving; thick enough for several days growth, so a little goes a long way if you shave every day.  The scent is pleasant without being overly strong (though because it is subtle you may find the women in your house taking it to use for shaving their legs) and the can is comfortable to hold when dispensing. The formula is for sensitive skin and I found it fine on mine though no more hydrating than other sensitive skin shaving foams or gels I&#x27;ve used. Still, overall, a very good shaving product.</li>
            <li> This product did a great job, it smells good &amp; I like the choice of ingredients. Yes, it&#x27;s an interesting choice of ingredients. It smells better &amp; peachier than the [[ASIN:B00BIL9HZE Nivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel, 7-Ounce Canister]]. I recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product is made by Unilever which also owns the Dove brand. Like Dove Men+Care Sensitive shave gel, the smell is very light and pleasant. I&#x27;m normally very sensitive to fragrances in beauty products but I&#x27;m happy to report that this product&#x27;s scent is not strong or dizzying. The gel instantly foams up as soon as it&#x27;s applied to skin. Goes on very smoothly for a fresh and close shave. As a plus, it prevents nicks and irritation. I had no breakouts or redness after using this shave gel. It&#x27;s also not overly moisturizing which means it doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue. I love that there are no PEGs or parabens in this product. Easily one of the best shaving gels on the market. I was skeptical at first but sold on it after the very first use. Try it if you like your products gentle. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> this is the best shaving cream ive ever used.its very soft and smooth on your face.even if my blade is dull.it  still shaves all my face with.</li>
            <li> i prefer axe products now to others.. i was a skeptic because these cost more BUT all in all they are better products.&lt;br /&gt;ive had friends say they look better (i realy dont care what packaging the product comes in.. just make it work and smell good!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it felt better as i was shaving and i have oddly shaving-sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;scent of this was nice too.</li>
            <li> My husband felt that his regular brand was just as good if not better than this shave gel by Axe.  I think that the scent is a bit much and it just did not seem to provide enough foam when applied to the face.  It also did not seem to rinse off perfectly clean and left a slight residue.  My household is not making the switch to this Axe product.</li>
            <li> The other half was happy to try out this new Axe shaving product, especially since he&#x27;s a big fan of their other products such as shower gels, deodorant sprays (and now face wash - thanks to Amazon).  He says the gel doesn&#x27;t foam up as much as shaving products from other brands that he&#x27;s used in the past but this wasn&#x27;t a dealbreaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging has a nice design with slight indents in the sides making it easy to grip.  It seems this feature would be helpful when handling the bottle around the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also noted this shaving gel gave him a close shave with no nicks or cuts.  The scent has a distinct scent which he says is \\&quot;masculine\\&quot; and hard to describe but pleasant.  He likes it and will continue to use this shaving gel along with his other Axe favorites.</li>
            <li> AXE Shave Gel is the ultimate in smoothness and comfort.  It left my face feeling clean and looking neat.  The best shaving gel I have ever used!  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I like that there isn&#x27;t any soap in this product, so I don&#x27;t have to wash it away if I am traveling in my RV and water is scarce. I can just rub in the remainder of the product after I use the razor on my leg hair. It makes me legs feel very smooth, and the scent is mild, dissipating quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There seem to be a nice amount of vitamins, anti-irritants and antioxidants in this formulation, so I feel great allowing the foam to sink into my skin. There are no irritants in the entire product list for the \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; line, so I am pleased. Axe is making some fantastically high quality products lately, and I am now a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended even for girls.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s first time using Axe shave gel. I was a bit worried that it would have an overpowering smell (as some Axe products do) but it doesn&#x27;t. It is a light fragrant smell, almost a bit sweet smelling. It made me want to snuggle up to him. It left his face feeling baby soft and he said it felt great on his skin and foams up nicely. It&#x27;s a winner!</li>
