            <li>london has very nice pleasant smell.the flip side of this one</li>
            <li>This is an amazing price for this Burberry-London,cologne!</li>
            <li>Also the price was the best I have found anywhere and had free shipping!</li>
            <li>Burberry is my favorite cologne and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>I think this is one of the most wonderful scents a man can wear for himself.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m into pleasant smells</li>
            <li>This EDT has a pleasant aroma and you can use by day, as well as at night.</li>
            <li>I bought this scent because I smelled it on a friend and loved</li>
            <li>Longevity is good on me, can smell it for 8-10 hours.</li>
            <li>but that is what happens to something that is good.</li>
            <li>The Burberry London scent smelled extremely mm good on my boyfriend  </li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>Good Cologne but a bit overbearing at times.</li>
            <li>This is a good smell good product.</li>
            <li>1-3 sprays are good for this cologne.</li>
            <li>One spray on the heart, one spray on the neck &amp; one spray on the wrist &amp; then rub your wrists together then smell good for the rest of the night with tons of compliments being said your way.</li>
            <li>But it smells good.</li>
            <li>but it was in perfect condition with the original wrapper still on it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the scent itself as a storm of cinnamon prelude followed by port wine, leather, and sensational basenote of tobacco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are all excellent scents that bring their own unique appeal.</li>
            <li>I love this product, smells great.</li>
            <li>Great price love the smell</li>
            <li>It is a very sophisticated scent that continues to unfurl hours after application.</li>
            <li>Glad to have found it here!  </li>
            <li>I love this scent on my husband!  </li>
            <li>When I tried it for the first time I was very much impressed and still am.</li>
            <li>that one is amazing.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll have to deal with it to get to the nice smell that follows minutes after.</li>
            <li>This is one of those popular colognes out there which every reviewer loves.</li>
            <li>Still, this is a really nice cologne.</li>
            <li>and it stays with you nicely for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice deal for the price</li>
            <li>I find this cologne is best appreciated during the evening in the colder months of the year.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice too, but it is not the Burberry London.</li>
            <li>, however i just wanted a cologne for work that i know has a great winter smell that is sweet and woody</li>
            <li>It is perfect as it is a very sleek and elegant and does its job.</li>
            <li>but this was by far the best smelling of the cologne for men.</li>
            <li>London is a great scent that reminds me of winter, cinnamon, pine trees, and fresh flannel/timber.</li>
            <li>Then, when the scent dries, it changes to a rather warm and woodsy smell that gets many compliments.  </li>
            <li>This is has an amazing smell, better than Polo and stays with you all day.</li>
            <li>A very pleasant masculine smell.</li>
            <li>Great price and exactly what a wanted.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quite quickly and smells good.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of it, it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Projection: 3 out of 5&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: 2 out of 5 (4 hours max)&lt;br /&gt;Bottle:</li>
            <li>well okay,,  </li>
            <li>would love to return the item, but I no longer have the box it came in...and both my husband and I have had adverse reactions to this item (nautious).  </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance and the price.</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I only wish that I could find the Burberry London body wash at an excellent price as this cologne was; you go Amazon.com!</li>
            <li>Love it to wear outdoors in the winter or summer.</li>
            <li>I like the touch and brit for more formal occassions, indoors, in spring and fall.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best price on the internet</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T SHOP WITH THIS MERCHANT......unless you like being ripped off and have nothing better to do with your time or money.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sortof fruity sophisticated smell.</li>
            <li>Love burberry scents</li>
            <li>I am a fan of the Burberry series of fragrances; with Touch being my favorite one.  </li>
            <li>I urge every one to try London you won&#x27;t regret : )</li>
            <li>Yes I love it</li>
            <li>Nothing like where I know I will be staying more than 3 hours like work, or night out and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this scent.  </li>
            <li>a more summer flavor, check out Burberry&#x27;s Brit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy more</li>
            <li>It is not the fragrance to be worn if you are looking for sexy.</li>
            <li>My wife likes it so what more is there to say?</li>
            <li>I like London a lot more.</li>
            <li>Every thing ok but some not</li>
            <li>This is a favorite of mine and I am so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with my purchase of Burberry London.</li>
            <li>&amp; im glad i did.</li>
            <li>but will always say something else is there favorite on there</li>
            <li>and i know for me, Burberry London is one of my favorite Winter</li>
            <li>,i realized that this is not an  authentic product.</li>
            <li>But they all love it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s like the euphoric sensation the morning after a night of binging on the magic dragon --</li>
            <li>So try a sample at your local dept. store and see if you like it, then if you are amazed like I was, then this is the best place to buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite and it compliments me.  </li>
            <li>I have tried all of Burberry&#x27;s fragrances for men and this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Really enjoyable not too overbearing,</li>
            <li>My boyfriend was so happy because this is his favorite but because it&#x27;s an older scent not everyone carries it.  </li>
            <li>I was overall pleased with my purchase and my service!!!</li>
            <li>Burberry seems to have a very unique set of fragrances for men on the market.</li>
            <li>He was so excited, he&#x27;d sampled it at a store and really loved it, so I was so excited to give it to him.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I have loved just about every Burberry fragrance; Touch, Brit, Weekends, but when the temperature drops below 40° in the winter time and you need a fragrance that is sophisticated, masculine, and has great longevity with just the right amount of sillage then you must give this a try.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this to anyone looking for a good cologne.</li>
            <li>Suitable in my opinion for any special occasion where friends or family might gather around the fire and reminisce.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t buy a lot of fragrances, but this is a great, masculine smell that works any time of the year.  </li>
            <li>It smells fresh and nice and everyone seems to complement me on it.</li>
            <li>It opens up with hints of smoky Moss, the perfect blend of spices, and ends with a wonderful woody dry down.</li>
            <li>It is also very sweet, which am into, but many will find it too sweet.</li>
            <li>10 stars for the great scent but doesnt last more than 5 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is strong for couple hours ...</li>
            <li>Strong, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>So good, I bought a new bottle.</li>
            <li>Wonderful manly smell, hints of tobacco and leather, and the typical musk they use for a mans cologne.</li>
            <li>I wear all their men&#x27;s colognes, this vendor was quick and provided outstanding service</li>
            <li>i would like to start by addressing the fact that i have done so much research on colognes that i know about more about colognes than most people and even though i am not an expert i am not someone who can be fooled easily.</li>
            <li>The price was the best part, I originally priced this item out for my boyfriend in a retail store and it was $70.00, I purchased it from Amazon for half that literally</li>
            <li>a huge hit with the ladies.</li>
            <li>The item was packaged neatly and securely.  </li>
            <li>One for each of my brothers, but liked this one sooooo much</li>
            <li>This product is cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li>That is why it is being sold so cheap on Amazon.</li>
            <li>After it ran out I bought this one on amazon because it was cheap and over three times the size of the one she got me.  </li>
            <li>It smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s ok, but not as good as Burberry Brit,</li>
            <li>The smells is ok it really smells more sugary</li>
            <li>This London is very nice though and comes in second.  </li>
            <li>It has a unique fragrance and is complimented on by everyone at work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was love at first sniff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Either Burberry has changed the formula or this is a cheap, &#x27;watered downed&#x27; version of the scent I loved (I&#x27;m guessing the latter).</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, once it dries, it actually smells quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>I like the smell; it is not overpowering, it lingers for a long time, and it gives me a very warm olfactory feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rather amazed at how such an incredible scent is one that not many people mention when they talk about great colognes, but thats alright by me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s woodsy, sweet, clean</li>
            <li>Amazing and masculine.</li>
            <li>The quantity is a great value, yet the scent is weaker than expected  </li>
            <li>Sweet and spicy.</li>
            <li>And the Nautica Blue was good for every day use</li>
            <li>Good cost, spray does not last at all.</li>
            <li>it is a sweet woodsy smell.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is cool in that the sleeve that covers it is a cloth material.</li>
            <li>Smells sweet, has woodsy, cinnamonny, vanilla overtones, and its dry-down</li>
            <li>I have also noticed, like many fragrances, London responds very well to heat.  </li>
            <li>I personally wear John Varvatos Vintage more because I like it slightly better.</li>
            <li>when those smells seem more appropriate, such as holidays.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t project as well as I would like, but it just smells so good.</li>
            <li>I bought my husband this cologne when he wanted to try a new scent, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>it smells great and it lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li>As the scent wears on through the day different aromas come forth and smell amazing.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into fresh or citrusy scents, this one&#x27;s not for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really a big fan of the smell (kind of musty/sandalwood-ey)</li>
            <li>it is by far my favorite cologne to wear.</li>
            <li>but this scent always is the one to turn heads and stay fresh in the air as you passs by.</li>
            <li>It has a more mature atmosphere.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I always receive compliments from women when I wear this cologne and more than one have complimented on masculine presence.  </li>
            <li>It is in one of my top five fragrances of all time, it just has limited use because of its strong aroma and notes.    </li>
            <li>the price was right.  </li>
            <li>A friend suggested London and they were right.</li>
            <li>It is the right fragrance for any occasion.</li>
            <li>but if you are in market for your first good quality cologne and want to get full worth out of your money spent, I would not strongly recommend it because it wont make you very excited though I am sure it will make</li>
            <li>it is not strong and quite mild and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Usually I have great satisfactiion with product purchased from Amazon</li>
            <li>The cool air is where this cologne really shines.  </li>
            <li>I have a reasonably large collection of Armanis and Polos but ever since I have got the Burberrys, I just find myself to be reaching out for these!</li>
            <li>I do not care for the other Burberry, which is too musk-y for my taste, but am very pleased with this one.</li>
            <li>like this very much.</li>
            <li>Smells great and the price is hard to beat.</li>
            <li>First, I saw this on the store but was overpriced.</li>
            <li>Never buy cologne without smelling it first, lesson learned.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I ordered size and all.  </li>
            <li>Burberry London is one of the first fragrances I reach for during the fall or winter.  </li>
            <li>;)   </li>
            <li>GIVE YOUR MONEY TO CHARITY OR BURN IT FIRST, but don&#x27;t give it to this crook.</li>
            <li>Arrived promptly &amp; was exactly what we wanted.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The description has a typo first of all.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t want to smell like too much of a dad as a 26 year-old!</li>
            <li>i first received the cologne</li>
            <li>remember the first day wearing it, I wasn&#x27;t even going out.</li>
            <li>the authentic one will last HOURS and project out.</li>
            <li>The EDT is best suited for casual, evening wear.</li>
            <li>Not the real thing, the fragrance is similar, pleasant enough, but projection and longevity are abysmal, wears off after an hour...</li>
            <li>i was very satisfied and wore it a few times when i first purchased it in Feb. 2012 however after a month</li>
            <li>I have bought real authentic colognes of high end brands from department stores such as Macy&#x27;s and Sachs, and at times buy the cologne from the official website (like Chanel, Christian Dior)</li>
            <li>Great scent but does not last all day as mentioned by other viewers.</li>
            <li>(It is a masculine sweet, though).  </li>
            <li>Unlike many other popular designers, they have a whopping total of 8 different scents available: Classic, London, Beat, Touch, Brit, Sport, Weekend, and Summer.</li>
            <li>The other we got him Davidoff HOT, was most definitely Hot  </li>
            <li>Maybe I should have been suspect when the label was lopsided on the cologne bottle, the cap doesn&#x27;t fit snug on the bottle (like the real thing), and this product reaks of ALCOHOL (like cheap or imitation cologne).    </li>
            <li>If this could last around 6 hours, it could easily be my fav</li>
            <li>The fragrance lasts about 2 hours while the real deal will stay on your clothes until washed.</li>
            <li>This is a scent chosen by our son who really enjoys it</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S NOT THE REAL THING</li>
            <li>so you have to watch how much you use.</li>
            <li>overall London is a fantastic cologne.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well it really depends.</li>
            <li>Much sweeter than the real spray.    </li>
            <li>I Like it very much.burberry</li>
            <li>very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very pine forward</li>
            <li>but his product is inferior and not the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Reminds me a lot of Polo, but a much softer, understated scent, not overly-sweet.  </li>
            <li>i really like this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Definitely the most masculine of the Burberry Mens fragrances.</li>
            <li>So this is something that I only wear for short time meetings, date, party, get-together, dinner kind of stuff.</li>
            <li>That previous bottle was very strong and pungent.</li>
            <li>I had been familiar with the female version of this perfume, but never thought of buying &#x27;por homme&#x27; one for me.</li>
            <li>but it does last long and the packaging is nice.</li>
            <li>However, it is good for office wear as well - not very harsh and does not project excessively.</li>
            <li>I was a regular Burberry Brit fan, but it became too sweet for my liking.</li>
            <li>Other typical ones that smell great are the Eternity, CK Escape, and Drakkar Noir, Polo Green/Blue  </li>
            <li>BUT the one I received from Amazon is NOT the same, even though I ordered the exact item (I had his bottle in my hand and ordered the exact title, amount, strength - toilette...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve built this weirdly extensive cologne collection over the years, and Burberry London is about the only thing I&#x27;ve had to buy more of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is my classic fragrance during the winter.</li>
            <li>An older women at the register caught a whiff and immediately complemented me on the scent.</li>
            <li>If you buy this, I highly suggest the 3.4oz and making a decant so you can reapply after 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and would recommend highly.</li>
            <li>The initial hit diminishes very fast, but the underlying characteristics last for a full workday.</li>
            <li>Far from the real thing and</li>
            <li>AND PAY A FEW DOLLARS MORE.</li>
            <li>Overall, very much worth what you spend.</li>
            <li>Classy dark glass wrapped in burberry cloth with a great cap that locks on tight.</li>
            <li>London lasts extra long for me (5-6hrs) and is refreshing in a manly way (not soapy or powdery soft).</li>
            <li>i have many colognes and so i did not use the the burberry London cologne for about a few weeks, however recently when i decided to wear it to work, after spraying it for the first time in a 3 weeks</li>
            <li>I purchased this after doing some research for something new to wear to work this winter.</li>
            <li>Very classy.</li>
            <li>Not saying it will last all day, but if it is not the real version then I am assuming it is pretty good fake.  </li>
            <li>I actually regretted buying it at first.</li>
            <li>if you are out there for your first cologne, get Jean Paul gaultier Le male.</li>
            <li>Been wearing this sent for 3 years now,  I have tried my old favorites during this time and I always wish I had put on this!  </li>
            <li>and they smell exactly the same!</li>
            <li>Its sum is greater than its parts, which is what makes this cologne so natural and yet urban, classy and everything that one would associate with a heightened brand such as Burberry, a stylized aromatic representation of a British city.   </li>
            <li>Not to mention the bottle is just cool looking, unique with the fabric on the bottle and the black cap, pretty slick I must say.</li>
            <li>The smell is more or less the same.</li>
            <li>For some reason, this one seems a bit less potent, doesn&#x27;t last as long, and seems a bit higher on the alcohol side.</li>
            <li>Stock up on this if you can people because this scent I hear has ben discontinued, and may only be back off and on for a much higher premium price!.  </li>
            <li>The description of the product was plan and clear</li>
            <li>However it is obviously not the real thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s masculine and drives women wild.</li>
            <li>I have a real bottle of this at home, which I purchased from a department store, and the bottle I received here is not the same product.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t differ much from its opening notes, with moderate longetivity and projection.</li>
            <li>My experience so far is that women like smelling it</li>
            <li>Even women who prefer the &#x27;old man in the woods/daddy was a man&#x27; scent can&#x27;t/don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give the old department store version 4 stars but the amazon one underwhelms at 2 stars.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it would work on someone who naturally has a musky scent.  </li>
            <li>I must say I believe this would classify as a mature fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Many people have complained about its longevity.  </li>
            <li>But do I think this cologne is worth money spent?</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for an older gentleman, not really a young teenager or even a very young adult.</li>
            <li>See if the longevity is decent enough for you.</li>
            <li>The only small thing which could be better is its projection and longevity.</li>
            <li>This is my second time purchasing this, the first time was from a department store and the second time was from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It looks like what we actually received is Burberry Classic.</li>
            <li>IF YOU WANT A MAJOR DISSAPPOINTMENT....</li>
            <li>Right out of the bottle, all i smell is BLACK PEPPER.</li>
            <li>Overall, a very subtle and nice cologne.</li>
            <li>It smells like the classic green bottle Polo when you first open the bottle.  </li>
            <li>But be careful to get the real thing.</li>
            <li>I was actually pleasantly surprised it was the bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>My #2 favorite scent to wear behind Burberry Brit.</li>
            <li>have finally discovered a new cologne which is has similar notes to this cologne but lasts all day.</li>
            <li>There is a slight floral and citrusy hint somewhere in the middle notes, though I cannot exactly tell what it is..</li>
            <li>It last may be just one day, so i am not sure it is the right perfume of Buberry.</li>

            <li> This is an amazing price for this Burberry-London,cologne!</li>
            <li> Also the price was the best I have found anywhere and had free shipping!</li>
            <li> Burberry is my favorite cologne and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li> I think this is one of the most wonderful scents a man can wear for himself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m into pleasant smells</li>
            <li> This EDT has a pleasant aroma and you can use by day, as well as at night.</li>
            <li> I bought this scent because I smelled it on a friend and loved</li>
            <li> Longevity is good on me, can smell it for 8-10 hours.</li>
            <li> but that is what happens to something that is good.</li>
            <li> The Burberry London scent smelled extremely mm good on my boyfriend  </li>
            <li> Good price</li>
            <li> Good Cologne but a bit overbearing at times.</li>
            <li> This is a good smell good product.</li>
            <li> 1-3 sprays are good for this cologne.</li>
            <li> One spray on the heart, one spray on the neck &amp; one spray on the wrist &amp; then rub your wrists together then smell good for the rest of the night with tons of compliments being said your way.</li>
            <li> But it smells good.</li>
            <li> but it was in perfect condition with the original wrapper still on it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the scent itself as a storm of cinnamon prelude followed by port wine, leather, and sensational basenote of tobacco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are all excellent scents that bring their own unique appeal.</li>
            <li> I love this product, smells great.</li>
            <li> Great price love the smell</li>
            <li> It is a very sophisticated scent that continues to unfurl hours after application.</li>
            <li> Glad to have found it here!  </li>
            <li> I love this scent on my husband!  </li>
            <li> When I tried it for the first time I was very much impressed and still am.</li>
            <li> that one is amazing.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll have to deal with it to get to the nice smell that follows minutes after.</li>
            <li> This is one of those popular colognes out there which every reviewer loves.</li>
            <li> Still, this is a really nice cologne.</li>
            <li> and it stays with you nicely for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice deal for the price</li>
            <li> I find this cologne is best appreciated during the evening in the colder months of the year.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice too, but it is not the Burberry London.</li>
            <li> , however i just wanted a cologne for work that i know has a great winter smell that is sweet and woody</li>
            <li> It is perfect as it is a very sleek and elegant and does its job.</li>
            <li> but this was by far the best smelling of the cologne for men.</li>
            <li> London is a great scent that reminds me of winter, cinnamon, pine trees, and fresh flannel/timber.</li>
            <li> Then, when the scent dries, it changes to a rather warm and woodsy smell that gets many compliments.  </li>
            <li> This is has an amazing smell, better than Polo and stays with you all day.</li>
            <li> A very pleasant masculine smell.</li>
            <li> Great price and exactly what a wanted.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quite quickly and smells good.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of it, it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Projection: 3 out of 5&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: 2 out of 5 (4 hours max)&lt;br /&gt;Bottle:</li>
            <li> well okay,,  </li>
            <li> would love to return the item, but I no longer have the box it came in...and both my husband and I have had adverse reactions to this item (nautious).  </li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and the price.</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I only wish that I could find the Burberry London body wash at an excellent price as this cologne was; you go Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> Love it to wear outdoors in the winter or summer.</li>
            <li> I like the touch and brit for more formal occassions, indoors, in spring and fall.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best price on the internet</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T SHOP WITH THIS MERCHANT......unless you like being ripped off and have nothing better to do with your time or money.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sortof fruity sophisticated smell.</li>
            <li> Love burberry scents</li>
            <li> I am a fan of the Burberry series of fragrances; with Touch being my favorite one.  </li>
            <li> I urge every one to try London you won&#x27;t regret : )</li>
            <li> Yes I love it</li>
            <li> Nothing like where I know I will be staying more than 3 hours like work, or night out and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent.  </li>
            <li> a more summer flavor, check out Burberry&#x27;s Brit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to buy more</li>
            <li> It is not the fragrance to be worn if you are looking for sexy.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it so what more is there to say?</li>
            <li> I like London a lot more.</li>
            <li> Every thing ok but some not</li>
            <li> This is a favorite of mine and I am so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with my purchase of Burberry London.</li>
            <li> &amp; im glad i did.</li>
            <li> but will always say something else is there favorite on there</li>
            <li> and i know for me, Burberry London is one of my favorite Winter</li>
            <li> ,i realized that this is not an  authentic product.</li>
            <li> But they all love it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s like the euphoric sensation the morning after a night of binging on the magic dragon --</li>
            <li> So try a sample at your local dept. store and see if you like it, then if you are amazed like I was, then this is the best place to buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite and it compliments me.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all of Burberry&#x27;s fragrances for men and this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Really enjoyable not too overbearing,</li>
            <li> My boyfriend was so happy because this is his favorite but because it&#x27;s an older scent not everyone carries it.  </li>
            <li> I was overall pleased with my purchase and my service!!!</li>
            <li> Burberry seems to have a very unique set of fragrances for men on the market.</li>
            <li> He was so excited, he&#x27;d sampled it at a store and really loved it, so I was so excited to give it to him.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I have loved just about every Burberry fragrance; Touch, Brit, Weekends, but when the temperature drops below 40° in the winter time and you need a fragrance that is sophisticated, masculine, and has great longevity with just the right amount of sillage then you must give this a try.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this to anyone looking for a good cologne.</li>
            <li> Suitable in my opinion for any special occasion where friends or family might gather around the fire and reminisce.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy a lot of fragrances, but this is a great, masculine smell that works any time of the year.  </li>
            <li> It smells fresh and nice and everyone seems to complement me on it.</li>
            <li> It opens up with hints of smoky Moss, the perfect blend of spices, and ends with a wonderful woody dry down.</li>
            <li> It is also very sweet, which am into, but many will find it too sweet.</li>
            <li> 10 stars for the great scent but doesnt last more than 5 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is strong for couple hours ...</li>
            <li> Strong, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> So good, I bought a new bottle.</li>
            <li> Wonderful manly smell, hints of tobacco and leather, and the typical musk they use for a mans cologne.</li>
            <li> I wear all their men&#x27;s colognes, this vendor was quick and provided outstanding service</li>
            <li> i would like to start by addressing the fact that i have done so much research on colognes that i know about more about colognes than most people and even though i am not an expert i am not someone who can be fooled easily.</li>
            <li> The price was the best part, I originally priced this item out for my boyfriend in a retail store and it was $70.00, I purchased it from Amazon for half that literally</li>
            <li> a huge hit with the ladies.</li>
            <li> The item was packaged neatly and securely.  </li>
            <li> One for each of my brothers, but liked this one sooooo much</li>
            <li> This product is cheap for a reason.</li>
            <li> That is why it is being sold so cheap on Amazon.</li>
            <li> After it ran out I bought this one on amazon because it was cheap and over three times the size of the one she got me.  </li>
            <li> It smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s ok, but not as good as Burberry Brit,</li>
            <li> The smells is ok it really smells more sugary</li>
            <li> This London is very nice though and comes in second.  </li>
            <li> It has a unique fragrance and is complimented on by everyone at work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was love at first sniff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Either Burberry has changed the formula or this is a cheap, &#x27;watered downed&#x27; version of the scent I loved (I&#x27;m guessing the latter).</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, once it dries, it actually smells quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> I like the smell; it is not overpowering, it lingers for a long time, and it gives me a very warm olfactory feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rather amazed at how such an incredible scent is one that not many people mention when they talk about great colognes, but thats alright by me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s woodsy, sweet, clean</li>
            <li> Amazing and masculine.</li>
            <li> The quantity is a great value, yet the scent is weaker than expected  </li>
            <li> Sweet and spicy.</li>
            <li> And the Nautica Blue was good for every day use</li>
            <li> Good cost, spray does not last at all.</li>
            <li> it is a sweet woodsy smell.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is cool in that the sleeve that covers it is a cloth material.</li>
            <li> Smells sweet, has woodsy, cinnamonny, vanilla overtones, and its dry-down</li>
            <li> I have also noticed, like many fragrances, London responds very well to heat.  </li>
            <li> I personally wear John Varvatos Vintage more because I like it slightly better.</li>
            <li> when those smells seem more appropriate, such as holidays.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t project as well as I would like, but it just smells so good.</li>
            <li> I bought my husband this cologne when he wanted to try a new scent, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> it smells great and it lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li> As the scent wears on through the day different aromas come forth and smell amazing.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into fresh or citrusy scents, this one&#x27;s not for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really a big fan of the smell (kind of musty/sandalwood-ey)</li>
            <li> it is by far my favorite cologne to wear.</li>
            <li> but this scent always is the one to turn heads and stay fresh in the air as you passs by.</li>
            <li> It has a more mature atmosphere.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I always receive compliments from women when I wear this cologne and more than one have complimented on masculine presence.  </li>
            <li> It is in one of my top five fragrances of all time, it just has limited use because of its strong aroma and notes.    </li>
            <li> the price was right.  </li>
            <li> A friend suggested London and they were right.</li>
            <li> It is the right fragrance for any occasion.</li>
            <li> but if you are in market for your first good quality cologne and want to get full worth out of your money spent, I would not strongly recommend it because it wont make you very excited though I am sure it will make</li>
            <li> it is not strong and quite mild and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Usually I have great satisfactiion with product purchased from Amazon</li>
            <li> The cool air is where this cologne really shines.  </li>
            <li> I have a reasonably large collection of Armanis and Polos but ever since I have got the Burberrys, I just find myself to be reaching out for these!</li>
            <li> I do not care for the other Burberry, which is too musk-y for my taste, but am very pleased with this one.</li>
            <li> like this very much.</li>
            <li> Smells great and the price is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> First, I saw this on the store but was overpriced.</li>
            <li> Never buy cologne without smelling it first, lesson learned.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I ordered size and all.  </li>
            <li> Burberry London is one of the first fragrances I reach for during the fall or winter.  </li>
            <li> ;)   </li>
            <li> GIVE YOUR MONEY TO CHARITY OR BURN IT FIRST, but don&#x27;t give it to this crook.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly &amp; was exactly what we wanted.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The description has a typo first of all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to smell like too much of a dad as a 26 year-old!</li>
            <li> i first received the cologne</li>
            <li> remember the first day wearing it, I wasn&#x27;t even going out.</li>
            <li> the authentic one will last HOURS and project out.</li>
            <li> The EDT is best suited for casual, evening wear.</li>
            <li> Not the real thing, the fragrance is similar, pleasant enough, but projection and longevity are abysmal, wears off after an hour...</li>
            <li> i was very satisfied and wore it a few times when i first purchased it in Feb. 2012 however after a month</li>
            <li> I have bought real authentic colognes of high end brands from department stores such as Macy&#x27;s and Sachs, and at times buy the cologne from the official website (like Chanel, Christian Dior)</li>
            <li> Great scent but does not last all day as mentioned by other viewers.</li>
            <li> (It is a masculine sweet, though).  </li>
            <li> Unlike many other popular designers, they have a whopping total of 8 different scents available: Classic, London, Beat, Touch, Brit, Sport, Weekend, and Summer.</li>
            <li> The other we got him Davidoff HOT, was most definitely Hot  </li>
            <li> Maybe I should have been suspect when the label was lopsided on the cologne bottle, the cap doesn&#x27;t fit snug on the bottle (like the real thing), and this product reaks of ALCOHOL (like cheap or imitation cologne).    </li>
            <li> If this could last around 6 hours, it could easily be my fav</li>
            <li> The fragrance lasts about 2 hours while the real deal will stay on your clothes until washed.</li>
            <li> This is a scent chosen by our son who really enjoys it</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S NOT THE REAL THING</li>
            <li> so you have to watch how much you use.</li>
            <li> overall London is a fantastic cologne.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well it really depends.</li>
            <li> Much sweeter than the real spray.    </li>
            <li> I Like it very much.burberry</li>
            <li> very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very pine forward</li>
            <li> but his product is inferior and not the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Reminds me a lot of Polo, but a much softer, understated scent, not overly-sweet.  </li>
            <li> i really like this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Definitely the most masculine of the Burberry Mens fragrances.</li>
            <li> So this is something that I only wear for short time meetings, date, party, get-together, dinner kind of stuff.</li>
            <li> That previous bottle was very strong and pungent.</li>
            <li> I had been familiar with the female version of this perfume, but never thought of buying &#x27;por homme&#x27; one for me.</li>
            <li> but it does last long and the packaging is nice.</li>
            <li> However, it is good for office wear as well - not very harsh and does not project excessively.</li>
            <li> I was a regular Burberry Brit fan, but it became too sweet for my liking.</li>
            <li> Other typical ones that smell great are the Eternity, CK Escape, and Drakkar Noir, Polo Green/Blue  </li>
            <li> BUT the one I received from Amazon is NOT the same, even though I ordered the exact item (I had his bottle in my hand and ordered the exact title, amount, strength - toilette...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve built this weirdly extensive cologne collection over the years, and Burberry London is about the only thing I&#x27;ve had to buy more of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is my classic fragrance during the winter.</li>
            <li> An older women at the register caught a whiff and immediately complemented me on the scent.</li>
            <li> If you buy this, I highly suggest the 3.4oz and making a decant so you can reapply after 4 hours.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> The initial hit diminishes very fast, but the underlying characteristics last for a full workday.</li>
            <li> Far from the real thing and</li>
            <li> AND PAY A FEW DOLLARS MORE.</li>
            <li> Overall, very much worth what you spend.</li>
            <li> Classy dark glass wrapped in burberry cloth with a great cap that locks on tight.</li>
            <li> London lasts extra long for me (5-6hrs) and is refreshing in a manly way (not soapy or powdery soft).</li>
            <li> i have many colognes and so i did not use the the burberry London cologne for about a few weeks, however recently when i decided to wear it to work, after spraying it for the first time in a 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I purchased this after doing some research for something new to wear to work this winter.</li>
            <li> Very classy.</li>
            <li> Not saying it will last all day, but if it is not the real version then I am assuming it is pretty good fake.  </li>
            <li> I actually regretted buying it at first.</li>
            <li> if you are out there for your first cologne, get Jean Paul gaultier Le male.</li>
            <li> Been wearing this sent for 3 years now,  I have tried my old favorites during this time and I always wish I had put on this!  </li>
            <li> and they smell exactly the same!</li>
            <li> Its sum is greater than its parts, which is what makes this cologne so natural and yet urban, classy and everything that one would associate with a heightened brand such as Burberry, a stylized aromatic representation of a British city.   </li>
            <li> Not to mention the bottle is just cool looking, unique with the fabric on the bottle and the black cap, pretty slick I must say.</li>
            <li> The smell is more or less the same.</li>
            <li> For some reason, this one seems a bit less potent, doesn&#x27;t last as long, and seems a bit higher on the alcohol side.</li>
            <li> Stock up on this if you can people because this scent I hear has ben discontinued, and may only be back off and on for a much higher premium price!.  </li>
            <li> The description of the product was plan and clear</li>
            <li> However it is obviously not the real thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s masculine and drives women wild.</li>
            <li> I have a real bottle of this at home, which I purchased from a department store, and the bottle I received here is not the same product.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t differ much from its opening notes, with moderate longetivity and projection.</li>
            <li> My experience so far is that women like smelling it</li>
            <li> Even women who prefer the &#x27;old man in the woods/daddy was a man&#x27; scent can&#x27;t/don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give the old department store version 4 stars but the amazon one underwhelms at 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would work on someone who naturally has a musky scent.  </li>
            <li> I must say I believe this would classify as a mature fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Many people have complained about its longevity.  </li>
            <li> But do I think this cologne is worth money spent?</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for an older gentleman, not really a young teenager or even a very young adult.</li>
            <li> See if the longevity is decent enough for you.</li>
            <li> The only small thing which could be better is its projection and longevity.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this, the first time was from a department store and the second time was from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It looks like what we actually received is Burberry Classic.</li>
            <li> IF YOU WANT A MAJOR DISSAPPOINTMENT....</li>
            <li> Right out of the bottle, all i smell is BLACK PEPPER.</li>
            <li> Overall, a very subtle and nice cologne.</li>
            <li> It smells like the classic green bottle Polo when you first open the bottle.  </li>
            <li> But be careful to get the real thing.</li>
            <li> I was actually pleasantly surprised it was the bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> My #2 favorite scent to wear behind Burberry Brit.</li>
            <li> have finally discovered a new cologne which is has similar notes to this cologne but lasts all day.</li>
            <li> There is a slight floral and citrusy hint somewhere in the middle notes, though I cannot exactly tell what it is..</li>
            <li> It last may be just one day, so i am not sure it is the right perfume of Buberry.</li>
            <li> Burberry&#x27;s London smells a bit like Polo (the one in the classic green bottle) mixed in with Christian Dior&#x27;s Poison (a perfume for women).   </li>
            <li> The one i got from Amazon smells the same, but it doesnt last as long as the one that was bought from a store rather than online.</li>
            <li> It has a great spicy woody base, which is what is smelt all day long.</li>
            <li> is that the smell does not last long enough.</li>
            <li> the scent was significantly weaker and i drench myself in the cologne and still only had a faint smell and last about 2-3 hrs</li>
            <li> sucks is that after 2-3 hours you wont be even able to feel it which really sucks.</li>
            <li> Not only did the cologne arrive earlier then expected</li>
            <li> But the overall scent gets VERY faint, so I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s not going to last more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I find it funny when people say they can&#x27;t smell it after a few hours, and that&#x27;s typical with any type of cologne...</li>
            <li> And, I particularly like that there&#x27;s not the usual alcohol burn after shaving.</li>
            <li> and so I went crazy and bought as many as I could get my hands on.</li>
            <li> I received this product a day earlier then expected.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I been Wanted to get this for so long.</li>
            <li> And even if you put it on in the morning before you go to work, your girlfriend/wife will be sniffing your neck all night long.</li>
            <li> While the latter experience was a little out of the ordinary, it was attention that I normally don&#x27;t get from the opposite sex</li>
            <li> Only a little is needed, and this will last for hours.  </li>
            <li> But I saw this little number listed somewhere in there -- or perhaps even on a slightly different albiet related site.</li>
            <li> I am not exactly a cologne expert, but then Im not total a newbie either.  </li>
            <li> the smell is just very different than other colognes i also use mont blanc starwalker and hugo boss in motion white the 3 having very different smell i use burberry for everyday use because smell is softer and blurs aways faster.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ve owned and used the real thing for about a year prior to this rip-off.     </li>
            <li> Makes me feel like the item might have been tampered with, possibly watered down.</li>
            <li> The price that I paid for this cologne is less than 50% of what my local department store was asking.  </li>
            <li> &quot; has a slight musky flavor, with a hint of spices, especially tobacco.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does not seem to last very long.  </li>
            <li> The first time I wore this cologne out to eat sushi, within 10 minutes of sitting down I received positive comments from the hostess, and a very awkward compliment from a woman sitting next to me with her husband?/boyfriend?</li>
            <li> I bought this product blind after hearing allot about it in particular and the brand in general.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 3.4 Oz Bottle, and received it in the mail a few days later.</li>
            <li> I purchased a smaller bottle a few months ago from Dillard&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> then I expected.</li>
            <li> I know a few cheaper colognes that give out the same smell.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> : I love this scent but I am disappointed in the longevity and the projection.</li>
            <li> At Von Maur&#x27;s they try to convince you to try the Chanel or some other cologne</li>
            <li> and I have used it everyday for long time.</li>
            <li> My GF bought me a small one of these for Christmas last year.  </li>
            <li> i will never again buy cologne from amazon or any other fragrance on this site again.</li>
            <li> I even continued to buy other colognes, but none can match the charisma and smoothness.</li>
            <li> BUY IT!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t have &#x27;other&#x27; people</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviewers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn Chrome and Kenneth Cole Black in the past, but have not liked them as much as this one.  </li>
            <li> If something is nice people will buy it and it will become common but that doesnt make it a bad cologne.</li>
            <li> suddenly know what this Godsend is, or worse, actually wear it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This would should last at least 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Top notes are a little sharp, but heart and base notes are</li>
            <li> I truly feel that this is watered down and will not buy again.  </li>
            <li> Keep the sprays 2 or less, because this is a stronger frangrance.</li>
            <li> and I bought the 3 oz for less</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who enjoys fragrances, you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> I thought I was saving a few bucks with this merchant, INSTEAD I LOST EVERY DOLLAR ON THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> It is heavy</li>
            <li> had to beat off a few dudes as well.</li>
            <li> can only describe it poorly and with metaphysical analogy, but here it goes; its smells like you took a bath in Heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never have I met anyone who has not liked it</li>
            <li> Although it is an expensive fragrance a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is subtle yet noticeable and a little bit lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> Really disappointed in Amazon, buy in a fragrance outlet instead if you want the real deal.</li>
            <li> Neither of us wants to go through the hassle of returning the item. :(</li>
            <li> Hard to be cloying so 2 on neck and 1 on each wrist.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to rate cologne.  </li>
            <li> My husband LOVES this cologne &amp; it&#x27;s hard to find in stores these days.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially, you get a hard hit of tobacco shop and leather, with some tea undertones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Advice - I have learned hard way that always buy scents after trying them on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find this anymore.</li>
            <li> it sucks.  </li>
            <li> I know it is common</li>
            <li> 3 stars are because it sucks at longevity.</li>
            <li> Everyone, and I mean everyone loves this scent.</li>
            <li> I now know why this product is less expensive than that found in department stores.  </li>
            <li> Also, the wrap on the outside of the bottle smells so bad you will need to cut it off if you decide to keep it.  </li>
            <li> I am really frustrated, I spent a lot of money on this item for him, and it is not the one he wanted.</li>
            <li> Burberry would never send a product packaged in a material that smells worse than burning tires.   </li>
            <li> I was initially skeptical of this product because I know there are a lot of colognes on the web that are knock offs.</li>
            <li> listening rather angrily.  </li>
            <li> , i blind bought</li>
            <li> i am convinced it is a fake and upset that amazon was the one who sold me the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not for mere mortals, I assure you.</li>
            <li> This is lousy because it cost me 44 dollars .</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for cold, or snowy days.</li>
            <li> bad longevity is close to none.</li>
            <li> London\\&quot; When my husband opened it, I could tell he was disappointed.</li>
            <li> It too has horrible longevity.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First, I saw this on the store but was overpriced. Took a look at amazon to see if they had it. Love the smell of it, it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I was initially skeptical of this product because I know there are a lot of colognes on the web that are knock offs. However I trusted this product because it was a amazon approved seller. However it is obviously not the real thing. The fragrance lasts about 2 hours while the real deal will stay on your clothes until washed. The smell is more or less the same.</li>
            <li> Scent: Amazing and masculine. Sweet and spicy. Blend of tobacco leaves, pepper and leather with greens. Very classy. Age mid 20s+.&lt;br /&gt;Projection: 3 out of 5&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: 2 out of 5 (4 hours max)&lt;br /&gt;Bottle: Awesome. Classy dark glass wrapped in burberry cloth with a great cap that locks on tight. Spray shoots out a ton and you will need it.&lt;br /&gt;Application: Winter. Any time of day. Hard to be cloying so 2 on neck and 1 on each wrist. Great for Christmas or Thanksgiving.&lt;br /&gt;Similar fragrances: John Varvatos Vintage&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I love this scent but I am disappointed in the longevity and the projection. If you buy this, I highly suggest the 3.4oz and making a decant so you can reapply after 4 hours. I personally wear John Varvatos Vintage more because I like it slightly better. It too has horrible longevity.</li>
            <li> I have used the Blueberry London that belongs to my friend. The one i got from Amazon smells the same, but it doesnt last as long as the one that was bought from a store rather than online.</li>
            <li> stinky stinky ew.  well okay,,  if you&#x27;re 60+ it might be alright. nah forget that. it sucks.  Never buy cologne without smelling it first, lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne since christmas was coming up. This fragrance reminds you of christmas and it smells of cinnamon, nutmeg, leather, and tobacco leaves. It&#x27;s masculine and drives women wild. I would recommend this for cold, or snowy days. Keep the sprays 2 or less, because this is a stronger frangrance. Not to mention the bottle is just cool looking, unique with the fabric on the bottle and the black cap, pretty slick I must say.</li>
            <li> I have tried different colognes over the years, but I keep coming back to Burberry London.  It has a unique fragrance and is complimented on by everyone at work.</li>
            <li> I received this product a day earlier then expected.  The item was packaged neatly and securely.  It was exactly what I ordered size and all.  The description of the product was plan and clear and I knew it was the scent I needed.  The price was the best part, I originally priced this item out for my boyfriend in a retail store and it was $70.00, I purchased it from Amazon for half that literally and it was the same size as in the retail store.  My boyfriend was so happy because this is his favorite but because it&#x27;s an older scent not everyone carries it.  I was overall pleased with my purchase and my service!!!</li>
            <li> I like Burberry London becasue it is not strong and quite mild and pleasant.  Price on Amazon is great, cheaper than Sam&#x27;s Club by about 10% and about 40% cheaper than depsrtment stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this scent because I smelled it on a friend and loved it!!!...BUT the one I received from Amazon is NOT the same, even though I ordered the exact item (I had his bottle in my hand and ordered the exact title, amount, strength - toilette...)I would love to return the item, but I no longer have the box it came in...and both my husband and I have had adverse reactions to this item (nautious).  Is there anyway this purchase can be rectified?</li>
            <li> Burberry London is one of the first fragrances I reach for during the fall or winter.  Its a beatiful scent, with spicy notes that call to mind the best parts of the holidays.  Suitable in my opinion for any special occasion where friends or family might gather around the fire and reminisce.  Projection is moderate, people will notice you as you go by, and longevity is moderate also, lasting on my skin perhaps 6 to 7 hours.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who enjoys fragrances, you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> This cologne is Great!  I purchased this one and Burberry Brit .... One for each of my brothers, but liked this one sooooo much, I bought for myself.  I don&#x27;t think it lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t project as well as I would like, but it just smells so good.</li>
            <li> This was a great fragrance in a cologne. At Von Maur&#x27;s they try to convince you to try the Chanel or some other cologne but this was by far the best smelling of the cologne for men. It is perfect as it is a very sleek and elegant and does its job. It is not an overpowering smell at all. I would certainly recommend this to anyone looking for a good cologne.</li>
            <li> My #2 favorite scent to wear behind Burberry Brit. London is a great scent that reminds me of winter, cinnamon, pine trees, and fresh flannel/timber. I purchased an extra just to have around in case it would ever sell out or be unavailable.    London lasts extra long for me (5-6hrs) and is refreshing in a manly way (not soapy or powdery soft). The first time I wore this cologne out to eat sushi, within 10 minutes of sitting down I received positive comments from the hostess, and a very awkward compliment from a woman sitting next to me with her husband?/boyfriend? listening rather angrily.  While the latter experience was a little out of the ordinary, it was attention that I normally don&#x27;t get from the opposite sex and you wont find me complaining about that ;)   I&#x27;m rather amazed at how such an incredible scent is one that not many people mention when they talk about great colognes, but thats alright by me. I&#x27;ll keep it my alternate to Burberry Brit!   If only Burberry made toothpaste and mouthwash I would be set!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and the price. I am totally satisfied with my purchase. I only wish that I could find the Burberry London body wash at an excellent price as this cologne was; you go Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> Definitely the most masculine of the Burberry Mens fragrances. Love it to wear outdoors in the winter or summer. I like the touch and brit for more formal occassions, indoors, in spring and fall.</li>
            <li> para este otoño-invierno dificilmente encontraras una fragancia de esta calidad a este precio, si te gustan las fragancias con olor a cuero y tabaco y aromaticas esta es la tuya, tiene una excelente duracion (10 hrs aprox)y muy buena presencia...es una de mis consentidas</li>
            <li> This is a scent chosen by our son who really enjoys it and I have to admit it smells very nice on him.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best price on the internet and it was shipped to my house in a couple of days!  Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE!     GIVE YOUR MONEY TO CHARITY OR BURN IT FIRST, but don&#x27;t give it to this crook. This product is cheap for a reason. IT&#x27;S NOT THE REAL THING..I know I&#x27;ve owned and used the real thing for about a year prior to this rip-off.     I thought I was saving a few bucks with this merchant, INSTEAD I LOST EVERY DOLLAR ON THIS PRODUCT. Maybe I should have been suspect when the label was lopsided on the cologne bottle, the cap doesn&#x27;t fit snug on the bottle (like the real thing), and this product reaks of ALCOHOL (like cheap or imitation cologne).    GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND PAY A FEW DOLLARS MORE. DON&#x27;T BE A FOOL LIKE I WAS.     DON&#x27;T SHOP WITH THIS MERCHANT......unless you like being ripped off and have nothing better to do with your time or money.     IF YOU WANT A MAJOR DISSAPPOINTMENT....shop with this merchant.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent perfume from Burberry. I sampled it before I ordered. It has a great spicy woody base, which is what is smelt all day long. There is a slight floral and citrusy hint somewhere in the middle notes, though I cannot exactly tell what it is.. Longevity is good on me, can smell it for 8-10 hours. The EDT is best suited for casual, evening wear. However, it is good for office wear as well - not very harsh and does not project excessively. This is one of my current favorites.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 3.4 Oz Bottle, and received it in the mail a few days later. It smells weaker than it did when I tested it in the store, but smells great otherwise. Hoping that was just an isolated problem. Definitely buy! But be careful to get the real thing. It&#x27;s a sortof fruity sophisticated smell.</li>
            <li> Not only did the cologne arrive earlier then expected but it was in perfect condition with the original wrapper still on it.  Also the price was the best I have found anywhere and had free shipping!</li>
            <li> Right out of the bottle, all i smell is BLACK PEPPER. I swear. Might as well go to your kitchen and pop open your basic jar of ground pepper because that&#x27;s what it smells like. I actually regretted buying it at first. HOWEVER, once it dries, it actually smells quite pleasant. But the overall scent gets VERY faint, so I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s not going to last more than a couple hours. You&#x27;d have to spray quite a bit on you. I only did one spray because the initial scent is SO overpowering. I guess I&#x27;ll have to deal with it to get to the nice smell that follows minutes after. Overall, it&#x27;s ok, but not as good as Burberry Brit, that one is amazing. If you&#x27;re into fresh or citrusy scents, this one&#x27;s not for you. TRY before you buy, i can&#x27;t stress that enough with Burberry London.</li>
            <li> I recieved item on time, sealed in box when I opened the box I found the bottle was leaking a tiny bit.   Makes me feel like the item might have been tampered with, possibly watered down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to rate cologne.  I&#x27;m not really a big fan of the smell (kind of musty/sandalwood-ey) but it does last long and the packaging is nice.</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES this cologne &amp; it&#x27;s hard to find in stores these days.  Glad to have found it here!  Arrived promptly &amp; was exactly what we wanted.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great scent but does not last all day as mentioned by other viewers. Love burberry scents but this one did not hit the mark. Will try the Brit next.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve built this weirdly extensive cologne collection over the years, and Burberry London is about the only thing I&#x27;ve had to buy more of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, you get a hard hit of tobacco shop and leather, with some tea undertones. The initial hit diminishes very fast, but the underlying characteristics last for a full workday. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;grown-up&amp;#34; but not &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34;. And, I particularly like that there&#x27;s not the usual alcohol burn after shaving.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of the Burberry series of fragrances; with Touch being my favorite one.  This London is very nice though and comes in second.  It is heavy so you have to watch how much you use. Only a little is needed, and this will last for hours.  It is also very sweet, which am into, but many will find it too sweet.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after doing some research for something new to wear to work this winter. Smells great! My wife loves it too.</li>
            <li> Amazon did a great job of delivering my burberry london on time . It took just three day for me to receive my order. overall London is a fantastic cologne.&lt;br /&gt;I been Wanted to get this for so long. now that i have it in my arsenal the sky is the limit. I urge every one to try London you won&#x27;t regret : )</li>
            <li> This is one of those popular colognes out there which every reviewer loves. And thus I also bought it w/o actually using it. Do I like it? Yes I love it and I have used it everyday for long time. But do I think this cologne is worth money spent? Well it really depends. Here are some thoughts -&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this smells simply great. I wish I could smell it all day. No joke. When you will put it on , you will instantly fall in love.&lt;br /&gt;What sucks is that after 2-3 hours you wont be even able to feel it which really sucks. So this is something that I only wear for short time meetings, date, party, get-together, dinner kind of stuff. Nothing like where I know I will be staying more than 3 hours like work, or night out and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is must of any person who is building up their cologne collection but if you are in market for your first good quality cologne and want to get full worth out of your money spent, I would not strongly recommend it because it wont make you very excited though I am sure it will make you smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice - I have learned hard way that always buy scents after trying them on. For me, I personally want longevity in my colognes. There is no use of shelling 40-70 bucks on something which lasts for 2- 3hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are out there for your first cologne, get Jean Paul gaultier Le male. I know it is common, I know it is best selling but that is what happens to something that is good. If something is nice people will buy it and it will become common but that doesnt make it a bad cologne. It lasts on me forever like 10 hours and has great smell.&lt;br /&gt;Another advice is that always go to a store on weekend, and try something that you would buy. See if the longevity is decent enough for you. 5-6 hours is something that I consider good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again this is a great cologne. 3 stars are because it sucks at longevity. If this could last around 6 hours, it could easily be my fav cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***********Update*************&lt;br /&gt;I have finally discovered a new cologne which is has similar notes to this cologne but lasts all day. It is &amp;#34;Bvlgari Man in Black&amp;#34;. Excellent smell and lasts way longer than Burberry London. try it out.s has similar notes to this cologne but lasts all day. It is &amp;#34;Bvlgari Man in Black&amp;#34;. Excellent smell and lasts way longer than Burberry London. try it out.</li>
            <li> Great purchase for the price.  Would do it again.&lt;br /&gt;No problems or issues.</li>
            <li> Given to me by an English friend of mine.  I absolutely love this scent.  I&#x27;ve worn Chrome and Kenneth Cole Black in the past, but have not liked them as much as this one.  It smells like the classic green bottle Polo when you first open the bottle.  Then, when the scent dries, it changes to a rather warm and woodsy smell that gets many compliments.  A little goes a long way.  Their aftershave emulsion is also a great product when paired with the cologne.</li>
            <li> This really an excellent cologne for men.  The price that I paid for this cologne is less than 50% of what my local department store was asking.  My wife loves this cologne.  My only complaint is that it does not seem to last very long.  After about 4 - 5 hours the cologne is gone and needs to be refreshed.  Unlike my Givenchy PI which still lingers after 12 - 14 hours.  I suspect this cologne does not have as much essential oils in it.  Still, this is a really nice cologne.</li>
            <li> I have a real bottle of this at home, which I purchased from a department store, and the bottle I received here is not the same product. It&#x27;s close to the same scent but not the same. Much sweeter than the real spray.    Also, the wrap on the outside of the bottle smells so bad you will need to cut it off if you decide to keep it.  It makes an entire room smell. Burberry would never send a product packaged in a material that smells worse than burning tires.   Definitley a knock off! I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> * The Burberry London scent smelled extremely mm good on my boyfriend  * The other we got him Davidoff HOT, was most definitely Hot  * Other typical ones that smell great are the Eternity, CK Escape, and Drakkar Noir, Polo Green/Blue  * And the Nautica Blue was good for every day use</li>
            <li> I love this cologne!!! And so do a lot of the people I am around! It smells wonderful it is by far my favorite cologne to wear.</li>
            <li> I Like it very much.burberry london has very nice pleasant smell.the flip side of this one is that the smell does not last long enough. it is strong for couple hours ...and then it fades away.overall...i like it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, smells great.Product came on time. All of my friends try to steal this one. I would order from them again.</li>
            <li> Smells great, packaged just as if it was purchased from a store and the price was right.  Great gift for a man.</li>
            <li> The quantity is a great value, yet the scent is weaker than expected  I purchased a smaller bottle a few months ago from Dillard&#x27;s.  That previous bottle was very strong and pungent.</li>
            <li> Wonderful manly smell, hints of tobacco and leather, and the typical musk they use for a mans cologne. Again, tobacco...not an ashtray. Lasts all day. Strong, but not overpowering. Especially nice in the fall and winter when those smells seem more appropriate, such as holidays.</li>
            <li> Simple scent.masculine my husband loves  it I do too.one favorite.christmas gift lasted over 1 yr.wearing occasionally.</li>
            <li> I had been familiar with the female version of this perfume, but never thought of buying &#x27;por homme&#x27; one for me. I received this one as a result of seller sending it by mistake when I purchased [[ASIN:B000E7STWK Burberry Brit By Burberry For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Ounces]]. Now I repent that I hadn&#x27;t bought it earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This perfume is good, not just good, very very good. I like the smell; it is not overpowering, it lingers for a long time, and it gives me a very warm olfactory feel. Top notes are a little sharp, but heart and base notes are very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this very much. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a great winter scent that goes as well at the office as it does on the dancefloor.  Very pine forward and it stays with you nicely for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a more summer flavor, check out Burberry&#x27;s Brit.  I do this in the fall and winter and Brit in the spring and summer.</li>
            <li> I now know why this product is less expensive than that found in department stores.  I have used this product for several years and know the potentcy should be stronger than that in the product I received from Amazon.  This cologne is much much weaker and almost no fragrance within a few hours.  I truly feel that this is watered down and will not buy again.  Usually I have great satisfactiion with product purchased from Amazon but his product is inferior and not the real thing.  Bob Lepper  Springstead, Wi</li>
            <li> I was a regular Burberry Brit fan, but it became too sweet for my liking. A friend suggested London and they were right. It is the right fragrance for any occasion.</li>
            <li> Not saying it will last all day, but if it is not the real version then I am assuming it is pretty good fake.  Good price</li>
            <li> The description has a typo first of all. Good cost, spray does not last at all. That is why it is being sold so cheap on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy a lot of fragrances, but this is a great, masculine smell that works any time of the year.  Reminds me a lot of Polo, but a much softer, understated scent, not overly-sweet.  Wife loves it on me, so can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> i really like this product. it smells great and it lasts a few hours. it&#x27;s a nice deal for the price (i paid $30).</li>
            <li> I love this scent on my husband!  The best way I can describe it is a sweet woodsy smell.  (It is a masculine sweet, though).  Amazon is definitely the place to purchase this, as their prices beat department stores.</li>
            <li> Everyone, and I mean everyone loves this scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find this anymore. Great price and exactly what a wanted.  I&#x27;m going to buy more so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Burberry seems to have a very unique set of fragrances for men on the market. Unlike many other popular designers, they have a whopping total of 8 different scents available: Classic, London, Beat, Touch, Brit, Sport, Weekend, and Summer. I have 5 of these, and have smelled all except the Summer. They are all excellent scents that bring their own unique appeal. For the London, its spiciness and woodiness brings to mind the fall/winter season. For me, it lasts about 6 hours. The bottle is cool in that the sleeve that covers it is a cloth material.</li>
            <li> this is my classic fragrance during the winter. I have loved just about every Burberry fragrance; Touch, Brit, Weekends, but when the temperature drops below 40° in the winter time and you need a fragrance that is sophisticated, masculine, and has great longevity with just the right amount of sillage then you must give this a try. It opens up with hints of smoky Moss, the perfect blend of spices, and ends with a wonderful woody dry down. It is not the fragrance to be worn if you are looking for sexy. But if you are between the ages of 30 and 45, and have a formal event in the evening during the fall or winter, look no further than Burberry London. It is in one of my top five fragrances of all time, it just has limited use because of its strong aroma and notes.    Illustration: if you can picture yourself in a law library, or in the den of your home wearing a smoking jacket, pipe in your mouth, roaring fire in the background, reading Chaucer... all while watching the snow fall out your window, this is it. And even if you put it on in the morning before you go to work, your girlfriend/wife will be sniffing your neck all night long.</li>
            <li> Although it is an expensive fragrance a little goes a long way. My wife likes it so what more is there to say?</li>
            <li> Burberry is my favorite cologne and this one is the best.  I wear all their men&#x27;s colognes, this vendor was quick and provided outstanding service</li>
            <li> Burberry&#x27;s London smells a bit like Polo (the one in the classic green bottle) mixed in with Christian Dior&#x27;s Poison (a perfume for women).   Smells sweet, has woodsy, cinnamonny, vanilla overtones, and its dry-down doesn&#x27;t differ much from its opening notes, with moderate longetivity and projection. (I use two sprays, both sides of the neck.) It&#x27;s an enticing cologne and great for the fall/winter,  holiday season.  Its sum is greater than its parts, which is what makes this cologne so natural and yet urban, classy and everything that one would associate with a heightened brand such as Burberry, a stylized aromatic representation of a British city.   I also have Burberry&#x27;s The Beat. I like London a lot more.</li>
            <li> Every thing ok but some not</li>
            <li> Good Cologne but a bit overbearing at times. Don&#x27;t want to smell like too much of a dad as a 26 year-old! I would recommend Burberry Touch instead.</li>
            <li> Great smelling. So good, I bought a new bottle. It smells fresh and nice and everyone seems to complement me on it.</li>
            <li> This is a favorite of mine and I am so glad I found it on Amazon. The men&#x27;s version of Burberry London is no longer sold within the Burberry line, so I took a chance and searched for it here. They have it and it is a great price. Relief!</li>
            <li> Smells great and the price is hard to beat. This same bottle costs $70 at the local mall. Will definately purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with my purchase of Burberry London.A very pleasant masculine smell. Great longevity on my skin. The cool air is where this cologne really shines.  I will be buying another one.</li>
            <li> My GF bought me a small one of these for Christmas last year.  She went to a cologne store in the mall and sniffed dozens of scents and picked this one for me.  After it ran out I bought this one on amazon because it was cheap and over three times the size of the one she got me.  The 1oz bottle lasted me almost a year.  This would should last at least 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the scent!</li>
            <li> This is a good smell good product. My husband was very happy with my selection. I would refer this to my friends!!!</li>
            <li> Great cologne for men, i blind bought this one(cause i heard it was one of burberrys best smelling) &amp; im glad i did. I sprayed this on my neck, just one spray &amp; it lasted the entire night. 1-3 sprays are good for this cologne. One spray on the heart, one spray on the neck &amp; one spray on the wrist &amp; then rub your wrists together then smell good for the rest of the night with tons of compliments being said your way.</li>
            <li> Been wearing this sent for 3 years now,  I have tried my old favorites during this time and I always wish I had put on this!  3 to 4 sprays and the scent lasts for about 6 to 8hrs.  Stock up on this if you can people because this scent I hear has ben discontinued, and may only be back off and on for a much higher premium price!.  My experience so far is that women like smelling it but will always say something else is there favorite on there man,  but this scent always is the one to turn heads and stay fresh in the air as you passs by.</li>
            <li> i would like to start by addressing the fact that i have done so much research on colognes that i know about more about colognes than most people and even though i am not an expert i am not someone who can be fooled easily. however i did make the mistake of throwing away the box before i should of checked if the serial number on the bottled match the one on the box. I have bought real authentic colognes of high end brands from department stores such as Macy&#x27;s and Sachs, and at times buy the cologne from the official website (like Chanel, Christian Dior), however i just wanted a cologne for work that i know has a great winter smell that is sweet and woody and i know for me, Burberry London is one of my favorite Winter colognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when i first received the cologne i was very satisfied and wore it a few times when i first purchased it in Feb. 2012 however after a month,i realized that this is not an  authentic product. i have many colognes and so i did not use the the burberry London cologne for about a few weeks, however recently when i decided to wear it to work, after spraying it for the first time in a 3 weeks the scent was significantly weaker and i drench myself in the cologne and still only had a faint smell and last about 2-3 hrs but thats after spraying it 15+ times on me. i am convinced it is a fake and upset that amazon was the one who sold me the product. i will never again buy cologne from amazon or any other fragrance on this site again.</li>
            <li> a huge hit with the ladies. had to beat off a few dudes as well. ( not literally!!)</li>
            <li> I bought this product blind after hearing allot about it in particular and the brand in general. When I tried it for the first time I was very much impressed and still am. It smells fantastic. The only small thing which could be better is its projection and longevity. While they are both acceptable, now they could still be improved. Overall, very much worth what you spend. I would recommend it for an older gentleman, not really a young teenager or even a very young adult. It has a more mature atmosphere. But that shouldn&#x27;t stop you from trying it no matter your age.</li>
            <li> Years ago I read a list of colognes that were recommended, that were from a seduction site of some sort -- or so I recall. Some of the posted colognes were no longer made/too expensive/hard to find. But I saw this little number listed somewhere in there -- or perhaps even on a slightly different albiet related site. I&#x27;m into pleasant smells and so I went crazy and bought as many as I could get my hands on. This was one of the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was love at first sniff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember the first day wearing it, I wasn&#x27;t even going out. As I recall I went to Carl&#x27;s Jr to grab a salad. For whatever reason I went inside instead of using the drivethru -- line perhaps? An older women at the register caught a whiff and immediately complemented me on the scent. From that day forth I would -- and still do -- receive complements all the time about the cologne. I have never met anyone who wears it, and I&#x27;ve never met anyone who has even known of it. But they all love it. Women and Men alike are incapable of resisting it&#x27;s &#x27;aromic-allure&#x27;. I even continued to buy other colognes, but none can match the charisma and smoothness. Even women who prefer the &#x27;old man in the woods/daddy was a man&#x27; scent can&#x27;t/don&#x27;t complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only describe it poorly and with metaphysical analogy, but here it goes; its smells like you took a bath in Heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never have I met anyone who has not liked it, it&#x27;s like the euphoric sensation the morning after a night of binging on the magic dragon -- well sort of, but in a scent form. Don&#x27;t wear it unless you want to never buy another cologne for the rest of your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, DON&#x27;T BUY IT!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY IT!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY IT!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY IT!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T BUY IT!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t have &#x27;other&#x27; people suddenly know what this Godsend is, or worse, actually wear it!&lt;br /&gt;It is for I, and I alone.&lt;br /&gt;It is not for mere mortals, I assure you. Only the holiest of holies can withstand it&#x27;s perfection.it&#x27;s perfection.</li>
            <li> I bought my husband this cologne when he wanted to try a new scent, and I love it.  It is subtle yet noticeable and a little bit lasts all day.  I do not care for the other Burberry, which is too musk-y for my taste, but am very pleased with this one.</li>
            <li> I have had 3 of this colognes the smell is just very different than other colognes i also use mont blanc starwalker and hugo boss in motion white the 3 having very different smell i use burberry for everyday use because smell is softer and blurs aways faster.</li>
            <li> I am not exactly a cologne expert, but then Im not total a newbie either.  \\&quot;London\\&quot; has a slight musky flavor, with a hint of spices, especially tobacco.  Overall, a very subtle and nice cologne. Well worth the price.  I have a reasonably large collection of Armanis and Polos but ever since I have got the Burberrys, I just find myself to be reaching out for these!</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the most wonderful scents a man can wear for himself.  As the scent wears on through the day different aromas come forth and smell amazing.  I find it funny when people say they can&#x27;t smell it after a few hours, and that&#x27;s typical with any type of cologne...you become use to the smell and don&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s part of you.  So try a sample at your local dept. store and see if you like it, then if you are amazed like I was, then this is the best place to buy. I love Amazon and there prices!!!</li>
            <li> The smells is ok it really smells more sugary then I expected. I know a few cheaper colognes that give out the same smell.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this, the first time was from a department store and the second time was from Amazon. For some reason, this one seems a bit less potent, doesn&#x27;t last as long, and seems a bit higher on the alcohol side. It just overall misses the mark. It&#x27;s a great scent but the quality seems to be a bit lower. I&#x27;d give the old department store version 4 stars but the amazon one underwhelms at 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely does not have the longevity I once remembered with this fragrance. Either Burberry has changed the formula or this is a cheap, &#x27;watered downed&#x27; version of the scent I loved (I&#x27;m guessing the latter). Do yourself - and others - a favor by coughing up the extra $20-30 and buy this at a department store and get a bottle that will last the entire day with just a spray or two.</li>
            <li> Not the real thing, the fragrance is similar, pleasant enough, but projection and longevity are abysmal, wears off after an hour... Far from the real thing and the authentic one will last HOURS and project out. Really disappointed in Amazon, buy in a fragrance outlet instead if you want the real deal.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD QUALITY  PERFUME. I RECOMEND.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite and it compliments me.  It&#x27;s woodsy, sweet, clean but I wouldn&#x27;t call it musk.  I don&#x27;t think it would work on someone who naturally has a musky scent.  I think it give a sense of masculinity without smelling like a lumberjack</li>
            <li> Great price love the smell</li>
            <li> I have tried all of Burberry&#x27;s fragrances for men and this one is my favorite.  It is a very sophisticated scent that continues to unfurl hours after application. I must say I believe this would classify as a mature fragrance.  I have also noticed, like many fragrances, London responds very well to heat.  Many people have complained about its longevity.  Apply it after you shower to the chest and throat along the back of your jawline, then go out.  I always receive compliments from women when I wear this cologne and more than one have complimented on masculine presence.  I find this cologne is best appreciated during the evening in the colder months of the year.  However I have also worn it during the summer where the heat and humidity help bring it out.  Buy with confidence from Amazon and not a third party seller.</li>
            <li> All I wear and had no problems with my order. I would order again. I was actually pleasantly surprised it was the bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing price for this Burberry-London,cologne! My son loves it and at this price ,who can resist! Thanks</li>
            <li> My girlfriend bought me the 1.7 oz at the department store for $50 and I bought the 3 oz for less and they smell exactly the same! Arrived on time and would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> This is has an amazing smell, better than Polo and stays with you all day. Really enjoyable not too overbearing,</li>
            <li> I ordered Burberry of London for my husband for his birthday. He was so excited, he&#x27;d sampled it at a store and really loved it, so I was so excited to give it to him.&lt;br /&gt;Well, what I received is NOT Burberry of London. It is a red box, and it doesn&#x27;t say London on the box, although the packing slip and my order confirmation says \\&quot;Burberry London\\&quot; When my husband opened it, I could tell he was disappointed. It looks like what we actually received is Burberry Classic. I am really frustrated, I spent a lot of money on this item for him, and it is not the one he wanted. It smells nice too, but it is not the Burberry London. Neither of us wants to go through the hassle of returning the item. :(</li>
            <li> Ordered for husband as it was cheaper online than in stores. Arrived quite quickly and smells good. A Happy husband.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like it should . I know because I&#x27;ve worn this for years . This stuff smells like off or window cleaner . This is lousy because it cost me 44 dollars . From now on , I won&#x27;t buy anything from burnerry. The burnerry burn me .</li>
            <li> It last may be just one day, so i am not sure it is the right perfume of Buberry. But it smells good.</li>
            <li> 10 stars for the great scent but doesnt last more than 5 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the scent itself as a storm of cinnamon prelude followed by port wine, leather, and sensational basenote of tobacco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;too bad longevity is close to none.</li>
            <li> I wear this for a lighter daytime scent.  Smells delicious and I get compliments from everyone that comes in close contact.  Remember not to drown yourself in this stuff, a spray or 2 does the trick.</li>
            <li> This EDT has a pleasant aroma and you can use by day, as well as at night. I recommend it totally and without reservations. I like it.</li>
