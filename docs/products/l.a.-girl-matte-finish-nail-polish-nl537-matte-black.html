            <li>It works great, and with the matte finish, doesn&#x27;t detract from the daytime appearance of the devices.</li>

            <li>I am probably going to purchase more colors too!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>but she liked it.</li>
            <li>I was not overly thrilled with this polish.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t too satisfied on this.</li>
            <li>of all the matte polishes and top</li>
            <li>that this is a top coat)</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>For me to feel confident doing anything with my hands after I&#x27;ve applied it, I wait maybe an hour before I trust using my hands.</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>it isnt 100% matte, id say more like 75%</li>
            <li>absolutally grand,</li>
            <li>I love this nail polish and use it all the time.</li>
            <li>i guess this stuff is okay.</li>
            <li>I love the matte finish for a change up.  </li>
            <li>I love one-step matte finish polish.  </li>
            <li>The contrast makes for a wonderful and different look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a chalkboard on my nails :)</li>
            <li>I love the color.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love the matte finish.</li>
            <li>daughter happy with polish thanks for not dissapointing her</li>
            <li>Very fun nail polish color!</li>
            <li>It needs a top coat to keep it in good condition, but top coats make it glossy and defeat the purpose of using a matte polish in the first place.</li>
            <li>its lasted quite a while, it was good priced and shipped fast!</li>
            <li>It was cheap, stylish, and cute.</li>
            <li>And if you want the best shiny black you&#x27;ve ever seen, put a top coat on it.</li>
            <li>still not a bad color, Will use often!</li>
            <li>chip easily</li>
            <li>Bought this for my girlfriend she absolutely loved it and the smile on her face along with the other things I bought her made me happy...</li>
            <li>then I guess it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
            <li>Gives a great color, and it&#x27;s definitely matte.</li>
            <li>A good buy for someone of a young age that would enjoy this color polish.</li>
            <li>Love the awesome matte finish paired with a shiny black tip.totally thinking this is my new favorite choice of color</li>
            <li>and it dries real fast!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone trying to use this for any special occasions, but if it&#x27;s just for the heck of it</li>
            <li>Overall really good for the price.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any other matte polish, but for the price, and how it looks, I&#x27;m perfectly happy.</li>
            <li>i say buy two you will use it up quick</li>
            <li>However, the matte effect wore off quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks very pretty</li>
            <li>L.A. Girl Black Matte Finish Nail Polish is great.</li>
            <li>I really like this nail polish!!</li>
            <li>This is by far her favorite.  </li>
            <li>It takes a few coats to look nice, but then gets globby as you put more on.</li>
            <li>But the finish is more matte with only one coat, so I try to get a good solid covering with the first coat.  </li>
            <li>I decided to get this one because it was such a good price and had decent reviews.</li>
            <li>Even though it takes to coats to get the matte effect, I liked it at first, then two days later the matte effect disappeared and it was glossy:|</li>
            <li>The small brush and color were great and cheaper than touch-up paint.</li>
            <li>I personally think it dries very quickly!</li>
            <li>Matte finishes are so hot right now.  </li>
            <li>It shipped and arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>It dries very fast.</li>
            <li>It may seem dry pretty quickly, but it will ding super easy.</li>
            <li>Perfect if you want flat matte black nails or if you want your designs to pop!</li>
            <li>It is exactly what it says and i got lots of compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>I had to put a matte finisher on top of it to get an actual matte look.</li>
            <li>The matte look is pretty cool and is nice contrasted against a normal shiny black polish.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and allows me to easily do other designs on top of it without smearing.</li>
            <li>but when i tried it on, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a general thing or just the quality of the nail polish, but it looked cheap on my nails.</li>
            <li>After a couple of days the matte finish of this polish kind of wears down and starts to get shiny.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a nice black color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shade of black is really nice, sometimes a black can be &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; I found this one rather nice.</li>
            <li>And even if it does set properly, the polish chips easily.</li>
            <li>I was able to achieve the matte black look with 2 coats (the first coat does look pretty streaky).  </li>
            <li>Many matte nail polish reviews for others said that it would get ruined easily, takes long to dry etc etc.</li>
            <li>I bought this because i REALLY like the matte look</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t really care</li>
            <li>but you get what you paid for really.</li>
            <li>I really like the look of this nail polish!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Its a real matte nail polish</li>
            <li>but it dries really</li>
            <li>Not so much MATTE finish as it is WAXY.</li>
            <li>reason I&#x27;m rating this 4 instead of 5 stars is because the polish leaked, and it wasn&#x27;t really what I wanted</li>
            <li>I bought it to use with the foil and it works very well.</li>
            <li>The only con is that the polish is not quite as smooth as some others when you layer, so it&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; looking.</li>
            <li>but I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Not to mention how fast it chips, and you can&#x27;t use a chip protectant on it because it won&#x27;t keep the matte look.</li>
            <li>it took way too many coats, and its just not what i expected, but then again, i&#x27;m picky about polish.</li>
            <li>I can create so many designs with the matte black but my favorite the classic french manicure with a clear tip</li>
            <li>very matte and surprisingly durable, but need 2 coats for a totally opaque black.</li>
            <li>Although you do have to apply a few coats to get it to be a true black, it still is really nice for the price!</li>
            <li>But one coat is still matte but like a slightly unnoticeable transparency which actually looks good.</li>
            <li>Matte black is my favorite color</li>
            <li>I love this matte black</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the matte and glossy black look and had to buy this.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest it if you are looking for the matte finish,</li>
            <li>Expected it to be more dull but turned out more glossy than I wanted.</li>
            <li>The matte becomes shiny after a few days wear, but I still love it.</li>
            <li>quickly and only needs two coats for complete coverage.</li>
            <li>I went to the nail salon to get this nail polish put on and after a new hours the nail polish was shiny.</li>
            <li>This is my new obsession.</li>
            <li>this is by far my fav one!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this a few different times now and other than the very long drying time on this polish, it is great!!</li>
            <li>but you can tell that it is more matted than a regular black</li>
            <li>It takes about four coats to be completely opaque and it isn&#x27;t even that matte.</li>
            <li>True matte black polish.</li>
            <li>It takes forever to dry, and it doesn&#x27;t dry smooth.</li>
            <li>Does not get ruined too easily but a little easier than regular nail polish</li>
            <li>The nail polish is pretty much what I expected, however it didn&#x27;t quite achieve the five stars I hoped for because it took quite a few a few coats to get there, and I thought it would be a lot more &#x27;matte&#x27;</li>
            <li>I expected a little more out of this product</li>
            <li>Not recommended for those who want matte nails that dry fast</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping to create a cute easy look, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li>This polish goes on pretty thin on the first coat, and really darkens up on the second.  </li>
            <li>The black is solid and not some thin watered-down color, it is opaque and for that I was happy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try it with regular black polish with dots, french manicure or zebra style, should be fun!</li>
            <li>Its doesn&#x27;t dry quick so watch out when painting because you could mess it up .</li>
            <li>It has the perfect matte finish that she uses as a base coat before applying her other colors and finishes.  </li>
            <li>This nail polish goes on too thick and takes a long time to dry,  would recommend a matte top coat instead.</li>
            <li>Its less of a matte, and more of a dull finish.  </li>
            <li>Unless you have the patience to spend a few hours waiting for it to dry, it won&#x27;t set right.</li>
            <li>The matte makes the little designs in regular gloss polish stand out so much.  </li>

            <li> I bought this because i REALLY like the matte look</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t really care</li>
            <li> but you get what you paid for really.</li>
            <li> I really like the look of this nail polish!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its a real matte nail polish</li>
            <li> but it dries really</li>
            <li> Not so much MATTE finish as it is WAXY.</li>
            <li> reason I&#x27;m rating this 4 instead of 5 stars is because the polish leaked, and it wasn&#x27;t really what I wanted</li>
            <li> I bought it to use with the foil and it works very well.</li>
            <li> The only con is that the polish is not quite as smooth as some others when you layer, so it&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; looking.</li>
            <li> but I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Not to mention how fast it chips, and you can&#x27;t use a chip protectant on it because it won&#x27;t keep the matte look.</li>
            <li> it took way too many coats, and its just not what i expected, but then again, i&#x27;m picky about polish.</li>
            <li> I can create so many designs with the matte black but my favorite the classic french manicure with a clear tip</li>
            <li> very matte and surprisingly durable, but need 2 coats for a totally opaque black.</li>
            <li> Although you do have to apply a few coats to get it to be a true black, it still is really nice for the price!</li>
            <li> But one coat is still matte but like a slightly unnoticeable transparency which actually looks good.</li>
            <li> Matte black is my favorite color</li>
            <li> I love this matte black</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the matte and glossy black look and had to buy this.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest it if you are looking for the matte finish,</li>
            <li> Expected it to be more dull but turned out more glossy than I wanted.</li>
            <li> The matte becomes shiny after a few days wear, but I still love it.</li>
            <li> quickly and only needs two coats for complete coverage.</li>
            <li> I went to the nail salon to get this nail polish put on and after a new hours the nail polish was shiny.</li>
            <li> This is my new obsession.</li>
            <li> this is by far my fav one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few different times now and other than the very long drying time on this polish, it is great!!</li>
            <li> but you can tell that it is more matted than a regular black</li>
            <li> It takes about four coats to be completely opaque and it isn&#x27;t even that matte.</li>
            <li> True matte black polish.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to dry, and it doesn&#x27;t dry smooth.</li>
            <li> Does not get ruined too easily but a little easier than regular nail polish</li>
            <li> The nail polish is pretty much what I expected, however it didn&#x27;t quite achieve the five stars I hoped for because it took quite a few a few coats to get there, and I thought it would be a lot more &#x27;matte&#x27;</li>
            <li> I expected a little more out of this product</li>
            <li> Not recommended for those who want matte nails that dry fast</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to create a cute easy look, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> This polish goes on pretty thin on the first coat, and really darkens up on the second.  </li>
            <li> The black is solid and not some thin watered-down color, it is opaque and for that I was happy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try it with regular black polish with dots, french manicure or zebra style, should be fun!</li>
            <li> Its doesn&#x27;t dry quick so watch out when painting because you could mess it up .</li>
            <li> It has the perfect matte finish that she uses as a base coat before applying her other colors and finishes.  </li>
            <li> This nail polish goes on too thick and takes a long time to dry,  would recommend a matte top coat instead.</li>
            <li> Its less of a matte, and more of a dull finish.  </li>
            <li> Unless you have the patience to spend a few hours waiting for it to dry, it won&#x27;t set right.</li>
            <li> The matte makes the little designs in regular gloss polish stand out so much.  </li>
            <li> You need at least 2 even coats to get the right coverage</li>
            <li> black normal nailpolish don&#x27;t get this</li>
            <li> So I recommend this to people who want a funky new look on black nails.</li>
            <li> Not as shiny as a regular nail polish but not near as matte as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> The product was Not as flat as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I use to just go with the clear, but decided to give this Matte Black a try.</li>
            <li> I have to double the layer on my nail which makes the process even slower to dry up.</li>
            <li> The nail polish is super thin and drips everywhere because of it.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy other colors as long as matte is in style.</li>
            <li> Also takes a very long time to dry, sometimes over an hour.</li>
            <li> The one downside is it takes a very long time to dry.</li>
            <li> Besides that I like how the matte looks on the nail when it&#x27;s completely dry.</li>
            <li> No shine when dry.</li>
            <li> I was looking for black matte nail polish everywhere for a decent deal which was not easy to find.</li>
            <li> the polish is not really flat black</li>
            <li> but it definitely isn&#x27;t regular black nail polish.</li>
            <li> It just looks like black fingernail polish, it doesn&#x27;t have the texture of matte and its only 5% matte and 95%</li>
            <li> But it is definitely matte black</li>
            <li> Flat black.  </li>
            <li> but it really is not that matte.</li>
            <li> I had also received pink;</li>
            <li> It worked for what I wanted but was a little disappointed in how many coats it took to cover properly</li>
            <li> The black was still shiny like a regular black polish</li>
            <li> find that it can chip in a day or two, especially if you type a lot or if you aren&#x27;t careful, but reapplying another coat is not a big problem since a thin layer can dry fully in a minute or two.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a matte nail polish where I live (not sure why).</li>
            <li> by the end of my day it had worn down (possibly rubbed off, I&#x27;m not sure why)</li>
            <li> My wife has tried about 5 other &amp;#34;top brands&amp;#34; version of matte black.  </li>
            <li> I think matte black is my favoret color.  </li>
            <li> Bought to touch-up a matte black bicycle.</li>
            <li> Not one to wear black nail polish myself</li>
            <li> Also the packaging was slightly damaged and there was nail polish that must have leaked from the bottle onto the nail polish bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This black nail polish is truly matte.</li>
            <li> Polish 1 coat black matte</li>
            <li> it has a slight sheen to it</li>
            <li> But after but a trickle few hours, it began to be shiny, not the matte look</li>
            <li> but once it runs out it gets clunky its messy</li>
            <li> In my opinion, you shouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> You can always just apply another coat, so it&#x27;s not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> it will be my staple black polish from now on!</li>
            <li> It just came off as a dull black...</li>
            <li> Not pleased.</li>
            <li> If not applied in thin coats, you will get a bumpy uneven finish.</li>
            <li> Slow drying, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d do thin coats (2-3).</li>
            <li> me just say that my package was shipped to the wrong place but still arrived on time.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I do like it but you can tell that it is more matted than a regular black but it really is not that matte. It also has a bit of a shine.</li>
            <li> I use this to paint over all of the blinking LEDs on the electronics in my bedroom.  It works great, and with the matte finish, doesn&#x27;t detract from the daytime appearance of the devices.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always in a hurry. Sometimes I like to just paint my nails and go without worrying that they&#x27;ll get damage. Wasn&#x27;t too satisfied on this. I have to double the layer on my nail which makes the process even slower to dry up. Besides that I like how the matte looks on the nail when it&#x27;s completely dry.</li>
            <li> of all the matte polishes and top coats(not that this is a top coat) this is by far my fav one! love it i say buy two you will use it up quick i know i did! happy with my purchase! :)</li>
            <li> very matte and surprisingly durable, but need 2 coats for a totally opaque black. But one coat is still matte but like a slightly unnoticeable transparency which actually looks good.</li>
            <li> At first it was great polish, great quality! But after but a trickle few hours, it began to be shiny, not the matte look I was striving for. Also takes a very long time to dry, sometimes over an hour. It&#x27;s alright nail polish, but not the best quality in the world. Not recommended for those who want matte nails that dry fast</li>
            <li> Great product for the price! Gives a great color, and it&#x27;s definitely matte. This has been the sisterhood of the traveling pants for nail polish with my friends ! All of my friends have asked to borrow it. The one downside is it takes a very long time to dry. It may seem dry pretty quickly, but it will ding super easy. For me to feel confident doing anything with my hands after I&#x27;ve applied it, I wait maybe an hour before I trust using my hands. That&#x27;s the only reason I gave it a 4 star, but that could just be because of the matte finish. I haven&#x27;t tried any other matte polish, but for the price, and how it looks, I&#x27;m perfectly happy. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> As a man who likes his feet looking good I think matte black is my favoret color.  My wife thinks they look great (and so do I) tell yo man to lighten up and give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish. Matte black is my favorite color so i bought this. Drying time take a while. Just don&#x27;t use this while in a rush</li>
            <li> I bought this because i REALLY like the matte look but when i tried it on, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a general thing or just the quality of the nail polish, but it looked cheap on my nails. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone trying to use this for any special occasions, but if it&#x27;s just for the heck of it and you don&#x27;t really care then I guess it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> i absolutely loved the polish with the matte touch. i recommend this to all nail polish lovers! it is a must for every collection</li>
            <li> My wife has tried about 5 other &amp;#34;top brands&amp;#34; version of matte black.  This is by far her favorite.  Mine too!  It has the perfect matte finish that she uses as a base coat before applying her other colors and finishes.  The matte makes the little designs in regular gloss polish stand out so much.  Perfect if you want flat matte black nails or if you want your designs to pop!</li>
            <li> The nail polish is pretty much what I expected, however it didn&#x27;t quite achieve the five stars I hoped for because it took quite a few a few coats to get there, and I thought it would be a lot more &#x27;matte&#x27; than it is but you get what you paid for really.</li>
            <li> Got the MATTE color. Expected it to be more dull but turned out more glossy than I wanted. still not a bad color, Will use often!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is great!  It&#x27;s just what it says... Flat black.  Dries quickly and only needs two coats for complete coverage.</li>
            <li> This product arrived at the earliest delivery expectancy! It was cheap, stylish, and cute. So I recommend this to people who want a funky new look on black nails. Love it.</li>
            <li> Hey I like getting a pedi. once in a while, makes my feet feel great. I use to just go with the clear, but decided to give this Matte Black a try. I think it looks great!</li>
            <li> it isnt 100% matte, id say more like 75% but it definitely isn&#x27;t regular black nail polish. its lasted quite a while, it was good priced and shipped fast!</li>
            <li> I went to the nail salon to get this nail polish put on and after a new hours the nail polish was shiny. it did not look matte at all.</li>
            <li> Very nice polish! The matte becomes shiny after a few days wear, but I still love it.</li>
            <li> I really like the look of this nail polish!&lt;br /&gt;I wanted Matte and I got it. Stays on well also</li>
            <li> I play in a rock/metal band, i always put on makeup and nail polish for the show, and this is a great product to use.</li>
            <li> I love the matte finish, but find that it&#x27;s difficult to apply.  I&#x27;d do thin coats (2-3). If not applied in thin coats, you will get a bumpy uneven finish.</li>
            <li> The nail polish is super thin and drips everywhere because of it. It takes about four coats to be completely opaque and it isn&#x27;t even that matte. Not as shiny as a regular nail polish but not near as matte as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> True matte black polish. No shine when dry. Bought to touch-up a matte black bicycle. Works perfectly!</li>
            <li> This is my new obsession. I can create so many designs with the matte black but my favorite the classic french manicure with a clear tip</li>
            <li> I really like this nail polish!! Its a real matte nail polish and it dries real fast! Although you do have to apply a few coats to get it to be a true black, it still is really nice for the price!</li>
            <li> You need at least 2 even coats to get the right coverage but it dries really quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that it can chip in a day or two, especially if you type a lot or if you aren&#x27;t careful, but reapplying another coat is not a big problem since a thin layer can dry fully in a minute or two.</li>
            <li> Not one to wear black nail polish myself but she liked it. A good buy for someone of a young age that would enjoy this color polish.</li>
            <li> L.A. Girl Black Matte Finish Nail Polish is great. And if you want the best shiny black you&#x27;ve ever seen, put a top coat on it.</li>
            <li> This nail polish goes on too thick and takes a long time to dry,  would recommend a matte top coat instead.</li>
            <li> absolutally grand, but after a day or two it goes back to being shiney</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish and use it all the time. It dries quickly and allows me to easily do other designs on top of it without smearing. Love the matte finish!</li>
            <li> I was looking for black matte nail polish everywhere for a decent deal which was not easy to find. I decided to get this one because it was such a good price and had decent reviews. It shipped and arrived very fast. You have to use 2-3 coats to get the best results and although it might not be the best matte polish out there, it gets the job done, looks nice, and was a great price. Overall really good for the price.</li>
            <li> i guess this stuff is okay. Not so much MATTE finish as it is WAXY. i&#x27;d say pass on this one.</li>
            <li> Love the awesome matte finish paired with a shiny black tip.totally thinking this is my new favorite choice of color</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it says and i got lots of compliments on it.I would definitely buy other colors as long as matte is in style.</li>
            <li> I expected a little more out of this product but it&#x27;s still fine.&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say that my package was shipped to the wrong place but still arrived on time. Also the packaging was slightly damaged and there was nail polish that must have leaked from the bottle onto the nail polish bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It looks very pretty and it&#x27;s a nice black color.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m rating this 4 instead of 5 stars is because the polish leaked, and it wasn&#x27;t really what I wanted but I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
            <li> Very fun nail polish color! Went on very smooth and color lasted for a week! Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to create a cute easy look, I was disappointed. The black is solid and not some thin watered-down color, it is opaque and for that I was happy. However, the matte effect wore off quickly.  by the end of my day it had worn down (possibly rubbed off, I&#x27;m not sure why) but it was not matte.</li>
            <li> I used this for touch-up paint on my rims. Worked pretty well. The small brush and color were great and cheaper than touch-up paint.</li>
            <li> Even though it takes to coats to get the matte effect, I liked it at first, then two days later the matte effect disappeared and it was glossy:|</li>
            <li> I love the matte finish for a change up.  I keep my nails short and this stays on for quite some time without chips.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> It streaks when you put it on, so you have to do several passes.  It takes forever to dry, and it doesn&#x27;t dry smooth. Its less of a matte, and more of a dull finish.  I had to put a matte finisher on top of it to get an actual matte look.</li>
            <li> It worked for what I wanted but was a little disappointed in how many coats it took to cover properly</li>
            <li> Does take atleast 2 coats. But it is definatly matte (non-shiny) like the product says. I can&#x27;t wait to try it with regular black polish with dots, french manicure or zebra style, should be fun!</li>
            <li> This is not matte at all. It just looks like black fingernail polish, it doesn&#x27;t have the texture of matte and its only 5% matte and 95% black normal nailpolish don&#x27;t get this</li>
            <li> I love one-step matte finish polish.  This shade of black is really nice, sometimes a black can be &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; I found this one rather nice. I had also received pink; also a great addition to my collection.</li>
            <li> I love this matte black it will be my staple black polish from now on! I am probably going to purchase more colors too!</li>
            <li> I have been playing around with matte colors with shinny designs and the turn out is great. The contrast makes for a wonderful and different look.</li>
            <li> This black nail polish is truly matte. It dries very fast. I bought it to use with the foil and it works very well. However it can be used by itself. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Matte finishes are so hot right now.  This polish goes on pretty thin on the first coat, and really darkens up on the second.  But the finish is more matte with only one coat, so I try to get a good solid covering with the first coat.  Just sayin&#x27;</li>
            <li> The matte look is pretty cool and is nice contrasted against a normal shiny black polish. The only con is that the polish is not quite as smooth as some others when you layer, so it&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; looking.</li>
            <li> Slow drying, but whatever. I fell in love with the matte and glossy black look and had to buy this. I bought it after the OPI one ended up not being matte.</li>
            <li> I was able to achieve the matte black look with 2 coats (the first coat does look pretty streaky).  But it is definitely matte black and I love it! It&#x27;s like a chalkboard on my nails :)</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a matte nail polish where I live (not sure why). So I started looking up online to see if I could find one. I ran into this one. Many matte nail polish reviews for others said that it would get ruined easily, takes long to dry etc etc. This one seemed to have the best reviews and I can see why! I personally think it dries very quickly! I love the color. Does not get ruined too easily but a little easier than regular nail polish but I highly recommend! Great color!! Definitely will buy again!</li>
            <li> I was not overly thrilled with this polish. Unless you have the patience to spend a few hours waiting for it to dry, it won&#x27;t set right. And even if it does set properly, the polish chips easily. It needs a top coat to keep it in good condition, but top coats make it glossy and defeat the purpose of using a matte polish in the first place. Not pleased.</li>
            <li> The product was Not as flat as I thought it would be. The black was still shiny like a regular black polish</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few different times now and other than the very long drying time on this polish, it is great!! Nice matte finish!!</li>
            <li> i loved it but once it runs out it gets clunky its messy but it was a saver for me when i didn&#x27;t wanna paint mi toe nails another color</li>
            <li> After a couple of days the matte finish of this polish kind of wears down and starts to get shiny.  You can always just apply another coat, so it&#x27;s not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> I love this. Will buy again. Thanks</li>
            <li> El producto fue altamente útil.. Excelente vendedor. Entrega rapida, nada roto o dañado, buena comunicación, LO RECOMIENDO..... A++++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compraria nuevamente Gracias</li>
            <li> In my opinion, you shouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this. It takes a few coats to look nice, but then gets globby as you put more on. Not to mention how fast it chips, and you can&#x27;t use a chip protectant on it because it won&#x27;t keep the matte look. I don&#x27;t recommend it and will never purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend she absolutely loved it and the smile on her face along with the other things I bought her made me happy... And this price was great for my pockets..👍</li>
            <li> Great color loved it!! Its doesn&#x27;t dry quick so watch out when painting because you could mess it up .</li>
            <li> it took way too many coats, and its just not what i expected, but then again, i&#x27;m picky about polish.</li>
            <li> I love the matte finish. Good product came in good time and in good condition. I highly suggest it if you are looking for the matte finish,</li>
            <li> awesome price for good nail polish, came in good amount of time as well. this is a newer product so im happy</li>
            <li> So I did not get any matte effect using this. It just came off as a dull black... SAVE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> Polish 1 coat black matte even coverage&lt;br /&gt;Does chip easily but all mattes do for me no matter the brand</li>
            <li> just as described came in time frame stated would buy fromseller again. daughter happy with polish thanks for not dissapointing her</li>
            <li> Great customer service but the polish is not really flat black it has a slight sheen to it but we did accomplish what we need with it</li>
