            <li>OMG My skin has never done so nicely with the derma roller until i paired it with this!</li>
            <li>Received this product through AMZ review trader and it works AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>But my review is based on my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>(but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support).</li>
            <li>I also liked the pump to dispense the product so you don&#x27;t have to put your fingers in the jar and contaminate the product.  </li>
            <li>I received a discount on this product in exchange for writing an honest and unbiased review.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Good by fine lines and leather skin....</li>
            <li>My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li>Pump tops are great because they dispense just the right amount of serum to apply.</li>
            <li>The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the</li>
            <li>It has very light consistency.</li>
            <li>I approve :-)&lt;br</li>
            <li>The seller, Elleda, provided the 50x Strength Hyaluronic Acid free of charge in exchange for my 100% honest opinion and unbiased review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great packaging as well as it allows you to control how much to pump out.</li>
            <li>and now so glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>(I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li>My remarks are sincere and my own.to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>After using it for at a week or so, I should have paid more attention, under my chin is firmer.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do elaborate reviews, but this one deserved it.</li>
            <li>It really does a great job with eradicating fine lines as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It came with a convenient pump top for easy application.</li>
            <li>Its great so far!  </li>
            <li>As with many products, the fact that it has no scent and did not irritate my skin, cause redness or irritation was a huge plus for me.</li>
            <li>so glad i have had the chance to test this product for free because I found a winner here in this stuff.</li>
            <li>Hello smooth and glowing skin:)</li>
            <li>/&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: Not for sensitive or oily skin unless diluted with another product.&lt;br /&gt;~</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m older and wise and know</li>
            <li>I fell like it&#x27;s to strong.</li>
            <li>Fine lines and wrinkles look to be fading</li>
            <li>This product is very strong and will leave your skin feeling tacky at first, but it absorbs within 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels firmer and smooth.</li>
            <li>I received this free through Amazon Review Trader and recommend using it at night.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
            <li>and I just love how my skin looks like right now.</li>
            <li>I used this today for the first time and I was pleased with how smoothly it went on.  </li>
            <li>so I was getting it at a reduced rate and was excited to try a  &#x27;50x Strength Hyaluronic Acid&#x27; product</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin leaving you with a nice soft smooth feeling.</li>
            <li>The irony of this for me is I was super excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it, my face seem so much smoother.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>* Hyaluronic acid is one of the most important and effective anti-aging active ingredients.</li>
            <li>I would not expect great results using this alone, but to boost your other products I think it would be a useful thing for your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I thought it was going to be a nice addition to the glycolic acid and rosehip oil face treatments I&#x27;m currently using to lessen the brown spots/melasma.</li>
            <li>Easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>I am 56 yrs old and on many meds because of a car accident .  </li>
            <li>I have had good results with this Hyaluronic Acid product and there is a noticeable difference in my skin texture, It is a serious moisturizer and is good on mature skin like mine.</li>
            <li>It has excellent hydrating effects that really benefit me being that I have such intensely dry skin at times.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed anything huge other than my skins texture and appearance seems better, but</li>
            <li>First I washed my face with my favorite facial cleanser and then applied it to my damp face.</li>
            <li>: the packaging for this container is pretty &#x27;home kitchen&#x27; looking.  </li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>Sticky and hot.</li>
            <li>letting you know more about how it helps keep my skin smooth, soft, dewy and helps firm up around my jawline and help with those fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always interested in exploring new skincare options, so I was VERY interested in seeing how this one works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li>The first time i used it i put on too much and thought my skin was burning, after i figured out that all you need a drop</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t get too much.</li>
            <li>really like this...a lot.</li>
            <li>The pump bottle is very convenient as well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really care it.</li>
            <li>I really like using Hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>feels immediately hydrating once I apply it, and I really like the soothing sensation of well hydrated skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with short term use, can’t wait to see long term benefit out of this serum.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>It goes on so nice and smooth and you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li>First of all, I wouldn&#x27;t know what to do as far as moisture retention goes, had I not come across this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I needed something to make me feel good while tightening and firming my tired spots.</li>
            <li>I have had no issues with breaking out or rashes as I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am really surprised at the hydration and plump this gives my skin!</li>
            <li>Before I start, I should note that this and Uptown Cosmeceuticals&#x27; 50X strength hyaluronic acid serum are the exact same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is excellent as long as you use just a little, not too much because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>The texture is not heavy and the scent is neutral.</li>
            <li>I like the quality and how soft and hydrated</li>
            <li>I have been using Hyaluronic based products for more than two years now and it has been a complete game changer as far as my skin care routine goes.</li>
            <li>The size of the bottle isn&#x27;t anything I could have been responsible for, but the fact my skin is very dry and sensitive</li>
            <li>Several hours my face and neck still feel dewy soft.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to waste this -- and it&#x27;s worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes in a container with a little pump/dispenser built right in and has a cover</li>
            <li>This product is just not very professional and the texture of the product, while it does have a gel-like that is to be expected of HA, it is also watery at the same time and slides right off the back of your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so just press down on the pump/dispenser gently</li>
            <li>This is one of the products that truly helped with my extremely sensitive, perpetually dry and problematic skin!</li>

            <li> They use a clear back plastic label on the bottle that isn&#x27;t centered evenly on the bottle and the plain white box for the product  also has a clear/black printed sticker for identification.  </li>
            <li> Because one drop of this serum, mixed into/applied with your normal amount of your usual serum or moisturizer, will provide it with a super-charge of hyaluronic acid at a lower cost than using this straight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it everyday since receiving it and also Ive used it once so far when using my dermaroller,</li>
            <li> tanning is bad for your skin, I&#x27;ve been searching for products to help get my skin back to its glowing, fabulous self!</li>
            <li> I thoroughly cleaned my face, patted it dry, and then applied the product as instructed to on the container.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very dry.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels subtle and soft after apply.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I found the straight gel to be very annoying, and too strong for my arms let alone my face.</li>
            <li> but I do see other reviews of this product that mention the smell and</li>
            <li> I am using it with other serums and creams</li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t accidentally press it down.</li>
            <li> ish?&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Slightly oily-feeling</li>
            <li> Odd - very slightly cinnamon-</li>
            <li> probably accounts for the fact that I felt it might be a little harsh for my face.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing.</li>
            <li> THis stuff packs a serious punch.  </li>
            <li> slippery thin gel.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption:</li>
            <li> product smells terrible.  </li>

This is excellent as long as you use just a little, not too much because a little goes a long way. It absorbs well and this is great to use after showering in the am, pm and also if you use a dermaroller. I use it everyday since receiving it and also Ive used it once so far when using my dermaroller, OMG My skin has never done so nicely with the derma roller until i paired it with this! Im so glad i have had the chance to test this product for free because I found a winner here in this stuff.I approve :-)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOMd10a4114525e2df867f536a3ae95ddbe&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;img style&#x3D;&amp;#34;display: none&amp;#34; src&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/images/front/pixel.png&amp;#34; &amp;#62;&amp;lt;/a&gt;</li>
            <li> THis stuff packs a serious punch.  The first time i used it i put on too much and thought my skin was burning, after i figured out that all you need a drop i have not had any issues.  So i guess, follow the directions because i didnt.  Its great so far!  Haven&#x27;t noticed anything huge other than my skins texture and appearance seems better, but im waiting for my face to start tightening up and looking younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i received this product at a reduced cost in exchange for my personal and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just all sorts of awesomeness!!! I use to be a big tanner back in my younger days. Now that I&#x27;m older and wise and know tanning is bad for your skin, I&#x27;ve been searching for products to help get my skin back to its glowing, fabulous self! This stuff totally helps with that. Good by fine lines and leather skin.... Hello smooth and glowing skin:)</li>
            <li> The seller, Elleda, provided the 50x Strength Hyaluronic Acid free of charge in exchange for my 100% honest opinion and unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Elleda product is wonderful It comes in a container with a little pump/dispenser built right in and has a cover so you won&#x27;t accidentally press it down. As with many products, the fact that it has no scent and did not irritate my skin, cause redness or irritation was a huge plus for me. A little goes a long way so just press down on the pump/dispenser gently so you don&#x27;t get too much. You don&#x27;t want to waste this -- and it&#x27;s worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this...a lot. I smoothed it all over my face and neck, under my eyes and on my eyelids and forehead. First I washed my face with my favorite facial cleanser and then applied it to my damp face. Several hours my face and neck still feel dewy soft. I look forward to using the Elleda 50x Strength Hyaluronic Acid and letting you know more about how it helps keep my skin smooth, soft, dewy and helps firm up around my jawline and help with those fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> The irony of this for me is I was super excited to try this product.  I received a coupon so I was getting it at a reduced rate and was excited to try a  &#x27;50x Strength Hyaluronic Acid&#x27; product, it has been awhile since I used anything with  HA and I thought it was going to be a nice addition to the glycolic acid and rosehip oil face treatments I&#x27;m currently using to lessen the brown spots/melasma. My review will not be favorable but it will be truthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells terrible.  I know smells are subjective but I do see other reviews of this product that mention the smell and all I can say is they are understating the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: the packaging for this container is pretty &#x27;home kitchen&#x27; looking.  They use a clear back plastic label on the bottle that isn&#x27;t centered evenly on the bottle and the plain white box for the product  also has a clear/black printed sticker for identification.  This product is just not very professional and the texture of the product, while it does have a gel-like that is to be expected of HA, it is also watery at the same time and slides right off the back of your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the design of the container and I didn&#x27;t feel any adverse skin issues after the 3 times that I did use it so I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars but the smell is enough to keep me from using it again so if it does perform well, I&#x27;ll never know.</li>
            <li> This is a great hyaluronic acid for your skin. I needed something to make me feel good while tightening and firming my tired spots. It goes on so nice and smooth and you only need a small amount. It absorbs quickly into the skin leaving you with a nice soft smooth feeling. Fine lines and wrinkles look to be fading and my skin feels firmer and smooth. This is a great product. I have had no issues with breaking out or rashes as I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> i could see a differents after applying 1 time, makes my skin looks 10 yrs younger!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It has very light consistency. A little goes a long way. Easily absorbed into the skin. Does not feel greasy at all. Skin feels subtle and soft after apply. Great to use under makeup, did not cause any irritation for me. Great packaging as well as it allows you to control how much to pump out. I am very satisfied with short term use, can’t wait to see long term benefit out of this serum. Will definitely recommend and repurchase in the future.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product at a reduced cost for reviewing purpose. But my review is based on my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Received this product through AMZ review trader and it works AMAZING.  Have never tried it before and now so glad that I did.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is very strong and will leave your skin feeling tacky at first, but it absorbs within 10 minutes. I received this free through Amazon Review Trader and recommend using it at night. The texture is not heavy and the scent is neutral. I have had good results with this Hyaluronic Acid product and there is a noticeable difference in my skin texture, It is a serious moisturizer and is good on mature skin like mine. The pump bottle is very convenient as well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really care it. I fell like it&#x27;s to strong.</li>
            <li> Great Hyaluronic Acid Serum! I really like using Hyaluronic acid. It has excellent hydrating effects that really benefit me being that I have such intensely dry skin at times. I&#x27;m always interested in exploring new skincare options, so I was VERY interested in seeing how this one works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with a convenient pump top for easy application. Pump tops are great because they dispense just the right amount of serum to apply. It&#x27;s very easy to use. I just apply it to my entire face and neck, morning and night, after cleansing and toning but before moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels immediately hydrating once I apply it, and I really like the soothing sensation of well hydrated skin. It hasn&#x27;t caused me any irritation as a result of use either, which is awesome. I like the quality and how soft and hydrated it leaves my skin feeling. I would definitely buy again. (I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product and am so happy I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Love it, my face seem so much smoother.</li>
            <li> I have been using Hyaluronic based products for more than two years now and it has been a complete game changer as far as my skin care routine goes. First of all, I wouldn&#x27;t know what to do as far as moisture retention goes, had I not come across this product. This is one of the products that truly helped with my extremely sensitive, perpetually dry and problematic skin! I am using it with other serums and creams and I just love how my skin looks like right now. It really does a great job with eradicating fine lines as well. Two thumbs up for this product and brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> How do you compare the hundreds of skin care products? As a regular tester, I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these help you! Before I start, I should note that this and Uptown Cosmeceuticals&#x27; 50X strength hyaluronic acid serum are the exact same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance: Odd - very slightly cinnamon-ish?&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Slightly oily-feeling slippery thin gel.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: Sticky and hot. I found the straight gel to be very annoying, and too strong for my arms let alone my face. BUT this is a good thing! Because one drop of this serum, mixed into/applied with your normal amount of your usual serum or moisturizer, will provide it with a super-charge of hyaluronic acid at a lower cost than using this straight.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: Not for sensitive or oily skin unless diluted with another product.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No.&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: .5oz plastic pump bottle.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* Shiny, hydrated-looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* Hyaluronic acid is one of the most important and effective anti-aging active ingredients. I would not expect great results using this alone, but to boost your other products I think it would be a useful thing for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li> wonderful product also using it with the vitamin C</li>
            <li> I used this today for the first time and I was pleased with how smoothly it went on.  I also liked the pump to dispense the product so you don&#x27;t have to put your fingers in the jar and contaminate the product.  I thoroughly cleaned my face, patted it dry, and then applied the product as instructed to on the container.  I received a discount on this product in exchange for writing an honest and unbiased review.  For that reason I feel like I should tell you the cons I found with the product.  The size of the bottle is much smaller than I have anticipated, and I did feel some tingling/slight burning when I applied the product.  The size of the bottle isn&#x27;t anything I could have been responsible for, but the fact my skin is very dry and sensitive probably accounts for the fact that I felt it might be a little harsh for my face.  I do like this product, though.  I plan on continuing to use it, but only once daily instead of twice.</li>
            <li> I am 56 yrs old and on many meds because of a car accident .  My skin is very dry.  I have used many products, expensive to inexpensive, I found that after cleansing my face and neck , then applying Elleda&#x27;s serum followed by day or night time regime makes all the difference. Especially at night, when I wake up my my face and especially under my chin, my skin is still hydrated.  After using it for at a week or so, I should have paid more attention, under my chin is firmer.  I love this product.  I don&#x27;t do elaborate reviews, but this one deserved it. Thanks.</li>
