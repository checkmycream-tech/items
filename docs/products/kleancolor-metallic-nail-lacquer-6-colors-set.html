            <li>They were really nice about it and said they would replace the damaged bottle.</li>
            <li>but I liked what people were saying about it</li>
            <li>Love love love!!  </li>
            <li>The metallic colors are so vivid as well, great for stamping as well!!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to trying more sets.  </li>
            <li>:)  Cheers.</li>
            <li>Love these colors, and the metallic quality is much better than most \\&quot;metallic\\&quot; polishes I&#x27;ve encountered.  </li>
            <li>From this item it cost more than 6 dollar.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and great product.  </li>
            <li>it is more gold/limeade type color, a lot lighter.</li>
            <li>I love the blues and the purple, but it&#x27;s been weeks</li>
            <li>still, if you&#x27;re going to wear it within 1-2 days, lovely.</li>
            <li>Love the color, but the smell had everyone complaining.  </li>
            <li>The colors are ok.</li>
            <li>better than the pics.</li>
            <li>they will bleed a bit when you but top coat on.</li>
            <li>Figuring for the price and ordering it online, where I could not test it, it would probably be ok, but</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve learned that adding a top coat causes the metallic property of the polish do disappear.</li>
            <li>Much better than what&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li>I could have accepted a 25% off voucher for my next order - which was awesome as well.&lt;br /&gt;Summary...</li>
            <li>That damaged them even more.</li>
            <li>I find the consistency perfect, it applies with ease and only need one coat.</li>
            <li>They do flake but nothing a top coat won&#x27;t take care of</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of this nail polish for the low price I paid for it.</li>
            <li>Bought some for myself, my daughter and granddaughter and we love it.</li>
            <li>Love kleancolor nail products.</li>
            <li>They look great in the bottle (gorgeous, actually) but putting them on your nails is another story.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Hopefully I will have better luck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I had many compliments</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure when I ordered them</li>
            <li>This set of polish has very rich metallic color.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that I get so many bright polishes for such a good price.</li>
            <li>gorgeous colors, very pigmented!</li>
            <li>I thought that was super nice of them.</li>
            <li>These are such awesome colors and they are great quality especially for the price!</li>
            <li>Such a good deal for so many colors!</li>
            <li>I just received them so I haven&#x27;t tried every color just yet, but I just used the teal blue on my nails and it looks GORGEOUS!</li>
            <li>I also noticed that they peal and chip easily with or without base/top coats.</li>
            <li>These are easy one-coaters, but OCD forces me to do 2.  </li>
            <li>Although it does chip fairly easily, butt what are you going to do.</li>
            <li>No chipping and easy to paint on.</li>
            <li>they came very quickly</li>
            <li>These colors are amazing, very rich, and very metallic/foil-like.</li>
            <li>The colors are great and it goes on smooth and most often you only need one coat.</li>
            <li>I adore these shades - all of them are absolutely stunning and contain a full .5 ounces of product.</li>
            <li>Cheap and flakes off easily</li>
            <li>I contacted them and got a quick response from them!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super satisfied.</li>
            <li>this set was exactly what I needed- a cheap set with many cute colors.</li>
            <li>One of the colors is more golden than I like</li>
            <li>smooth</li>
            <li>fantastic price for the quantity and the quality.</li>
            <li>nothing fantastic...</li>
            <li>Colors are bright and pigmented; nearly all are one-coaters.</li>
            <li>These are gorgeous and classy.</li>
            <li>Looks nice on but chips pretty quick.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t familiar with the brand, but decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>but i am not disappointed and can&#x27;t wait to use all of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried everything to clean them, but they are stained.</li>
            <li>I was super excited.</li>
            <li>The contain a micro-glitter of either silver or silver and another color, they will sparkle instead of shine like a true metallic.</li>
            <li>but if you want true metallics these aren&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>but otherwise some of the best polish ive bought lately</li>
            <li>Love the colors and they chip too fast.</li>
            <li>Thes work really well for stamping not to mention the colors are very pretty most are one coaters  </li>
            <li>I cannot BELIEVE how quickly my order arrived - it seemed as thought I clicked order, blinked, and it was here.</li>
            <li>They may have a long drying time, but with a good quick drying topcoat it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li>the colors are very pretty, with quite a bit of shine to them.</li>
            <li>Very pretty colors</li>
            <li>The colors are very pretty, but it will stain your fingernails.</li>
            <li>and I have a nice top polish that doesn&#x27;t chip with other nail polishes.</li>
            <li>just took the green off my nails and although it was beautiful</li>
            <li>One coat works beautifully and the polish dried super fast!  </li>
            <li>You can speed up drying time by using a fast-dry clear top coat like NYC&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This polish is kind of a double edged sword.</li>
            <li>The colors were a bit off and the Seller was right there to correct the problem.</li>
            <li>I was able to find a cheaper nail polish brand for $1.00 each at my local beauty supply store and even though they don&#x27;t have any metallic colors, the polish drys quickly, doesn&#x27;t stain, and is chip resistant.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the coverage from only one coat, how quickly it dried and how great the colors are.  </li>
            <li>For most of them one coat of polish is enough.</li>
            <li>The metallic colors are HOT.</li>
            <li>They do stamp really well though!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>These chip within the first day of using them--</li>
            <li>Thank you so much, I would so order from you once again!  </li>
            <li>Exactly who you want to deal with when you&#x27;re ordering online!&lt;br /&gt;THANK</li>
            <li>This is nothing negative against the seller, they were great.</li>
            <li>I put it on over a top coat and kept it on for 2 days only.</li>
            <li>I tried all the home remedies to whiten nails and then buffed off the top layer of my nails just to get some of the yellow off.</li>
            <li>It is thick, only needs one coat to achieve great color, and is true to its color!</li>
            <li>The colors I have tried have worked well for stamping since they are very reflective and pretty opaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice but the dark colors stain.</li>
            <li>colors are very vibrant.</li>
            <li>Although they chip easily, but that can be fixed with extra coats and a last clear coat for a nice finish.</li>
            <li>the colors show up very well.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I really wanted metallic polishes and the price just couldn&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>However, the colors aren&#x27;t really metallic.</li>
            <li>the odor dissipates very quickly once dry, unlike a lot of nail polish that still smells really strong hours later or even all</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this nail polish!!!</li>
            <li>Not exactly konad special polish result, but still very sharp and bright images.</li>
            <li>Polish goes on easy and stays on long time.  </li>
            <li>the picture on the product page shows a bright bubble gum pink, orange, red, lime green, bright blue, and purple, and that&#x27;s what I was expecting-</li>
            <li>These are very metallic, and look different with a top coat, so you can get two different looks out of one color.</li>
            <li>which is going to quickly make them go to shades in my extensive nail polish collection.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t resist this shiny, glittery, vibrant multi-pack.  </li>
            <li>think again for buying this product if you&#x27;re older.</li>
            <li>the colors are vibrant and just what i wanted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen colors like these - most polish that is really metallic is also a pale shade.</li>
            <li>I would compare the quality to high end polishes - they are so highly pigmented</li>
            <li>Formulas are very nice, minus the green.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Such vibrant pretty colors!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to put on, dry fast, sometimes I don&#x27;t need a second layer.  </li>
            <li>I have a feeling these will all stain significantly, but with polishes ad pigmented and opaque as these, it&#x27;s too be expected.</li>
            <li>They go on with three brush strokes and dry quickly.</li>
            <li>What kind of picture, me attempting to polish my nails with thick old nail polish??</li>
            <li>Steer clear of this product!</li>
            <li>only thing I use these for now is with my stamper and nail plates, they work pretty well with the plates.</li>
            <li>This one chips alot easier than the others but as long as you do 2 coats its worth the buy.</li>
            <li>If you like a variety of light and dark polish, this is not for you.</li>
            <li>Love the dark blue but it stains a bit for a couple days after.</li>
            <li>In a New York Minute (which is cheap and dries VERY fast, makes everything underneath it dry fast and isn&#x27;t thick)</li>
            <li>Without topcoat, they look like frosty metal, and with, the color deepens and looks more like hard candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I received the package one of the bottles was chipped and the bottom almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it stamps, but I don&#x27;t recommend it for going directly on your nails.</li>
            <li>I tried a couple coats of the green on my pinky nail and left it there for a couple of days, letting it naturally flake off without applying a top coat...</li>
            <li>It was so old</li>
            <li>That to me says they are old.</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Two coats, and in some cases just one coat, give complete coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product, however, completely destroyed my nails.</li>
            <li>I forgot the names of the companies, but just as thick as the nail polish they sell for better, thicker decals.  </li>
            <li>The polish is very thick and pigmented, not the kind you have to do multiple coats.</li>
            <li>mostly my fault for not at least putting on two coats to make it last longer.</li>
            <li>On one hand, the colors are so insanely vibrant and you really only need one coat, but two for a deeper color, and they stay on for a very long time(as most metallics usually do) , at least a week, without chipping.</li>
            <li>Looking closely at the thumbnail photo (in the search results page) for this listing, the colors in it are bluish &amp;#34;grimace&amp;#34; purple, a dark fuchsia &amp;#34;grape purple&amp;#34;, darker blue, teal, gold, and bright green, and that&#x27;s the set I got which is unfortunate because I bought it for the bright pink and red.  </li>
            <li>The colors are pretty but its not worth the hassle it takes to get this nail polish off.</li>
            <li>I could barely get it out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Others mentioned a bad smell, but I found it more mild than regular nail polishes, even maybe a hint of grape.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice they smelled any worse than any other polish I own.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll dry a little quicker as well as go on a little more</li>
            <li>It applies well, dries in good time, and seems to be rather resilient to the gross clumpy-ness that comes from a badly done manicure.</li>

            <li> The colors are nice however a day after painting my nails it began to chip.</li>
            <li> They were really nice about it and said they would replace the damaged bottle.</li>
            <li> but I liked what people were saying about it</li>
            <li> Love love love!!  </li>
            <li> The metallic colors are so vivid as well, great for stamping as well!!</li>

            <li> :)  Cheers.</li>
            <li> Love these colors, and the metallic quality is much better than most \\&quot;metallic\\&quot; polishes I&#x27;ve encountered.  </li>
            <li> From this item it cost more than 6 dollar.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great product.  </li>
            <li> it is more gold/limeade type color, a lot lighter.</li>
            <li> I love the blues and the purple, but it&#x27;s been weeks</li>
            <li> still, if you&#x27;re going to wear it within 1-2 days, lovely.</li>
            <li> Love the color, but the smell had everyone complaining.  </li>
            <li> The colors are ok.</li>
            <li> better than the pics.</li>
            <li> they will bleed a bit when you but top coat on.</li>
            <li> Figuring for the price and ordering it online, where I could not test it, it would probably be ok, but</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve learned that adding a top coat causes the metallic property of the polish do disappear.</li>
            <li> Much better than what&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li> I could have accepted a 25% off voucher for my next order - which was awesome as well.&lt;br /&gt;Summary...</li>
            <li> That damaged them even more.</li>
            <li> I find the consistency perfect, it applies with ease and only need one coat.</li>
            <li> They do flake but nothing a top coat won&#x27;t take care of</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of this nail polish for the low price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Bought some for myself, my daughter and granddaughter and we love it.</li>
            <li> Love kleancolor nail products.</li>
            <li> They look great in the bottle (gorgeous, actually) but putting them on your nails is another story.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hopefully I will have better luck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I had many compliments</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure when I ordered them</li>
            <li> This set of polish has very rich metallic color.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that I get so many bright polishes for such a good price.</li>
            <li> gorgeous colors, very pigmented!</li>
            <li> I thought that was super nice of them.</li>
            <li> These are such awesome colors and they are great quality especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Such a good deal for so many colors!</li>
            <li> I just received them so I haven&#x27;t tried every color just yet, but I just used the teal blue on my nails and it looks GORGEOUS!</li>
            <li> I also noticed that they peal and chip easily with or without base/top coats.</li>
            <li> These are easy one-coaters, but OCD forces me to do 2.  </li>
            <li> Although it does chip fairly easily, butt what are you going to do.</li>
            <li> No chipping and easy to paint on.</li>
            <li> they came very quickly</li>
            <li> These colors are amazing, very rich, and very metallic/foil-like.</li>
            <li> The colors are great and it goes on smooth and most often you only need one coat.</li>
            <li> I adore these shades - all of them are absolutely stunning and contain a full .5 ounces of product.</li>
            <li> Cheap and flakes off easily</li>
            <li> I contacted them and got a quick response from them!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m super satisfied.</li>
            <li> this set was exactly what I needed- a cheap set with many cute colors.</li>
            <li> One of the colors is more golden than I like</li>
            <li> smooth</li>
            <li> fantastic price for the quantity and the quality.</li>
            <li> nothing fantastic...</li>
            <li> Colors are bright and pigmented; nearly all are one-coaters.</li>
            <li> These are gorgeous and classy.</li>
            <li> Looks nice on but chips pretty quick.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t familiar with the brand, but decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> but i am not disappointed and can&#x27;t wait to use all of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to clean them, but they are stained.</li>
            <li> I was super excited.</li>
            <li> The contain a micro-glitter of either silver or silver and another color, they will sparkle instead of shine like a true metallic.</li>
            <li> but if you want true metallics these aren&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> but otherwise some of the best polish ive bought lately</li>
            <li> Love the colors and they chip too fast.</li>
            <li> Thes work really well for stamping not to mention the colors are very pretty most are one coaters  </li>
            <li> I cannot BELIEVE how quickly my order arrived - it seemed as thought I clicked order, blinked, and it was here.</li>
            <li> They may have a long drying time, but with a good quick drying topcoat it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li> the colors are very pretty, with quite a bit of shine to them.</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty, but it will stain your fingernails.</li>
            <li> and I have a nice top polish that doesn&#x27;t chip with other nail polishes.</li>
            <li> just took the green off my nails and although it was beautiful</li>
            <li> One coat works beautifully and the polish dried super fast!  </li>
            <li> You can speed up drying time by using a fast-dry clear top coat like NYC&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This polish is kind of a double edged sword.</li>
            <li> The colors were a bit off and the Seller was right there to correct the problem.</li>
            <li> I was able to find a cheaper nail polish brand for $1.00 each at my local beauty supply store and even though they don&#x27;t have any metallic colors, the polish drys quickly, doesn&#x27;t stain, and is chip resistant.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the coverage from only one coat, how quickly it dried and how great the colors are.  </li>
            <li> For most of them one coat of polish is enough.</li>
            <li> The metallic colors are HOT.</li>
            <li> They do stamp really well though!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> These chip within the first day of using them--</li>
            <li> Thank you so much, I would so order from you once again!  </li>
            <li> Exactly who you want to deal with when you&#x27;re ordering online!&lt;br /&gt;THANK</li>
            <li> This is nothing negative against the seller, they were great.</li>
            <li> I put it on over a top coat and kept it on for 2 days only.</li>
            <li> I tried all the home remedies to whiten nails and then buffed off the top layer of my nails just to get some of the yellow off.</li>
            <li> It is thick, only needs one coat to achieve great color, and is true to its color!</li>
            <li> The colors I have tried have worked well for stamping since they are very reflective and pretty opaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice but the dark colors stain.</li>
            <li> colors are very vibrant.</li>
            <li> Although they chip easily, but that can be fixed with extra coats and a last clear coat for a nice finish.</li>
            <li> the colors show up very well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I really wanted metallic polishes and the price just couldn&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> However, the colors aren&#x27;t really metallic.</li>
            <li> the odor dissipates very quickly once dry, unlike a lot of nail polish that still smells really strong hours later or even all</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this nail polish!!!</li>
            <li> Not exactly konad special polish result, but still very sharp and bright images.</li>
            <li> Polish goes on easy and stays on long time.  </li>
            <li> the picture on the product page shows a bright bubble gum pink, orange, red, lime green, bright blue, and purple, and that&#x27;s what I was expecting-</li>
            <li> These are very metallic, and look different with a top coat, so you can get two different looks out of one color.</li>
            <li> which is going to quickly make them go to shades in my extensive nail polish collection.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t resist this shiny, glittery, vibrant multi-pack.  </li>
            <li> think again for buying this product if you&#x27;re older.</li>
            <li> the colors are vibrant and just what i wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen colors like these - most polish that is really metallic is also a pale shade.</li>
            <li> I would compare the quality to high end polishes - they are so highly pigmented</li>
            <li> Formulas are very nice, minus the green.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Such vibrant pretty colors!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to put on, dry fast, sometimes I don&#x27;t need a second layer.  </li>
            <li> I have a feeling these will all stain significantly, but with polishes ad pigmented and opaque as these, it&#x27;s too be expected.</li>
            <li> They go on with three brush strokes and dry quickly.</li>
            <li> What kind of picture, me attempting to polish my nails with thick old nail polish??</li>
            <li> Steer clear of this product!</li>
            <li> only thing I use these for now is with my stamper and nail plates, they work pretty well with the plates.</li>
            <li> This one chips alot easier than the others but as long as you do 2 coats its worth the buy.</li>
            <li> If you like a variety of light and dark polish, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Love the dark blue but it stains a bit for a couple days after.</li>
            <li> In a New York Minute (which is cheap and dries VERY fast, makes everything underneath it dry fast and isn&#x27;t thick)</li>
            <li> Without topcoat, they look like frosty metal, and with, the color deepens and looks more like hard candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I received the package one of the bottles was chipped and the bottom almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it stamps, but I don&#x27;t recommend it for going directly on your nails.</li>
            <li> I tried a couple coats of the green on my pinky nail and left it there for a couple of days, letting it naturally flake off without applying a top coat...</li>
            <li> It was so old</li>
            <li> That to me says they are old.</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Two coats, and in some cases just one coat, give complete coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product, however, completely destroyed my nails.</li>
            <li> I forgot the names of the companies, but just as thick as the nail polish they sell for better, thicker decals.  </li>
            <li> The polish is very thick and pigmented, not the kind you have to do multiple coats.</li>
            <li> mostly my fault for not at least putting on two coats to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> On one hand, the colors are so insanely vibrant and you really only need one coat, but two for a deeper color, and they stay on for a very long time(as most metallics usually do) , at least a week, without chipping.</li>
            <li> Looking closely at the thumbnail photo (in the search results page) for this listing, the colors in it are bluish &amp;#34;grimace&amp;#34; purple, a dark fuchsia &amp;#34;grape purple&amp;#34;, darker blue, teal, gold, and bright green, and that&#x27;s the set I got which is unfortunate because I bought it for the bright pink and red.  </li>
            <li> The colors are pretty but its not worth the hassle it takes to get this nail polish off.</li>
            <li> I could barely get it out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Others mentioned a bad smell, but I found it more mild than regular nail polishes, even maybe a hint of grape.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice they smelled any worse than any other polish I own.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll dry a little quicker as well as go on a little more</li>
            <li> It applies well, dries in good time, and seems to be rather resilient to the gross clumpy-ness that comes from a badly done manicure.</li>
            <li> All of the other colors are fine, but the green does stain neon yellow like other reviewers have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> I will absolutely order these again and have actually ordered other colors from this brand!!!</li>
            <li> I make sure I have at least three coats of polish underneath and that usually does the trick.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy nail polish online because I have to try it out, I&#x27;m really picky when it comes to it</li>
            <li> It did cover perfectly well with one coat, but like other brands that don&#x27;t stick without some sort of &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; coat, two days later it was horribly chipped and un-presentable...</li>
            <li> It stains your nails and is hard to removed even with pure acetone.</li>
            <li> The green stains your nails bright yellow and is impossible to get off unless you file the tops of your nails.</li>
            <li> Smell is weird; almost like cheap crayons?  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have not gotten near the green color again after it destroyed my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But does get somewhat chunky if you don&#x27;t leave enought time to dry between applications.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers say, the colors are very vibrant and get compliments since it&#x27;s hard to miss.  </li>
            <li> all the colors appear to look the same as in the picture and after 2 coats b the same as the color in the bottle, except the green...</li>
            <li> This polish stained my nails a dark yellow that is permanent, and now I have to wait months for it to grow out.</li>
            <li> I received these 3 days ago, and immediately put on the dark blue.  </li>
            <li> The first time I mentioned that one of the nail polish bottles had come broken-</li>
            <li> And they sent me an extra little gift too (polish remover pads).</li>
            <li> Mine is a little gritty and clumpy; it looked like it had been opened before, because there was polish on the neck.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is that a couple of the colors stain the stamper, but in the scheme of things that is really no big deal.</li>
            <li> these were listed as a gift set - I expected them to come in a box not just wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> Did not really like it.</li>
            <li> I received the order way before i was expected.</li>
            <li> I will try experimenting with different base and top coats.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a lot of other reviews, so I&#x27;ll only add a few things</li>
            <li> b) the polish was so hard to get off once I finally wanted it off that I had to use the glitter trick, - put polish remover soaked cotton pads on nails and put tin foil on them for a few minutes -  and STILL there was polish left</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any other polish chip off my toenails like that before.</li>
            <li> The only thing I like about this is the color and people usually complement my nails when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I got three shades of pink!</li>
            <li> I was actually skeptical at first</li>
            <li> Product arrived a day before it was due.</li>
            <li> I just took the pink off my nails, and holy stain!</li>
            <li> The color lasts a few days but not really as vibrant as expected.</li>
            <li> The green and the blue do stain a little</li>
            <li> Other polish last at least 2 weeks to a month.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t stamped with them yet, but the consistency looks just thick enough to work well.  </li>
            <li> Be sure you have a base coat, as these tend to stain quite a bit.</li>
            <li> So I will keep experimenting with base and top coats to find a combination that works.</li>
            <li> they stained my nails SO BAD, especially the green color, that I had to let my nails grow out completely before the stain finally went away,</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the other colors because of the results from the green one.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they seem to chip a little easier than others polishes</li>
            <li> The polish began to chip off in less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I had previously written a review for this seller...</li>
            <li> not quick drying though</li>
            <li> I have a very shaky hand, but my nails look nearly flawless~!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> but sadly it doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> They all chip within a few days if using it, even on the toenails.</li>
            <li> I decided to use the green.  </li>
            <li> One flaw: green coloured my nails...</li>
            <li> I did not get the green in my package nor the purple.  </li>
            <li> Specifically the metallic green...</li>
            <li> colour are very beautifull, but they stain very bad, and when u add light nail art, it civers everything sad....</li>
            <li> It was on for less than 48 hours, and its pretty badly stained.</li>
            <li> These are nice metallics, but beware, the green and blue stained my nails really badly, even with a base coat.</li>
            <li> They are a little thick, and you can benefit by adding a few drops of nail polish thinner (not remover or acetone - find nail polish thinner here on Amazon or at a beauty supply place).</li>
            <li> And such an unbelievable price!!!  </li>
            <li> The color just becomes REALLY SHINY, which isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> The polish also dries faster than others I have tried and my manicure lasted longer than usual.</li>
            <li> and I usually buy sinful colors.</li>
            <li> My manicure lasted longer than usual, as chipping was a minimum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 16, but I have a very womanly appearance, and I look a bit silly in some of the colors.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding a set of polishes that wasn&#x27;t minis.  </li>
            <li> Too hard to get off and stains nails.</li>
            <li> I wish I had listened to the negative reviews on the nail polish.</li>
            <li> haphazardly slapped some of the fuchsia on without using a base or top coat and went on about my day.  </li>
            <li> I had to use a ridiculous amount of nail polish remover to take it off and it smeared all over my cuticles and under my nails</li>
            <li> Stained nails, chips quickly and is just awful to remove.  </li>
            <li> Even with a clear base coat it still stains.</li>
            <li> The colors are poor and the polish was thick and goopy with each bottle.</li>
            <li> and it was very thick.</li>
            <li> This item is such poor quality!!!</li>
            <li> I added thinner and didnt help, it just made the color worse.</li>
            <li> I know there are a lot of complaints about the odor with Kleancolor, but I&#x27;ve smelled worse, and what I like is</li>
            <li> , also I noticed it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as my other polish</li>
            <li> However, what I bought is a bit expensive because each of them cost around $1.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately one of the polishes had leaked during shipment.  </li>
            <li> The problem is that they chipped off within 1 day of application, but were really difficult to take off with polish remover.</li>
            <li> The dark metallic colors stained my nails really bad, eventhough I put on a base coat!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will definately be buying from them again AND recommeding them to my friends!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen a polish stain so badly.  </li>
            <li> :()</li>
            <li> I put a base coat on before I used the polish.</li>
            <li> Even with a base coat the color has a tendency to stay where you don&#x27;t want it.</li>
            <li> this is with a base coat.</li>
            <li> I hate this...</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was soooo wrong!!!</li>
            <li> I just removed it and my nails are horribly stained.  </li>
            <li> This was the worst.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this purchase and will not be ordering again!!!</li>
            <li> Very bad quality!</li>
            <li> The problem is it chipped terrible within hours of application.</li>

            <li> this set was exactly what I needed- a cheap set with many cute colors. I got this for a friend for Christmas, and she loved it! the colors are very pretty, with quite a bit of shine to them. this set is great for gifts.</li>
            <li> When I received the package one of the bottles was chipped and the bottom almost completely gone. The green stains your nails bright yellow and is impossible to get off unless you file the tops of your nails. Even with a clear base coat it still stains. They all chip within a few days if using it, even on the toenails. I&#x27;ve never had any other polish chip off my toenails like that before. Other polish last at least 2 weeks to a month. The only thing I like about this is the color and people usually complement my nails when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I bought these (in a store) as they were recommended for stamping.  I decided to use the green.  I just removed it and my nails are horribly stained.  I&#x27;ve never seen a polish stain so badly.  I don&#x27;t know how it stamps, but I don&#x27;t recommend it for going directly on your nails.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter, she loves the colors and has nothing but praise for this line of products.  Very good buy.</li>
            <li> Great Quality, great colors, great deal!!!  A++++++.  Polish goes on easy and stays on long time.  Very good deal for colors and price!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these!!</li>
            <li> This set of polish has very rich metallic color. For most of them one coat of polish is enough. The Gold will require more coats but its still a great polish.</li>
            <li> I put a base coat on before I used the polish. I used the blue one 1st, this polish dyed my skin the color of the polish and it was very thick.I had to use a ridiculous amount of nail polish remover to take it off and it smeared all over my cuticles and under my nails, I looked like a smurf. I threw them all out</li>
            <li> I purchased this set because I was told the colors were good for stamping.  The colors are gorgeous!  I haven&#x27;t stamped with them yet, but the consistency looks just thick enough to work well.  I had a hard time finding a set of polishes that wasn&#x27;t minis.  This set is full sized and for the price a great value!  I&#x27;m looking forward to trying more sets.  EDIT:  I did a stamping manicure with this set and I&#x27;m thrilled with the way it looks.  Stamps great and the colors show up very well.  If I ever figure out how to post a picture I will.</li>
            <li> Nice but the dark colors stain. Otherwise the colors are really beautiful. If you are a nail stamper, they stamp well.</li>
            <li> these were listed as a gift set - I expected them to come in a box not just wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> I wish I had listened to the negative reviews on the nail polish. It stains your nails and is hard to removed even with pure acetone. The colors are pretty but its not worth the hassle it takes to get this nail polish off. I will never buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> Such a good deal for so many colors! I just received them so I haven&#x27;t tried every color just yet, but I just used the teal blue on my nails and it looks GORGEOUS! The polish is very thick and pigmented, not the kind you have to do multiple coats. Love them!</li>
            <li> I LOVVVVEEEEE these colors and shine! One of the colors is more golden than I like and I was expecting a red/orange color but the blues are awesome!!!!!! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers say, the colors are very vibrant and get compliments since it&#x27;s hard to miss.  I knocked two stars off because the pictures are of different sets... the picture on the product page shows a bright bubble gum pink, orange, red, lime green, bright blue, and purple, and that&#x27;s what I was expecting- some of the reviews even posted pictures of these same colors on their nails.  Looking closely at the thumbnail photo (in the search results page) for this listing, the colors in it are bluish &amp;#34;grimace&amp;#34; purple, a dark fuchsia &amp;#34;grape purple&amp;#34;, darker blue, teal, gold, and bright green, and that&#x27;s the set I got which is unfortunate because I bought it for the bright pink and red.  So there&#x27;s a problem with the listing not properly representing the colors in the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  I tried a couple coats of the green on my pinky nail and left it there for a couple of days, letting it naturally flake off without applying a top coat... I can verify the others&#x27; claims about it tinting the nail underneath yellow.  It looks like I&#x27;ve been playing with yellow food coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haphazardly slapped some of the fuchsia on without using a base or top coat and went on about my day.  It did cover perfectly well with one coat, but like other brands that don&#x27;t stick without some sort of &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; coat, two days later it was horribly chipped and un-presentable... mostly my fault for not at least putting on two coats to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail polish that I have ever used! It is thick, only needs one coat to achieve great color, and is true to its color!</li>
            <li> This is the nail color set to get. The metallic colors are HOT. I bought two sets of this one. Recommend getting this one.</li>
            <li> These are nice metallics, but beware, the green and blue stained my nails really badly, even with a base coat. They do stamp really well though!</li>
            <li> YES, they are just great!  1. Colors are amazing. Eye-catching, juicy, yum!  2. They&#x27;re easy to put on, dry fast, sometimes I don&#x27;t need a second layer.  3. One flaw: green coloured my nails... but still I CAN&#x27;T STOP USING THEM :)  Cheers.</li>
            <li> colour are very beautifull, but they stain very bad, and when u add light nail art, it civers everything sad....</li>
            <li> Love these colors, and the metallic quality is much better than most \\&quot;metallic\\&quot; polishes I&#x27;ve encountered.  I have about a dozen Kleancolor nail polishes and I&#x27;ve been really impressed with how well it goes on and how well it holds up over time.</li>
            <li> I cannot BELIEVE how quickly my order arrived - it seemed as thought I clicked order, blinked, and it was here. I adore these shades - all of them are absolutely stunning and contain a full .5 ounces of product. I would compare the quality to high end polishes - they are so highly pigmented which is going to quickly make them go to shades in my extensive nail polish collection.</li>
            <li> All shades are gorgeous!  For this price, unbeatable deal!! The metallic colors are so vivid as well, great for stamping as well!! Will definately buy from again!</li>
            <li> Perfect combination of colors!</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and bright. I didn&#x27;t need to apply a second coat to get the color I wanted. The polish also dries faster than others I have tried and my manicure lasted longer than usual.</li>
            <li> I like it. However, what I bought is a bit expensive because each of them cost around $1. From this item it cost more than 6 dollar. Should have known next time.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great product.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> gorgeous colors, very pigmented!</li>
            <li> all the colors appear to look the same as in the picture and after 2 coats b the same as the color in the bottle, except the green... it is more gold/limeade type color, a lot lighter.</li>
            <li> All of the other colors are fine, but the green does stain neon yellow like other reviewers have mentioned.  I love the blues and the purple, but it&#x27;s been weeks and I still can&#x27;t get the stain off, leaving me to simply paint over it.</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors but sadly it doesn&#x27;t last long.  The polish began to chip off in less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> smelly polish, great assorted colors, kind of pricy though cause they dont stay on as they should (2 to 3 says :() use all the time and always get compliments.</li>
            <li> Looks nice on but chips pretty quick. Love the dark blue but it stains a bit for a couple days after. still, if you&#x27;re going to wear it within 1-2 days, lovely.</li>
            <li> Totally stained my nails.  It was more difficult to get off than gel polish. I threw them away.  Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> perfect. great colors</li>
            <li> This is a great nail plish with a variety of colors.  It lasts a long time.  I truly recomend this</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  It was so old I could barely get it out of the bottle.  There were just blobs of polish on my nails.  Love the color, but the smell had everyone complaining.  Never again will I buy this.  Been doing nails for 30 years.  This was the worst.</li>
            <li> smooth yes. I did not get the green in my package nor the purple.  I got three shades of pink!</li>
            <li> colors good but i have to reaply it every day</li>
            <li> The color lasts a few days but not really as vibrant as expected.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty, but it will stain your fingernails.</li>
            <li> These chip within the first day of using them-- and I have a nice top polish that doesn&#x27;t chip with other nail polishes. Don&#x27;t do it!</li>
            <li> The colors are great and got exactly what I wanted. The nail polishes do come individualy and not in a box.</li>
            <li> The colors are ok. I only used one once. Did not really like it.</li>
            <li> This item is such poor quality!!! The colors are poor and the polish was thick and goopy with each bottle. That to me says they are old. I added thinner and didnt help, it just made the color worse. I requested a refund and they requested a picture!!! What?? What kind of picture, me attempting to polish my nails with thick old nail polish?? I am so disappointed with this purchase and will not be ordering again!!!</li>
            <li> The colors are nice however a day after painting my nails it began to chip. Two days after it is almost gone</li>
            <li> I had previously written a review for this seller... The first time I mentioned that one of the nail polish bottles had come broken- I contacted them and got a quick response from them! They were really nice about it and said they would replace the damaged bottle. And so they did! I was actually skeptical at first but now I am really happy with my purchase. And they sent me an extra little gift too (polish remover pads). I thought that was super nice of them. Needless to say, I will definately be buying from them again AND recommeding them to my friends! I LOVE THE COLORS! Although they chip easily, but that can be fixed with extra coats and a last clear coat for a nice finish.</li>
            <li> better than the pics. fantastic price for the quantity and the quality. there is no way you will be diasapointed.</li>
            <li> This was a gift, so this review is how it came and what I saw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are very nice and the seller packed it nicely with bubble wrap. I don&#x27;t know how they look painted on or how durable the paint is. I am looking forward to hearing what my nieces think.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I really wanted metallic polishes and the price just couldn&#x27;t be beat. The colors are great and it goes on smooth and most often you only need one coat. However, the colors aren&#x27;t really metallic. The contain a micro-glitter of either silver or silver and another color, they will sparkle instead of shine like a true metallic. They are still beautiful but if you want true metallics these aren&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> Bought these for stamping. They work great. Only complaint is that a couple of the colors stain the stamper, but in the scheme of things that is really no big deal. It does fade off the stamper over time.</li>
            <li> Thes work really well for stamping not to mention the colors are very pretty most are one coaters  they will bleed a bit when you but top coat on.</li>
            <li> Received mine yesterday. he colors are absolutely gorgeous and delivery was quick. Would order this product again.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this nail polish!!! Figuring for the price and ordering it online, where I could not test it, it would probably be ok, but nothing fantastic...I was soooo wrong!!! The colors are amazing and the most sparkle I&#x27;ve ever gotten out of nail polish!!! I will absolutely order these again and have actually ordered other colors from this brand!!!</li>
            <li> I like to paint my nails A LOT. And when I saw this 6 color set of Metallics I was super excited. The colors are really beautiful, BUT they stain your nails once it&#x27;s time to remove them. Even with a base coat the color has a tendency to stay where you don&#x27;t want it. Also, I&#x27;ve learned that adding a top coat causes the metallic property of the polish do disappear. The color just becomes REALLY SHINY, which isn&#x27;t bad but it takes away from the purpose of buying the metallic colors. I also noticed that they peal and chip easily with or without base/top coats. I was able to find a cheaper nail polish brand for $1.00 each at my local beauty supply store and even though they don&#x27;t have any metallic colors, the polish drys quickly, doesn&#x27;t stain, and is chip resistant.</li>
            <li> Was very impressed by the colors. Much better than what&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li> It came very quickly  and in great condition.  Thank you so much, I would so order from you once again!  I use it for my nail decoration wheels.  I forgot the names of the companies, but just as thick as the nail polish they sell for better, thicker decals.  A great set for any nail polish enthusiast out there!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the colors I received!  They&#x27;re just as awesome as you see in the pics.  Unfortunately one of the polishes had leaked during shipment.  I immediately took a pic, sent it to vendor and within 2 days I am holding the replacement!!!  Now THAT&#x27;S CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!  I could have accepted a 25% off voucher for my next order - which was awesome as well.&lt;br /&gt;Summary...PRODUCT: awesome&lt;br /&gt;COMPANY:  Exactly who you want to deal with when you&#x27;re ordering online!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU KLEANCOLOR!!!!</li>
            <li> GOing into Easter basket for the family hunt on Saturday.</li>
            <li> The colors are rich and beautiful, price is fantastic, these even smell good :D the only problem is the darker ones stain and take quite a bit of nail polish remover to get off but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> The colors are really bright and look good! But does get somewhat chunky if you don&#x27;t leave enought time to dry between applications.</li>
            <li> These colors are amazing, very rich, and very metallic/foil-like. I&#x27;ve never seen colors like these - most polish that is really metallic is also a pale shade. These colors are strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of other reviews, so I&#x27;ll only add a few things here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- These are very metallic, and look different with a top coat, so you can get two different looks out of one color. Without topcoat, they look like frosty metal, and with, the color deepens and looks more like hard candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- They are a little thick, and you can benefit by adding a few drops of nail polish thinner (not remover or acetone - find nail polish thinner here on Amazon or at a beauty supply place). They&#x27;ll dry a little quicker as well as go on a little more smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The colors I have tried have worked well for stamping since they are very reflective and pretty opaque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I know there are a lot of complaints about the odor with Kleancolor, but I&#x27;ve smelled worse, and what I like is the odor dissipates very quickly once dry, unlike a lot of nail polish that still smells really strong hours later or even all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Two coats, and in some cases just one coat, give complete coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You can speed up drying time by using a fast-dry clear top coat like NYC&#x27;s In a New York Minute (which is cheap and dries VERY fast, makes everything underneath it dry fast and isn&#x27;t thick)</li>
            <li> I love these! I usually don&#x27;t buy nail polish online because I have to try it out, I&#x27;m really picky when it comes to it but I liked what people were saying about it so I went for it and got them. The color is great, one coat looks amazing and it dries super quick, also I noticed it doesn&#x27;t smell as bad as my other polish and I usually buy sinful colors. I am definitely buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> This is nothing negative against the seller, they were great. This product, however, completely destroyed my nails. Specifically the metallic green...I put it on over a top coat and kept it on for 2 days only. This polish stained my nails a dark yellow that is permanent, and now I have to wait months for it to grow out. I tried all the home remedies to whiten nails and then buffed off the top layer of my nails just to get some of the yellow off. That damaged them even more. I haven&#x27;t tried the other colors because of the results from the green one. Steer clear of this product!</li>
            <li> This polish is kind of a double edged sword. On one hand, the colors are so insanely vibrant and you really only need one coat, but two for a deeper color, and they stay on for a very long time(as most metallics usually do) , at least a week, without chipping. The downside to these is that a) they stained my nails SO BAD, especially the green color, that I had to let my nails grow out completely before the stain finally went away, mind you this is with a base coat. b) the polish was so hard to get off once I finally wanted it off that I had to use the glitter trick, - put polish remover soaked cotton pads on nails and put tin foil on them for a few minutes -  and STILL there was polish left over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I use these for now is with my stamper and nail plates, they work pretty well with the plates. I make sure I have at least three coats of polish underneath and that usually does the trick. I have not gotten near the green color again after it destroyed my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, beautiful colors, but I would definitely not recommend these to anyone. Too hard to get off and stains nails.</li>
            <li> I received these 3 days ago, and immediately put on the dark blue.  They are so gorgeous and rich, and just stunning.  I planned on using them for stamping, but they look so good alone!  Brushes are great.  Smell is weird; almost like cheap crayons?  Not a big deal, just something I noticed.  I now have on the purple, and can&#x27;t stop staring at my hands!  These are easy one-coaters, but OCD forces me to do 2.  Love love love!!  And such an unbelievable price!!!  I&#x27;m just giddy.</li>
            <li> I ordered these polishes from pandora collection and I&#x27;m super satisfied. The polishes arrived in a perfect condition from this seller all the way to Norway. The set came in one of the best packaging I&#x27;ve ever seen. Love the fact that I get so many bright polishes for such a good price. They may have a long drying time, but with a good quick drying topcoat it&#x27;s not a problem. This is by far one of the best polishes I&#x27;ve used. I find the consistency perfect, it applies with ease and only need one coat. I&#x27;ve tried them for stamping as well. Not exactly konad special polish result, but still very sharp and bright images.</li>
            <li> The green and the blue do stain a little but otherwise some of the best polish ive bought lately They do flake but nothing a top coat won&#x27;t take care of</li>
            <li> The polish goes on beautifully. Although it does chip fairly easily, butt what are you going to do. it shipped accordingly.</li>
            <li> The colors are great and look really nice on. The problem is that they chipped off within 1 day of application, but were really difficult to take off with polish remover.</li>
            <li> The dark metallic colors stained my nails really bad, eventhough I put on a base coat! I can&#x27;t get it off... I didn&#x27;t have this problem with Sally Hansen nail polish, even the darkest color. I hate this...I used the blue metallic and now my nails are blue when I removed the polish! Very bad quality!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the quality of this nail polish for the low price I paid for it. This is the 2nd set of Kleancolor polishes I ordered &amp; I am now a fan of this brand... I ordered it on Nov 8 and received it on Nov 10. Very fast delivery with great wrapping/condition. I&#x27;ll add some pictures.</li>
            <li> The colors are absolutely stunning! Be sure you have a base coat, as these tend to stain quite a bit. My manicure lasted longer than usual, as chipping was a minimum</li>
            <li> Bought some for myself, my daughter and granddaughter and we love it. Durable product as well as color. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t resist this shiny, glittery, vibrant multi-pack.  I wasn&#x27;t familiar with the brand, but decided to try it.  I was pleased with the coverage from only one coat, how quickly it dried and how great the colors are.  Others mentioned a bad smell, but I found it more mild than regular nail polishes, even maybe a hint of grape.  My only complaint is that they seem to chip a little easier than others polishes I&#x27;ve used.  So I will keep experimenting with base and top coats to find a combination that works.</li>
            <li> Love kleancolor nail products. This one chips alot easier than the others but as long as you do 2 coats its worth the buy.</li>
            <li> This was something my parents got me from my wish list. The quality of the polish is great. It applies well, dries in good time, and seems to be rather resilient to the gross clumpy-ness that comes from a badly done manicure. I have a very shaky hand, but my nails look nearly flawless~!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d think again for buying this product if you&#x27;re older. I&#x27;m 16, but I have a very womanly appearance, and I look a bit silly in some of the colors. They look great in the bottle (gorgeous, actually) but putting them on your nails is another story.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a great product for costume, pre-teen girls, and for nail decoration (like stamping).</li>
            <li> Cheap and flakes off easily</li>
            <li> Product arrived a day before it was due. The colors are just beautiful. They go on with three brush strokes and dry quickly. The problem is it chipped terrible within hours of application. It took forever to remove and stained my nails. I will try experimenting with different base and top coats. Hopefully I will have better luck.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I just took the green off my nails and although it was beautiful and I had many compliments, I can not recommend this polish. My nails are stained \\&quot;glow in the dark\\&quot; yellow. I have tried everything to clean them, but they are stained. If you like a variety of light and dark polish, this is not for you. Stained nails, chips quickly and is just awful to remove.  DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and they chip too fast. will stay on for a week. not quick drying though but for the price and colors I can stay put for an extra 10mins....</li>
            <li> Colors are bright and pigmented; nearly all are one-coaters. I didn&#x27;t notice they smelled any worse than any other polish I own.  Formulas are very nice, minus the green. Mine is a little gritty and clumpy; it looked like it had been opened before, because there was polish on the neck.  I just took the pink off my nails, and holy stain! It was on for less than 48 hours, and its pretty badly stained. I have a feeling these will all stain significantly, but with polishes ad pigmented and opaque as these, it&#x27;s too be expected.</li>
            <li> Absolutely stunning colors!!! One coat works beautifully and the polish dried super fast!  I can&#x27;t wait to try it with stamping!</li>
            <li> These are such awesome colors and they are great quality especially for the price! I would buy this brand again!</li>
            <li> Great product and great Seller.  The colors were a bit off and the Seller was right there to correct the problem. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I received the order way before i was expected. the colors are vibrant and just what i wanted. I love it!</li>
