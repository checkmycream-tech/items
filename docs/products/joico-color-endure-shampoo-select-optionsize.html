            <li>It smells fantastic and as I said, the price is great.</li>
            <li>love love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m otherwise a huge fan of this shampoo and plan to use it for a while!</li>
            <li>Since I began using Joico Color Endure Shampoo at home, my hair retains its color and shine so much better from appointment to appointment.</li>
            <li>I like this joico shampoo more than the others</li>
            <li>I feel like it cleans my hair better.</li>
            <li>I searched everywhere to find a REAL shampoo for color treated hair but they all seem to contain sulfate (which most women with colored hair know doesn&#x27;t help keep color) and for the price this is great.</li>
            <li>Love the way my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and leaves your hair feeling light.</li>
            <li>It an ok shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love the Joico products.</li>
            <li>Also, I have asthma and most of the products on the market have perfumes that cause a reaction.</li>
            <li>This is sulfate free and makes for a nice lather.my colored hair</li>
            <li>I really love that this shampoo heals my hair</li>
            <li>Leaves a very clean feel.  </li>
            <li>Should have known better if it&#x27;s available at CVS.</li>
            <li>thanks you.definitely a good price for the product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is rich, lathers well, but doesn&#x27;t make my fine hair greasy.</li>
            <li>The only positive is that it smells good.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo with little bubbles, the way shampoo should be.</li>
            <li>I have my hair treated on a regular basis (every 5-6 weeks), and it is important to me that my hair look healthy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it though.</li>
            <li>but I really feel that I need to use a clarifying shampoo before using this one, as it doesn&#x27;t clean out sweat and the like.  </li>
            <li>Before using them my hair would grow to a certain length and then break off.</li>
            <li>This product is gentle, while still cleansing my hair well.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find the older version</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>so it is important that I&#x27;m careful not to over-stress it, and I believe this product helps me do just that.</li>
            <li>No matter how much attention I pay to rinsing all of the shampoo and conditioner out, I still have a residue on my hair once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used the Joico Color Endure Violet formula, which helps in keeping blonde hair cool-toned, but I don&#x27;t like it as much because it doesn&#x27;t lather as well as the regular Color Endure.</li>
            <li>A little bit, maybe three squirts to get a nickel-sized amount, washes all of my hair, as this lathers very well.</li>

            <li> but it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for well over a year and usually wash my hair every day with no problems at all.</li>
            <li> Leaves a thick, heavy, slimy residue on your hair.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need conditioner or hair care products with this one because it will already be slick and greasy after this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have seen shampoos for &amp;#34;color-treated hair&amp;#34; that cost an upwards of $30 for less than 10oz that all contain sulfate...so irritating.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this product, no matter how much you use it does not lather.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not loving this product the way I hoped I would.</li>
            <li> The product came in about a week late and by that time I was out of shampoo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a very hard time with this shampoo and conditioner combo.</li>
            <li> I hate this product, strips the hair of life and gives it a weighted down feeling like straw.  </li>
            <li> This formulation without sulphates is awful.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m having a very hard time with this shampoo and conditioner combo. No matter how much attention I pay to rinsing all of the shampoo and conditioner out, I still have a residue on my hair once it&#x27;s dry. I use no product when styling and I can&#x27;t help but feel my hair is still not clean. Maybe it&#x27;s me...but I&#x27;m not loving this product the way I hoped I would.</li>
            <li> I have my hair colored and highlighted in a salon.  My hairdresser uses Joico coloring products as well as Joico shampoos and conditioners.  I had been using other shampoo brands at home, in between appointments.  I found that, even when using products that were supposed to be made especially for color-treated hair, my hair color faded and lost its deep shine.  Since I began using Joico Color Endure Shampoo at home, my hair retains its color and shine so much better from appointment to appointment.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product to me initially, and I have used it ever since.  I have my hair treated on a regular basis (every 5-6 weeks), and it is important to me that my hair look healthy.  This product is gentle, while still cleansing my hair well.  I wash my hair daily, and so it is important that I&#x27;m careful not to over-stress it, and I believe this product helps me do just that.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product and have used for years.  However I was expecting a pump handle with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I like this joico shampoo more than the others bc I feel like it cleans my hair better.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo with little bubbles, the way shampoo should be.</li>
            <li> love love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I used the color endure with sulphates and loved this shampoo,  and that is the one I ordered. This formulation without sulphates is awful.  I hate this product, strips the hair of life and gives it a weighted down feeling like straw.  I can&#x27;t find the older version but this one is a waste of money. I had no idea this was a different formulation as the name is the same and the packaging, online, looks identical. The product came in about a week late and by that time I was out of shampoo so I had to use it but it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I searched everywhere to find a REAL shampoo for color treated hair but they all seem to contain sulfate (which most women with colored hair know doesn&#x27;t help keep color) and for the price this is great. It smells fantastic and as I said, the price is great. I have seen shampoos for &amp;#34;color-treated hair&amp;#34; that cost an upwards of $30 for less than 10oz that all contain sulfate...so irritating. I found this by chance and haven&#x27;t looked back. There&#x27;s one other shampoo that I tried but it was almost watery and cost a fortune. Love the way my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Leaves a very clean feel.  My favorite!</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo and leaves my hair shiny and silky with no build up problem whatsoever.  I&#x27;ve been using it for well over a year and usually wash my hair every day with no problems at all.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this product, no matter how much you use it does not lather.</li>
            <li> I have long, color treated hair that goes down to my hips and this is my go-to shampoo. A little bit, maybe three squirts to get a nickel-sized amount, washes all of my hair, as this lathers very well. It smells amazing and leaves your hair feeling light. My only complaint is that this product is a bit pricey- I try to buy in bulk when I can. It&#x27;s worth it though.</li>
            <li> Love sulfate free shampoo and Joico is an excellent product. Product arrived on time and was what I expected. Good price too</li>
            <li> It an ok shampoo.  There are a lot of products out there that condition as well as this one does.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair bleached platinum blonde, and seriously, this is the ONLY shampoo that keeps the ends of my hair looking unbroken, unbronzed and cooperative with the flatiron and curling iron. The benefits of switching from regular volumizing shampoo (TIGI Bed Head) to Joico Color Endure was noticeable after one wash, and I believe that it&#x27;s in part because the shampoo is sulfate-free. I&#x27;ve also used the Joico Color Endure Violet formula, which helps in keeping blonde hair cool-toned, but I don&#x27;t like it as much because it doesn&#x27;t lather as well as the regular Color Endure. This stuff is rich, lathers well, but doesn&#x27;t make my fine hair greasy. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo.  I love the Joico products. Before using them my hair would grow to a certain length and then break off. This is so nourishing that I can now grow my hair as long as I want. Also, I have asthma and most of the products on the market have perfumes that cause a reaction. For some reason the scent in Joico doesn&#x27;t trigger a reaction.  SO happy!</li>
            <li> This is sulfate free and makes for a nice lather.my colored hair thanks you.definitely a good price for the product.</li>
            <li> I really love that this shampoo heals my hair but I really feel that I need to use a clarifying shampoo before using this one, as it doesn&#x27;t clean out sweat and the like.  I&#x27;m otherwise a huge fan of this shampoo and plan to use it for a while!</li>
            <li> Great product for colored hair</li>
            <li> Leaves a thick, heavy, slimy residue on your hair. I washed it twice and there was no improvement in getting the product off. You don&#x27;t need conditioner or hair care products with this one because it will already be slick and greasy after this shampoo. Should have known better if it&#x27;s available at CVS. The only positive is that it smells good.</li>
