            <li>If you&#x27;re using the curly girl method I recommend this gel strongly.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m in love with pantine in general but this is by far the best gel out there.</li>
            <li>Very nice gel, not dry and scrunchy texture</li>
            <li>Hey, curly girls, this product is fantastic.    </li>
            <li>These were a great buy on Amazon with a digital coupon</li>
            <li>Look for coupons that are sometimes available on Amazon before you buy.</li>
            <li>my own mother, who knows I have naturally straight hair asked me if I had gotten a perm.</li>
            <li>It is just fantastic and neither of us have issues with frizz with our curly hair.</li>
            <li>(don&#x27;t rub the hair, or tie it up turban style, just flip your hair over and lightly scrunch it in the towel)</li>
            <li>I really like this hair gel because of my curly hair, this is the kind of styling that I like a lot.</li>
            <li>so cheap and</li>
            <li>I really like this hair gel because of my curly hair, this is the kind of styling that I like a lot.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft but with hold, good value on Amazon as well.</li>
            <li>this is a product I use regularly - I am familiar with it - but&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product, and teamed with the Aussie extra freeze hair spray, my hair looks perfect all day long.</li>
            <li>but on the whole the curls last for ages and look pretty flawless.</li>
            <li>Pantene Pro-V Curly Hair Style Gel is great for my naturally curly hair and it is hard for me to find products that truly work great for my hair.</li>
            <li>so I am not shocked.</li>
            <li>They make such a good product.  </li>
            <li>Gives a nice smoothness and control to my naturally wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li>somebody who&#x27;s hair is already very curly and healthy.</li>
            <li>this was really a super deal, I love pantene products, thanks</li>
            <li>on 2nd and 3rd day... on the 1st day it was wonderful</li>
            <li>but it frizzed out quickly without product.</li>
            <li>My daughter now has enough gel to last her a year, and her hair looks great!</li>
            <li>Works pretty good for my 2 year olds blonde ringlets hair.</li>
            <li>I still am on my first tube of gel!</li>
            <li>Using this gel enhances the curl and gives my thick but fine hair a great texture.</li>
            <li>gel is the best gel that I have tried for my thin, curly hair</li>
            <li>For the one with most kinky curls we put directly on.  </li>
            <li>I found this via a youtube review and it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve tried to tame my curls so far.  </li>
            <li>Once you find the right amount to use it makes the curls defined.</li>
            <li>It lasts almost all day long,  has a nice smell</li>
            <li>Makes for defined curls that are still soft to the touch and easy to style.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice it curls my hair any better than anything else - I actually prefer the L&#x27;Oreal Evercurl gel.</li>
            <li>Threw it away after first use.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like my hair to look too crisp and shiny.</li>
            <li>So long as you don&#x27;t go overboard, this stuff does an awesome job.</li>
            <li>I have used too much a few times leaving my hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;, but on most days, I apply it to my wet head, scrunch it and maybe apply a little more when it dries, but my hair holds a beautiful curl all day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried lots of other leave-in products for curly hair (lotions, cremes and gels) but this is the only one that works great.  </li>
            <li>turn my head over, scrunch some more and then blow dry with a diffuser.</li>
            <li>The mousse, on the other hand, keeps the hair looking great for several days--the hair actually looks better after a few days of using the mousse without washing the hair and even going on some runs makes the hair look better.</li>
            <li>This arrived quickly and I am glad it came in a 3 pack as it was cheaper than going to my local store and buying them individually.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very curly hair</li>
            <li>My hair is very curly and soft...like ringlets.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much of it I use, I end up with a halo of frizz.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much cheaper than in store.</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, I am amazed at how much fuller my hair looks and feels using this curling gel.</li>
            <li>This gel works very well on my curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair (sort of corkscrew curls)</li>
            <li>Pantene&#x27;s products have been working very well for me, including this one.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair all crunchy, still really flexible.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much to wash out of your hair either.</li>
            <li>I just have to remember not to use so much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s getting harder to find in stores, but I Love it.</li>
            <li>Really helps to style hair</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve moved to a high humid climate and my daughter and I absolutely for this product.</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel extremely dry and after sleeping on it one night, it turned my pony tail into one huge dreadlock that took way too much time to comb out in the shower.</li>
            <li>so I assumed this curl gel would be equally as good while creating less environmental waste since the mousse goes quick.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you&#x27;ve got curly hair.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend, and I also recommend ordering through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy and hard, but looks nice and curly.</li>
            <li>My hairs tends to fall flat quickly with this gel.  </li>
            <li>It also works very well as far as what it&#x27;s supposed to do...</li>
            <li>Kind of sticky and thick.  </li>
            <li>I have very straight, long, fine hair, and after showering, I towel dry my hair, squeeze a glob of this in my hand, and apply to my moist hair (at the roots).</li>
            <li>that can get frizzy easily, but using this gel keeps my curls under control and is still soft to the touch, not crunchy like other products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mild scent, can&#x27;t smell when dry.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you have naturally curly hair and are looking for a product to help keep your curls definition through the day.</li>
            <li>I use a curl friendly shampoo and conditioner and instead of using several styling products, I only use this.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Completely safisfied!</li>
            <li>With about 15 minutes of work and some diffusing I get a head full of bouncy individual curls that last all day.     </li>
            <li>I style my hair using dabs of gel to forming individual curls, and this stuff works really well--</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and have tried nearly every product on the market.</li>
            <li>It leaves soft controlled curls</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>So far no problem at all</li>
            <li>My hair looks natural, not processed like when I use hairspray.</li>
            <li>I have spent YEARS looking for the right gel.  </li>
            <li>These keep my curls nice and defined while not making them stiff or crunchy like some other products do.</li>
            <li>If left to air dry alone it can get incredibly frizzy and the my corkscrew curls can get limp since my hair is so heavy.</li>
            <li>I apply it directly out of the shower and gently towel dry</li>
            <li>This really helps to hold a curl all day long.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make hair hard or crunchy or look like it&#x27;s full of product either!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other products (no matter how expensive) seem to leave residue that leaves you feeling like you&#x27;ve got gunk in your hair, but this gel is clear and just gives nice results without the gunk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the other three of us don&#x27;t need that much hold</li>
            <li>It helps keep natural curls looking nice without crazy frizz as well as just using it as a refused gel product for non cut lay hair.</li>
            <li>I have long, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have super thick, long, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>and it turns my naturally wavy hair into loose curls.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint I have it that every once in a while the gel suds up like a mild soap.</li>
            <li>NIce consistency, not sticky or stiff like other gels I have used in the past.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Pantene curl mousse for years and love it</li>
            <li> I think it might work better for</li>
            <li> effect is OK .</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, its great.  </li>
            <li> the best gel l have found to hold my curls plus its alcohol free and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using the curly girl method I recommend this gel strongly.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it seems to do good job keeping the curls of my hair, and it smells good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with pantine in general but this is by far the best gel out there.</li>
            <li> Very nice gel, not dry and scrunchy texture</li>
            <li> Hey, curly girls, this product is fantastic.    </li>
            <li> These were a great buy on Amazon with a digital coupon</li>
            <li> Look for coupons that are sometimes available on Amazon before you buy.</li>
            <li> my own mother, who knows I have naturally straight hair asked me if I had gotten a perm.</li>
            <li> It is just fantastic and neither of us have issues with frizz with our curly hair.</li>
            <li> (don&#x27;t rub the hair, or tie it up turban style, just flip your hair over and lightly scrunch it in the towel)</li>
            <li> I really like this hair gel because of my curly hair, this is the kind of styling that I like a lot.</li>
            <li> so cheap and</li>
            <li> I really like this hair gel because of my curly hair, this is the kind of styling that I like a lot.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft but with hold, good value on Amazon as well.</li>
            <li> this is a product I use regularly - I am familiar with it - but&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product, and teamed with the Aussie extra freeze hair spray, my hair looks perfect all day long.</li>
            <li> but on the whole the curls last for ages and look pretty flawless.</li>
            <li> Pantene Pro-V Curly Hair Style Gel is great for my naturally curly hair and it is hard for me to find products that truly work great for my hair.</li>
            <li> so I am not shocked.</li>
            <li> They make such a good product.  </li>
            <li> Gives a nice smoothness and control to my naturally wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li> somebody who&#x27;s hair is already very curly and healthy.</li>
            <li> this was really a super deal, I love pantene products, thanks</li>
            <li> on 2nd and 3rd day... on the 1st day it was wonderful</li>
            <li> but it frizzed out quickly without product.</li>
            <li> My daughter now has enough gel to last her a year, and her hair looks great!</li>
            <li> Works pretty good for my 2 year olds blonde ringlets hair.</li>
            <li> I still am on my first tube of gel!</li>
            <li> Using this gel enhances the curl and gives my thick but fine hair a great texture.</li>
            <li> gel is the best gel that I have tried for my thin, curly hair</li>
            <li> For the one with most kinky curls we put directly on.  </li>
            <li> I found this via a youtube review and it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve tried to tame my curls so far.  </li>
            <li> Once you find the right amount to use it makes the curls defined.</li>
            <li> It lasts almost all day long,  has a nice smell</li>
            <li> Makes for defined curls that are still soft to the touch and easy to style.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice it curls my hair any better than anything else - I actually prefer the L&#x27;Oreal Evercurl gel.</li>
            <li> Threw it away after first use.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like my hair to look too crisp and shiny.</li>
            <li> So long as you don&#x27;t go overboard, this stuff does an awesome job.</li>
            <li> I have used too much a few times leaving my hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;, but on most days, I apply it to my wet head, scrunch it and maybe apply a little more when it dries, but my hair holds a beautiful curl all day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried lots of other leave-in products for curly hair (lotions, cremes and gels) but this is the only one that works great.  </li>
            <li> turn my head over, scrunch some more and then blow dry with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> The mousse, on the other hand, keeps the hair looking great for several days--the hair actually looks better after a few days of using the mousse without washing the hair and even going on some runs makes the hair look better.</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and I am glad it came in a 3 pack as it was cheaper than going to my local store and buying them individually.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very curly hair</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and soft...like ringlets.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much of it I use, I end up with a halo of frizz.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much cheaper than in store.</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I am amazed at how much fuller my hair looks and feels using this curling gel.</li>
            <li> This gel works very well on my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair (sort of corkscrew curls)</li>
            <li> Pantene&#x27;s products have been working very well for me, including this one.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair all crunchy, still really flexible.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much to wash out of your hair either.</li>
            <li> I just have to remember not to use so much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting harder to find in stores, but I Love it.</li>
            <li> Really helps to style hair</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve moved to a high humid climate and my daughter and I absolutely for this product.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel extremely dry and after sleeping on it one night, it turned my pony tail into one huge dreadlock that took way too much time to comb out in the shower.</li>
            <li> so I assumed this curl gel would be equally as good while creating less environmental waste since the mousse goes quick.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you&#x27;ve got curly hair.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend, and I also recommend ordering through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy and hard, but looks nice and curly.</li>
            <li> My hairs tends to fall flat quickly with this gel.  </li>
            <li> It also works very well as far as what it&#x27;s supposed to do...</li>
            <li> Kind of sticky and thick.  </li>
            <li> I have very straight, long, fine hair, and after showering, I towel dry my hair, squeeze a glob of this in my hand, and apply to my moist hair (at the roots).</li>
            <li> that can get frizzy easily, but using this gel keeps my curls under control and is still soft to the touch, not crunchy like other products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mild scent, can&#x27;t smell when dry.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you have naturally curly hair and are looking for a product to help keep your curls definition through the day.</li>
            <li> I use a curl friendly shampoo and conditioner and instead of using several styling products, I only use this.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Completely safisfied!</li>
            <li> With about 15 minutes of work and some diffusing I get a head full of bouncy individual curls that last all day.     </li>
            <li> I style my hair using dabs of gel to forming individual curls, and this stuff works really well--</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and have tried nearly every product on the market.</li>
            <li> It leaves soft controlled curls</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> So far no problem at all</li>
            <li> My hair looks natural, not processed like when I use hairspray.</li>
            <li> I have spent YEARS looking for the right gel.  </li>
            <li> These keep my curls nice and defined while not making them stiff or crunchy like some other products do.</li>
            <li> If left to air dry alone it can get incredibly frizzy and the my corkscrew curls can get limp since my hair is so heavy.</li>
            <li> I apply it directly out of the shower and gently towel dry</li>
            <li> This really helps to hold a curl all day long.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make hair hard or crunchy or look like it&#x27;s full of product either!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other products (no matter how expensive) seem to leave residue that leaves you feeling like you&#x27;ve got gunk in your hair, but this gel is clear and just gives nice results without the gunk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the other three of us don&#x27;t need that much hold</li>
            <li> It helps keep natural curls looking nice without crazy frizz as well as just using it as a refused gel product for non cut lay hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have super thick, long, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> and it turns my naturally wavy hair into loose curls.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have it that every once in a while the gel suds up like a mild soap.</li>
            <li> NIce consistency, not sticky or stiff like other gels I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s literally much softer, shinier, and less frizzy without any product in it at all than it is having been coated with this gel!</li>
            <li> All of the other products that I have tried made my hair feel crunchy, but this stuff keeps it much softer and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look like it&#x27;s wet all day.</li>
            <li> Hair is soft compared with other shaping brands.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time Pantene shampoo and conditioner user, but actually used a different styling product.  </li>
            <li> The ones I like the best are the ones that I can use a little bit and it lasts all day in my thick curly, CRAZY hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but it still makes it soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> It last a long time!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I have soft curls (but that&#x27;s probably just because I have chronic dry hair), but it&#x27;s definitely not the crunchy mess</li>
            <li> I get compliments all day long AND requests for my step-by-step process!  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s hard to wash it completely off my hands after I apply it, and if I don&#x27;t wash it off completely, my hands are left sticky.</li>
            <li> I like to let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> Hair has a crunchy feel when product is dry.</li>
            <li> (unless you use it when your hair is completely dry and you don&#x27;t brush it through...</li>
            <li> still flakes a bit but doesnt dry out your hair.</li>
            <li> Let it dry, comb it out...</li>
            <li> It does dry out my hair a bit with every day use</li>
            <li> I generally follow with some Argan oil or a finishing spray once my hair is fully dry to tame any excess frizz and fight off humidity</li>
            <li> For her calms down the massive fluff.  </li>
            <li> Must apply product while hair is wet or damp</li>
            <li> This did as promised (I use on wet curls..</li>
            <li> i put it on wet hair</li>
            <li> not what i expected, made hair crunchy</li>
            <li> I just put a &#x27;nickle size&#x27; amount in my hands and rub it through my wet hair...</li>
            <li> Then I blow dry my hair and brush it out, and voom!!</li>
            <li> Is not strong enough to control the frizz in my hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> In 36 years of having curly hair, I haven&#x27;t found any other product that can do that.</li>
            <li> In the past, I would have to rewet daily (which dries the hair out).  </li>
            <li> Lots of other gels have gave up when the humidity went up</li>
            <li> My only complaint:  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair gunky and weighs hair down.</li>
            <li> I do admit that I add other products while styling, but what a difference!  </li>
            <li> The gel doesn&#x27;t cake or flake and it&#x27;s not overly sticky or heavy like some other products (ex.</li>
            <li> I use less hair spray and less products</li>
            <li> we squirt it in spray bottle and add conditioner and half of bottle with water.  </li>
            <li> Performance was disappointing on short naturally wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I like my gel to be a little stiffer and hold a little longer therefore it looses 1 star.  </li>
            <li> For me,  it does little to support or enhance curls.  </li>
            <li> I used to hate wearing my hair curly and would waste so much time blow drying and straightening but this product alone has totally cured me of that.</li>
            <li> I am a bit heavy handed when it comes to hair products.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t make my hair stiff and hard like other products have.  </li>
            <li> It gives me the control I need without causing my hair to be stiff or flaky.  </li>
            <li> it keeps curls defined and separated without making them look too stiff.</li>
            <li> It helps tame my curly, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair are not easy to style and with this, I obtain the result I want.</li>
            <li> No more curlers or curling irons for me.  </li>
            <li> so we use this to help define the curls as well as tame them!</li>
            <li> This did not make it hard, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help with frizz.</li>
            <li> Does not leave a hard film but still controls the style.</li>
            <li> I have really thick curly frizzy hair and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> i have longer thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> My hair looks very dull and feels like straw.</li>
            <li> I have very thick semi-curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used gel in my curls for years because all I could think of were those awful, crunchy curls of my high school days.</li>
            <li> This, by far, has been the worst.</li>
            <li> I get my hair cut in the Madu style but their gels are too expensive.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this as I tried salon products that have worked for me</li>
            <li> Sorry to break the news</li>
            <li> And I can do my hair for the day, then go swimming, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair all weird after swimming.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong using it.  </li>
            <li> This gel is hands down the worst hair product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> , so I figured, can&#x27;t go wrong!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about this gel.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Pantene is one of my favorite brands and Pro V Curl Perfection shaping gel is great.  It gives me the control I need without causing my hair to be stiff or flaky.  It also smells AMAZING and is at an unbeatable price here on Amazon.  I highly recommend it, its great.  If you have curly hair, you need this shaping gel.</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Pantene always makes reliable products and this is no exception. Keeps your curls looking shiny and curly.</li>
            <li> I use this for &amp;#34;hair-plopping&amp;#34; (Google it!) and it turns my naturally wavy hair into loose curls.  All of the other products that I have tried made my hair feel crunchy, but this stuff keeps it much softer and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look like it&#x27;s wet all day.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing! My daughter has very curly hair so we use this to help define the curls as well as tame them! This is a great product. It not only helps with the frizziness of her hair but it helps to make her curls look extra curly!! I&#x27;m in love with pantine in general but this is by far the best gel out there.</li>
            <li> Hey, curly girls, this product is fantastic.    I style my hair using dabs of gel to forming individual curls, and this stuff works really well--it keeps curls defined and separated without making them look too stiff. With about 15 minutes of work and some diffusing I get a head full of bouncy individual curls that last all day.     In 36 years of having curly hair, I haven&#x27;t found any other product that can do that. Even better, this stuff is WAY cheaper than salon products.  Five stars!</li>
            <li> Keeps my curly hairs from frizzing up</li>
            <li> Very nice gel, not dry and scrunchy texture but it will keep a nice hld on curls without being stick.y</li>
            <li> I have been a long time Pantene shampoo and conditioner user, but actually used a different styling product.  These were a great buy on Amazon with a digital coupon so I decided to give them a try.  I love this product.  Makes for defined curls that are still soft to the touch and easy to style.  I highly recommend this product if you have naturally curly hair and are looking for a product to help keep your curls definition through the day.</li>
            <li> makes my hair crunchy..dry</li>
            <li> What an awesome product!  I have spent YEARS looking for the right gel.  I do admit that I add other products while styling, but what a difference!  I get compliments all day long AND requests for my step-by-step process!  I&#x27;m African American and Capeverdean (mixture of African and Portuguese). My hair is very curly and soft...like ringlets.  This gel sets my curls for 3-5 days without having to REAPLY!  I just make sure to put my hair up at night, awake...then shake...viola!!!  It&#x27;s done!  I&#x27;ve never been able to do this!  In the past, I would have to rewet daily (which dries the hair out).  My only complaint:  I wish there were more in the bottle!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using the curly girl method I recommend this gel strongly. It has a light and pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t leave hair crunchy or flaky. It defines curls and takes away the frizz</li>
            <li> I am really glad I came along this deal! This arrived quickly and I am glad it came in a 3 pack as it was cheaper than going to my local store and buying them individually. Pantene Pro-V Curly Hair Style Gel is great for my naturally curly hair and it is hard for me to find products that truly work great for my hair. This is truly a great product!</li>
            <li> I have very thick semi-curly hair.  I like to let it air dry.  This did not make it hard, but it didn&#x27;t seem to help with frizz.</li>

            <li> Not too impressed, hairs were like straw... on 2nd and 3rd day... on the 1st day it was wonderful</li>
            <li> Great hold! Never sticky, perfect for air drying or diffusing . Look for coupons that are sometimes available on Amazon before you buy.</li>
            <li> I like this pantene pro v  I can manage my hair easier  I have used this product for years</li>
            <li> I have medium to thin-ish curly hair and this is the best gel I&#x27;ve found. I wish it came in bigger containers so I didn&#x27;t have to waste so much packaging. I get my hair cut in the Madu style but their gels are too expensive. I also use pantene pro-v for curly hair shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this product.bgreat price</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used gel in my curls for years because all I could think of were those awful, crunchy curls of my high school days. I got a good deal on this 3-pack, so I decided to give it a try. I figured, if anything, I could use it to take care of flyaways when I wear a pony tail if I didn&#x27;t work out for the curls. So long as you don&#x27;t go overboard, this stuff does an awesome job. I wouldn&#x27;t say I have soft curls (but that&#x27;s probably just because I have chronic dry hair), but it&#x27;s definitely not the crunchy mess I used to sport. I love to apply, scrunch, turn my head over, scrunch some more and then blow dry with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I like my gel to be a little stiffer and hold a little longer therefore it looses 1 star.  The only complaint I have it that every once in a while the gel suds up like a mild soap.</li>
            <li> Curly Hair - Yay!  Humidity - Boo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel is the best gel that I have tried for my thin, curly hair and I have tried a lot.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down but it still makes it soft and manageable.  Lots of other gels have gave up when the humidity went up but this didn&#x27;t.  It also didn&#x27;t make my hair stiff and hard like other products have.  Buying in bulk makes it such a great deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this as I tried salon products that have worked for me but I decided to try and am impressed. I use a curl friendly shampoo and conditioner and instead of using several styling products, I only use this. It works great and lasts all day. Impressed with the quality and it&#x27;s much cheaper than in store. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> OMG. Defines my curls much more compare to Suave. Pros: I use less hair spray and less products</li>
            <li> Wow! I have naturally straight hair and I used this curling gel from Pantene and it made my hair look as if I had gotten a perm. I kid you not, my neighbor commented on how nice my hair looked and my own mother, who knows I have naturally straight hair asked me if I had gotten a perm. I told her about this curling gel and she wanted to try it! I got a three pack of it when Amazon had a clip &amp; save coupon so I gave her one &amp; she loves it!&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I am amazed at how much fuller my hair looks and feels using this curling gel. Plus I don&#x27;t have to do anything but get out of the shower and scrunch my hair with this gel and this is my end result. No blow drying necessary.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Hair has a crunchy feel when product is dry. Must apply product while hair is wet or damp</li>
            <li> Works pretty good for my 2 year olds blonde ringlets hair. Keeps it from frizzing. The deal on three was anazing!</li>
            <li> Is not strong enough to control the frizz in my hair.</li>
            <li> Really nice for curly hair.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to have buildup.  Hair is soft compared with other shaping brands.</li>
            <li> Works well and smells nice.</li>
            <li> This gel works very well on my curly hair. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s hard to wash it completely off my hands after I apply it, and if I don&#x27;t wash it off completely, my hands are left sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years and am always pleased with the results.  I have very curly hair (sort of corkscrew curls) that can get frizzy easily, but using this gel keeps my curls under control and is still soft to the touch, not crunchy like other products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products (no matter how expensive) seem to leave residue that leaves you feeling like you&#x27;ve got gunk in your hair, but this gel is clear and just gives nice results without the gunk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried lots of other leave-in products for curly hair (lotions, cremes and gels) but this is the only one that works great.  And the great price is just another plus.  I highly recommend this product if you&#x27;ve got curly hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were on sale and I wanted something to keep my curls when I decide to wear them.  This did as promised (I use on wet curls..)&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about this gel. It smells nice and has a fairly strong hold. However, I wouldn&#x27;t classify this is &amp;#34;curling&amp;#34; gel. I don&#x27;t notice it curls my hair any better than anything else - I actually prefer the L&#x27;Oreal Evercurl gel.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve moved to a high humid climate and my daughter and I absolutely for this product. It is just fantastic and neither of us have issues with frizz with our curly hair. We also don&#x27;t have an issue with the &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; factor that a lot of curly hair products cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend, and I also recommend ordering through Amazon. This price is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This really helps to hold a curl all day long. I am very happy with the price I paid and the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that gave my hair a fuller look, so after reading the reviews I bought the Pantene shampoo, conditioner and setting gel combo, and it does what it promises. I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I have really thick curly frizzy hair and this does the trick. Once you find the right amount to use it makes the curls defined. I was using mousse for years but threw all of them away after using this.</li>
            <li> Love how it adds curls to my hair</li>
            <li> I have used COUNTLESS curl gels.  The ones I like the best are the ones that I can use a little bit and it lasts all day in my thick curly, CRAZY hair.  I used a coupon and got this 3 pack at a discount, so I figured, can&#x27;t go wrong!  I have used too much a few times leaving my hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;, but on most days, I apply it to my wet head, scrunch it and maybe apply a little more when it dries, but my hair holds a beautiful curl all day.  I&#x27; very happy.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and teamed with the Aussie extra freeze hair spray, my hair looks perfect all day long.</li>
            <li> Pantene&#x27;s products have been working very well for me, including this one. I use it to give my hair some volume, and it works great. It&#x27;s not sticky or crunchy (unless you use it when your hair is completely dry and you don&#x27;t brush it through...blehhh). I have very straight, long, fine hair, and after showering, I towel dry my hair, squeeze a glob of this in my hand, and apply to my moist hair (at the roots). Then I blow dry my hair and brush it out, and voom!! I&#x27;ve got graet volume for the day! It smells good, and doesn&#x27;t flake at all (even if I sleep with the product in my hair). My hair feels as if I didn&#x27;t have any product in it, and it maintains its style.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing! It also works very well as far as what it&#x27;s supposed to do... It helps keep natural curls looking nice without crazy frizz as well as just using it as a refused gel product for non cut lay hair.</li>
            <li> I have super thick, long, naturally curly hair. If left to air dry alone it can get incredibly frizzy and the my corkscrew curls can get limp since my hair is so heavy. I found this via a youtube review and it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve tried to tame my curls so far.  I apply it directly out of the shower and gently towel dry (don&#x27;t rub the hair, or tie it up turban style, just flip your hair over and lightly scrunch it in the towel) I generally follow with some Argan oil or a finishing spray once my hair is fully dry to tame any excess frizz and fight off humidity but on the whole the curls last for ages and look pretty flawless. The gel doesn&#x27;t cake or flake and it&#x27;s not overly sticky or heavy like some other products (ex. Diva curl gel) I used to hate wearing my hair curly and would waste so much time blow drying and straightening but this product alone has totally cured me of that. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> still flakes a bit but doesnt dry out your hair. would recommend</li>
            <li> Sorry to break the news but this has a rating of 6 for EWG&#x27;s website. Product can cause all kinds of problems. See here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> My three girls and myself all have curly hair four different types of curls.  For the one with most kinky curls we put directly on.  For her calms down the massive fluff.  the other three of us don&#x27;t need that much hold we squirt it in spray bottle and add conditioner and half of bottle with water.  It leaves soft controlled curls no frizzy fly always. We love it for all types of curls.  We buy two packs of three at a time and save $5 or more.</li>
            <li> this was really a super deal, I love pantene products, thanks</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the quantities</li>
            <li> Leaves hair gunky and weighs hair down. Threw it away after first use.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair but it frizzed out quickly without product. This is great. It gives my curls definition and keeps the frizz at bay. It doesn&#x27;t make hair hard or crunchy or look like it&#x27;s full of product either!</li>
            <li> This works great! It doesn&#x27;t make my hair all crunchy, still really flexible. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hands sticky even after you wash them, but it&#x27;s gel so I am not shocked. Doesn&#x27;t take much to wash out of your hair either. And I can do my hair for the day, then go swimming, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair all weird after swimming.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Better deal than the stores! My daughter now has enough gel to last her a year, and her hair looks great!</li>
            <li> I really like this hair gel because of my curly hair, this is the kind of styling that I like a lot.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair looking nice and smooth.  Does not leave a hard film but still controls the style.</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect for my hairstyle and I use it in a cocktail with the Pantene Volume Gel.  My hair is wavy and I wear it curly.  Using this gel enhances the curl and gives my thick but fine hair a great texture.</li>
            <li> I love everything Pantene.  They make such a good product.  You can&#x27;t go wrong using it.  I have been using Pantene for years.  A variety of their products.  This gel works good in My curly hair.  I just have to remember not to use so much.  I am a bit heavy handed when it comes to hair products.</li>
            <li> Amazing in my daughters hair! It does not harden her curls and it keeps them nice and neat.</li>
            <li> very cheap compare to Target Love it!!</li>
            <li> so cheap and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Awesome for hair that is curly! I love it! I still am on my first tube of gel! It last a long time! Completely safisfied!</li>
            <li> It does hold your curl.  I am satisfy with the Pantene Pro-V Crl Shaping Hair Gel.  So far no problem at all</li>
            <li> love this stuff! been using it for yeras. i have longer thick wavy hair and this holds my curls all day! i put it on wet hair and then when it dries some i put a touch of hairspray before i leave. doesnt leave ur hair lookign \\&quot;wet\\&quot; once it dries, which i love! the agency i model for loves it too for the same reason</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for awhile.  It helps tame my curly, frizzy hair.  It&#x27;s getting harder to find in stores, but I Love it.</li>
            <li> NIce consistency, not sticky or stiff like other gels I have used in the past. Gives a nice smoothness and control to my naturally wavy/curly hair. Leaves hair soft but with hold, good value on Amazon as well. Mild scent, can&#x27;t smell when dry. A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Pantene curl mousse for years and love it so I assumed this curl gel would be equally as good while creating less environmental waste since the mousse goes quick. Not so. This gel is hands down the worst hair product I have ever used. It made my hair feel extremely dry and after sleeping on it one night, it turned my pony tail into one huge dreadlock that took way too much time to comb out in the shower. The mousse, on the other hand, keeps the hair looking great for several days--the hair actually looks better after a few days of using the mousse without washing the hair and even going on some runs makes the hair look better.</li>
            <li> It does leave my hair crusty. On the other hand, it seems to do good job keeping the curls of my hair, and it smells good. I&#x27;ll not be using this though.</li>
            <li> I wish this worked for me as well as it does for all of those that gave it rave reviews.  I have long, naturally curly hair.  It dries out my hair and for some reason creates tons of knots/snarls, to the point that I basically had dreadlocks forming.</li>
            <li> I do like this product for my permed curly hair! Doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy and hard, but looks nice and curly. Not Frizzy!</li>
            <li> Nice non sticky product  quality.  Performance was disappointing on short naturally wavy hair.  For me,  it does little to support or enhance curls.  Will not order again.</li>
            <li> the best gel l have found to hold my curls plus its alcohol free and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair! Amazon offers the best price too! ;)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like my hair to look too crisp and shiny. I was looking for something that would keep my hair in control. When I wash my hair there&#x27;s no tangle which is great. I have wavy hair and works good. My hair looks natural, not processed like when I use hairspray. Great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> not what i expected, made hair crunchy</li>
            <li> The strength of this gel is not as impressive as I was expecting.  My hairs tends to fall flat quickly with this gel.  I think it might work better for somebody who&#x27;s hair is already very curly and healthy.</li>
            <li> nice item, nice seller.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair gel because of my curly hair, this is the kind of styling that I like a lot. My hair are not easy to style and with this, I obtain the result I want.</li>
            <li> Bought these at a great price and love how well it works on my hair. It keeps the shape the way I want it. Great product</li>
            <li> Kind of sticky and thick.  It leaves my curls crunchy.</li>
            <li> Really helps to style hair</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> These keep my curls nice and defined while not making them stiff or crunchy like some other products do.</li>
            <li> Easy extrusion, the smell is very fragrant, very good product</li>
            <li> This gel is amazing!  I use it a couple times a week but my son also uses it to put a Mohawk in his hair and it holds!! It lasts almost all day long,  has a nice smell and I got it for a really good price. All in all is a good product for your money.</li>
            <li> this is a product I use regularly - I am familiar with it - but&lt;br /&gt;the process here was cheaper than anywhere I can get it near&lt;br /&gt;the house  - all is well</li>
            <li> lost all order to monster home fire</li>
            <li> No more curlers or curling irons for me.  I just put a &#x27;nickle size&#x27; amount in my hands and rub it through my wet hair...comb it through, style and &#x27;scrunch&#x27;.  Let it dry, comb it out...and my hair holds it&#x27;s curl and has nice volume.</li>
            <li> the smell of these shampoo is very strong ,sometimes I like it ,sometimes not ,depends on my mood .the effect is OK .</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy and smells nice. It does dry out my hair a bit with every day use but I compensate by using argan oil on the ends after a shower. Otherwise, its perfect for frizzy days.</li>
