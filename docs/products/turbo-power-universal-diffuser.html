            <li>There was no way this would work for me, maybe someone with much more hair and longer.</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it is bulkier than I expected but works perfectly well</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s easily forgivable.</li>
            <li>It was supposed to fit twin turbo dryer snugly and doesn&#x27;t .</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my TwinTurbo hair dryer in hopes that it would fit.</li>
            <li>I purchased another \\&quot;universal\\&quot; diffuser at a beauty supply store but it didnt fit.</li>
            <li>Well, this one didnt fit either.</li>
            <li>The seller is very friendly and helpful and I got my order right away, but if you are hoping this diffuser will fit a TwinTurbo hairdryer</li>
            <li>The supplier sent my item quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>PLEASE do not waste your time and money buying this junk!!!!!</li>
            <li>It snaps right on.</li>
            <li>I love it, my hair actually looks like it does coming out of the salon.</li>
            <li>I have a Twin Turbo 3200 and this definitely does fit on it, you just have to give it a quick push</li>
            <li>It works very well on my wavy hair.</li>
            <li>My sister has very curly hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>The hair dryer on the other hand is fabulous!</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I thought this didn&#x27;t fit at first.</li>
            <li>It even scratched my brand new hair dryer when I tried to insert the diffuser!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>this diffiser indicated it could be used with my new hairdryer...</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the diffuser was returned as it fit just okay for my Turbo 3200</li>
            <li>Please note that it is pretty large and though the picture appears shallow its actually pretty deep.</li>
            <li>The diffuser doesn&#x27;t seem to fit the hairdryer at first (like a lot of the other reviewers say), but if you set it on a hard surface &amp; push down on the hair dryer, then diffuser will lock into place.</li>

            <li> When I pushed down hard enough, it locked in.</li>
            <li> Then, I pushed firmly down, using a table as resistance.</li>
            <li> They told me to put the diffuser on a flat stable surface ( like s table) and push down hard.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> My curls are awakened with this diffuser! Works great with the Turbo Power hair dryer. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The diffuser pops off the dryer every time you use it. It was supposed to fit twin turbo dryer snugly and doesn&#x27;t .</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my TwinTurbo hair dryer in hopes that it would fit. I purchased another \\&quot;universal\\&quot; diffuser at a beauty supply store but it didnt fit. Well, this one didnt fit either. I purchased this one specifically because it claims to work with Turbo hair dryers....and it doesnt. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> The seller is very friendly and helpful and I got my order right away, but if you are hoping this diffuser will fit a TwinTurbo hairdryer it will NOT.  Look at the other review. I don&#x27;t feel like sending it back so lesson learned!!!</li>
            <li> I have a Twin Turbo 3200 and this definitely does fit on it, you just have to give it a quick push so it locks on. It works very well on my wavy hair. It&#x27;s also a snap to remove -- good thing since my husband and I both use the hair dryer and needless to say he does not need the diffuser.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. Please note that it is pretty large and though the picture appears shallow its actually pretty deep. I have very thin and short to medium length hair. There was no way this would work for me, maybe someone with much more hair and longer. Will have to forward as a gift. Didn&#x27;t make sense to return it as it would have cost me over $7 bucks and the product is only $20.</li>
            <li> Product works well. I use it when I style my hair in finger curls wet. The packaging was a little sketchy but the product was in new condition.</li>
            <li> This diffuser perfectly fits my TwinTurbo 3200.  It fits snugly and doesn&#x27;t require a &amp;#34;click in&amp;#34; so there&#x27;s no parts to break off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is bulkier than I expected but works perfectly well so that&#x27;s easily forgivable.</li>
            <li> I have this rating because the product works extremely will with my blowdryer.  I am happy that I bought this product thank you.</li>
            <li> Had the same problem with it not fitting when I first tried it, you just have to push a little harder. I love it, my hair actually looks like it does coming out of the salon.</li>
            <li> Advertised to be compatible with the Turbo Power 3200 but did not fit.  The hair dryer on the other hand is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I like this product, but it falls off the dryer sometimes while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> it fits the dryer perfectly.  My sister has very curly hair and it does a great job.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it on my hair to see if I can wear it curly.</li>
            <li> The supplier sent my item quickly and efficiently. Unfortunately, the diffuser was returned as it fit just okay for my Turbo 3200 and it was so heavy and bulky that it was so difficult to use. I didn&#x27;t see a difference using this diffuser and drying my hair regularly.</li>
            <li> works on both of my hair dryers</li>
            <li> It was suggested to buy this diffuser to go with my twin turbo 3500 but it does not fit on the end. It does however work well with other dryers.</li>
            <li> I have a Turbopower Twin Turbo 3200.  When I received the diffuser I put it on and it kept popping off.  I called Turbopower and they asked me if there were four rectangular rubber prongs on the inside of the diffuser.  I looked inside and there they were.  They told me to put the diffuser on a flat stable surface ( like s table) and push down hard.  When I pushed down hard enough, it locked in. I hope this helps the other two ladies who expresses problems in their reviews</li>
            <li> Purchased the Turbo Power hairdryer... this diffiser indicated it could be used with my new hairdryer... it does not.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this \\&quot;universal\\&quot; diffuser and it did not fit any of my hair dryers. It even scratched my brand new hair dryer when I tried to insert the diffuser! When I tried to return it, it cost triple the price of the diffuser. PLEASE do not waste your time and money buying this junk!!!!!</li>
            <li> Fits on my babyliss. love</li>
            <li> awkward to handle attached to the dryer - too big</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly hair and uses it every time after shower.</li>
            <li> Fits my Twin Turbo perfectly and does NOT pop off during drying!</li>
            <li> I have a TwinTurbo 2800 hairdryer. The diffuser doesn&#x27;t seem to fit the hairdryer at first (like a lot of the other reviewers say), but if you set it on a hard surface &amp; push down on the hair dryer, then diffuser will lock into place. No need to return it!</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I thought this didn&#x27;t fit at first. Then, I pushed firmly down, using a table as resistance. It snaps right on. I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> Does not work for Twin Turbo 2600 Hair Dryer - do not buy it if this is what you have!!!!</li>
            <li> Fits nicely on my Twinturbo 2800 hair dryer and does not pop off during use.</li>
