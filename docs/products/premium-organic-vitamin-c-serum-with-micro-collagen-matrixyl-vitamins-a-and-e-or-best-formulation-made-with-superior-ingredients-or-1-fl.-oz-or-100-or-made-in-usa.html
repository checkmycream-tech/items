            <li> I have used all kinds of products under the sun, but this one is the best I have used bar none. I have combination to dry skin and this serum makes my skin feel like silk. It is not greasy or sticky. I use it once at night then in the morning. A little goes a long way. When I put my make up on. It goes on smoother and my skin feels and looks younger. Love it.</li>

The smell is a little organic like, so my hubby doesn&#x27;t like that part of it, but the smell dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give ZERO stars. This product gave me a terrible, painful itchy rash on my face and neck. The ingredients are in violation of FDA regulations, because they do not list the essential oils individually. Don&#x27;t buy this, it&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> Great product¡ I love it¡&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great anti-aging product! Since starting Leora Vitamin C serum my skin feels plumped and rejuvenated, mg skin tone seems more even and pores are diminished. My face even feels better and any acne that I had is either gone or almost gone. i&#x27;ve had fewer outbreaks since i stardted using this. I will be buying more when this runs out and I have told a friend about it.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about it, I didn&#x27;t notice much change - but when you apply it , the serum felt smooth.</li>
            <li> Best Vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve ever bought! I had those lines on my forehand from not wearing sunglasses and squinting from the sun, well its hard to see them now. Ever since I&#x27;ve started using this product they have been greatly diminished! My skin is smooth and has a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Fantastic serum!. I started using this serum a little over a month ago and I really like it. It&#x27;s definitely better than any of the other products I tried before. I feel like it worked faster and I can actually see results. I have a line on my forehead that I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of and it looks like it&#x27;s going away now.  I&#x27;m happy to finally find a product that actually works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this serum. Just a few drops and your skin is like a velvet. It&#x27;s so great the texture and absorb very fast.  I have been using this for a few days and already can see the changes on my skin. More healthy, less spots, more elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend the product. Great!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought it with http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00II19J0K/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0 for my wife, she loves it. She says it feels great and very light on skin. It is being a great experience and she recommends it!</li>
            <li> I found this vitamin C serum to be extremely effective. I have dark spots and the laugh lines that I had to get rid of. I saw results in less than 2 weeks. I recommended it to some of my friends and they still thank me to this day. I know people look for something that won&#x27;t bother their skin and this is the best product. I would highly recommend this product for regular use.</li>
            <li> This product makes miracles. I am very satisfied with the product and what it does on my skin. I really loved and recommend to any person who wants to have a better skin.</li>
            <li> Works great! Makes the skin smooth and soft. Really has grown on me. Different from other Vitamin C where they&#x27;re more watery and dissipates quickly, this one is more silky. LOVE the smell. Great product! I&#x27;m a skin fanatic so I&#x27;ve tried many products. This is definitely a worthy product. Also, gives you longer time to apply, and more of a skin oil texture where a little goes a long way. This was a free product I tried in exchange but not affecting my reviwe, but I will consider buying it in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now and&lt;br /&gt;I must say my skin looks much brighter and smoother already.&lt;br /&gt;This is a high-quality Vitamin C Serum!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to help ease the aging on my face. This product really works! It has softened the lines around my eyes - they&#x27;ve actually disappeared. The deeper lines have significantly softened. Also lines over my lips are softening. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Smooth as silk!</li>
