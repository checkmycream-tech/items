            <li>Mustella seemed to be working the best, but then eventually irritated his eczema.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t made to be the perfect intensive hydrating formula.</li>
            <li>Go to their websites and determine what best fits your baby&#x27;s needs (or yours).</li>

            <li>and it was awesome.</li>
            <li>I just assumed with all the awesome feedback I had read about this product on its website that it would work for</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s great, but this product wasn&#x27;t made to be the #1 moisturizer</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s great, but this product wasn&#x27;t made to be the #1 moisturizer</li>
            <li>I think it would be great if you had allergic reactions to products</li>
            <li>:/&lt;br /&gt;Not a great product</li>
            <li>This is a great product but it is not what I received.  </li>
            <li>It is great.  </li>
            <li>reviewers and people will say this product doesn&#x27;t moisturize, it doesn&#x27;t feel good</li>
            <li>reviewers and people will say this product doesn&#x27;t moisturize, it doesn&#x27;t feel good</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Regardless the product itself is amazing</li>
            <li>to read what they are all about and then make your own judgmental decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>to read what they are all about and then make your own judgmental decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it on her every morning and after baths--it rubs into her skin nicely.</li>
            <li>It is worth a shot to try something that could in fact make all the difference!!!</li>
            <li>However, for this product I will make an exception since I am overwhelmingly satisfied with the outcome and company.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many many creams and lotions for eczema</li>
            <li>This product is OK.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>My baby&#x27;s skin is so much better since using it.</li>
            <li>She had an eczema flare up on Saturday, and it was better by Monday.</li>
            <li>Its unscented and doesnt contain any irritants as most creams &amp; lotions do.</li>
            <li>If I have the product on my hand already and have to go squeeze out more than I get it all over the tube.  </li>
            <li>That would have been better.</li>
            <li>I will make sure to test everything from now on...</li>
            <li>This did more harm than the eczema.</li>
            <li>I am not usually a reviewer but this cream was so good</li>
            <li>After investing all my free time into finding the cause I was eventually came across Exederm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works the same and we have had great results with it</li>
            <li>you could see swirl marks at the edges of where I had lightly rubbed it on.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because my son (six months old) is fair skinned</li>
            <li>I like the original tub</li>
            <li>We had to completely clean it off of him.</li>
            <li>Almost immediately her skin turned BRIGHT RED where I applied the lotion</li>
            <li>Minutes after I applied it, my face and neck turned bright red and started to itch.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling for four months now and finally found a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling for four months now and finally found a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It burns my daughter skin, but it is effective to clear the eczema.</li>
            <li>My biggest issue with creams I have used before is the oily feeling they leave, but I was pleasantly surprised when I used this the first time that it isn&#x27;t oily and absorbs nicely into the skin.</li>
            <li>I primarily use Exederm on her face and Vanicream moisturizer on her body and the combo works really well.  </li>
            <li>Exederm works nicely for my daughter&#x27;s excema, but it&#x27;s a bit too pricey for me to use consistently as an entire face and body moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t take the time to write a review for any products, even products that I genuinely love.</li>
            <li>Exederm is very creamy, and not as greasy feeling as Vanicream and it seems to absorb quickly into her skin.  </li>
            <li>This product is extremely effective at combating dry, winter skin conditions.</li>
            <li>As she ages it gets slightly better but for the last seven years we have tried just about everything prescription and not.  </li>
            <li>I then researched the National Eczema Associations website and began to find better products which were Aveno extensive care, Cetaphyl, and Mustella.  </li>
            <li>literally could see an immediate difference within the first two days.</li>
            <li>literally could see an immediate difference within the first two days.</li>
            <li>Love the product, only difference is i received a tub instead of a tube.</li>
            <li>Being a first time</li>
            <li>I really recommend trying it!</li>
            <li>irritated his skin more or just kept it the same with no improvement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, if you&#x27;re going to try this stuff, please learn from our mistake and do a patch test first.  </li>
            <li>My 2 year old daughter has mild eczema on her legs and by using this moisturizer after her bath (which I used the Exederm Cleansing Baby Bath)</li>
            <li>him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried the California Baby Super Sensitive and Eczema lines, and the rash is gone.  </li>
            <li>Instead of moisturizing his skin, exederm dried up his skin even more right after the first application.</li>
            <li>This lotion, along side our regular allergy medication routine has truly made a huge difference for my kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it did not provide much moisturising.</li>
            <li>The soap and the intense moisturizer has relieved my dryness and itching.</li>
            <li>so much it bleeds.</li>
            <li>I think I need some products very moist.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to use that way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are first time parents, so please don&#x27;t yell at me and tell me to do test patches with any new product.  </li>
            <li>When we use this all over his body after bath, there seems to be a significant improvement of his skin the next day.</li>
            <li>We first assumed it was an obvious food allergy that was causing his skin to break out, but after several stressful-waited formula trials; we were able to find a miracle in a can, Neocate, this hypo-allergenic milk that worked.</li>
            <li>I have loved and never had any problems with little remedies intense moisturizer and will be going back to that product.</li>
            <li>My little guy seems so much happier now : )</li>
            <li>but then they told me ONLY if product is new with all original packaging</li>
            <li>We are also using it in conjunction with cortisone cream - which we were using with Aquaphor or CeraVe which only seemed to mildly help.</li>
            <li>The main thing is that for MY children it does not cause the burning, stinging, reddening reaction.  </li>
            <li>The older I get, the dryer I get, face, neck and hands.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this for someone with mild eczema.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone who has been struggeling with their babies&#x27; eczema.</li>
            <li>Do your own research, simply look at the ingredients and you&#x27;ll see what all these other products contain.</li>
            <li>Do your own research, simply look at the ingredients and you&#x27;ll see what all these other products contain.</li>
            <li>My DIL is going to try their other products, as well, to help keep baby&#x27;s dry skin more hydrated!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to put her right back in the tub to rinse off lotion because of reactions and tears.  </li>
            <li>and we live in the desert.</li>
            <li>I got this on a whim, hadn&#x27;t tried it yet, and so far I can&#x27;t say enough positive about this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I think that is how it goes when you&#x27;re dealing with sensitive or eczema</li>
            <li>IF you have tried multiple things and not seen any real change or relief</li>
            <li>His eczema was almost gone and his skin was so soft.</li>
            <li>Although they don&#x27;t itch I have been using eczema products on him because he is sensitive to fragrance.</li>
            <li>It says it is for REALLY sensitive skin and that it is ultra hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>I am an adult with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the company directly expressing my concern about the product...</li>
            <li>Although this product said it was for &amp;#34;ultra sensitive skin&amp;#34</li>
            <li>DO NOT USE THIS IF YOUR BABY HAS SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.to try the last product from the national Eczema association to score a 5/5,</li>
            <li>This product was made specifically and only to cater to those who suffer from Eczema, allergies,  dermatitis, sensitive skin, or those who simply don&#x27;t want to apply a whole pile of C*ap on their skin.&lt;br</li>

            <li>On the contrary - it made my daughter break out and have weird blotches all over her beautiful face when she has never had that reaction before to any other lotion!</li>
            <li>I ordered this product based on reviews and followed advise and did small test area on my baby appeared fine then after applying all over body baby broke out in red patches where product was applied.</li>
            <li>Our allergist recommended we try this cream for our 2 year old who has multiple food/environmental allergies and struggles with eczema.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 4-month old granddaughter who&#x27;d had a red rash on her cheeks for over a month.  </li>
            <li>This cream is the only one I have found that has helped my 5 month old&#x27;s ezcema.  </li>
            <li>we live in a very dry climate and I have sensitive skin (although no eczema).</li>
            <li>I tried tons of other creams and nothing helped much.</li>
            <li>Neocate is literally one of the most broken down baby formulas you can buy and not to mention very pricey.</li>
            <li>My 6month old felt more itchy and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>The rough and red spots are slowly but surely going away.  </li>
            <li>Dry skin fixed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Our allergist recommended we try this cream for our 2 year old who has multiple food/environmental allergies and struggles with eczema. When we use this all over his body after bath, there seems to be a significant improvement of his skin the next day. We are also using it in conjunction with cortisone cream - which we were using with Aquaphor or CeraVe which only seemed to mildly help. We like exederm. I even like it for my face - we live in a very dry climate and I have sensitive skin (although no eczema).</li>
            <li> The cream just didn&#x27;t work for my baby..Instead of moisturizing his skin, exederm dried up his skin even more right after the first application. My 6month old felt more itchy and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> What I can see from the other reviews is that you either love this or hate it.  I think that is how it goes when you&#x27;re dealing with sensitive or eczema skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have three children all of which have some level of eczema.  My oldest has it the worst.  As she ages it gets slightly better but for the last seven years we have tried just about everything prescription and not.  Lotions that people swear by caused the immediate reddening and stinging reaction that others have said this does.  I&#x27;ve had to put her right back in the tub to rinse off lotion because of reactions and tears.  If it&#x27;s on the shelf we&#x27;ve probably tried it.  I got this on a whim, hadn&#x27;t tried it yet, and so far I can&#x27;t say enough positive about this lotion.  The main thing is that for MY children it does not cause the burning, stinging, reddening reaction.  My kids actually sleep through the night now because of this lotion.  The rough and red spots are slowly but surely going away.  The itching is less and less.  This lotion, along side our regular allergy medication routine has truly made a huge difference for my kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I completely understand the heartbreak of having little ones and there is just nothing you can do to make their itching and pain go away.  I completely understand and sympathize with the other mothers that reviewed that said it caused their little ones pain because eczema truly is a case by case basis.  IF you have tried multiple things and not seen any real change or relief I do suggest you try this.  Will it help your little one?  Maybe!  It is worth a shot to try something that could in fact make all the difference!!!</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t take the time to write a review for any products, even products that I genuinely love. However, for this product I will make an exception since I am overwhelmingly satisfied with the outcome and company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off by saying my son is currently five months old and for the past three months he&#x27;s had severe eczema. We first assumed it was an obvious food allergy that was causing his skin to break out, but after several stressful-waited formula trials; we were able to find a miracle in a can, Neocate, this hypo-allergenic milk that worked. Neocate is literally one of the most broken down baby formulas you can buy and not to mention very pricey. So you could imagine my stress once my son&#x27;s eczema began to resurface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dreadful and much hated eczema randomly began to populate the back of his thighs, both arms, cheeks, and the back of his ears. He was miserable and constantly itching and crying. At this point I had enough and immediately began to research eczema like a mad man. After investing all my free time into finding the cause I was eventually came across Exederm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve tried every moisturizer, cream, oil, soap, shampoo, intensive moisturizer, and even ointment&#x27;s just to be upset over and over again. I&#x27;ve been disappointed by Johnson&#x27;s, Aveno, Aquaphor, and every other company out there. All these products contained some sort of oil, fragrance, or chemical that was harmful to my poor son&#x27;s skin. I then researched the National Eczema Associations website and began to find better products which were Aveno extensive care, Cetaphyl, and Mustella.  They all contained some sort of potentially harmful ingredient or irritant. Mustella seemed to be working the best, but then eventually irritated his eczema. I read the ingredients and saw that it contained Almond oil along with some other oils in there that can irritate eczema. I immediately stopped using Mustella (Which scored a 5/5 on the NEA website) and decided to try the last product from the national Eczema association to score a 5/5, Exederm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally could see an immediate difference within the first two days. His skin stopped inflating and slowly began to get lighter and lighter. I&#x27;ve been applying the cream, using the soap, and using the bath oil. Within two weeks his eczema was almost non-existent. I&#x27;ve been struggling for four months now and finally found a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers and people will say this product doesn&#x27;t moisturize, it doesn&#x27;t feel good, it goes on weird, it has a weird consistency, and all of the above. That&#x27;s great, but this product wasn&#x27;t made to be the #1 moisturizer and it wasn&#x27;t made to be the perfect intensive hydrating formula. This product was made specifically and only to cater to those who suffer from Eczema, allergies,  dermatitis, sensitive skin, or those who simply don&#x27;t want to apply a whole pile of C*ap on their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I can&#x27;t speak for everyone, but I can say for us this company has been a miracle. Do your own research, simply look at the ingredients and you&#x27;ll see what all these other products contain. Go to their websites and determine what best fits your baby&#x27;s needs (or yours). Visit, Exederm. com or the National Eczema Association to read what they are all about and then make your own judgmental decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have read this and you are a parent going through the same heart ache that I endured; TRY THIS PRODUCT OUT NOW!

            <li> *WARNING*  this product burned both my son and I.    When I tried to contact their customer service at their location in Basking Ridge, NJ (973) 615-1739 no one answered after repeated calls after 9:30 on a Tuesday morning and no one returned my calls.      I&#x27;ve used many many creams and lotions for eczema and I have NEVER had any sort of reaction like this.  There must be something wrong here.  It literally is still burning after I washed myself and my son off.    WORST EXPERIENCE EVER</li>
            <li> This product is OK. It did not irrate me which is a plus. However, it did not provide much moisturising. After applying the product it would create a coating that would \\&quot;pill\\&quot; off your body if you rubbed it again. I think it would be great if you had allergic reactions to products but I feel it did not help ease eczema condition.</li>
            <li> My son had bad, painful eczema on his legs. I tried tons of other creams and nothing helped much. I finally tired this cream when a friend recommend it to me and it was awesome. I noticed a big difference the next day. His eczema was almost gone and his skin was so soft. I am not usually a reviewer but this cream was so good I had to share!</li>
            <li> The older I get, the dryer I get, face, neck and hands. I buy the baby version because it is cheaper. The soap and the intense moisturizer has relieved my dryness and itching. I&#x27;ve  tried the expensive  creams that are recommended.  But this worked for me when none  of those did.</li>
            <li> Love the product, only difference is i received a tub instead of a tube. Regardless the product itself is amazing and I&#x27;m so glad I bought it. My sons eczema cleared in 2 days with this and the wash.</li>
            <li> My son is 2 and has really bad eczema, sometimes he gets to scratching it so much it bleeds. So I needed something that would actually hydrate his skin. My biggest issue with creams I have used before is the oily feeling they leave, but I was pleasantly surprised when I used this the first time that it isn&#x27;t oily and absorbs nicely into the skin. It has also been approved by the National Eczema Association as having their seal of acceptance, meaning it doesn&#x27;t have any ingredients that will irritate the skin or make the eczema worse. My only complaint is that our tube had burst at the seal in the packaging during shipping so some of the cream was wasted.</li>
            <li> I think this product works only in moist area. Although it has no fragrance or  chemicals,  it&#x27;s too dry.  It&#x27;s so hard to smear over the face. My baby&#x27;s face will be dry again after an hour and we live in the desert. I think I need some products very moist. This one is way too dry.</li>
            <li> It burns my daughter skin, but it is effective to clear the eczema. :/&lt;br /&gt;Not a great product</li>
            <li> My Baby had really bad eczema and I decided to try this after seeing it at the store. Being a first time Mom, I mistakenly did not test an area of her skin before applying it all over her rough patches on both cheeks. Almost immediately her skin turned BRIGHT RED where I applied the lotion and she started screaming! Same thing happened to other reviewers. Probably not good for very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4-month old granddaughter who&#x27;d had a red rash on her cheeks for over a month.  With several daily applications on red scaly patches, this works well to keep her eczema at bay.  My DIL is going to try their other products, as well, to help keep baby&#x27;s dry skin more hydrated!  I really recommend trying it!</li>
            <li> Little boy has eczema. No luck with this product. But we didn&#x27;t have luck with any creams we bought. Might work might not.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! My baby&#x27;s skin is so much better since using it. She had an eczema flare up on Saturday, and it was better by Monday. I use it on her every morning and after baths--it rubs into her skin nicely.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old daughter has mild eczema on her legs and by using this moisturizer after her bath (which I used the Exederm Cleansing Baby Bath) her irritation has decreased significantly in only a week. I would definitely recommend this for someone with mild eczema. We tried all kinds of other lotions that were supposed to &#x27;soothe&#x27; but none worked as well as this one.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that doesn&#x27;t break out my lil ones skin!</li>
            <li> This cream is the only one I have found that has helped my 5 month old&#x27;s ezcema.  Every other product(and I have tried alot!) irritated his skin more or just kept it the same with no improvement. After one day of using this cream I could see an improvement on his cheeks and arms &amp; legs. The price is a little high for 3 oz.  but I would probably pay $100 a jar for this cream! Its unscented and doesnt contain any irritants as most creams &amp; lotions do. I highly recommend this for anyone who has been struggeling with their babies&#x27; eczema. I know how frustrating it can be. My little guy seems so much happier now : )</li>
            <li> This is a great product but it is not what I received.  I was sent a squeeze tube.  It works the same and we have had great results with it but I just don&#x27;t like having to squeeze a tube.  If I have the product on my hand already and have to go squeeze out more than I get it all over the tube.  I like the original tub that I could just scoop it out and put on my son.  I would recommend the product itself though.  It is great.  I just wish they hadn&#x27;t switched the container.  Or at least put it in something with a pump.  That would have been better.</li>
            <li> Exederm works nicely for my daughter&#x27;s excema, but it&#x27;s a bit too pricey for me to use consistently as an entire face and body moisturizer.  I primarily use Exederm on her face and Vanicream moisturizer on her body and the combo works really well.  Exederm is very creamy, and not as greasy feeling as Vanicream and it seems to absorb quickly into her skin.  Some parents have complained about it causing irritation, so I did the recommended test treatment on her inside wrist and a little on her leg to see if she had a bad reaction, which she didn&#x27;t.  One thing I do not like is that Exederm comes in a jar, not a convenient pump.  I just cleaned out a small pump style lotion container and dumped the Exederm into a ziplock bag and squeezed the contents into the pump container.  It&#x27;s much easier to use that way.</li>
            <li> My son has dry patches through out his body. Although they don&#x27;t itch I have been using eczema products on him because he is sensitive to fragrance. This product did not help one bit. I contacted them and they didn&#x27;t even bother to respond. Aveeno baby therapy bath is what I am bathing him with and it seems subdue the dryness, and I&#x27;m using aquaphor for moisturizing. Also Eucerin, although that&#x27;s for adults.</li>
            <li> This lotion is really a strange product. It says it is for REALLY sensitive skin and that it is ultra hypoallergenic. On the contrary - it made my daughter break out and have weird blotches all over her beautiful face when she has never had that reaction before to any other lotion! I would not recommend this as it obviously has some strangeness about it. I have loved and never had any problems with little remedies intense moisturizer and will be going back to that product. I would never have bought this Exederm stuff except that I was on vacation and had run out of little remedies. Exederm gets a thumbs down.</li>
            <li> A really terrible product. I am an adult with sensitive skin.  Minutes after I applied it, my face and neck turned bright red and started to itch.  I contacted the company directly expressing my concern about the product...specifically, my concern that the product might have been contaminated since it is intended for babies.  Response was disappointing especially since it is intended for babies.  Simply said to return product at no cost for refund...</li>
            <li> This product is extremely effective at combating dry, winter skin conditions. It lasts 24 hours and the texture is like whipped butter, although it&#x27;s not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> We put this on our 4 month olds cheek to try and treat his excema patches. Big mistake. Within minutes he had broken out into a big red rash anywhere the lotion touched. We had to completely clean it off of him. The redness went away after and hour or so. Waste of money for us. I will make sure to test everything from now on... Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my son (six months old) is fair skinned like I am--we&#x27;re both redheads--and he had dry skin on his face and a bit of a rash.  All of the old standbys that everyone recommends, like Aquaphor &amp; Aveeno, just made it worse.  So I purchased this, thinking it would be heaven-sent.  Boy, was I wrong.  I put it on his face on the affected areas, and started looking for my purse and keys and whatnot to go to the store.  My husband called me into the living room, and when I looked at him (our son), I was aghast--everywhere I had applied the cream was beet red.  I mean, it was to the point where you could actually see a line where I had applied it to his face and run my finger down onto his neck with the cream on it--you could see swirl marks at the edges of where I had lightly rubbed it on.  Scared the crap out of both of us, to say the least.  We washed it off immediately, and the redness began fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are first time parents, so please don&#x27;t yell at me and tell me to do test patches with any new product.  We do that religiously now. We both felt absolutely horrible about it.  I just assumed with all the awesome feedback I had read about this product on its website that it would work for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried the California Baby Super Sensitive and Eczema lines, and the rash is gone.  Dry skin fixed.  A little bit of redness immediately after application, but the pedi said it&#x27;s just from the friction of applying it.  Problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re going to try this stuff, please learn from our mistake and do a patch test first.  It may work for your child--as I said, our son&#x27;s skin is extremely sensitive (i.e., we can only use ONE brand of diapers, and ANY deviation from that results in a TERRIBLE rash).  But it did not work for ours.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on reviews and followed advise and did small test area on my baby appeared fine then after applying all over body baby broke out in red patches where product was applied. I tried to return product as they said they take returns but then they told me ONLY if product is new with all original packaging how can I know I did not like product if I did not test it which would require me to open it  which would only make sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed seller and told them I only used 1/2 dime size of the product and since it made my baby skin break out I would like a refund then again told me \\&quot;sorry you need to contact the manufacture\\&quot;  for a refund.  I would not order from this company because they do NOT stand behind their products and their return policy I do not agree with if I did not open product and try it how would I know or anyone else know if it works. I recommend finding another seller who sells this item a seller that will stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> Although this product said it was for &amp;#34;ultra sensitive skin&amp;#34; it made my baby break out in red splotches! Being a curious mom I put some on my face to try it.. it burned to the point I had to wash my face. DO NOT USE THIS IF YOUR BABY HAS SENSITIVE SKIN. This did more harm than the eczema.</li>
