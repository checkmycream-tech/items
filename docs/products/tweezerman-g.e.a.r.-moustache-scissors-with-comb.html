            <li>Good Value</li>
            <li>The scissors do the job, but they are not quite as good as a superior pair of mustache scissors I already have in the drawer.</li>
            <li>This is a good addition for your grooming needs.</li>
            <li>The comb is also good quality, but not helpful to me.</li>
            <li>I also feel this is a unique gift and perfect as a wedding party gift etc.</li>
            <li>The scissors are very good and are available on Amazon also.</li>

            <li>B000EMUC3E Tweezerman  Deluxe Men&#x27;s Grooming Kit]], came in a kit for a stocking stuffer that included tweezers, fingernail clipper and pocket nail file (but not a comb).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Trimming and grooming is very easy.</li>
            <li>Use the kind of oil you use for razors, not just any oil, and just wipe with a very light coating before storing.  </li>
            <li>Use the kind of oil you use for razors, not just any oil, and just wipe with a very light coating before storing.  </li>
            <li>They cut smoothly and they do a good job, but they are not fancy.</li>
            <li>The Tweezerman is by far the best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The especially fine comb is excellent for separating hairs and is a little nicer than I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They have a very fine serration cut into the blades which the maker says allows the scissors to hold the hair for a better cut.  </li>
            <li>This gives it a very precise feel.</li>
            <li>I do my eyebrows with the scissors and they are very precise.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>that was better than my Swiss Army</li>
            <li>OK, I admit..</li>
            <li>I love the scissors and my husband loves the comb.</li>
            <li>I want to buy what&#x27;s proven to work the best and last the longest: Tweezerman.</li>
            <li>This Italian tool is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>The comb is nice, too, but nothing special</li>
            <li>The comb (plastic and fairly sturdy) really is the key to this system and is best used in tandem with the scissors.  </li>
            <li>We have a very full moustache in this household which belongs to a Shih Tzu.  </li>
            <li>Would have been better had this come with even a cheap carrying case, just a plastic one with a zipper.</li>
            <li>They are great for all types of facial hair and are quick and easy to use.ck layers to shape up a hairstyle with great success.  </li>
            <li>These are great scissors, really cut clean and smooth without catching/pulling any hairs.</li>
            <li>Perfect, sharp, and easy to use, although the comb is rubbish</li>
            <li>my goatee for about 20 years and in that time have used many items to try and maintain the look and clean lines.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The well made and easy to use scissors</li>
            <li>Easy to handle, and gets the job done well.</li>
            <li>It works well and is easy to hold in either hand.  </li>
            <li>very pleased they work very well,thanks</li>
            <li>These are good quality scissors, better quality than most local pharmacies carry.</li>
            <li>Even the tips cut smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li>I guess I should  have read the fine print.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for fine tuning after trimming my beard with an electric trimmer with a length attachment.</li>
            <li>then they offered this nifty little set, which is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I have huge hands</li>
            <li>This allows for a great cut from any direction, which is important when dealing with facial</li>
            <li>What a great simple kit to keep your mustache in check.</li>
            <li>The scissors are comfortable in his had.</li>
            <li>I only use them to trim fly-a-way rouge hairs and they work great for this.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>But overall the quality is good and I would consider this grand again.</li>
            <li>They are great for all types of facial hair and are quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason I took a star off was because I recently tried out a pair of sanguine mustache scissors, and for $10 more you get a much higher quality scissor, that works great for trimming beard lines as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You need to make sure to wipe the blades off FIRST before applying oil to remove stray hairs and any dampness</li>
            <li>You need to make sure to wipe the blades off FIRST before applying oil to remove stray hairs and any dampness</li>
            <li>Scissors seem good quality and well made, but they are not very sharp.</li>
            <li>Very good Product, very sharp</li>
            <li>I received these as a gift over a year ago and I have to commend Tweezerman for making an excellent, precision pair of scissors that have retained sharpness the whole length to the tip even with light use on things other than hair.</li>
            <li>Comb is cheap, but adequate.</li>
            <li>used these scissors and comb to cut unruly brows back, beard hair, moustache hair, sideburns, and even trim some quick layers to shape up a hairstyle with great success.  </li>
            <li>The men in my family range in size from medium to large hands and all were able to use these well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>made a beautiful STRAIGHT line along my upper lip and along my chin.</li>
            <li>cool thing: micro-serrations on the scissors grip hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;The comb is very fine, and is great for beards that aren&#x27;t as thick as others.</li>
            <li>Pretty easy review here.  </li>
            <li>Great sharp scissors for precision trimming.</li>
            <li>Comb is flimsy but the scissors are adequate</li>
            <li>Great mustache and beard scissor, I&#x27;ve used it multiple times and the blades are super sharp and makes it very easy to clean up your beard/mustache.</li>
            <li>Perfect for trimming my beard and mustache, scissors are sharp and comb is just fine enough.  </li>
            <li>Great quality scissors, very sharp, even the very tip will cut a fine hair.</li>
            <li>These little scissors are great.</li>
            <li>Great for little touch-ups between groomings.</li>
            <li>The comb and scissors make it so much easier to precisely trim sideburns and bangs/faceframe.  </li>
            <li>Rounded tips are better for scissors you use near</li>
            <li>All in all this is a nice set to have in your army of facial hair grooming tools.</li>
            <li>I prefer rounded-tip scissors, which are just as useful, but safer to use around my nose, ears, etc.</li>
            <li>Just an overall great pair of scissors to do general hair cleanup!</li>
            <li>sharp and has a good snip.</li>
            <li>The comb pulls the hairs down nicely and the scissors are sharp and have a nice grip to get a nice straight line across.</li>
            <li>They do the job at the right price</li>
            <li>Both comb and scissors are just the right size.</li>
            <li>scissors are very sharp for a nice precise cut.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it cut precisely, it&#x27;s easy and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After going through numerous cheap hair scissors and finding they all pull, it&#x27;s great to get a sharp pair that doesn&#x27;t pinch/pull.  </li>
            <li>and was met only with moderately successful results as the blade is somewhat curved making a straight line near impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d imagine there are better german-made scissors out there, but these scissors are very sharp and do the job just fine with no hairs missed or issues with trimming.  </li>
            <li>Through most of the winter months I maintain a very short beard.  </li>
            <li>Bought for son who lost the first set, and needed it again.  </li>
            <li>The first, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>jumped on the chance to replace the scissors from that first kit.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;These scissors came well oiled, and I would suggest that you keep them oiled as well- to keep them functioning at top level for future use.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;These scissors came well oiled, and I would suggest that you keep them oiled as well- to keep them functioning at top level for future use.  </li>
            <li>These are pretty well exactly what you&#x27;d expect.  </li>
            <li>have no major issues with this combo, but it does seem as if the comb has limited use and you might be better off just purchasing the scissors on their own at a cheaper price.  </li>
            <li>It is great for dogs as well as humans, especially since just the last section of the fingers comfortably slip into the small handles, thereby allowing better control of the dog.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent combination of a super fine-tooth comb and a pair of small but well crafted and extremely sharp scissors.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I see these more as something to augment or fine tune whatever you&#x27;re already using or to take on smaller jobs like eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a very nice small pair of Tweezerman scissors, and a completely normal comb.</li>
            <li>The scissors are very sharp and cut precisely and easily.</li>
            <li>On her face, the eye area and area above the mouth require the most attention, so I really needed a good pair or small, sharp, safe scissors which would withstand weekly use at a minimum.  </li>
            <li>This scissor has a nice friction feel as soon as the blades are half crossed, with a release toward the end of closing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides my preference of no more jokes about safety tips, he prefers the grips of this pair and says they are more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>That means that they are easy to use and move around different locations of the face while being well balanced.  </li>
            <li>It is large enough not to get lost easily.</li>
            <li>The small scissors are sharp and the comb it the perfect size.</li>
            <li>They appear to be very high quality and well made.  </li>
            <li>Comb could be a little finer but overall a great purchase.</li>
            <li>Super sharp and extremely accurate.</li>
            <li>I compared the comb to the fine-tooth combs that are available everywhere, and they are the same width and distance apart.  </li>
            <li>It grips the hair very well for directional grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They grip and cut very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>I thought this was much fancier than it ended up being.</li>
            <li>My husband likes the comb because it has a lot of bristles and gets his mustache straight.</li>
            <li>The comb is a real plus as well.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I think this works very well.  </li>
            <li>This means the scissors require too much force to close.  </li>
            <li>They are made stainless steel, well-finished and with an adjustable screw.  </li>
            <li>These are for cutting moustache hair specifically, so that is excellent to get the job</li>
            <li>scissors are very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>Especially with such a nice pair of scissors.</li>
            <li>Although I would not recommend these for cutting hair on a regular basis (as in hair style on head), they do great in a pinch and work quickly and easily to cut through hair for a fast shape</li>
            <li>Although I would not recommend these for cutting hair on a regular basis (as in hair style on head), they do great in a pinch and work quickly and easily to cut through hair for a fast shape</li>
            <li>I typically use a rechargeable beard trimmer which works well most of the time, but it also easily misses hairs and when the power gets low it pulls hair like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the price, you can&#x27;t ask for better scissors.&lt;br /&gt;The blade came sharp, and cuts perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love the size of the comb compared to the other one he has.</li>
            <li>Where my mustache meets my lip, I have always used a small scissors to create a nice straight line.</li>
            <li>You can save yourself the trouble though by just buying a mustache comb and different scissors :o)</li>
            <li>The scissors are of high quality and work very well.  </li>
            <li>Ok product, the comb was slightly disfigured from packaging, didn&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li>only caveat that I found with these is that the scissors are noticeably shorter than your standard haircutting scissors which makes them more targeted to (of course) things like mustaches or eyebrows, where you are going to cut fewer hairs at once in order to ensure precision cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>However, you should know that it is not quite that clever.</li>
            <li>The comb is small and is perfect for those small area needs.</li>
            <li>(compared to most of the super super expensive Tweezerman tweezers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are easy to work with and the finger holes are large enough to accommodate most fingers, although I am thinking that men with extra large fingers might have some trouble manipulating these well.</li>
            <li>the other hand, the little come that comes with them is great and what kept me from returning the scissors.  </li>
            <li>If you or your man is like me it is always good to have a variety of tools to tame the facial hair.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman makes consistently high quality products that feel substantial and are well designed.</li>
            <li>You are paying a little more for quality</li>
            <li>The tiny comb will straighten the hairs, then the sharp small scissors will give you a perfect trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While the old ones functioned fine, there&#x27;s been an eight year long running joke that they are made like kid&#x27;s safety scissors with blunted ends</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scissors are sharp, easy to hold, cuts hair without any pulling or ripping.</li>
            <li>They are so, sharp but the point is easy to manipulate so as to not endanger her eyes.  </li>
            <li>use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The traditional moustache grooming comb is under five inches long, with fine, smooth teeth and a curved back and handle.  </li>
            <li>This is a little challenging, as the scissors are not blunt at the end, but their small size and sharpness lets me be very precise.  </li>
            <li>The scissors are sharp and accurate.</li>
            <li>The comb is pretty useless, you should invest in a nice wood comb if you really care about your stash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good, sharp little scisors.</li>
            <li>For fun I did a few cuts &#x27;free hand&#x27; only using the scissors after combing; on another section (along my chin) used the comb and scissors together to try and control the height of the cut.</li>
            <li>kit comes with a pretty run-of-the mill moustache comb, but it does the job for all kinds of facial hair- brows, beards, sideburns, as well as moustache</li>
            <li>The length of the blades are also good that they not too long so as to make them hard to use and angle around your face.</li>
            <li>This is a fine little kit.  </li>
            <li>I had nothing but a razor and this only helps with around the mustache more or less.  </li>
            <li>Most recently I was using little scissors swiped from my wife&#x27;s vanity</li>
            <li>like that the scissors cut cleanly without pulling, which was an issue with the previous scissors I used for these</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned I have tried nearly everything to maintain my goatee.</li>
            <li>have no use for the comb, but these scissors have been quite useful, although not exactly as hoped.  </li>
            <li>Comb works well, is small, fine toothed.</li>
            <li>Scissors are sharp, comb is just the right size for your mustache, but will also work for sideburns and around the ear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the brush is also comfortable to use &amp; compact enough that you can really get in &amp; trim done of those hard to get spots.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are still solid scissors, but for self care, the stabilizer handle makes a big difference, and in my opinion, worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>The comb is just the right size and the scissors are really sharp!  </li>
            <li>The scissors cut very well and are well made plus the comb is not to small and sharp and it&#x27;s easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>Extremely sharp, very well made!</li>
            <li>With my old scissors the hairs sometimes would slide along the blade before getting cut which made an uneven look that I had to keep fiddling with to get right.  </li>
            <li>The scissors a very sharp and just the right size for getting those hairs growing into your mouth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m average size with large hands and my fingers barely fit into the small area designed for the thumb and finger.</li>
            <li>The blades move very tightly but smoothly against each other for the top two thirds of the blades, and are plenty tight for the last third.  </li>
            <li>The little comb is an added bonus for combing the hairs between her eyes and nose, the most tender area of her little squish face.  </li>
            <li>These scissors are very high quality and sharp.  </li>
            <li>The overall size is small enough for traveling yet comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li>The comb, on the other hand, not so much, but that&#x27;s probably because he&#x27;s been doing without all this time.</li>
            <li>The blades curve together to create a sharp cut, but they curve too much.  </li>
            <li>Extra large fingers or fat fingers will fit uncomfortably.</li>
            <li>For general haircutting, though, avoid these and get the ones that are standard length.</li>
            <li>They are a little over four inches long, just the right size for grooming facial hair.  </li>
            <li>I have been trimming my husbands mustache for him and it is a much easier job with these little scissors and comb.</li>

            <li> The comb is the perfect size.</li>
            <li> The comb is perfect for a moustache (sic)...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li> The Tweezerman GEAR is the perfect combination for trimming around the mustache as well as taming the length of the layers.  </li>

            <li> They cut hair excellently.  </li>
            <li> The comb is also perfect for combing the hairs in her ears which I need to remove regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Nice scissors and comb!  </li>
            <li> and it is wonderful for really fine tuning your mustache and or beard</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d recommend them as a good addition to your grooming products.  </li>
            <li> My dad loved this set.</li>
            <li> Good Value</li>
            <li> The scissors do the job, but they are not quite as good as a superior pair of mustache scissors I already have in the drawer.</li>
            <li> This is a good addition for your grooming needs.</li>
            <li> The comb is also good quality, but not helpful to me.</li>
            <li> I also feel this is a unique gift and perfect as a wedding party gift etc.</li>
            <li> The scissors are very good and are available on Amazon also.</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that these scissors perform in an outstanding fashion and I regret not thinking of using moustache scissors before now.  </li>
            <li> This set of comb and scissors are good quality and work quite nicely for both my husband and me.  </li>
            <li> This was moderately successful but I am getting better at this with practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, made with stainless steel!</li>
            <li> I love Tweezerman products!</li>
            <li> The quaility is amazing.</li>
            <li> Ordered it for my husband and the scissor is amazing</li>
            <li> It provides a nice finish to keep the mustache in order and not overflowing into my my mouth when eating.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a nice feature.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set.  </li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> Otherwise this is a nice compact set designed for home or travel.</li>
            <li> B000EMUC3E Tweezerman  Deluxe Men&#x27;s Grooming Kit]], came in a kit for a stocking stuffer that included tweezers, fingernail clipper and pocket nail file (but not a comb).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Trimming and grooming is very easy.</li>
            <li> Use the kind of oil you use for razors, not just any oil, and just wipe with a very light coating before storing.  </li>
            <li> Use the kind of oil you use for razors, not just any oil, and just wipe with a very light coating before storing.  </li>
            <li> They cut smoothly and they do a good job, but they are not fancy.</li>
            <li> The Tweezerman is by far the best.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The especially fine comb is excellent for separating hairs and is a little nicer than I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They have a very fine serration cut into the blades which the maker says allows the scissors to hold the hair for a better cut.  </li>
            <li> This gives it a very precise feel.</li>
            <li> I do my eyebrows with the scissors and they are very precise.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> that was better than my Swiss Army</li>
            <li> OK, I admit..</li>
            <li> I love the scissors and my husband loves the comb.</li>
            <li> I want to buy what&#x27;s proven to work the best and last the longest: Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> This Italian tool is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> The comb is nice, too, but nothing special</li>
            <li> The comb (plastic and fairly sturdy) really is the key to this system and is best used in tandem with the scissors.  </li>
            <li> We have a very full moustache in this household which belongs to a Shih Tzu.  </li>
            <li> Would have been better had this come with even a cheap carrying case, just a plastic one with a zipper.</li>
            <li> They are great for all types of facial hair and are quick and easy to use.ck layers to shape up a hairstyle with great success.  </li>
            <li> These are great scissors, really cut clean and smooth without catching/pulling any hairs.</li>
            <li> Perfect, sharp, and easy to use, although the comb is rubbish</li>
            <li> my goatee for about 20 years and in that time have used many items to try and maintain the look and clean lines.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The well made and easy to use scissors</li>
            <li> Easy to handle, and gets the job done well.</li>
            <li> It works well and is easy to hold in either hand.  </li>
            <li> very pleased they work very well,thanks</li>
            <li> These are good quality scissors, better quality than most local pharmacies carry.</li>
            <li> Even the tips cut smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li> I guess I should  have read the fine print.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for fine tuning after trimming my beard with an electric trimmer with a length attachment.</li>
            <li> then they offered this nifty little set, which is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I have huge hands</li>
            <li> This allows for a great cut from any direction, which is important when dealing with facial</li>
            <li> What a great simple kit to keep your mustache in check.</li>
            <li> The scissors are comfortable in his had.</li>
            <li> I only use them to trim fly-a-way rouge hairs and they work great for this.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> But overall the quality is good and I would consider this grand again.</li>
            <li> They are great for all types of facial hair and are quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I took a star off was because I recently tried out a pair of sanguine mustache scissors, and for $10 more you get a much higher quality scissor, that works great for trimming beard lines as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You need to make sure to wipe the blades off FIRST before applying oil to remove stray hairs and any dampness</li>
            <li> You need to make sure to wipe the blades off FIRST before applying oil to remove stray hairs and any dampness</li>
            <li> Scissors seem good quality and well made, but they are not very sharp.</li>
            <li> Very good Product, very sharp</li>
            <li> I received these as a gift over a year ago and I have to commend Tweezerman for making an excellent, precision pair of scissors that have retained sharpness the whole length to the tip even with light use on things other than hair.</li>
            <li> Comb is cheap, but adequate.</li>
            <li> used these scissors and comb to cut unruly brows back, beard hair, moustache hair, sideburns, and even trim some quick layers to shape up a hairstyle with great success.  </li>
            <li> The men in my family range in size from medium to large hands and all were able to use these well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> made a beautiful STRAIGHT line along my upper lip and along my chin.</li>
            <li> cool thing: micro-serrations on the scissors grip hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;The comb is very fine, and is great for beards that aren&#x27;t as thick as others.</li>
            <li> Pretty easy review here.  </li>
            <li> Great sharp scissors for precision trimming.</li>
            <li> Comb is flimsy but the scissors are adequate</li>
            <li> Great mustache and beard scissor, I&#x27;ve used it multiple times and the blades are super sharp and makes it very easy to clean up your beard/mustache.</li>
            <li> Perfect for trimming my beard and mustache, scissors are sharp and comb is just fine enough.  </li>
            <li> Great quality scissors, very sharp, even the very tip will cut a fine hair.</li>
            <li> These little scissors are great.</li>
            <li> Great for little touch-ups between groomings.</li>
            <li> The comb and scissors make it so much easier to precisely trim sideburns and bangs/faceframe.  </li>
            <li> Rounded tips are better for scissors you use near</li>
            <li> All in all this is a nice set to have in your army of facial hair grooming tools.</li>
            <li> I prefer rounded-tip scissors, which are just as useful, but safer to use around my nose, ears, etc.</li>
            <li> Just an overall great pair of scissors to do general hair cleanup!</li>
            <li> sharp and has a good snip.</li>
            <li> The comb pulls the hairs down nicely and the scissors are sharp and have a nice grip to get a nice straight line across.</li>
            <li> They do the job at the right price</li>
            <li> Both comb and scissors are just the right size.</li>
            <li> scissors are very sharp for a nice precise cut.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it cut precisely, it&#x27;s easy and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After going through numerous cheap hair scissors and finding they all pull, it&#x27;s great to get a sharp pair that doesn&#x27;t pinch/pull.  </li>
            <li> and was met only with moderately successful results as the blade is somewhat curved making a straight line near impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d imagine there are better german-made scissors out there, but these scissors are very sharp and do the job just fine with no hairs missed or issues with trimming.  </li>
            <li> Through most of the winter months I maintain a very short beard.  </li>
            <li> Bought for son who lost the first set, and needed it again.  </li>
            <li> The first, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> jumped on the chance to replace the scissors from that first kit.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;These scissors came well oiled, and I would suggest that you keep them oiled as well- to keep them functioning at top level for future use.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;These scissors came well oiled, and I would suggest that you keep them oiled as well- to keep them functioning at top level for future use.  </li>
            <li> These are pretty well exactly what you&#x27;d expect.  </li>
            <li> have no major issues with this combo, but it does seem as if the comb has limited use and you might be better off just purchasing the scissors on their own at a cheaper price.  </li>
            <li> It is great for dogs as well as humans, especially since just the last section of the fingers comfortably slip into the small handles, thereby allowing better control of the dog.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent combination of a super fine-tooth comb and a pair of small but well crafted and extremely sharp scissors.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I see these more as something to augment or fine tune whatever you&#x27;re already using or to take on smaller jobs like eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a very nice small pair of Tweezerman scissors, and a completely normal comb.</li>
            <li> The scissors are very sharp and cut precisely and easily.</li>
            <li> On her face, the eye area and area above the mouth require the most attention, so I really needed a good pair or small, sharp, safe scissors which would withstand weekly use at a minimum.  </li>
            <li> This scissor has a nice friction feel as soon as the blades are half crossed, with a release toward the end of closing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides my preference of no more jokes about safety tips, he prefers the grips of this pair and says they are more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> That means that they are easy to use and move around different locations of the face while being well balanced.  </li>
            <li> It is large enough not to get lost easily.</li>
            <li> The small scissors are sharp and the comb it the perfect size.</li>
            <li> They appear to be very high quality and well made.  </li>
            <li> Comb could be a little finer but overall a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and extremely accurate.</li>
            <li> I compared the comb to the fine-tooth combs that are available everywhere, and they are the same width and distance apart.  </li>
            <li> It grips the hair very well for directional grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They grip and cut very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> I thought this was much fancier than it ended up being.</li>
            <li> My husband likes the comb because it has a lot of bristles and gets his mustache straight.</li>
            <li> The comb is a real plus as well.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I think this works very well.  </li>
            <li> This means the scissors require too much force to close.  </li>
            <li> They are made stainless steel, well-finished and with an adjustable screw.  </li>
            <li> These are for cutting moustache hair specifically, so that is excellent to get the job</li>
            <li> scissors are very lightweight.  </li>
            <li> Especially with such a nice pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> Although I would not recommend these for cutting hair on a regular basis (as in hair style on head), they do great in a pinch and work quickly and easily to cut through hair for a fast shape</li>
            <li> Although I would not recommend these for cutting hair on a regular basis (as in hair style on head), they do great in a pinch and work quickly and easily to cut through hair for a fast shape</li>
            <li> I typically use a rechargeable beard trimmer which works well most of the time, but it also easily misses hairs and when the power gets low it pulls hair like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t ask for better scissors.&lt;br /&gt;The blade came sharp, and cuts perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love the size of the comb compared to the other one he has.</li>
            <li> Where my mustache meets my lip, I have always used a small scissors to create a nice straight line.</li>
            <li> You can save yourself the trouble though by just buying a mustache comb and different scissors :o)</li>
            <li> The scissors are of high quality and work very well.  </li>
            <li> Ok product, the comb was slightly disfigured from packaging, didn&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li> only caveat that I found with these is that the scissors are noticeably shorter than your standard haircutting scissors which makes them more targeted to (of course) things like mustaches or eyebrows, where you are going to cut fewer hairs at once in order to ensure precision cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> However, you should know that it is not quite that clever.</li>
            <li> The comb is small and is perfect for those small area needs.</li>
            <li> (compared to most of the super super expensive Tweezerman tweezers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are easy to work with and the finger holes are large enough to accommodate most fingers, although I am thinking that men with extra large fingers might have some trouble manipulating these well.</li>
            <li> the other hand, the little come that comes with them is great and what kept me from returning the scissors.  </li>
            <li> If you or your man is like me it is always good to have a variety of tools to tame the facial hair.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman makes consistently high quality products that feel substantial and are well designed.</li>
            <li> You are paying a little more for quality</li>
            <li> The tiny comb will straighten the hairs, then the sharp small scissors will give you a perfect trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While the old ones functioned fine, there&#x27;s been an eight year long running joke that they are made like kid&#x27;s safety scissors with blunted ends</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scissors are sharp, easy to hold, cuts hair without any pulling or ripping.</li>
            <li> They are so, sharp but the point is easy to manipulate so as to not endanger her eyes.  </li>
            <li> use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The traditional moustache grooming comb is under five inches long, with fine, smooth teeth and a curved back and handle.  </li>
            <li> This is a little challenging, as the scissors are not blunt at the end, but their small size and sharpness lets me be very precise.  </li>
            <li> The scissors are sharp and accurate.</li>
            <li> The comb is pretty useless, you should invest in a nice wood comb if you really care about your stash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good, sharp little scisors.</li>
            <li> For fun I did a few cuts &#x27;free hand&#x27; only using the scissors after combing; on another section (along my chin) used the comb and scissors together to try and control the height of the cut.</li>
            <li> kit comes with a pretty run-of-the mill moustache comb, but it does the job for all kinds of facial hair- brows, beards, sideburns, as well as moustache</li>
            <li> The length of the blades are also good that they not too long so as to make them hard to use and angle around your face.</li>
            <li> This is a fine little kit.  </li>
            <li> I had nothing but a razor and this only helps with around the mustache more or less.  </li>
            <li> Most recently I was using little scissors swiped from my wife&#x27;s vanity</li>
            <li> like that the scissors cut cleanly without pulling, which was an issue with the previous scissors I used for these</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned I have tried nearly everything to maintain my goatee.</li>
            <li> have no use for the comb, but these scissors have been quite useful, although not exactly as hoped.  </li>
            <li> Comb works well, is small, fine toothed.</li>
            <li> Scissors are sharp, comb is just the right size for your mustache, but will also work for sideburns and around the ear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the brush is also comfortable to use &amp; compact enough that you can really get in &amp; trim done of those hard to get spots.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are still solid scissors, but for self care, the stabilizer handle makes a big difference, and in my opinion, worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> The comb is just the right size and the scissors are really sharp!  </li>
            <li> The scissors cut very well and are well made plus the comb is not to small and sharp and it&#x27;s easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> Extremely sharp, very well made!</li>
            <li> With my old scissors the hairs sometimes would slide along the blade before getting cut which made an uneven look that I had to keep fiddling with to get right.  </li>
            <li> The scissors a very sharp and just the right size for getting those hairs growing into your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m average size with large hands and my fingers barely fit into the small area designed for the thumb and finger.</li>
            <li> The blades move very tightly but smoothly against each other for the top two thirds of the blades, and are plenty tight for the last third.  </li>
            <li> The little comb is an added bonus for combing the hairs between her eyes and nose, the most tender area of her little squish face.  </li>
            <li> These scissors are very high quality and sharp.  </li>
            <li> The overall size is small enough for traveling yet comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> The comb, on the other hand, not so much, but that&#x27;s probably because he&#x27;s been doing without all this time.</li>
            <li> The blades curve together to create a sharp cut, but they curve too much.  </li>
            <li> Extra large fingers or fat fingers will fit uncomfortably.</li>
            <li> For general haircutting, though, avoid these and get the ones that are standard length.</li>
            <li> They are a little over four inches long, just the right size for grooming facial hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been trimming my husbands mustache for him and it is a much easier job with these little scissors and comb.</li>
            <li> But the scissors are sharp, and do a good job of cutting my beard and mustache.</li>
            <li> Also, these scissors are on the small side and might be difficult to use for those with large hands or those wanting something that cuts more surface area.  </li>
            <li> The comb is appropriate styled and sized but very poorly made - go with a Kent.</li>
            <li> I had one gripe, they are barely big enough for my hands, which as far as guy hands go are probably about average.</li>
            <li> It is not of surgical quality, I have used one of these from my first aid kit in the past on my beard, but it is lighter and will possibly last as long.</li>
            <li> For the pads of the paws, I can control the scissors without much effort and because they are so sharp, there&#x27;s no pull on the hairs which has tended to annoy the dog when I&#x27;ve used other scissors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found them to be very good for fixing what the trimmer left behind or doing things the trimmer simply can&#x27;t like cutting eyebrow hairs that have gotten too long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do what they say on the tin, sit well in your hand (middle finger in the loop, index finger in front), and thus far the comb has even stood up to daily use with only a couple tines missing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be truly good scissors for cutting hair of any sort, the blades need to be tight and have good precision all of the way from tip to base.  </li>
            <li> I feel the cost could be a little lower, as it just comes in a clear plastic box and isn&#x27;t anything fancy.</li>
            <li> Once you have that out of the way, use the comb to bring out the long stray hairs and trim away.  </li>
            <li> The scissors is solid and sharp and can be used for a multitude of grooming needs.  </li>
            <li> I am a coordinated person and have no trouble using small scissors, these just do not work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The problem with them being so small is that for guys with larger fingers, actually a large thumb, it is hard to use these well.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d be inclined to save some money if I were looking for a little present and just get the scissors alone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but I thought these would be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> They are small, and tight, and useful for small touchups.</li>
            <li> And, yes, I know they are mustache scissors, and they only should be sharp toward the point, but these aren&#x27;t very sharp there, either.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d invested in these a long time ago as there is a noticeable difference in the way these cut versus the 3 pairs of generic scissors I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
            <li> Not much to it.</li>
            <li> wish there was a travel case for it, thus minus a star.</li>
            <li> There are a few things that I look for in them that are key to performance over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve successfully used my general hair cutting shears for cutting her hair and a pair of baby rounded tip scissors when at a loss for other options to trim the hair between the pads of her paws.  </li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and well-aligned and they do indeed have micro-serrated edges to keep the hair from slipping.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp, which allows for precise cutting.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how that benefits over a regular comb.</li>
            <li> The scissors are well-built and cut mustache hair easily due to the microserrations on the blades.</li>
            <li> I cant get over how sharp they are.</li>
            <li> They feel very solid in your hand, hefty for their small size.  </li>
            <li> The scissors are sharp.</li>
            <li> Every part of the blades is sharp, enabling me to use either the tip or length, depending on what I cut.  </li>
            <li> They lack (as you can see in the photo), a little fingertip guide for precise cutting.</li>
            <li> With little hesitation I started to comb out my goatee ann evenly with the included comb; saw where I had imbalance and jagged edges; combed these sections then carefully used the SHARP yet manageable scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The comb is very cheap, about worthless if you were going to buy it by itself, but as a kit</li>
            <li> Since I like a very sharp line, I need a sharp scissors.</li>
            <li> I would suggest buying the scissors and comb separately, the comb is not worth the added price increase.</li>
            <li> He said he bent the tips of the scissors toward each other with pliers to make them cut a little</li>
            <li> Sharp Scissors!</li>
            <li> The scissors are very sharp and cut the hair with precision.</li>
            <li> This is not your typical household scissors and is made for the assigned duty.</li>
            <li> The points are slightly rounded for safety and the handles have opposing eye rings for ambidextrous</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp and their small size and pointed tips allow for exact cutting.  </li>
            <li> little overpriced, but works well.</li>
            <li> So, I was looking for something to trim this &amp;#34;fussy little mustache&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> This little guy will cut &amp; groom your Moustache &amp; them some.  </li>
            <li> I even used them to trim the fur around my little dog&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> I thought the microgrooves sounded \\&quot;gimicky\\&quot;, but they really do hold the hair so it doesn&#x27;t slip when cutting.</li>
            <li> Probably works for small fingers, mine are average.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting hair for quite a few years now, and I have had the chance to use a wide variety of scissors from drugstore to professional hair scissors.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;The micro-serrated blades are almost imperceptible, but they do keep the hair in place to cut.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp scissors!</li>
            <li> The comb is made of hard plastic and is of average quality, but works well.</li>
            <li> The scissors are sturdy, but the holes are too small for my husband to put his finger and thumb through, and the pointed tip was not safe, because he has a bleeding disorder.  </li>
            <li> one small quibble is the lack of a case to keep them in.</li>
            <li> Both are extremely small</li>
            <li> The mustache comb is just a small plastic comb with a rat tail handle.  </li>
            <li> With these scissors one cut does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dinged the product one star because I think they should include a small carrying case with this set.  </li>
            <li> The comb is a little cheesy as it is very small; I guess that is the desired design for the mustache.</li>
            <li> Nothing worse than dull scissors that pull your hair or worse yet don&#x27;t cut at all.</li>
            <li> , some scissors have a little arc-shaped extension on one of the thumb holes, which serves as a finger guide for precision cutting.</li>
            <li> The idea behind Movember is to grow a mustache to raise awareness and donations for men&#x27;s health issues.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The comb, on the other hand, is so bad that it shouldn&#x27;t even be bundled with the scissors.  </li>
            <li> Comb is kinda useless.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t slip while you&#x27;re cutting.</li>
            <li> (as in maybe I&#x27;m afraid he&#x27;ll stab me with them, ha-ha!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scissors are disappointing.  </li>
            <li> but these blades don&#x27;t cause the hairs to move out of the way, making for easier cutting and control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The comb is crap though</li>
    </ol>

            <li> little overpriced, but works well. Comb is kinda useless.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m doing the no-Shave November, this is timely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scissors are sharp, easy to hold, cuts hair without any pulling or ripping. Comb works well, is small, fine toothed. Both work well to help keep facial hair trim &amp; neat.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t ding this a star because of no carrying case.  It wasn&#x27;t included in the description.  The scissors are sturdy, but the holes are too small for my husband to put his finger and thumb through, and the pointed tip was not safe, because he has a bleeding disorder.  I compared the comb to the fine-tooth combs that are available everywhere, and they are the same width and distance apart.  The tines are not curved, but the handle is.  I&#x27;m not sure how that benefits over a regular comb.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent combination of a super fine-tooth comb and a pair of small but well crafted and extremely sharp scissors.  You are paying a little more for quality but you get it.  I also have a pair of tweezerman tweezers and their caliber is only matched by that of the scissors.  Slide your finger along the blade and you&#x27;ll probably cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The especially fine comb is excellent for separating hairs and is a little nicer than I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat that I found with these is that the scissors are noticeably shorter than your standard haircutting scissors which makes them more targeted to (of course) things like mustaches or eyebrows, where you are going to cut fewer hairs at once in order to ensure precision cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those specialty jobs I have no reservations about recommending this product.  For general haircutting, though, avoid these and get the ones that are standard length.</li>
            <li> Pricey but very nice scissors for nose and beard/mustache hairs.  Very sharp, which allows for precise cutting.  The comb is nice, too, but nothing special and I&#x27;d be inclined to save some money if I were looking for a little present and just get the scissors alone.</li>
            <li> Very sharp scissors! I don&#x27;t know why, but I thought these would be a little bigger. The problem with them being so small is that for guys with larger fingers, actually a large thumb, it is hard to use these well. The comb is very cheap, about worthless if you were going to buy it by itself, but as a kit it&#x27;s okay. Would have been better had this come with even a cheap carrying case, just a plastic one with a zipper. But the scissors are sharp, and do a good job of cutting my beard and mustache.</li>
            <li> I grew a &amp;#34;Walt Disney&amp;#34; mustache for Halloween, and the comments were so favorable I have kept it.  So, I was looking for something to trim this &amp;#34;fussy little mustache&amp;#34;  that was better than my Swiss Army knife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then they offered this nifty little set, which is perfect.  The tiny comb will straighten the hairs, then the sharp small scissors will give you a perfect trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one small quibble is the lack of a case to keep them in.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned I have tried nearly everything to maintain my goatee. I have &amp;#34;worn&amp;#34; my goatee for about 20 years and in that time have used many items to try and maintain the look and clean lines. Most recently I was using little scissors swiped from my wife&#x27;s vanity (shhh... she still thinks the kids are doing this!) and was met only with moderately successful results as the blade is somewhat curved making a straight line near impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this Tweezerman G.E.A.R. come up on Vine I immediately grabbed one! The day it arrived I used it and the skies parted and the heavens sang! Glory be!! With little hesitation I started to comb out my goatee ann evenly with the included comb; saw where I had imbalance and jagged edges; combed these sections then carefully used the SHARP yet manageable scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow! The results were stellar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The well made and easy to use scissors made a beautiful STRAIGHT line along my upper lip and along my chin. The comb (plastic and fairly sturdy) really is the key to this system and is best used in tandem with the scissors.  For fun I did a few cuts &#x27;free hand&#x27; only using the scissors after combing; on another section (along my chin) used the comb and scissors together to try and control the height of the cut. This was moderately successful but I am getting better at this with practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a man (or.. well...) and want to keep your whiskers tamed then this is for you! Great value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not think this is TSA-approved so best not try to take it in your carry-on. You might check with them prior to packing if you&#x27;re considering making this part of your travel kit.</li>
            <li> Through most of the winter months I maintain a very short beard.  I typically use a rechargeable beard trimmer which works well most of the time, but it also easily misses hairs and when the power gets low it pulls hair like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no use for the comb, but these scissors have been quite useful, although not exactly as hoped.  They&#x27;re sharp and their small size and pointed tips allow for exact cutting.  I&#x27;ve found them to be very good for fixing what the trimmer left behind or doing things the trimmer simply can&#x27;t like cutting eyebrow hairs that have gotten too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no major issues with this combo, but it does seem as if the comb has limited use and you might be better off just purchasing the scissors on their own at a cheaper price.  Also, these scissors are on the small side and might be difficult to use for those with large hands or those wanting something that cuts more surface area.  Personally, I see these more as something to augment or fine tune whatever you&#x27;re already using or to take on smaller jobs like eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This set of comb and scissors are good quality and work quite nicely for both my husband and me.  No, I&#x27;m not with the sideshow - I don&#x27;t have a moustache; I use the scissors to trim my bangs in between haircuts.  I also use them to trim up my husband&#x27;s hair after he does his haircut with electric clippers, and he uses both comb and scissors for his beard and moustache clean-up.  He said he bent the tips of the scissors toward each other with pliers to make them cut a little better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the scissors cut cleanly without pulling, which was an issue with the previous scissors I used for these jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d recommend them as a good addition to your grooming products.  Nice stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, made with stainless steel!</li>
            <li> Bought for son who lost the first set, and needed it again.  He uses it a lot, and likes this.</li>
            <li> My dad loved this set. It appears to be made of quality materials. The scissors are sharp and accurate. The comb is the perfect size. I feel the cost could be a little lower, as it just comes in a clear plastic box and isn&#x27;t anything fancy. But overall the quality is good and I would consider this grand again. I also feel this is a unique gift and perfect as a wedding party gift etc.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t ask for better scissors.&lt;br /&gt;The blade came sharp, and cuts perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;The comb is very fine, and is great for beards that aren&#x27;t as thick as others.</li>
            <li> They do the job at the right price</li>
            <li> Even the tips cut smoothly and easily. Don&#x27;t have to worry you&#x27;ll hurt yourself.</li>
            <li> Nice scissors and comb!  The comb is just the right size and the scissors are really sharp!  Would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> The scissors cut very well and are well made plus the comb is not to small and sharp and it&#x27;s easy to handle.  Good Value</li>
            <li> very pleased they work very well,thanks</li>
            <li> Very nice. I love Tweezerman products!</li>
            <li> Just OK.not even for medium size fingers</li>
            <li> The scissors are well-built and cut mustache hair easily due to the microserrations on the blades. They cut well at all points along the blades, working especially well at the tips. The overall size is small enough for traveling yet comfortable in the hand. This is not your typical household scissors and is made for the assigned duty. It is not of surgical quality, I have used one of these from my first aid kit in the past on my beard, but it is lighter and will possibly last as long. The comb is appropriate styled and sized but very poorly made - go with a Kent.</li>
            <li> sharp and has a good snip. Easy to handle, and gets the job done well.</li>
            <li> Comb is flimsy but the scissors are adequate</li>
            <li> This little guy will cut &amp; groom your Moustache &amp; them some.  Extremely sharp, very well made!</li>
            <li> Tiny. I guess I should  have read the fine print. Both are extremely small</li>
            <li> The small scissors are sharp and the comb it the perfect size. It provides a nice finish to keep the mustache in order and not overflowing into my my mouth when eating. An essential when trying to look dapper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d imagine there are better german-made scissors out there, but these scissors are very sharp and do the job just fine with no hairs missed or issues with trimming.  I&#x27;d rate the scissors a 4-4.5/5 for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb, on the other hand, is so bad that it shouldn&#x27;t even be bundled with the scissors.  The comb is sharper on the skin than any comb I have ever used, and if you run it through thicker hair, it is all too possible to pull out hairs.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind these are 2 separate items.  Perfect for trimming my beard and mustache, scissors are sharp and comb is just fine enough.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> My husband loves using this set to trim his moustache. The comb pulls the hairs down nicely and the scissors are sharp and have a nice grip to get a nice straight line across.</li>
            <li> The scissors do the job, but they are not quite as good as a superior pair of mustache scissors I already have in the drawer. For one thing, the tips are pointy. There is no need for pointy tips. Rounded tips are better for scissors you use near your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, some scissors have a little arc-shaped extension on one of the thumb holes, which serves as a finger guide for precision cutting. That&#x27;s a nice feature. These scissors don&#x27;t have that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are medium quality mustache scissors. They cut smoothly and they do a good job, but they are not fancy.</li>
            <li> The comb is perfect for a moustache (sic)... it doesn&#x27;t look like it would be but it&#x27;s perfect.  It grips the hair very well for directional grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scissors are very sharp for a nice precise cut.  They grip and cut very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice grooming tool for a mustache and beard.</li>
            <li> I decided to grow a mustache this year to support Movember.  The idea behind Movember is to grow a mustache to raise awareness and donations for men&#x27;s health issues.  Basically, by starting to grow a mustache people will inevitably make comments about it.  This of course becomes your opportunity to tell them about raising money for prostate cancer and testicle cancer organizations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I grew a mustache and it needed some trimming by week two.  I had nothing but a razor and this only helps with around the mustache more or less.  The Tweezerman GEAR is the perfect combination for trimming around the mustache as well as taming the length of the layers.  The scissors a very sharp and just the right size for getting those hairs growing into your mouth.  Once you have that out of the way, use the comb to bring out the long stray hairs and trim away.  What a great simple kit to keep your mustache in check.</li>
            <li> OK, I admit.. I thought this was much fancier than it ended up being. I was envisioning the product as pictured, where it appears that the comb is attached to the scissors, so you could do some one-handed beard trimming (or potentially eyebrow trimming, I though). However, you should know that it is not quite that clever. It&#x27;s just a very nice small pair of Tweezerman scissors, and a completely normal comb. So now I know why it&#x27;s so inexpensive.  (compared to most of the super super expensive Tweezerman tweezers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One cool thing: micro-serrations on the scissors grip hair so it doesn&#x27;t slip while you&#x27;re cutting. It helps keep bears shaped and looking neat.</li>
            <li> The comb is pretty useless, you should invest in a nice wood comb if you really care about your stash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I took a star off was because I recently tried out a pair of sanguine mustache scissors, and for $10 more you get a much higher quality scissor, that works great for trimming beard lines as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are still solid scissors, but for self care, the stabilizer handle makes a big difference, and in my opinion, worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Great pair of scissors. Can cut individual hairs without a problem. Comb is cheap, but adequate.</li>
            <li> works just like you think the should. no issues.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set for my husband and he loves it! The scissors are very sharp and cut precisely and easily. He says the comb is a great addition for making it easier to trim evenly. The scissors are comfortable in his had. A great set!</li>
            <li> This is a nice set.  The scissors is solid and sharp and can be used for a multitude of grooming needs.  The comb is small and is perfect for those small area needs.</li>
            <li> I trim my beard and mustache with an electric trimmer. Where my mustache meets my lip, I have always used a small scissors to create a nice straight line. Since I like a very sharp line, I need a sharp scissors. So, over the years, I&#x27;ve tried a dozen or so scissors. The Tweezerman is by far the best. Not only does it cut precisely, it&#x27;s easy and comfortable to hold. I also find the comb helps me maintain my beard neat. Nice product. Well made.</li>
            <li> The scissors work great! And so did the comb until my husband was brushing his beard and a couple of the plastic bristles came off. For the price though, I cannot complain.</li>
            <li> An all around great product! The quaility is amazing.</li>
            <li> This scissor has a nice friction feel as soon as the blades are half crossed, with a release toward the end of closing. This gives it a very precise feel. Here is a photo.</li>
            <li> This is a good addition for your grooming needs. If you or your man is like me it is always good to have a variety of tools to tame the facial hair. The size of the scissors and comb might be of concern to some men. I&#x27;m average size with large hands and my fingers barely fit into the small area designed for the thumb and finger. If you are a big man or you&#x27;re buying for someone who is you might take this fact into consideration. Extra large fingers or fat fingers will fit uncomfortably. Otherwise this is a nice compact set designed for home or travel. The scissors are very sharp and cut the hair with precision. Nothing worse than dull scissors that pull your hair or worse yet don&#x27;t cut at all. These are precision scissors that should give years of use with proper care. The comb is a little cheesy as it is very small; I guess that is the desired design for the mustache. Personally I prefer I larger comb when grooming the facial hair. Although it is sold as a mustache set I found that it works perfectly well with my beard. I&#x27;ve used it for fine tuning after trimming my beard with an electric trimmer with a length attachment. All in all this is a nice set to have in your army of facial hair grooming tools. Recommended for fans of Movember or  the bearded one&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Not much to it. Good, sharp little scisors. The comb is crap though and I would have skipped the kit had i known. I reccomend getting a metal flea comb for pets. Works great.</li>
            <li> work great. wish there was a travel case for it, thus minus a star.</li>
            <li> Works great. Sharp Scissors!</li>
            <li> Great mustache and beard scissor, I&#x27;ve used it multiple times and the blades are super sharp and makes it very easy to clean up your beard/mustache. The length of the blades are also good that they not too long so as to make them hard to use and angle around your face. I also use these to trim my eyebrows too. Just an overall great pair of scissors to do general hair cleanup!</li>
            <li> Very good Product, very sharp</li>
            <li> Super sharp and extremely accurate. I love the scissors and my husband loves the comb. I do my eyebrows with the scissors and they are very precise. My husband likes the comb because it has a lot of bristles and gets his mustache straight.</li>
            <li> These are great scissors, really cut clean and smooth without catching/pulling any hairs. I wish I&#x27;d invested in these a long time ago as there is a noticeable difference in the way these cut versus the 3 pairs of generic scissors I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
            <li> Great sharp scissors for precision trimming. Comb could be a little finer but overall a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Ok product, the comb was slightly disfigured from packaging, didn&#x27;t like that. One problem with scissors you need to make the finger holes big enough for the men that use them. Probably works for small fingers, mine are average. I would not buy again for the price they ask.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it is wonderful for really fine tuning your mustache and or beard the only drawback was I had it sent to my Massachusetts home and I was flying in June and did not want to put this in my suitcase as I did not want it to be confiscated by TSA because it is a scissors and they would have taken it away so I&#x27;ll have one at both my house in North Carolina and my house in Massachusetts</li>
            <li> Who knew??  These little scissors are great. The comb is a real plus as well. I have been trimming my husbands mustache for him and it is a much easier job with these little scissors and comb. Thanks. I cant get over how sharp they are. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is a fine little kit.  Scissors are sharp, comb is just the right size for your mustache, but will also work for sideburns and around the ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going through numerous cheap hair scissors and finding they all pull, it&#x27;s great to get a sharp pair that doesn&#x27;t pinch/pull.  And although marketed towards men, they would work for anyone needing a set about this size for trimming/grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had one gripe, they are barely big enough for my hands, which as far as guy hands go are probably about average.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been buying Tweezerman products for years after going cheaper routes and regretting it. Tweezerman makes consistently high quality products that feel substantial and are well designed. I have one pair of Tweezerman tweezers that must be pushing twenty years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second pair of men&#x27;s grooming scissors made by Tweezerman I&#x27;ve ordered. The first, [[ASIN:B000EMUC3E Tweezerman  Deluxe Men&#x27;s Grooming Kit]], came in a kit for a stocking stuffer that included tweezers, fingernail clipper and pocket nail file (but not a comb).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I jumped on the chance to replace the scissors from that first kit. While the old ones functioned fine, there&#x27;s been an eight year long running joke that they are made like kid&#x27;s safety scissors with blunted ends (as in maybe I&#x27;m afraid he&#x27;ll stab me with them, ha-ha!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides my preference of no more jokes about safety tips, he prefers the grips of this pair and says they are more comfortable to use. The comb, on the other hand, not so much, but that&#x27;s probably because he&#x27;s been doing without all this time. Others may not find it as superfluous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m going to buy anything as personal as grooming products for another person or myself I want to buy what&#x27;s proven to work the best and last the longest: Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> Pretty easy review here.  The mustache comb is just a small plastic comb with a rat tail handle.  It works well and is easy to hold in either hand.  The scissors are a different matter.  They appear to be very high quality and well made.  They feel very solid in your hand, hefty for their small size.  They cut hair excellently.  They have a very fine serration cut into the blades which the maker says allows the scissors to hold the hair for a better cut.  I think this works very well.  With my old scissors the hairs sometimes would slide along the blade before getting cut which made an uneven look that I had to keep fiddling with to get right.  With these scissors one cut does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dinged the product one star because I think they should include a small carrying case with this set.  Especially with such a nice pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> I picked this set up for my husband, and he has been so happy with it. This is what he had to say:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect sized moustache and beard trim set. The scissors are sharp. I thought the microgrooves sounded \\&quot;gimicky\\&quot;, but they really do hold the hair so it doesn&#x27;t slip when cutting. Trimming and grooming is very easy. Both comb and scissors are just the right size. Spacing on the comb teeth is great for my beard and moustache. Seems like it would be great for any hair type.</li>
            <li> Great quality scissors, very sharp, even the very tip will cut a fine hair. The comb is nothing fancy, but does its job</li>
            <li> These are good quality scissors, better quality than most local pharmacies carry. They are small, and tight, and useful for small touchups. They lack (as you can see in the photo), a little fingertip guide for precise cutting. I prefer rounded-tip scissors, which are just as useful, but safer to use around my nose, ears, etc. The comb is also good quality, but not helpful to me.</li>
            <li> Work as described and a value priced item.</li>
            <li> Scissors seem good quality and well made, but they are not very sharp. And, yes, I know they are mustache scissors, and they only should be sharp toward the point, but these aren&#x27;t very sharp there, either.</li>
            <li> I would suggest buying the scissors and comb separately, the comb is not worth the added price increase. The scissors are very good and are available on Amazon also.</li>
            <li> The scissors are disappointing.  The blades curve together to create a sharp cut, but they curve too much.  This means the scissors require too much force to close.  For me, the force required causes my hand to move away from the hairs I am trying to cut - which defeats the purpose of the scissors.  I am a coordinated person and have no trouble using small scissors, these just do not work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the little come that comes with them is great and what kept me from returning the scissors.  You can save yourself the trouble though by just buying a mustache comb and different scissors :o)</li>
            <li> Perfect, sharp, and easy to use, although the comb is rubbish</li>
            <li> Ordered it for my husband and the scissor is amazing and I love the size of the comb compared to the other one he has. It is large enough not to get lost easily.</li>
            <li> Work well.  I have huge hands and I don&#x27;t have any problems with them.  I only use them to trim fly-a-way rouge hairs and they work great for this.</li>
            <li> These scissors are very high quality and sharp.  I wish there were a case to protect them.  The comb and scissors make it so much easier to precisely trim sideburns and bangs/faceframe.  I even used them to trim the fur around my little dog&#x27;s face.  This is a little challenging, as the scissors are not blunt at the end, but their small size and sharpness lets me be very precise.  Great for little touch-ups between groomings.</li>
            <li> We have a very full moustache in this household which belongs to a Shih Tzu.  I&#x27;ve purchased assorted scissors specifically sold for dog facial fur trimming but found none to be satisfactory.  I&#x27;ve successfully used my general hair cutting shears for cutting her hair and a pair of baby rounded tip scissors when at a loss for other options to trim the hair between the pads of her paws.  Since her facial hair and paw pads require weekly trimming, I chose to try the [[ASIN:B00I8H6DOY Tweezerman G.E.A.R. Moustache Scissors with Comb]].  On her face, the eye area and area above the mouth require the most attention, so I really needed a good pair or small, sharp, safe scissors which would withstand weekly use at a minimum.  I am happy to report that these scissors perform in an outstanding fashion and I regret not thinking of using moustache scissors before now.  The little comb is an added bonus for combing the hairs between her eyes and nose, the most tender area of her little squish face.  The comb is also perfect for combing the hairs in her ears which I need to remove regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not exaggerating when I say that Zhaba did not flinch when I used this tiny tool on any part of her body.  They are so, sharp but the point is easy to manipulate so as to not endanger her eyes.  Every part of the blades is sharp, enabling me to use either the tip or length, depending on what I cut.  For the pads of the paws, I can control the scissors without much effort and because they are so sharp, there&#x27;s no pull on the hairs which has tended to annoy the dog when I&#x27;ve used other scissors.  This Italian tool is wonderful.  It is great for dogs as well as humans, especially since just the last section of the fingers comfortably slip into the small handles, thereby allowing better control of the dog.</li>
            <li> The scissors are of high quality and work very well.  They are a little over four inches long, just the right size for grooming facial hair.  They are made stainless steel, well-finished and with an adjustable screw.  The blades are sharp and well-aligned and they do indeed have micro-serrated edges to keep the hair from slipping.  The points are slightly rounded for safety and the handles have opposing eye rings for ambidextrous use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The traditional moustache grooming comb is under five inches long, with fine, smooth teeth and a curved back and handle.  The comb is made of hard plastic and is of average quality, but works well.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting hair for quite a few years now, and I have had the chance to use a wide variety of scissors from drugstore to professional hair scissors.  There are a few things that I look for in them that are key to performance over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW DO THESE SCISSORS RATE IN MY EXPERIENCE?&lt;br /&gt;-SIZE&lt;br /&gt;The size of these scissors is excellent.  They are easy to work with and the finger holes are large enough to accommodate most fingers, although I am thinking that men with extra large fingers might have some trouble manipulating these well. The men in my family range in size from medium to large hands and all were able to use these well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-TIGHT BLADES&lt;br /&gt;To be truly good scissors for cutting hair of any sort, the blades need to be tight and have good precision all of the way from tip to base.  These scissors are excellent.  The blades move very tightly but smoothly against each other for the top two thirds of the blades, and are plenty tight for the last third.  These are for cutting moustache hair specifically, so that is excellent to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-BALANCE&lt;br /&gt;These scissors are very lightweight.  That means that they are easy to use and move around different locations of the face while being well balanced.  This allows for a great cut from any direction, which is important when dealing with facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-BLADES&lt;br /&gt;The micro-serrated blades are almost imperceptible, but they do keep the hair in place to cut.  Moustache and beard hair tend to be quite wiry and coarse but these blades don&#x27;t cause the hairs to move out of the way, making for easier cutting and control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-COMB&lt;br /&gt;This kit comes with a pretty run-of-the mill moustache comb, but it does the job for all kinds of facial hair- brows, beards, sideburns, as well as moustache hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT CAN YOU USE THIS SET FOR?&lt;br /&gt;I used these scissors and comb to cut unruly brows back, beard hair, moustache hair, sideburns, and even trim some quick layers to shape up a hairstyle with great success.  Although I would not recommend these for cutting hair on a regular basis (as in hair style on head), they do great in a pinch and work quickly and easily to cut through hair for a fast shape up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO CARE FOR&lt;br /&gt;These scissors came well oiled, and I would suggest that you keep them oiled as well- to keep them functioning at top level for future use.  Use the kind of oil you use for razors, not just any oil, and just wipe with a very light coating before storing.  You need to make sure to wipe the blades off FIRST before applying oil to remove stray hairs and any dampness should you have tried to use these on damp hair after shower, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BOTTOM LINE&lt;br /&gt;I give these five stars because of the performance, quality, and components listed in my review.  They are great for all types of facial hair and are quick and easy to use.ck layers to shape up a hairstyle with great success.

            <li> I received these as a gift over a year ago and I have to commend Tweezerman for making an excellent, precision pair of scissors that have retained sharpness the whole length to the tip even with light use on things other than hair. They do what they say on the tin, sit well in your hand (middle finger in the loop, index finger in front), and thus far the comb has even stood up to daily use with only a couple tines missing.</li>
            <li> These are pretty well exactly what you&#x27;d expect.  This mini scissor kit is compact, but also sturdy, it doesn&#x27;t feel like just another flimsy pair of scissors.  They&#x27;re also comfortable to use.  the brush is also comfortable to use &amp; compact enough that you can really get in &amp; trim done of those hard to get spots.  All in all, A+</li>
