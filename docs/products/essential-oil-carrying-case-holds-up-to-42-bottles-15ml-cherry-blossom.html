            <li>Love the case, wish there were more color options.</li>
            <li>and I really love the print.</li>

            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>Cute design and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I love that it has a handle at the top for easy carrying too.</li>
            <li>Perfect little bag to fit my most important oils!</li>
            <li>The cloth dividers do a good job of protecting the oils (a concern of mine when I initially ordered) and I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on this bag as I&#x27;ve taken my oils to classes!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute &amp; user friendly.</li>
            <li>and it seems to be holding up just fine.</li>
            <li>The zipper isn&#x27;t exactly smooth, but works fine.</li>
            <li>Oils are protected and they all fit.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my oils handy and readily transportable.</li>
            <li>It holds all of my oils securely.  </li>
            <li>It also keeps the oils out of the light.  </li>
            <li>and I can fit some 10ml roller bottles in it as well, plus</li>
            <li>This bag is strudy and hold the oils securely.</li>
            <li>but they do fit.</li>
            <li>5ml bottles fit with no issue.</li>
            <li>It looks cute, however it doesn&#x27;t offer much padding for the oil bottles.</li>
            <li>It fits all my oils perfectly and it&#x27;s so nice to have an actual oil case now instead of just using makeup bags previously!!</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable that my investment in my essential oils are safe in this for travel and carrying, while making them easy to see and sort.</li>
            <li>The flower design is very pretty.</li>
            <li>I can not tell you how much i love this EO storage case, it is pretty, has plenty of space and it is very well done.</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>fit in these easily given the extra height allowance of the case.</li>
            <li>Love the fabric choice on the outside!!  </li>
            <li>So pretty.</li>
            <li>Love this carrier case, second one I&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made and durable!</li>
            <li>The print is quite cute, but not loud.</li>
            <li>Product is good, not sure if it&#x27;s entirely worth the expense, but it is certainly better made than a lot of the other cases out there.</li>
            <li>Very durable, padded and protects from heat.</li>
            <li>I really like this case.</li>
            <li>This looks and feels really well made.</li>
            <li>To get the full 42 bottles in is truly a tight fit, but fitting almost 42, mostly 15-ml with a few smaller bottles is no problem.</li>
            <li>Very durable and holds my oils as expected.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great with oils</li>
            <li> Very durable and holds my oils as expected. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> It works great! Wish it was bigger</li>
            <li> Love the case!  Oils are protected and they all fit.  Love the fabric choice on the outside!!  So pretty.</li>
            <li> This case is perfect! Very durable, padded and protects from heat. Perfect size to carry with you. Just ordered a second one. Would recommend this for every oiler!</li>
            <li> Love the fabric and colors.  Holds 30 oils in the front individual slots.  The 2 big back slots hold another 10.  Depending on yout bottle size.  Woild definetly buy it again</li>
            <li> I really like this case. It keeps my oils handy and readily transportable.</li>
            <li> I was unsure of the dividers in this case, but decided to buy this as my second oils container.  It is now my favorite!  The cloth dividers do a good job of protecting the oils (a concern of mine when I initially ordered) and I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on this bag as I&#x27;ve taken my oils to classes!</li>
            <li> Love this! Probably ordering another soon! This case is a sturdy, soft-sided case with spaces for 30 bottles, plus 2 larger compartments for rollers, and extra bottles, etc. My 5ml, 15ml, and small dropper bottles fit in these easily given the extra height allowance of the case. The dividers are connected on the sides, not on the bottom, but this allows for give between the bottles allowing for larger/smaller. The print is quite cute, but not loud. The zipper isn&#x27;t exactly smooth, but works fine. I like the handle on top and its positioning. I feel comfortable that my investment in my essential oils are safe in this for travel and carrying, while making them easy to see and sort.</li>
            <li> Held 42 bottles and some rollerballs.  Lots of space.</li>
            <li> I love it!! It fits all my bottles perfectly and there&#x27;s room for bigger ones as well. Works for me to carry my candle smells to consolations.</li>
            <li> Love this carrier case, second one I&#x27;ve ordered. Adorable pattern and holds oils well!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice case.  It holds all of my oils securely.  I used scotch guard to give it protection against staining.  I chose this case because it held more oils than others.  It also keeps the oils out of the light.  The flower design is very pretty.</li>
            <li> Good quality and lots of bottle space.</li>
            <li> Love this bag for all my oils! The handle is so convenient for carrying it places and I can fit some 10ml roller bottles in it as well, plus it&#x27;s cute!</li>
            <li> Good size.  Nice look.  To get the full 42 bottles in is truly a tight fit, but fitting almost 42, mostly 15-ml with a few smaller bottles is no problem.</li>
            <li> I bought another one without patterns... This one is cute :)&lt;br /&gt;Durable... Nicely fitted my YL oils... Very nicely made!!! Will buy again if needed :)</li>
            <li> This bag is strudy and hold the oils securely. I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I can not tell you how much i love this EO storage case, it is pretty, has plenty of space and it is very well done. It is made of canvas fabric. Best storage case ever.</li>
            <li> Love this and I was even able to fit a roller bottle in and it still zipped shut!</li>
            <li> Ahh the daughter&#x27;s essential oil collection is growing and she loves the beauty of this case&#x27;s function Thankyou for careful packaging and prompt shipping</li>
            <li> Love the case, wish there were more color options.</li>
            <li> Love this case! It&#x27;s very well made and durable! I get complemented on it all the time. It&#x27;s beautiful. Fits oils well. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better case!</li>
            <li> Case is thick, sturdy fabric and I really love the print. As a few other people mentioned, the bottom is not attached to the case so I haven&#x27;t tested how it will hold up during travel. Also, some of my 10mL bottles have taller stoppers and they poke-up a bit through the top of the case but they do fit. Product is good, not sure if it&#x27;s entirely worth the expense, but it is certainly better made than a lot of the other cases out there.</li>
            <li> Holds oils well. It does what it says.</li>
            <li> My mom loves the case! It&#x27;s cute &amp; user friendly.</li>
            <li> It looks cute, however it doesn&#x27;t offer much padding for the oil bottles. It is very difficult to fit the Young Living 15ml bottles all in one row, once you get down to the last one or two bottles its a really tight squeeze. 5ml bottles fit with no issue. You can hear the bottles clanging against each other. The material also makes it very difficult for the zipper to be easily opened or closed.</li>
            <li> I really love this carrying case. It fits all my oils perfectly and it&#x27;s so nice to have an actual oil case now instead of just using makeup bags previously!! This looks and feels really well made. I love that it has a handle at the top for easy carrying too.</li>
            <li> Perfect little bag to fit my most important oils!</li>
            <li> Love this.  Cute design and sturdy. I have about 40 oils in there and it seems to be holding up just fine. Worth the money</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little taller.</li>
            <li> Great product! Quality material</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my oils</li>
