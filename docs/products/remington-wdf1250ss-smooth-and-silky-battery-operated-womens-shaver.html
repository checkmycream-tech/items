    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great deal for the price as well!</li>
            <li>but it is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Im very happy with pruchase!</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>so I went on a search for a great razor</li>
            <li>so went to here (Amazon) and found this great razor.</li>
            <li>It even works great on bikini lines.</li>
            <li>This shaver is very nice.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price and it shipped free with the books I purchased.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to this shaver because it was inexpensive, but still had a good review.</li>
            <li>I loved the price and the fact that it&#x27;s battery operated, which makes it easier to use anywhere.</li>
            <li>and she loved it</li>
            <li>and I loved it,</li>
            <li>If you are looking for the convenience of a battery operated shaver then this is a good shaver.</li>
            <li>But more importantly IT DIDNT WORK!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve bought this for my mom and sister, and they love it too!  </li>
            <li>I thought this would be a nice razor.  </li>
            <li>And it gives a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is excellent and gives me a very close shave (not as close as manual razors, but close).</li>
            <li>Kind of embarrassing,</li>
            <li>when im in the shower makes it fast and easy and the best part is it takes battery&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I hope they always sell this shaver, good price, lots of power runs a long time on the battery before you have to change it, works great, nice to have for travel too</li>
            <li>I like that it isn&#x27;t rechargeable as that has always been a pain in trying to find an outlet and it fitting correctly.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t quiet sure whether to buy a battery operated or one that comes with a charger, but in the end I thought battery operated would be the best to travel with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to shop around some more for a better quality one.</li>
            <li>I have thicker hair strands than most women</li>
            <li>Try to use it many times in warranty period.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite shaving products.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>for the record, I have burned my hand on the stove more than once too.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think one ever finds a razor that shaves as close as one with a blade, but use it all the time and am pleased.  </li>
            <li>I received this shaver in a timely manner and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Not a close shave, was hoping for better.</li>
            <li>gotta love this when you have kids that love to get in to everything</li>
            <li>so i dont have to wait for it to charge:)</li>
            <li>While not as powerful as a rechargeable, it is convenient and does a good job.</li>
            <li>I wanted a battery operated one and this was a OK buy.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>This razor does a pretty good job for an electric.  </li>
            <li>This works great and gives a pretty clean shave.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and clean</li>
            <li>It works best with wet shaving (you&#x27;ll get a smoother finish), but for dry shaving, it&#x27;s awesome for touch-up</li>
            <li>I love how it fits in your hand its not bulky at all and is comfortable to the feel.</li>
            <li>This razor is a great buy and even better than my last electric razor I had.</li>
            <li>However, for those in between times or for trimming, it does the job just fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean and waterproof.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t leave my legs as silky smooth as a manual razor does.</li>
            <li>so I was so happy to find something I could use outside the shower without water.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a smooth shave, keep looking.</li>
            <li>My skin is not as smooth as butter, but close.  </li>
            <li>Says it is as good as the last one she had that cost much more.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t eat right though the batteries either which is great and only needs 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li>It was much faster and did a much better job.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not bad...</li>
            <li>Very nice replacement for the previous shaver I had for 15 years.</li>
            <li>Great little shaver for travel.  </li>
            <li>This razor works great wet or dry and easy to clean just pops open and comes with its own brush to clean it out with.</li>
            <li>It seemed to do a great job at first but on closer inspection, I noticed it was missing a lot.</li>
            <li>Shaves multiple areas on your body nice clean cut , easy to hold and keeps a very long charge.</li>
            <li>Also, you should clean it each time and then shake it to get all the excess water out and then make sure you dry it with a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>For the last two weeks I have been using this razor and so far so good</li>
            <li>I bought it as a first time shaver for her</li>
            <li>The only thing is that the top likes to pop off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a rechargeable shaver a few times when I was in my teens and loved them.  </li>
            <li>, for $12 you get all the convenience of a really good electric shaver without the expense of buying one and still come out ahead in the amount of waste you dispose.</li>
            <li>so convenience, leave your skin so soft, very useful product, I hightly recommend, give it a try you wont regret it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a couple weeks now and although no electric razor shaves as close as a manual razor it trims pretty short and on one or two smooth swipes.</li>
            <li>If I want a super close shave, I&#x27;ll use a standard razor in the shower -- but even then, sometimes that irritates my skin and isn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is great for wet or dry shaving!  </li>
            <li>Very cost efficent with 2 replaceable AA batteries.</li>
            <li>I guess you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>So much for taking this for a weekend get-a-way.</li>
            <li>if not, don&#x27;t expect much in the way of customer service from them.</li>
            <li>I put the old batteries back in and it ran fine</li>
            <li>just buy a new razor!</li>
            <li>no need to fuss with charging it (uses batteries), easy to hold, provides a reasonably close shave fairly quickly (doesn&#x27;t require several passes over the same area, and I feel like I&#x27;m ready to go out in the world in short pants), and seems to not irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>It also helps save the land fills because even though you&#x27;re throwing away a large shaver instead of an inner and outer foil it still doesn&#x27;t take up anywhere near as much space as a year&#x27;s worth of razors would.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shaver for three months and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>For the price and quality, I would highly recommend and would buy again.</li>
            <li>This shaver does just as well of a job as a normal razor at shaving my skin.</li>
            <li>the price, this is worth a try if you have needs similar to mine.  </li>
            <li>It is okay, but a bit harsh on my legs.</li>
            <li>It shaves about as good as my electric shaver, but not great.</li>
            <li>found another smaller one at Kmart that is doing the trick for me right now.  </li>
            <li>but I ended up with a new problem.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother buying a new battery when it stops charging well (after 1-2 years)...</li>
            <li>so I thought that after the screen broke it would be cheaper to buy a new battery operated shaver.</li>
            <li>I have bought several different Remington Smooth &amp; Silky razors over the years.  </li>
            <li>When it was held upright, it worked fine, but as soon as I put it in shaving position with the heads facing down, it stopped running.</li>
            <li>Cleaned it meticulously after each use, but after the first few times, it quickly dulled.  </li>
            <li>I have fine to medium hair on my legs and the shaver does a good job of taking off the hair without irritating my sensitive skin, and the batteries last a long time!</li>
            <li>The results are smoother than what I can get with a normal razor since they&#x27;re bump-free (I also have sensitive skin and razor-shaving gives me</li>
            <li>This razor doesn&#x27;t seem to shave the hair off as much as it beats it into submission until it finally gives up and lets go.</li>
            <li>I had the old style battery operated shaver</li>
            <li>I wish I had not thrown the old one out with the old shaver.</li>
            <li>, unfortunately I don&#x27;t think it shaves a good as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long the batteries last, but I have used it several times already on the original batteries.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and thin</li>
            <li>This never worked very well from the start, although it worked a little better wet than dry.</li>
            <li>Well I bought this for my wife and it doesnt even work barely trims hair at all.  </li>
            <li>You need to go over the area a few time to get it right, trying not to go too close to areas that are already close.</li>
            <li>Considering just the inner foil for my previous shaver cost $12, this doesn&#x27;t seem like much of a loss.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a lot of comments on this, because looks like people give up on it early for other reasons and never see this happen.  </li>
            <li> I do use a regular razor afterward for smoothness, but if you&#x27;re a furry monkey like me, this is a money and time saver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver about 6 times now -- only as a dry razor (not with water).  </li>
            <li> But that took a long time to develope</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I thought this would be a nice razor.  Did not look like the one in this picture.  Colors were different.  It stopped working after a week and a half.  I returned it last week for a replacement, but have not heard anything since.&lt;br /&gt;I am waiting for the return item and will probably only use it for travel like emergency reasons.&lt;br /&gt;I found another smaller one at Kmart that is doing the trick for me right now.  In the meantime I am waiting for my return product to arrive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a rechargeable shaver a few times when I was in my teens and loved them.  Then I stopped buying them for awhile.  I just bought this one and I think it&#x27;s great.  I like that it isn&#x27;t rechargeable as that has always been a pain in trying to find an outlet and it fitting correctly.  I like that it is cordless and water proof even though I use it dry.  If you like to reuse batteries, you can use some rechargeable ones. Also, you should clean it each time and then shake it to get all the excess water out and then make sure you dry it with a hair dryer.  What dulls the blades typically is water staying on the blades then it rusting a little and putting tiny nicks in it.  When doing arms, wash them so that the deoderant is gone before you begin shaving the hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this electric razor due to I&#x27;m tired of all the nicks from manual razors and the razor burn really can get quiet awful sometimes. I have always trusted Remington so I went on a search for a great razor so went to here (Amazon) and found this great razor. I wasn&#x27;t quiet sure whether to buy a battery operated or one that comes with a charger, but in the end I thought battery operated would be the best to travel with. Its small enough to put in a purse or a over night bag. There is nothing I can say bad about this product it met all my expectations. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple weeks now and although no electric razor shaves as close as a manual razor it trims pretty short and on one or two smooth swipes. It even works great on bikini lines. For the last two weeks I have been using this razor and so far so good it doesn&#x27;t eat right though the batteries either which is great and only needs 2 AA batteries. This razor works great wet or dry and easy to clean just pops open and comes with its own brush to clean it out with. I love how it fits in your hand its not bulky at all and is comfortable to the feel. It doesn&#x27;t cut you or nick you like I&#x27;ve heard some electric razors do. It has 2 flexible foils for the closeness any woman needs, and has two extra trimmers for longer hair as well. This razor is a great buy and even better than my last electric razor I had.</li>
            <li> I needed a battery powered shaver because I don&#x27;t have enough outlets in my bathroom keep a rechargable shaver recharged when I need to shave my legs; also, I prefer to shave in the bathtub, so when I saw that this is waterproof and uses 2 AA batteries, I had to try it.  Amazon has the best price and it shipped free with the books I purchased. I have been using this shaver for three months and highly recommend it. If you want a shaver you can use in the shower or tub with just soap or a little shave cream you won&#x27;t be disapointed! I have fine to medium hair on my legs and the shaver does a good job of taking off the hair without irritating my sensitive skin, and the batteries last a long time! This is just what I wanted in an electric shaver!</li>
            <li> I bought this razor, gosh, I dont even remember how long ago(not from amazon) and it has lasted forever! I have never had any problems with it except for now. The screen has a hole in it so kinda useless since I dont believe they make replacements for these. But that took a long time to develope so I cant be to disappointed. The only thing I would change is to make it rechargeable but I guess thatll be my next razor and Im definitely sticking to Remington! Ive had 2 in my life and they both lasted several years.</li>
            <li> I bought this one as an alternative to manual shavers because it&#x27;s really hard to shave your legs in a dorm room&#x27;s shower stall. I was looking forward to this shaver because it was inexpensive, but still had a good review. But, it was not what I expected at all!, It does it&#x27;s job, but only after going over and over the area  again and again. It also doesn&#x27;t leave my legs as silky smooth as a manual razor does. It&#x27;s alright when I&#x27;m not able to shower and use a manual shaver, but I wouldn&#x27;t use it all the time. I&#x27;m going to shop around some more for a better quality one.</li>
            <li> Not a real close shave like a razor, but works in a pinch when you need a dry shave in a hurry. I like that it only works on batteries, I hate having lots of plug-ins in the bathroom. I just toss this in the cabinet. Batteries that came with this have lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> This is great for wet or dry shaving!  I use mine all the time, and the battery lasts a long while too.  It works best with wet shaving (you&#x27;ll get a smoother finish), but for dry shaving, it&#x27;s awesome for touch-up or if you forget to shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought this for my mom and sister, and they love it too!  Great deal for the price as well!</li>
            <li> Wife ordered and received this electric razor. Says it is as good as the last one she had that cost much more. Very cost efficent with 2 replaceable AA batteries. Give this razor a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I got what I believe is the newer version of this shaver, the WDF-1250. It&#x27;s only around $12 but it is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. I have thicker hair strands than most women so removal with an electric shaver usually leads to some pulled hairs, the occasional nick, repeat area coverage since the first try usually leaves hair behind, and never results in smoother skin than what I can get with a normal razor. This shaver does just as well of a job as a normal razor at shaving my skin. I don&#x27;t have to go over the same area repeatedly and it hasn&#x27;t pulled a single hair much less nick me. The results are smoother than what I can get with a normal razor since they&#x27;re bump-free (I also have sensitive skin and razor-shaving gives me bumps).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model is AA battery operated and the foils are not replaceable. This means when the foils dull out you have to throw the shaver away. Considering just the inner foil for my previous shaver cost $12, this doesn&#x27;t seem like much of a loss. It also helps save the land fills because even though you&#x27;re throwing away a large shaver instead of an inner and outer foil it still doesn&#x27;t take up anywhere near as much space as a year&#x27;s worth of razors would. If you use rechargeable AA batteries you also save yourself the expense of batteries and help keep batteries from the landfill (if it had a rechargeable battery you would still have to throw it away when you threw away the unit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for $12 you get all the convenience of a really good electric shaver without the expense of buying one and still come out ahead in the amount of waste you dispose.</li>
            <li> I hope they always sell this shaver, good price, lots of power runs a long time on the battery before you have to change it, works great, nice to have for travel too</li>
            <li> The shaver was expensive. The 1st thing I noticed when it arrived was &amp;#34;Factory Reconditioned&amp;#34; on the box. I don&#x27;t remember seeing that when I ordered it. But more importantly IT DIDNT WORK!!! Now I have to go through the hassle of returning it.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor after a friend bought one for her daughter. I loved the price and the fact that it&#x27;s battery operated, which makes it easier to use anywhere. I have a small stall shower and shaving in there was like being a contortionist so I was so happy to find something I could use outside the shower without water. It seemed to do a great job at first but on closer inspection, I noticed it was missing a lot. My hair is very fine and thin which means I don&#x27;t have to shave as often but when I do, I would like something that works. This razor doesn&#x27;t seem to shave the hair off as much as it beats it into submission until it finally gives up and lets go. I tried to use the edge trimmer but it still just skims over the hair without taking it off. Recently I replaced the batteries because it seemed to be running a little slower than it should be but I ended up with a new problem. When it was held upright, it worked fine, but as soon as I put it in shaving position with the heads facing down, it stopped running. I put the old batteries back in and it ran fine but it&#x27;s sluggish. I guess you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This shaver is just what I was looking for.  Since it is battery operated I don&#x27;t have to worry about the cord and having a place to plug in.  And it gives a nice close shave.  I don&#x27;t know how long the batteries last, but I have used it several times already on the original batteries.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for my wife this Christmas. She finally tells me that it won&#x27;t hold a charge. She literally has to keep it in the charging holder 24/7 in order to use it. Take it out for a day and it&#x27;s dead. So much for taking this for a weekend get-a-way. Have to bring the charger too. Not very portable. This is the last Remington I will ever buy!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this I bought it as a first time shaver for her and she loved it</li>
            <li> I switched to this electric shaver from a Panasonic because I&#x27;m going overseas and needed a battery operated one. This shaver is excellent and gives me a very close shave (not as close as manual razors, but close). I use it only on my legs, so I can&#x27;t speak to how well it works in other areas. It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean and waterproof. For the price and quality, I would highly recommend and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought one Remington WDF1250SS, not from Amazon but from other store.  Used it three times in six months and it has stopped working now.  I would suggest not buy it. But still if you are buying, be cautious. Try to use it many times in warranty period.</li>
            <li> I spent almost 10 minutes attempting to shave my legs. The hair was short because I shaved yesterday, but there was enough stubble for me to need to shave today. It won&#x27;t shave the short hairs, and you have to keep going over the same spots again and again. After 10 minutes I put it down and got my disposable razor. It was much faster and did a much better job. And even though I used the same shaving gel I always use, there are little red bumps all over my legs now.</li>
            <li> I have bought several different Remington Smooth &amp; Silky razors over the years.  This is one of the cheapest, and works about the same as all of the others.  If you are looking for a smooth shave, keep looking. This won&#x27;t give you the same shave as a regular razor.  However, for those in between times or for trimming, it does the job just fine.  I would recommend this any time.... especially for the price.  Don&#x27;t bother buying a new battery when it stops charging well (after 1-2 years)... just buy a new razor!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite shaving products. It is battery operated so you don&#x27;t have to worry about charging it. I always keep one of these on hand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver about 6 times now -- only as a dry razor (not with water).  It is serving its purpose for me:  no need to fuss with charging it (uses batteries), easy to hold, provides a reasonably close shave fairly quickly (doesn&#x27;t require several passes over the same area, and I feel like I&#x27;m ready to go out in the world in short pants), and seems to not irritate my skin at all.  I like not having to get in the shower to shave my legs.  If I want a super close shave, I&#x27;ll use a standard razor in the shower -- but even then, sometimes that irritates my skin and isn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this is worth a try if you have needs similar to mine.  I do wish that the folks designing these razors could come up with a way to make them a bit quieter (though this one is no louder than any others I&#x27;ve heard).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other electric razors, and I always end up returning them and getting this same one, again.  They&#x27;re not in stores anymore (that I can find).  So I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.  The only thing is that the top likes to pop off.  But it&#x27;s not bad... I just pop it back on and keep shaving.  Works for shaving personal areas... doesn&#x27;t cut and pull like others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This razor does a pretty good job for an electric.  I like that it uses AA batteries.  The rechargeable models that I have used before have all lost their charging ability after a while.</li>
            <li> I have no problem with this item - it is the seller I have a problem with. I don&#x27;t post comments often but this seemed like something I should warn others about ~~ I ordered this item, then received the wrong item.  I e-mailed them to let them know about their error - their response - \\&quot;return it\\&quot;. I then asked if I would receive the correct item or if I had to re-order, their response \\&quot;reorder it\\&quot; After returning the wrong item and receiving the correct item I e-mailed again to ask about getting a credit back for the shipping cost to return the item and to have the correct one shipped - their response - None - I didn&#x27;t get a reply so I am guessing will also not get a credit for the 2 extra shipping charges I paid.&lt;br /&gt;If you buy from this seller I hope they ship the correct item, if not, don&#x27;t expect much in the way of customer service from them.</li>
            <li> The foils on this razor deform and tear, leaving jagged edges that will shred your skin.  I haven&#x27;t seen a lot of comments on this, because looks like people give up on it early for other reasons and never see this happen.  I have been using it for over a year.  I&#x27;ve replaced the razor once and the foils three times - each time because the foils eventually tore and made deep scratches on my legs.  for the record, I have burned my hand on the stove more than once too.  I suppose I&#x27;m not the fastest learner.  But I thought you should know you can actually hurt yourself with this thing.</li>
            <li> Shaves multiple areas on your body nice clean cut , easy to hold and keeps a very long charge. Im very happy with pruchase!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think one ever finds a razor that shaves as close as one with a blade, but use it all the time and am pleased.  My skin is not as smooth as butter, but close.  I received this shaver in a timely manner and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The shaver workes well and is quite satisfactory.  I wish it had attachments.  I like that is water proof.</li>
            <li> Kind of embarrassing, but I bought this to handle my winter leg hair grow out moments. It keeps me from having to go through several razors. This works great and gives a pretty clean shave. I do use a regular razor afterward for smoothness, but if you&#x27;re a furry monkey like me, this is a money and time saver.</li>
            <li> This never worked very well from the start, although it worked a little better wet than dry. Cleaned it meticulously after each use, but after the first few times, it quickly dulled.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not a close shave, was hoping for better. It will get the longer hairs. Plus it&#x27;s battery operated (which I knew about when I bought it) I recommend another brand</li>
            <li> gotta love this when you have kids that love to get in to everything when im in the shower makes it fast and easy and the best part is it takes battery&#x27;s so i dont have to wait for it to charge:)</li>
            <li> so convenience, leave your skin so soft, very useful product, I hightly recommend, give it a try you wont regret it</li>
            <li> I thought I would pick this up as a travel shaver, to replace one that has stopped working.  I should have saved my money.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very nice.  It is very easy to use and clean, unfortunately I don&#x27;t think it shaves a good as I thought it would.  It does shave close, but not clean.  You need to go over the area a few time to get it right, trying not to go too close to areas that are already close.</li>
            <li> Great little shaver for travel.  While not as powerful as a rechargeable, it is convenient and does a good job.</li>
            <li> I wanted a battery operated one and this was a OK buy. I don&#x27;t like the extra floating trimmer on it. I also have to take the bottom off and push in the starter button manually almost everytime I use it.</li>
            <li> Well I bought this for my wife and it doesnt even work barely trims hair at all.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I had the old style battery operated shaver and I loved it, so I thought that after the screen broke it would be cheaper to buy a new battery operated shaver. It is okay, but a bit harsh on my legs. It shaves about as good as my electric shaver, but not great. If you are looking for the convenience of a battery operated shaver then this is a good shaver. It does not come with a protective screen for the shaving head. I wish I had not thrown the old one out with the old shaver.</li>
            <li> I love this shaver.  I like that it does what it says.  Very nice replacement for the previous shaver I had for 15 years.</li>
