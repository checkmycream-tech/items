            <li>Great price !</li>
            <li>Best to just buy it from anyone but them.  </li>
            <li>Its really good!!</li>
            <li>This cleared me up great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for the money.</li>
            <li>She has been using it for a 2 weeks and her face look way better!!</li>
            <li>I love proactiv and proactiv products, and have a long-standing and very happy relationship with Amazon.com</li>
            <li>I did just that to give it a fair shot.</li>
            <li>The product is good.  </li>
            <li>, I felt like I had to look over each bottle with a magnifying glass to make sure they hadn&#x27;t been tampered with!</li>
            <li>The bottles that go with this\\&quot;special\\&quot; is nothing more than a \\&quot;travel\\&quot; size!  </li>
            <li>It arrived on time and I love this product!</li>
            <li>Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>and they told me I should give it 6 more weeks.  </li>
            <li>You have to be on top of their order/billing practices.  </li>
            <li>Although, they probably love it because they eek out top dollar by charging your CC before you get a chance to realize what&#x27;s happening.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t be fooled into paying more for this \\&quot;large\\&quot; size.</li>
            <li>But the Proactiv three step system is fantastic !</li>
            <li>This was definitley a better price that ordering from MFG.  </li>
            <li>so i was very excited.</li>
            <li>Daughter liked it wants me to order more.</li>
            <li>They automatically enrolled me in their special club which sends you more products and charges your CC automatically.  </li>
            <li>Get your FREE 7 day samples at [...]</li>
            <li>My face felt so much better after just the first application.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll find a better deal right here on Amazon, just search for \\&quot;Super Size Proactiv\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll find it.     </li>
            <li>Yeah right!</li>
            <li>So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be lucky if a get 45 days out of the product.</li>
            <li>I was delivered the product very fast!</li>
            <li>I never noticed it in high school, but i am more aware of myself now, and i notice.</li>
            <li>Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands....</li>
            <li>Although I made very certain that I did not select any subscription shipments, their system put me on a subscription list anyways.  </li>
            <li>The product didn&#x27;t do any better for my daughter than most other products, and she&#x27;s found a better product (1/2 the cost) at a local retail store.    </li>
            <li>I have used this in the past and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>In going through Amazon you can purhase product when you need it, and will certainly save money!</li>
            <li>So after a great first month you end up getting extra products when you don&#x27;t necessarily need them for almost triple the cost.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it.</li>
            <li>Better than the TV commercial.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s more, apparently the latest research shows that in severe cases of acne there is bacteria under the skin that must be treated by antibiotics and that treating it superficially isn&#x27;t likely to help much.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a trial kit and used it for the first 30 days, but Proactiv did not help my acne at all.</li>
            <li>What they don&#x27;t tell you is that it keeps on coming, and at a higher price, and when you cancel it, the price gets even higher</li>
            <li>This is the first time using for Proactive</li>
            <li>Thanks for a economical alternative for getting this product.  </li>
            <li>really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time.</li>
            <li>Now that i am older, i notice, it actually damages my face more than it helps.</li>
            <li>One thing i use that absolutely works is Benzyl Peroxide 10%..</li>
            <li>that much needs to be prescribed, but hey, get it how you can.</li>
            <li>It really does work</li>
            <li>I have tried many acne systems and this is THE ONLY system that continually keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>But when you buy directly through the Proactive site they offer a first month supply for just $20 but then sign you up for automatic refills.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched to L&#x27;BRI Pure n natural and you should too!</li>
            <li>I recommend buying this product from QVC or another reliable seller on amazon because if you buy it here, you will most likely be ripped off and pay twice what you would normally pay for the same product.</li>
            <li>Having had problems with my skin most of my life, I&#x27;ve tried everything with little to no results.</li>
            <li>Our doctor said that what&#x27;s in Proactiv isn&#x27;t really that much different than what&#x27;s in most of the other over the counter products.  </li>
            <li>Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results.</li>
            <li>It uses Aloe Vera as the main ingredient, instead of water, and it has no harsh chemicals, no pore clogging waxes or oils and they don&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
            <li>But if you have a severe case, it&#x27;s not likely to help very much, and you&#x27;ll probably have to get a prescription for something stronger.</li>
            <li>This proactive system is the first thing I&#x27;ve tried that actually helps balance out my skin problems.</li>
            <li>Stay far away from this product!</li>
            <li>There are so many toxic chemicals it burned my face off, left red acne marks, and dry everything inch of my face and hands.</li>
            <li>did the rep mention that I had to return it by a certain date to get my money back.    </li>
            <li>having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>&quot; Proactive offers.</li>
            <li>My skin is a combination skin of dry and oily and during the first 2 weeks of using it</li>
            <li>He also said that the main reason people who used it showed some improvement is because it motivated people to be regular in their acne hygiene routine - something</li>
            <li>you have a less severe case of acne, then Proactiv might be for you: the main thing is to use it consistently.  </li>
            <li>Also, the toner (which is always the thing that runs out first) was leaking in the package, and was already a quarter empty.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is visibly starting to clear up!</li>
            <li>I really do not see much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast service was here before expected.</li>
            <li>Even looking at their before and after \\&quot;pictures\\&quot; (more like marketing propaganda!), you can clearly tell that they&#x27;re not even showing the same person in both pictures - for example in one of the before and after sets, the person&#x27;s eye color changes miraculously from brown to green!</li>
            <li>since it&#x27;s been several months, I&#x27;m in the process of getting the UPS shipment information, and will be contacting the attorney general&#x27;s office).    </li>
            <li>It actually caused me to get two larger, more severe zits (worse than anything I&#x27;ve ever had before), one of which ended up getting an infection.</li>
            <li>Not only did I never receive a shipment confirmation or tracking number from the company, but two weeks after I placed the order, I finally started to attempt to track my package and found that UPS had apparently \\&quot;delivered\\&quot; the proactiv to me a week before.</li>
            <li>When i was in high school, i used pro active every day and thought it was helping me.</li>

            <li> My negative review of this \\&quot;Large 3 piece kit\\&quot; has nothing to do with whether or not Proactive works.</li>
            <li> So, to my surprise, I got a 2nd shipment a few months later with a bill.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using it for a few years, and just went back to it recently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for three months now and not had a single breakout .</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t, understand the ways to help keep your skin healthy since, if you don&#x27;t take those steps, it is HIGHLY likely be disappointed</li>
            <li> This time, I am a little older, alot more stressed and in worse health unfortunately</li>
            <li> Proactiv is great, but this configuration will leave you very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My teenaged son has had a bad case of acne for more than a year now.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want your time and money wasted, stay away from Total, Inc!!!</li>
            <li> After using it for several weeks now, we&#x27;ve seen a very slight improvement in our son&#x27;s acne, but nothing</li>
            <li> Once you stop using the product, your acne will return unless you take active steps to maintain the health of your skin.</li>
            <li> The whole thing was so weird</li>
            <li> They will get as much cash out of you as possible and make it nearly impossible to return the product by stating \\&quot;we didn&#x27;t receive it\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The bottle sizes are very small and will barely last you a month.  </li>
            <li> Not true.</li>
            <li> Doctors put me on Predizone for a few months and I started breaking out like a teenager.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems like nothing we tried worked, so after hearing several friends recommend Proactiv, we decided to take the plunge and buy a 2-month supply, even though it&#x27;s a little expensive.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain even a little!</li>
            <li> He had very little improvement......</li>
            <li> It is often believed that merely using a product can be the only change made to help your skin.</li>
            <li> They are a shady business that I would recommend that you avoid.</li>
            <li> This entire experience is disappointing...</li>
            <li> The sizes are very small for the price (almost $40) and you might as well buy the \\&quot;Mega\\&quot; Supersized bottles instead for an additional $10.</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast and the price is not to bad for proactive compared to buying it in store!</li>
            <li> U should at least try!</li>
            <li> , however I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular company to my worst enemy.</li>
            <li> and I was disappointed to say the least.  </li>
            <li> However, I HATE their business tactics.  </li>
            <li> I hope some day they figure out how annoying their business plan is.  </li>
            <li> Highly frustrated!</li>
            <li> Try it , you won&#x27;t be disappointed !</li>
            <li> Proactiv is HORRIBLE for your skin!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Proaciv is a highly effective acne treatment brand but, here&#x27;s the catch - you have to keep at it. Firstly, it takes a few weeks before you see significant results. This is the case for any acne treatment product really - you just HAVE to be consistent and give it time. So, folks looking for a quick solution to their problem (i.e. - clearing up your skin in time for prom or a wedding, for example) will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it is not a magic potion capable of \\&quot;curing\\&quot; acne. Once you stop using the product, your acne will return unless you take active steps to maintain the health of your skin. It is often believed that merely using a product can be the only change made to help your skin. Clear skin is about more than just using the right brands.... having clear skin is about understanding skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say use this product if you can afford to consistently buy it. If you can&#x27;t, understand the ways to help keep your skin healthy since, if you don&#x27;t take those steps, it is HIGHLY likely be disappointed once you stop using Proactiv.</li>

I promptly called them to state that I did not sign up for any additional shipments, they canceled the order, but made me pay to ship it back to them.  I&#x27;m still getting bills from them, and now they claim that they didn&#x27;t get the shipment (since it&#x27;s been several months, I&#x27;m in the process of getting the UPS shipment information, and will be contacting the attorney general&#x27;s office).    They are a shady business that I would recommend that you avoid.</li>
            <li> i just received my package today and I was disappointed to say the least.  I paid for a 60 day supply (which is what size the product is said to be) and i received a 30 day supply.  Also, the toner (which is always the thing that runs out first) was leaking in the package, and was already a quarter empty.  I recommend buying this product from QVC or another reliable seller on amazon because if you buy it here, you will most likely be ripped off and pay twice what you would normally pay for the same product.</li>
            <li> Great price ! Better than the TV commercial.</li>
            <li> When I placed this order, I paid extra for shipping so that I would get it sooner. Not only did I never receive a shipment confirmation or tracking number from the company, but two weeks after I placed the order, I finally started to attempt to track my package and found that UPS had apparently \\&quot;delivered\\&quot; the proactiv to me a week before. Not true. I emailed the company, played email-tag with them for two days, after which they promised to expedite my order within two days. A week later I finally received my package. The proactiv bottles came in a sketchy kitchen zip-lock bag. The whole thing was so weird, I felt like I had to look over each bottle with a magnifying glass to make sure they hadn&#x27;t been tampered with! I will never order from this company again. I love proactiv and proactiv products, and have a long-standing and very happy relationship with Amazon.com, however I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular company to my worst enemy. If you don&#x27;t want your time and money wasted, stay away from Total, Inc!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased a 60 day - 3 piece kit. As per the description, they only sell the big bottles in kits. Yeah right! What I received was two trial sets of Proactive product. I&#x27;ll be lucky if a get 45 days out of the product. Highly frustrated!</li>
            <li> This proactive system is the first thing I&#x27;ve tried that actually helps balance out my skin problems. But when you buy directly through the Proactive site they offer a first month supply for just $20 but then sign you up for automatic refills. So after a great first month you end up getting extra products when you don&#x27;t necessarily need them for almost triple the cost. I will never go through proactiv ever again! In going through Amazon you can purhase product when you need it, and will certainly save money!</li>
            <li> My teenaged son has had a bad case of acne for more than a year now.  We&#x27;ve tried a variety of different medicines, one of which actually made his acne worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like nothing we tried worked, so after hearing several friends recommend Proactiv, we decided to take the plunge and buy a 2-month supply, even though it&#x27;s a little expensive.  After using it for several weeks now, we&#x27;ve seen a very slight improvement in our son&#x27;s acne, but nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We finally got fed up with all of the over the counter stuff and decided to visit our pediatrician.  He told us that our son had 3-4 level acne on the Pillsbury scale which classifies the severity of acne from 1 to 4.  Our doctor said that what&#x27;s in Proactiv isn&#x27;t really that much different than what&#x27;s in most of the other over the counter products.  He also said that the main reason people who used it showed some improvement is because it motivated people to be regular in their acne hygiene routine - something teens are notorious for not being faithful with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more, apparently the latest research shows that in severe cases of acne there is bacteria under the skin that must be treated by antibiotics and that treating it superficially isn&#x27;t likely to help much.  So now we&#x27;re moving from using Proactiv to using prescription antibiotics and some stronger prescription acne medicines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish us luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a less severe case of acne, then Proactiv might be for you: the main thing is to use it consistently.  But if you have a severe case, it&#x27;s not likely to help very much, and you&#x27;ll probably have to get a prescription for something stronger.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is great, but this configuration will leave you very disappointed. The sizes are very small for the price (almost $40) and you might as well buy the \\&quot;Mega\\&quot; Supersized bottles instead for an additional $10. There is no way that the sizes in this configuration would last for 60 days of use. This ad is misleading. Search for another configuration.     You&#x27;ll find a better deal right here on Amazon, just search for \\&quot;Super Size Proactiv\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll find it.     Conclusion: Proactiv is Recommended! (but buy another configuration).</li>
            <li> When i was in high school, i used pro active every day and thought it was helping me. I stopped using it for a few years, and just went back to it recently. Now that i am older, i notice, it actually damages my face more than it helps. It creates blackheads. I only have blackheads when i use this product. I never noticed it in high school, but i am more aware of myself now, and i notice. One thing i use that absolutely works is Benzyl Peroxide 10%.. that much needs to be prescribed, but hey, get it how you can.</li>
            <li> Daughter liked it wants me to order more. WOW what a generation, have to provide for everyone even the dog with his fancy food etc... and I get to sleep with him in the dog house..... jk</li>
            <li> I have tried many acne systems and this is THE ONLY system that continually keeps my skin clear. Will NEVER be without or use anything else.</li>
            <li> When you read, 2 month supply, you think these must be the larger sizes.  Nope! Not at all.  The bottle sizes are very small and will barely last you a month.  Definitely will not be ordering from here again.</li>
            <li> I personally found this product okay.  I really do not see much of a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I also gave as a gift but I don&#x27;t know how Proactiv worked for them.</li>
            <li> I purchased a trial kit and used it for the first 30 days, but Proactiv did not help my acne at all. It actually caused me to get two larger, more severe zits (worse than anything I&#x27;ve ever had before), one of which ended up getting an infection. I ended up having to take oral antibiotics to treat the break out that Proactiv caused.    Stay far away from this product! It is a scam! Even looking at their before and after \\&quot;pictures\\&quot; (more like marketing propaganda!), you can clearly tell that they&#x27;re not even showing the same person in both pictures - for example in one of the before and after sets, the person&#x27;s eye color changes miraculously from brown to green! Hmm, suspicious...</li>
            <li> I received this product for my son in September.  He had very little improvement......so I called them and they told me I should give it 6 more weeks.  I did just that to give it a fair shot. I called them today to cancel and asked about the money back guarantee but they told me Im now \\&quot;outside the 60 day period\\&quot; and am no longer eligible for that guarantee.  I explained that I had called and did what the rep said and she said there was nothing she could do...NEVER did the rep mention that I had to return it by a certain date to get my money back.    The bottles that go with this\\&quot;special\\&quot; is nothing more than a \\&quot;travel\\&quot; size!  Dont order this!  This entire experience is disappointing...wish I had seen all of these reviews before I ordered!</li>
            <li> The product is good.  However, I HATE their business tactics.  I called to receive their $9.99 trial offer.  They automatically enrolled me in their special club which sends you more products and charges your CC automatically.  I stated I didn&#x27;t need to be in the club, they said to cancel after I received the product.   called to cancel as soon as I received the product, but they had already sent out another kit and charged my CC $45.  You have to be on top of their order/billing practices.  They will get as much cash out of you as possible and make it nearly impossible to return the product by stating \\&quot;we didn&#x27;t receive it\\&quot;.  Best to just buy it from anyone but them.  I hope some day they figure out how annoying their business plan is.  Although, they probably love it because they eek out top dollar by charging your CC before you get a chance to realize what&#x27;s happening.  Beware.</li>
            <li> Beware of the \\&quot;specials\\&quot; Proactive offers. What they don&#x27;t tell you is that it keeps on coming, and at a higher price, and when you cancel it, the price gets even higher</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It works!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and it worked great.  This time, I am a little older, alot more stressed and in worse health unfortunately, it is not as helpful as it was 5 years ago</li>
            <li> Wife uses this stuff, and I suggested checking on amazon for a lower price. Product arrived in 2 business days and works. Can&#x27;t complain even a little!</li>
            <li> I was delivered the product very fast! This is the first time using for Proactive so i was very excited. My skin is a combination skin of dry and oily and during the first 2 weeks of using it I noticed a difference! It now has been about 3 weeks and my skin is visibly starting to clear up! The delivery was fast and the price is not to bad for proactive compared to buying it in store!</li>
            <li> Its really good!! She has been using it for a 2 weeks and her face look way better!! U should at least try!</li>
            <li> Doctors put me on Predizone for a few months and I started breaking out like a teenager. This cleared me up great.</li>
            <li> My negative review of this \\&quot;Large 3 piece kit\\&quot; has nothing to do with whether or not Proactive works. This is the SAME SIZE as the Proactive Solution 3 step system kit, 2 month supply!! So don&#x27;t be fooled into paying more for this \\&quot;large\\&quot; size. No wonder why they don&#x27;t tell us the actual ounces in these bottles.</li>
            <li> Having had problems with my skin most of my life, I&#x27;ve tried everything with little to no results. But the Proactiv three step system is fantastic ! I&#x27;ve been using it for three months now and not had a single breakout . My daughter and I both use this and definitely recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s suffered with breakouts before. Try it , you won&#x27;t be disappointed !</li>
            <li> my daughter swears it helped</li>
            <li> This was definitley a better price that ordering from MFG.  Thanks for a economical alternative for getting this product.  It really does work</li>
            <li> Proactiv is HORRIBLE for your skin! There are so many toxic chemicals it burned my face off, left red acne marks, and dry everything inch of my face and hands. I&#x27;ve switched to L&#x27;BRI Pure n natural and you should too! It uses Aloe Vera as the main ingredient, instead of water, and it has no harsh chemicals, no pore clogging waxes or oils and they don&#x27;t test on animals. My face felt so much better after just the first application. Get your FREE 7 day samples at [...]</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the money. Fast service was here before expected. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
