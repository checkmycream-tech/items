            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many high-end cleansers and this is as good or better than many.  </li>

            <li>This is one of the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST facial cleanser I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Cleanses without over-drying and great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing and better than anything I&#x27;ve ever shaved with and leaves you feeling silky and smooth and not dry like most soaps.</li>
            <li>It feels smooth and plump.</li>
            <li>it goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and the cleanser removes all of my make up(passed the white towel test) and leaves my face feeling silky and wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Cleansers leave you feeling squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin which becomes very oily throughout the day, and I still find the Hydrating Cleanser to be the better of the two.</li>

            <li>It definitely outdoes many many of the high end cleansers and moisturizers</li>
            <li>Very gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently using the Hydrating Facial Cleanser along with the CeraVe PM Facial Lotion, and my skin has never been more amazing.</li>
            <li>If you want a facial cleanser that doesn&#x27;t weigh your face down yet does an extremely great job, this is the product.  </li>
            <li>but your skin feels really</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m at an age where you need to find a product that will clean your skin well and not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>I follow up with a gentle toner to remove traces of make-up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the combination of these gentle cleansers plus a stronger salicyclic acid spot treatment on the affected areas has really done the trick.</li>
            <li>I use the foaming on my face and it is so gentle</li>
            <li>It takes off all of my makeup, including mascara and is so gentle.  </li>
            <li>Its so gentle</li>
            <li>Not only does it clean my face gently, it is helping to even out  </li>
            <li>The hydrating cleanser was a bit too oily for me and whilst the facial cleanser was nice, it left my face too dry.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Facial cleaner is great - body wash is weird</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>give it three stars, however, because I think the product would work quite well for really oily to moderately oily skin.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, this stuff is pretty drying for already dry skin, but looks like it&#x27;ll be helpful for oily skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see good results, but that doesn&#x27;t mean other skin types won&#x27;t improve either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>brought it for my younger brother, he used it daily and so far, it really has reduce his acne</li>
            <li>It has done major wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li>I use the dry skin wash for the winter and the normal to oily for the summer.</li>
            <li>Both cleansers, even the one for normal to dry skin, ended up tightening the skin on face and causing the skin around my mouth and on my cheeks to flake.</li>
            <li>I regularly have sensitive skin, and in the winter, my skin ends up being very dry as well.</li>
            <li>This is the first product line that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and make it feel tight.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I use the dry skin wash for the winter and the normal to oily for the summer. Does the job.</li>

            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Probably thr best cleanser and hydrating products I&#x27;ve ever used.I have extremely sensitive skin and the cleanser removes all of my make up(passed the white towel test) and leaves my face feeling silky and wonderful.  Havr recommended both to friends.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Cleansers leave you feeling squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> My andro chronologist dermatologist dermatologist recommended this I do have to say it creams into your skin don&#x27;t feel it but your skin feels really so much better looks good at least my skin loves this stuff no greasy ish stuff we&#x27;ll see how well it works</li>
            <li> Great product and recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift, sister loved it. Shipped fast and as advertised.  Use it myself &amp; will continue to recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but there are better products out there. The hydrating cleanser was a bit too oily for me and whilst the facial cleanser was nice, it left my face too dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using the Hydrating Facial Cleanser along with the CeraVe PM Facial Lotion, and my skin has never been more amazing. It feels smooth and plump. Gone were the bumps/redness that was always there when I used Kiehl&#x27;s products. Quality product for half the price. Good job CeraVe (:</li>
            <li> These  are the  best  cleaners  ever!</li>
            <li> If you want a facial cleanser that doesn&#x27;t weigh your face down yet does an extremely great job, this is the product.  And for the price...you can&#x27;t beat it.  It definitely outdoes many many of the high end cleansers and moisturizers</li>
            <li> brought it for my younger brother, he used it daily and so far, it really has reduce his acne</li>
            <li> Best idea to put one of each in a package.  I use one for the morning and one at night.  That is how I always bought them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used cetaphil for umm I don&#x27;t know 8 years!! CeraVe blows cetaphil away. I noticed my dermatoligist had this product in his office. It wasn&#x27;t until years later I decided to make a switch. I&#x27;ve been using Cerave both the facial cleanser and hydrating cleanser in morning and at night. My skin has never felt better I swear.  I always suffered from the occasional break out. I still get little pimples sometimes. This stuff is really great. I got the moisturizer as well.  Definitely a repeat customer. Gonna wash face now yeah!</li>
            <li> I switched to CeraVe at my doctor&#x27;s recommendation. Previously I had used Clinique products for years, which were way more expensive. I have sensitive skin so I have to be careful what kinds of products I use. These are great--I use the foaming cleanser at night and it removes all of my makeup without leaving my face overly dry. In the morning I use the hydrating cleanser, with the same results. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  Cleanses without over-drying and great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at an age where you need to find a product that will clean your skin well and not dry out your skin. This is the first product line that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and make it feel tight. Moisturizers are great too. Not too heavy and make my skin feel soft and not greasy. You only need a little amount so all of there products last a long time. You may find that you can go without the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser I have found to date. I have combination skin which becomes very oily throughout the day, and I still find the Hydrating Cleanser to be the better of the two. It cleans well without drying out my skin. I follow up with a gentle toner to remove traces of make-up.</li>
            <li> Facial cleaner is great - body wash is weird - does not foam so feel like not getting washed</li>
            <li> These cleansers are superb. A friend&#x27;s facialist recommended them to her, and after months of looking for something for my dry skin with acne, I decided to give CeraVe a shot too.  I&#x27;ve found the combination of these gentle cleansers plus a stronger salicyclic acid spot treatment on the affected areas has really done the trick. My breakouts are tamed and the number of pimples has been greatly reduced. I don&#x27;t plan on ever going back to anything else.</li>
            <li> I love the foaming one. The hydrating one is similar as Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> I regularly have sensitive skin, and in the winter, my skin ends up being very dry as well. My dry and sensitive skin unfortunately didn&#x27;t get along well with either cleansers. Both cleansers, even the one for normal to dry skin, ended up tightening the skin on face and causing the skin around my mouth and on my cheeks to flake. I didn&#x27;t get to use the product long enough to tell whether it would help with my acne.&lt;br /&gt;I give it three stars, however, because I think the product would work quite well for really oily to moderately oily skin. The flaking and tightening wasn&#x27;t a result of any allergy or ingredient irritation; rather, it was because of the foam. For dry skin, creams and non-foaming cleansers are much kinder and less drying. I didn&#x27;t see good results, but that doesn&#x27;t mean other skin types won&#x27;t improve either.&lt;br /&gt;So, this stuff is pretty drying for already dry skin, but looks like it&#x27;ll be helpful for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. Love it, skin looks great.</li>
            <li> Love this! I use the foaming on my face and it is so gentle and then I use the hydrating cleanser for shaving. It&#x27;s amazing and better than anything I&#x27;ve ever shaved with and leaves you feeling silky and smooth and not dry like most soaps.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 4 only because I haven&#x27;t tried the hydrating cleanser yet.  I have been using the foaming facial cleanser for some time.  It takes off all of my makeup, including mascara and is so gentle.  Also, it beats paying a lot of money for something that washes down the drain.  I&#x27;ve tried many high-end cleansers and this is as good or better than many.  No irritation or redness after using this and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST facial cleanser I have ever used. Not only does it clean my face gently, it is helping to even out  my skin tone!!!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will purchase again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve beenusing this cleanser for years now. It has done major wonders for my skin. Its so gentle and it never irritates your skin. it goes on smoothly and I just believe this is the best cleanser for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
