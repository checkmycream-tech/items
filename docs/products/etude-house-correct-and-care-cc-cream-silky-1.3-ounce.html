    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Also works best with a primer under it, as it will still get clumpy even if you use a toner.</li>
            <li>If you are around a NW20 or NC20 shade this would be perfect for you!</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>CC cream promises wonderful things!  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>This is the best CC cream</li>
            <li>color blends perfectly,</li>
            <li>and I am totally impressed.    </li>
            <li>It turned into my skin tone as i blended it in, and was perfectly matte, but not drying.</li>
            <li>It goes on my skin and keeps my skin feeling silky and wonderful all day.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, so I thought it would be a perfect product for me.</li>
            <li>, I look like having a nature flawless skin.&lt;br /&gt;During the time that I use this cc cream, my skin was irritate with an acne cream treatment that I brought, it make my skin feeling burn when I use cleanser,toner... &amp;#34;everything&amp;#34; and it did not happen to me before.</li>
            <li>The cream is perfect for me</li>
            <li>Impressed by how this cream works as well.</li>
            <li>Very good, like the color</li>
            <li>Excellent product at a great price.</li>
            <li>The great thing is?</li>
            <li>I ordered this from UniBella, my product came before the estimated arrival date which made me happy.</li>
            <li>So great customer service from UniBella.</li>
            <li>But the product wasn&#x27;t so great, just one day after using it, my skin started breaking out and peeling.</li>
            <li>Its great for the skin...</li>
            <li>the seller was great, I received it in about a week and a half.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a no-makeup kind of girl and this is awesome.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for reducing redness without the makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great buy.</li>
            <li>Great seller.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d found a great alternative to wearing pore-clogging sunblock on my face.  </li>
            <li>Feels great and lasts through the day.</li>
            <li>but honestly nothing has matched so perfectly!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m incredibly happy (which is good, since I&#x27;m also incredibly picky).</li>
            <li>I wear it alone as foundation and it blends perfectly into my skin tone while still providing a smooth even coverage that leave my skin looking beautiful unlike any foundation i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>But I love it and am really impressed by it.</li>
            <li>This CC cream is not going to work miracles, but it gives a fair coverage.</li>
            <li>Really good CC cream.</li>
            <li>so its good for those days</li>
            <li>and I am good to go.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a good CC cream and a friend recommended this from Etude House.</li>
            <li>I just put on some bronzer and Its good to go.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s a good CC cream.</li>
            <li>Coverage was good.</li>
            <li>If you like some more coverage, you could still put bb cream after this, and this cc cream would work as a great primer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes your skin look great without wearing &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34; so if you&#x27;re a guy with acne or redness, this product will make your face look better and improve confidence.</li>
            <li>I am very glad that I purchased this product</li>
            <li>Very light coverage, which I happen to love, but if you want more coverage, you can layer it under your foundation for all the great benefits of this product!</li>
            <li>When you use it ,  you will love it !</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>and I am glad I did!</li>
            <li>I love this CC cream!</li>
            <li>This is nice as a very light colour CC cream with a nice finish!  </li>
            <li>cream is good if you have a very light skin.</li>
            <li>I wish this didn&#x27;t happen because this product does a great job brightening my face and it feels so light on my face.</li>
            <li>your skin looks amazing.  </li>
            <li>This CC cream is Amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing</li>
            <li>I honestly use the bb cream as a concealer now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>chose &amp;#34;Silky&amp;#34; because I didn&#x27;t want a glitzy/dewy look that is popular in Korean products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s kind of trending</li>
            <li>Its nice that it has SPF as well for the days I don&#x27;t wear make up.</li>
            <li>If you need a good coverage you can probably use this as a primer and apply something heavier on top of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice product</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best CC cream!</li>
            <li>I put it on, smelled great, and my sister noticed the difference right away!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes perfectly with the Etude House Moistfull Lotion for light and fresh make up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, while the packaging is cute and I liked the concept, it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Ã©tude for a while and by far their products are one of the best in the market.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE WILL BE REPURCHASING WHEN I RUN OUT!</li>
            <li>I like this CC cream, it has very light coverage</li>
            <li>Very light feeling and not greasy.</li>
            <li>It make my skin feel very Smooth</li>
            <li>and I LOVE the spf which is a super bonus!!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using etude bb creams for about 4 years now.&lt;br /&gt;I started with their Magic one, then the Dear Girls line.</li>
            <li>so now I use the precious mineral.</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The coverage is basically sheer, however, the lovely silky sheen is wonderful.</li>
            <li>WHen I opened my package I had an Etude House sample and the cutest letter with the most adorable stickers.  </li>
            <li>Better than my Lancome BB</li>
            <li>My skin looked and felt dewy after applying this CC cream and my complexion was much more even and</li>
            <li>Your skin will look like it has a healthy glow for hours.</li>
            <li>This cream evens out my tone perfectly and hides all of the redness that I get around my nose, my freckles, and the occasional pimple.</li>
            <li>It, somehow, makes my skin look really healthy and plump.</li>
            <li>problem that many people have had.</li>
            <li>I have read many reviews and bought &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; rather than #02 &amp;#34;Glow&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I like the matte finish much better)</li>
            <li>And,, like most korean products, it does make your face look</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>their service.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself IS FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t hesitate to pick up another one when mine runs out! :)</li>
            <li>I liked that this product went smoothly on my skin, but what I did not like was, it did dryed out my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure how it supposed to work.</li>
            <li>The product just spreads around more and seems like a mask.</li>
            <li>It was ok.  </li>
            <li>I just need a wee bit of concealer afterwards on the more redder parts of my face.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love Etude House products, they have been working great for my skin so far</li>
            <li>I was kind of hoping it would work really well with my skin, but to be honest</li>
            <li>This is great for all skin types, I believe, but I have oily/combination/ace prone and sensitive skin (rosacea).</li>
            <li>This product was too light for my skin, but it was ok since I blended it with another cc cream to match my skin.</li>
            <li>silky one gives more of a matte finish which I liked very much.(I</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly considering I have prime.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the slightly dewy finish that makes me look radiant.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li>(I have huge bags under my eyes).</li>
            <li>My whole face is a nice even color and not blotchy or read at all after using this.</li>
            <li>They even gave me a free sample.</li>
            <li>products feels so smooth and nourishing when you put it on your skin.</li>
            <li>so my skin is a light tan and after waiting a bit for the CC cream to adapt to my skin tone</li>
            <li>people may enjoy it, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>It went on smooth, has a matte finish and did not make my face oily.</li>
            <li>This cream is so light on my face that I often forget it is there</li>
            <li>I apply it with my fingers after my morning moisturizer and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Just didn&#x27;t go as smoothly as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>It says its good to use as a primer too which I didn&#x27;t have this cc cream with my bb cream on for more than 5 mins cuz the white was over powering my skin Color which bothered me</li>
            <li>The formula is nice and smooth, the Silky one is very matte.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try my product out</li>
            <li>Goes on nice and smooth light feel and blends into your natural skin tone.</li>
            <li>Pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love this better than any other makeup I own.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments from people when I do a no-makeup-look that say my skin looks absolutely glowing.</li>
            <li>The product adjusted to match me really well, so I am sure it can for just about anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I just got my full sized tube</li>
            <li>It sets to a fairly matte finish, but I still like to set with a bit of sheer powder after because I have quite oily skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I found this because I have a lot of days where I go out to the grocery store, to lunch, or to see my therapist, etc, and I want some coverage but not too much</li>
            <li>So now when I go out for errands, I don&#x27;t have to do my full skin care routine + foundation, all I have to do is toner + cc cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m probably not using good enough moisturizer for this cream</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, my BB cream with more dense coverage is less visible than this one.  </li>
            <li>I love Etude House and I love their CC cream just as much as I love all of their other products.</li>
            <li>Another great pro is it&#x27;s very inexpensive, but the quality if product and packaging doesn&#x27;t feel low end at all!</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Vella Neck Tight Cream (that is how it is written on the jar) is absolutely the most remarkable of all lotions, potions, serums, creams, etc.  </li>
            <li>The cc cream stays on pretty good throughout the day although I do layer it up with some bb cream if I need to go out at night after work - just for some extra coverage.</li>
            <li>The applicator is a pump so it is very hygienic and easy to control the amount of product you want.</li>
            <li>The texture is little bit thicker than etude precious mineral bb cream, (another good product I recommend) but it is still easy to apply and looks super natural without any cakey kinda feeling, meanwhile, it brighten my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The packaging it also really pretty!</li>
            <li>I get compliments regularly and I&#x27;m sure part of this I owe to Ã©tude!</li>
            <li>This cream is great for covering but it leaves my skin dry and flaky and also it makes my whole face looks like a mask.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it so much that i plan 2 purchase oit.</li>
            <li>I just received my cc cream by etude house, the only thing I liked about it was the scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an NC30 with golden undertones and there&#x27;s no way I culd pass by wearing this without eye brows raised.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that it brings out my pink undertones (in a good way) and makes me skin glow.</li>
            <li>I think it is a product worth trying to see if it works for you as it has for me.</li>
            <li>She loves it too and it is not heavy like councilors, great for our Asian skin, if you have darker skin I suggest not getting it though because it will not match your complexion</li>
            <li>I just got this CC cream, and I put it on right away.</li>
            <li>and I do notice a positive difference in my skin after wearing this product for a day!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly how the hell</li>
            <li>I ordered this without looking at reviews first</li>
            <li>I love this cream, it goes on white at first</li>
            <li>After dancing and not touching up, I came back to flawless skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shipping was extremely  fast considering it was from Korea!</li>
            <li>be aware --</li>
            <li>I made my first review on this product when I first received it.</li>
            <li>also really like that it is SPF 30!</li>
            <li>Etude House never fails to impress on</li>
            <li>The product is also more of a medium-weight rather than lightweight and takes some time in order to blend in properly.</li>
            <li>Transitioned to CC because spf was higher than the BB and because coverage is lighter/can be built depending on needs.</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s my first CC cream purchased.</li>
            <li>love the fact that this is not only a make up cream but also nourish your skin</li>
            <li>It gives clean and clear skin effect.  </li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t last throughout the whole day and doesn&#x27;t cover my pores, I am still satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>many reviews said, it doesn&#x27;t have as much coverage as regular bb cream.</li>
            <li>- I have fair skin, and it matches my skin tone really well when I&#x27;m really pale</li>
            <li>Lasts all day, Blends out well, Looks very pale/white when first applied but keep blending and it blends in.</li>
            <li>I had a little sample of this that I used for 3 days and liked very much.  </li>
            <li>Though I found it incredible that this cream could make my black heads seem to disappear, it doesn&#x27;t work well for those with dry of combination skin.</li>
            <li>My skin won&#x27;t give a lot of products a break it will flare up with huge cystic acne the same day I first use a product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also got pretty sensitive skin too, I can break out from pretty much anything but no reaction yet!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Moisture - 2 stars - It doesn&#x27;t add much moisture back into skin, which is fine during the summer.</li>
            <li>Light, goes on smoothly, evens out the color a little bit.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li>but now I don&#x27;t use so much bb cream.</li>
            <li>It did what it was supposed to do, though, so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>I also have very porcelain skin</li>
            <li>I really like this CC cream</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>fast delivery, i received this product in 3 days.</li>
            <li>I really like this CC cream.</li>
            <li>Etude House shipped this item really fast</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>Too oily for combination or oily skin, I do think it does benefit your skin, but it is too oily to stick on your face for the whole day.</li>
            <li>its light and not too &amp;#34;white&amp;#34;  for my lighter asian skin tone.</li>
            <li>But, I will say it&#x27;s much lighter than Missha&#x27;s M BB</li>
            <li>I spread too much cream on the face.</li>
            <li>Coverage - 3 stars - It doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage.  </li>
            <li>A light, buildable coverage is just enough to even out my skintone and cover redness.</li>
            <li>This product is extremely smooth, looks completely natural and offers added sun protection.  </li>
            <li>This gives me nice coverage with out a heavy feeling and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>However, because of this creams high SPF and all of the benefits it said to offer I decided to give it a shot</li>
            <li>, if you want high coverage you should look for bb cream.</li>
            <li>To be honest I was not thrill with it and did not liked it.</li>
            <li>What I appreciate is that although it makes your skin a little lighter than it really is, it doesn&#x27;t have that dreaded grayish cast that I&#x27;ve experienced with some bb creams, instead it looks like your natural tone except slightly lighter.  </li>
            <li>This I wuld say is definitely better for pale skin.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>so if your skin is more tan/darker, I&#x27;m not sure how this particular CC cream will work out for you.</li>
            <li>I just want something light and simple and this cream makes that possible.</li>
            <li>It also has a very natural finish and doesn&#x27;t steel the radiance of my skin.</li>
            <li>It definitely doesn&#x27;t hide pores or acne scarring very much</li>
            <li>Cleaning it off and feeling it was pretty gross to see on makeup wipes or on clothes/pillows when I fell asleep.</li>
            <li>Other than that I love &amp;eacute;tude house and this is the only product going on my face</li>
            <li>Have you ever gone to the beach or out in the sun, put on maybe too much sunscreen and after endless rubbing still have that light film of white on your skin?&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>The box was a little squashed but the product itself was fine.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the amount of coverage that this product offers, but it isn&#x27;t caky and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got very splotchy red skin and after using this it&#x27;s completely smoothed out.</li>
            <li>I like how it seems to be clear at application but then blends to the skin tone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although some people think it is too white for their face, in fact, it really depends on people.</li>
            <li>My skin is combination and I used to suffer with adult onset acne.</li>
            <li>so my face is red at times, this really evens out my skin tone and brightens my skin.</li>
            <li>But after giving it a few more tries, I absolute adore it.</li>
            <li>I use it with the Etude House conditioning cream and they give me a natural look with brightened skin.</li>
            <li>I was surprised with this product.  </li>
            <li>It does not absorb completely and leave my face shiny and sticky.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t provide complete coverage</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I guess everyone is different because I&#x27;ve consistently had acne from 9 years old and up to my present 45 years of age.  </li>
            <li>I would say it is between a sheer and matte finish if I had to say one, but the feel of wearing it is like a high quality cream or primer.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t recommend for someone who&#x27;s looking for a high coverage or acne skin( it not gonna have enough pigment to cover your acne)</li>
            <li>Personally, I like to mix half a pump of the CC cream with a drop of light coverage foundation and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not chunky, or heavy feeling and has a tingly nice feeling during and a little after application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, but it feels a little thick and makes my skin seems a little pale (which isn&#x27;t good considering that I&#x27;m almost the lightest shade of foundation).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much flaws to cover on my face, my only concern is sallowness of my skin tone, so I found this enough for daily/normal occasions.</li>
            <li>and i used it as a daily sunscreen, giving my skin a very natural but glowing effect</li>
            <li>:) Not sure if I will purchase this in the future since I still want to explore different options.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just enough to smooth out my skin, cover red spots, cover blemishes and imperfect areas, and even adds a little glow.</li>
            <li>CC creams try and even out your skin tone to create a clear canvas -- which this product definitely does!</li>
            <li>I have not used it enough to say that the long term effects really happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been one who was very big into any sort of makeup, including BB or CC creams, because my face is just to sensitive.</li>
            <li>After application my skin has a natural dewy look, not shiny but not totally matte, so I apply sebum control powder after the cc cream</li>
            <li>, I am very pale and I have a cool undertone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like a miracle foundation or anything , but it is much lighter weight and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave my face feeling as yucky as other products.</li>
            <li>At first it may seem like your skin has turned very white, but the cc cream just needs to settle down onto your skin.</li>
            <li>Instead of coming on smoothly like most other creams, this one seems thick and harder to spread, and it felt very heavy on my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the date printed at the end of the tube is supposed to be the manufactured date or the expiration because if it happens to be the expiration (20150407), I might as well order it from eBay next time since the products there come directly from South Korea and have not been stored in the U.S. for fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It is a little chalky inconsistency and needs a lot of blending, but it really does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>and it is much too dark for me!  </li>
            <li>but I only dot a little on each area of my face, a little more on my cheeks as they become pink at times from rosacea</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Also works best with a primer under it, as it will still get clumpy even if you use a toner.</li>

            <li> It goes on my skin and keeps my skin feeling silky and wonderful all day.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, so I thought it would be a perfect product for me.</li>
            <li> , I look like having a nature flawless skin.&lt;br /&gt;During the time that I use this cc cream, my skin was irritate with an acne cream treatment that I brought, it make my skin feeling burn when I use cleanser,toner... &amp;#34;everything&amp;#34; and it did not happen to me before.</li>
            <li> The cream is perfect for me</li>
            <li> Impressed by how this cream works as well.</li>
            <li> Very good, like the color</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a great price.</li>
            <li> The great thing is?</li>
            <li> I ordered this from UniBella, my product came before the estimated arrival date which made me happy.</li>
            <li> So great customer service from UniBella.</li>
            <li> But the product wasn&#x27;t so great, just one day after using it, my skin started breaking out and peeling.</li>
            <li> Its great for the skin...</li>
            <li> the seller was great, I received it in about a week and a half.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a no-makeup kind of girl and this is awesome.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for reducing redness without the makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Great seller.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d found a great alternative to wearing pore-clogging sunblock on my face.  </li>
            <li> Feels great and lasts through the day.</li>
            <li> but honestly nothing has matched so perfectly!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m incredibly happy (which is good, since I&#x27;m also incredibly picky).</li>
            <li> I wear it alone as foundation and it blends perfectly into my skin tone while still providing a smooth even coverage that leave my skin looking beautiful unlike any foundation i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> But I love it and am really impressed by it.</li>
            <li> This CC cream is not going to work miracles, but it gives a fair coverage.</li>
            <li> Really good CC cream.</li>
            <li> so its good for those days</li>
            <li> and I am good to go.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a good CC cream and a friend recommended this from Etude House.</li>
            <li> I just put on some bronzer and Its good to go.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s a good CC cream.</li>
            <li> Coverage was good.</li>
            <li> If you like some more coverage, you could still put bb cream after this, and this cc cream would work as a great primer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes your skin look great without wearing &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34; so if you&#x27;re a guy with acne or redness, this product will make your face look better and improve confidence.</li>
            <li> I am very glad that I purchased this product</li>
            <li> Very light coverage, which I happen to love, but if you want more coverage, you can layer it under your foundation for all the great benefits of this product!</li>
            <li> When you use it ,  you will love it !</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> and I am glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love this CC cream!</li>
            <li> This is nice as a very light colour CC cream with a nice finish!  </li>
            <li> cream is good if you have a very light skin.</li>
            <li> I wish this didn&#x27;t happen because this product does a great job brightening my face and it feels so light on my face.</li>
            <li> your skin looks amazing.  </li>
            <li> This CC cream is Amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing</li>
            <li> I honestly use the bb cream as a concealer now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> chose &amp;#34;Silky&amp;#34; because I didn&#x27;t want a glitzy/dewy look that is popular in Korean products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s kind of trending</li>
            <li> Its nice that it has SPF as well for the days I don&#x27;t wear make up.</li>
            <li> If you need a good coverage you can probably use this as a primer and apply something heavier on top of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice product</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best CC cream!</li>
            <li> I put it on, smelled great, and my sister noticed the difference right away!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes perfectly with the Etude House Moistfull Lotion for light and fresh make up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, while the packaging is cute and I liked the concept, it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ã©tude for a while and by far their products are one of the best in the market.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE WILL BE REPURCHASING WHEN I RUN OUT!</li>
            <li> I like this CC cream, it has very light coverage</li>
            <li> Very light feeling and not greasy.</li>
            <li> It make my skin feel very Smooth</li>
            <li> and I LOVE the spf which is a super bonus!!</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using etude bb creams for about 4 years now.&lt;br /&gt;I started with their Magic one, then the Dear Girls line.</li>
            <li> so now I use the precious mineral.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The coverage is basically sheer, however, the lovely silky sheen is wonderful.</li>
            <li> WHen I opened my package I had an Etude House sample and the cutest letter with the most adorable stickers.  </li>
            <li> Better than my Lancome BB</li>
            <li> My skin looked and felt dewy after applying this CC cream and my complexion was much more even and</li>
            <li> Your skin will look like it has a healthy glow for hours.</li>
            <li> This cream evens out my tone perfectly and hides all of the redness that I get around my nose, my freckles, and the occasional pimple.</li>
            <li> It, somehow, makes my skin look really healthy and plump.</li>
            <li> problem that many people have had.</li>
            <li> I have read many reviews and bought &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; rather than #02 &amp;#34;Glow&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I like the matte finish much better)</li>
            <li> And,, like most korean products, it does make your face look</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> their service.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself IS FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t hesitate to pick up another one when mine runs out! :)</li>
            <li> I liked that this product went smoothly on my skin, but what I did not like was, it did dryed out my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure how it supposed to work.</li>
            <li> The product just spreads around more and seems like a mask.</li>
            <li> It was ok.  </li>
            <li> I just need a wee bit of concealer afterwards on the more redder parts of my face.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love Etude House products, they have been working great for my skin so far</li>
            <li> I was kind of hoping it would work really well with my skin, but to be honest</li>
            <li> This is great for all skin types, I believe, but I have oily/combination/ace prone and sensitive skin (rosacea).</li>
            <li> This product was too light for my skin, but it was ok since I blended it with another cc cream to match my skin.</li>
            <li> silky one gives more of a matte finish which I liked very much.(I</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly considering I have prime.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the slightly dewy finish that makes me look radiant.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s fine with me.</li>
            <li> (I have huge bags under my eyes).</li>
            <li> My whole face is a nice even color and not blotchy or read at all after using this.</li>
            <li> They even gave me a free sample.</li>
            <li> products feels so smooth and nourishing when you put it on your skin.</li>
            <li> so my skin is a light tan and after waiting a bit for the CC cream to adapt to my skin tone</li>
            <li> people may enjoy it, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> It went on smooth, has a matte finish and did not make my face oily.</li>
            <li> This cream is so light on my face that I often forget it is there</li>
            <li> I apply it with my fingers after my morning moisturizer and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t go as smoothly as I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> It says its good to use as a primer too which I didn&#x27;t have this cc cream with my bb cream on for more than 5 mins cuz the white was over powering my skin Color which bothered me</li>
            <li> The formula is nice and smooth, the Silky one is very matte.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try my product out</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and smooth light feel and blends into your natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> Pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this better than any other makeup I own.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments from people when I do a no-makeup-look that say my skin looks absolutely glowing.</li>
            <li> The product adjusted to match me really well, so I am sure it can for just about anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I just got my full sized tube</li>
            <li> It sets to a fairly matte finish, but I still like to set with a bit of sheer powder after because I have quite oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I found this because I have a lot of days where I go out to the grocery store, to lunch, or to see my therapist, etc, and I want some coverage but not too much</li>
            <li> So now when I go out for errands, I don&#x27;t have to do my full skin care routine + foundation, all I have to do is toner + cc cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably not using good enough moisturizer for this cream</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, my BB cream with more dense coverage is less visible than this one.  </li>
            <li> I love Etude House and I love their CC cream just as much as I love all of their other products.</li>
            <li> Another great pro is it&#x27;s very inexpensive, but the quality if product and packaging doesn&#x27;t feel low end at all!</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vella Neck Tight Cream (that is how it is written on the jar) is absolutely the most remarkable of all lotions, potions, serums, creams, etc.  </li>
            <li> The cc cream stays on pretty good throughout the day although I do layer it up with some bb cream if I need to go out at night after work - just for some extra coverage.</li>
            <li> The applicator is a pump so it is very hygienic and easy to control the amount of product you want.</li>
            <li> The texture is little bit thicker than etude precious mineral bb cream, (another good product I recommend) but it is still easy to apply and looks super natural without any cakey kinda feeling, meanwhile, it brighten my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The packaging it also really pretty!</li>
            <li> I get compliments regularly and I&#x27;m sure part of this I owe to Ã©tude!</li>
            <li> This cream is great for covering but it leaves my skin dry and flaky and also it makes my whole face looks like a mask.</li>
            <li> I enjoy it so much that i plan 2 purchase oit.</li>
            <li> I just received my cc cream by etude house, the only thing I liked about it was the scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an NC30 with golden undertones and there&#x27;s no way I culd pass by wearing this without eye brows raised.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that it brings out my pink undertones (in a good way) and makes me skin glow.</li>
            <li> I think it is a product worth trying to see if it works for you as it has for me.</li>
            <li> She loves it too and it is not heavy like councilors, great for our Asian skin, if you have darker skin I suggest not getting it though because it will not match your complexion</li>
            <li> I just got this CC cream, and I put it on right away.</li>
            <li> and I do notice a positive difference in my skin after wearing this product for a day!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly how the hell</li>
            <li> I ordered this without looking at reviews first</li>
            <li> I love this cream, it goes on white at first</li>
            <li> After dancing and not touching up, I came back to flawless skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shipping was extremely  fast considering it was from Korea!</li>
            <li> be aware --</li>
            <li> I made my first review on this product when I first received it.</li>
            <li> also really like that it is SPF 30!</li>
            <li> Etude House never fails to impress on</li>
            <li> The product is also more of a medium-weight rather than lightweight and takes some time in order to blend in properly.</li>
            <li> Transitioned to CC because spf was higher than the BB and because coverage is lighter/can be built depending on needs.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s my first CC cream purchased.</li>
            <li> love the fact that this is not only a make up cream but also nourish your skin</li>
            <li> It gives clean and clear skin effect.  </li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t last throughout the whole day and doesn&#x27;t cover my pores, I am still satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> many reviews said, it doesn&#x27;t have as much coverage as regular bb cream.</li>
            <li> - I have fair skin, and it matches my skin tone really well when I&#x27;m really pale</li>
            <li> Lasts all day, Blends out well, Looks very pale/white when first applied but keep blending and it blends in.</li>
            <li> I had a little sample of this that I used for 3 days and liked very much.  </li>
            <li> Though I found it incredible that this cream could make my black heads seem to disappear, it doesn&#x27;t work well for those with dry of combination skin.</li>
            <li> My skin won&#x27;t give a lot of products a break it will flare up with huge cystic acne the same day I first use a product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also got pretty sensitive skin too, I can break out from pretty much anything but no reaction yet!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Moisture - 2 stars - It doesn&#x27;t add much moisture back into skin, which is fine during the summer.</li>
            <li> Light, goes on smoothly, evens out the color a little bit.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li> but now I don&#x27;t use so much bb cream.</li>
            <li> It did what it was supposed to do, though, so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> I also have very porcelain skin</li>
            <li> I really like this CC cream</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> fast delivery, i received this product in 3 days.</li>
            <li> I really like this CC cream.</li>
            <li> Etude House shipped this item really fast</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> Too oily for combination or oily skin, I do think it does benefit your skin, but it is too oily to stick on your face for the whole day.</li>
            <li> its light and not too &amp;#34;white&amp;#34;  for my lighter asian skin tone.</li>
            <li> But, I will say it&#x27;s much lighter than Missha&#x27;s M BB</li>
            <li> I spread too much cream on the face.</li>
            <li> Coverage - 3 stars - It doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage.  </li>
            <li> A light, buildable coverage is just enough to even out my skintone and cover redness.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely smooth, looks completely natural and offers added sun protection.  </li>
            <li> This gives me nice coverage with out a heavy feeling and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> However, because of this creams high SPF and all of the benefits it said to offer I decided to give it a shot</li>
            <li> , if you want high coverage you should look for bb cream.</li>
            <li> To be honest I was not thrill with it and did not liked it.</li>
            <li> What I appreciate is that although it makes your skin a little lighter than it really is, it doesn&#x27;t have that dreaded grayish cast that I&#x27;ve experienced with some bb creams, instead it looks like your natural tone except slightly lighter.  </li>
            <li> This I wuld say is definitely better for pale skin.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> so if your skin is more tan/darker, I&#x27;m not sure how this particular CC cream will work out for you.</li>
            <li> I just want something light and simple and this cream makes that possible.</li>
            <li> It also has a very natural finish and doesn&#x27;t steel the radiance of my skin.</li>
            <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t hide pores or acne scarring very much</li>
            <li> Cleaning it off and feeling it was pretty gross to see on makeup wipes or on clothes/pillows when I fell asleep.</li>
            <li> Other than that I love &amp;eacute;tude house and this is the only product going on my face</li>
            <li> Have you ever gone to the beach or out in the sun, put on maybe too much sunscreen and after endless rubbing still have that light film of white on your skin?&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> The box was a little squashed but the product itself was fine.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the amount of coverage that this product offers, but it isn&#x27;t caky and looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very splotchy red skin and after using this it&#x27;s completely smoothed out.</li>
            <li> I like how it seems to be clear at application but then blends to the skin tone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although some people think it is too white for their face, in fact, it really depends on people.</li>
            <li> My skin is combination and I used to suffer with adult onset acne.</li>
            <li> so my face is red at times, this really evens out my skin tone and brightens my skin.</li>
            <li> But after giving it a few more tries, I absolute adore it.</li>
            <li> I use it with the Etude House conditioning cream and they give me a natural look with brightened skin.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with this product.  </li>
            <li> It does not absorb completely and leave my face shiny and sticky.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t provide complete coverage</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I guess everyone is different because I&#x27;ve consistently had acne from 9 years old and up to my present 45 years of age.  </li>
            <li> I would say it is between a sheer and matte finish if I had to say one, but the feel of wearing it is like a high quality cream or primer.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t recommend for someone who&#x27;s looking for a high coverage or acne skin( it not gonna have enough pigment to cover your acne)</li>
            <li> Personally, I like to mix half a pump of the CC cream with a drop of light coverage foundation and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not chunky, or heavy feeling and has a tingly nice feeling during and a little after application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, but it feels a little thick and makes my skin seems a little pale (which isn&#x27;t good considering that I&#x27;m almost the lightest shade of foundation).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much flaws to cover on my face, my only concern is sallowness of my skin tone, so I found this enough for daily/normal occasions.</li>
            <li> and i used it as a daily sunscreen, giving my skin a very natural but glowing effect</li>
            <li> :) Not sure if I will purchase this in the future since I still want to explore different options.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just enough to smooth out my skin, cover red spots, cover blemishes and imperfect areas, and even adds a little glow.</li>
            <li> CC creams try and even out your skin tone to create a clear canvas -- which this product definitely does!</li>
            <li> I have not used it enough to say that the long term effects really happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one who was very big into any sort of makeup, including BB or CC creams, because my face is just to sensitive.</li>
            <li> After application my skin has a natural dewy look, not shiny but not totally matte, so I apply sebum control powder after the cc cream</li>
            <li> , I am very pale and I have a cool undertone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like a miracle foundation or anything , but it is much lighter weight and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave my face feeling as yucky as other products.</li>
            <li> At first it may seem like your skin has turned very white, but the cc cream just needs to settle down onto your skin.</li>
            <li> Instead of coming on smoothly like most other creams, this one seems thick and harder to spread, and it felt very heavy on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the date printed at the end of the tube is supposed to be the manufactured date or the expiration because if it happens to be the expiration (20150407), I might as well order it from eBay next time since the products there come directly from South Korea and have not been stored in the U.S. for fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It is a little chalky inconsistency and needs a lot of blending, but it really does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> and it is much too dark for me!  </li>
            <li> but I only dot a little on each area of my face, a little more on my cheeks as they become pink at times from rosacea</li>
            <li> , I still felt like my face was slightly lighter than normal</li>
            <li> It takes a long while for this to oxidize, but it actually works well.</li>
            <li> The thing totally neutralized all the weird color defects and made it look smooth and uniform.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product is not for me, but it will be for you guys if your skin doesn&#x27;t break out so easily.</li>
            <li> I used it on half of my face first to compare it to the other uncovered half and it definitely makes a difference.</li>
            <li> As for the colors, it does take a little time to completely oxidize, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> have combination skin, sometime gets oily after a long day, so</li>
            <li> I can deal with that as long as the redness is gone.</li>
            <li> This is one product that I will continue to purchase as long as the continue to import it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did not return due to I open it already.</li>
            <li> I usually use Etude House products and made the mistake of purchasing a regular American CC Cream as an emergency when I ran out of my regular CC cream.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the company that originally brought this miracle cream to the USA is no longer doing so.  </li>
            <li> It clung to my dry patches even though I always moisturize beforehand</li>
            <li> It is not too drying on my dry skin and feels lightweight.</li>
            <li> Also, this product does cling on to dry patches.</li>
            <li> But when I used it, it left a white cast and it was too pale for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Not only that, but the cream also has a scent to it which was subtle, but I can see how maybe that could affect those who have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li> I am medium tan Asian complexion so it does have a slight lightening effect</li>
            <li> but it does make my red marks/hyperpigmentation look considerably less noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale naturally</li>
            <li> but it made my face appear way too white and a little sparkly</li>
            <li> I got a dead white face, not for me!  </li>
            <li> that you just want minimal coverage.</li>
            <li> At first I was very skeptical because I have incredibly sensitive skin and lately due to hormones</li>
            <li> The smell was fine for me, it wasn&#x27;t too &amp;#34;stinky&amp;#34; or unpleasant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, a little of it does go a long way and it does do some of what it says.</li>
            <li> (I went full arsenal crazy on my face and used a million products.</li>
            <li> was afraid of going away from a full face of bb cream coverage.</li>
            <li> It comes out white, all I do is used a small amount.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s does not feel cakey or look whitish as other users said.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, you may need to put your face lotion on before, but I had a small dry spot and it did not show with this CC</li>
            <li> Starts off a little white but settles into perfection within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> would recommend this for anyone who wants something to even out their skin tone without putting unhealthy products like foundation on everyday.</li>
            <li> Remember it&#x27;s not FULL coverage, just minimal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using less and less bb cream, my face has cleared up some.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s from the cream, but I think by using less face make up</li>
            <li> The covered half looks healthier and glowy and even.</li>
            <li> but it also itches slightly when I have it on throughout the day.</li>
            <li> this appears to be a little dark.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not full coverage,</li>
            <li> But a little goes a looooong way.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and the pump will draw cream too the last drop so waste of cream here!!!</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s cold outside and my nose turns red, it shows through as if I weren&#x27;t wearing anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little worried because the bottle is a little small.</li>
            <li> I was worried with being really pale that it would settle too dark/yellow</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a rather thin package, yet a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> still get a few blemishes randomly, but I seriously think the changes I&#x27;ve taken in my beauty routine have attributed to my nearly clear face.</li>
            <li> Now I do not like paying 3 times the amount, but I do it because it is truly unbelievably miraculous.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear alot make up because they usually make my skin break out.</li>
            <li> I was also sick of having to wear so much bb cream.</li>
            <li> It gives my skin a dull, ruddy tinge.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure how it does that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a couple reviews here stating that this cc cream is not good for oily or acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> i mean does brighten up your face, but if you were tan it will look weird</li>
            <li> but unfortunately my skin did not react well to it.</li>
            <li> May be it&#x27;s something wrong with my face</li>
            <li> Did all the crazy stuff you can find.</li>
            <li> This cc cream is really bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, it disappointed me..</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It takes a long while for this to oxidize, but it actually works well. Also works best with a primer under it, as it will still get clumpy even if you use a toner.</li>
            <li> Every time when my time is hurry, I always put it up. It can cover my pores and include everything I need.&lt;br /&gt;Although some people think it is too white for their face, in fact, it really depends on people.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting but it wasn&#x27;t this. My whole face is a nice even color and not blotchy or read at all after using this. I don&#x27;t know exactly how the hell this works but it goes on white and blends into your skin and just evens out everything. Love it.</li>
            <li> Five star ! ! !  When you use it ,  you will love it !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using etude bb creams for about 4 years now.&lt;br /&gt;I started with their Magic one, then the Dear Girls line. Both discontinued so now I use the precious mineral. My skin is combination and I used to suffer with adult onset acne. (I&#x27;m 29, didn&#x27;t get acne until 25!)&lt;br /&gt;I still get a few blemishes randomly, but I seriously think the changes I&#x27;ve taken in my beauty routine have attributed to my nearly clear face. (I went full arsenal crazy on my face and used a million products. Did all the crazy stuff you can find. Now I&#x27;m very minimalistic.)&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid of going away from a full face of bb cream coverage. I was also sick of having to wear so much bb cream. Cleaning it off and feeling it was pretty gross to see on makeup wipes or on clothes/pillows when I fell asleep. I have to wear makeup at work every night.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, decided to try the cc cream and see how it worked.&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff. Definitely not full coverage, but now I don&#x27;t use so much bb cream. I honestly use the bb cream as a concealer now.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using less and less bb cream, my face has cleared up some. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s from the cream, but I think by using less face make up it&#x27;s helping my pores not get clogged.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a long time. I ordered this back in June. Almost daily use and I&#x27;m about to reorder now in December so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I just got this CC cream, and I put it on right away. I love it! At first I was very skeptical because I have incredibly sensitive skin and lately due to hormones my skin has been less-than-normal looking. The great thing is? It works. All the blotchiness was rubbed out (heck! It even took some of the red out of a couple blemishes I have). The thing totally neutralized all the weird color defects and made it look smooth and uniform. It&#x27;s not chunky, or heavy feeling and has a tingly nice feeling during and a little after application. Even looking closely it looks like you&#x27;re not wearing any makeup at all. I&#x27;m incredibly happy (which is good, since I&#x27;m also incredibly picky). I&#x27;ll be getting this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I ordered this without looking at reviews first so I was nervous. I knew to expect basically no coverage. I just wanted to reduce redness and make it seem like I was wearing no makeup. This definitely helped with both. Although it doesn&#x27;t last throughout the whole day and doesn&#x27;t cover my pores, I am still satisfied with this product. At first it may seem like your skin has turned very white, but the cc cream just needs to settle down onto your skin. I am very happy with the slightly dewy finish that makes me look radiant. :) Not sure if I will purchase this in the future since I still want to explore different options.</li>
            <li> The coverage is basically sheer, however, the lovely silky sheen is wonderful. I get so many compliments from people when I do a no-makeup-look that say my skin looks absolutely glowing. Definitely will repurchase again!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this with another product I purchased. It&#x27;s nice, but it feels a little thick and makes my skin seems a little pale (which isn&#x27;t good considering that I&#x27;m almost the lightest shade of foundation). Instead of coming on smoothly like most other creams, this one seems thick and harder to spread, and it felt very heavy on my face. It did what it was supposed to do, though, so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> It has a white shade. Not even close to the shade showing online. Did not return due to I open it already.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, it goes on white at first then it matches/ corrects as its spread on skin.  Will definitely buy again.  It contains NO Paraben!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this from UniBella, my product came before the estimated arrival date which made me happy. They even gave me a free sample. So great customer service from UniBella. But the product wasn&#x27;t so great, just one day after using it, my skin started breaking out and peeling. I wish this didn&#x27;t happen because this product does a great job brightening my face and it feels so light on my face. Unfortunately this product is not for me, but it will be for you guys if your skin doesn&#x27;t break out so easily.</li>
            <li> This is nice as a very light colour CC cream with a nice finish!  I am, however, an NW15 shade and this appears to be a little dark.  If you are around a NW20 or NC20 shade this would be perfect for you!</li>
            <li> this etude house correct &amp; care cc cream is good if you have a very light skin. i mean does brighten up your face, but if you were tan it will look weird</li>
            <li> Its great for the skin... it goes on white so I use this as a primer for my makeup... I use tjis with the same company bb cream and it works wonders...</li>
            <li> I received this yesterday which is five days ahead of what the seller said the time it would take to get here. WHen I opened my package I had an Etude House sample and the cutest letter with the most adorable stickers.  I was so excited to try my product out so I put this on and headed out to the club. I used this product alone and only used concealer under my eyes (I have huge bags under my eyes). When I left it was about 8 pm and when I got back it was about 3 pm. After dancing and not touching up, I came back to flawless skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products feels so smooth and nourishing when you put it on your skin. It also has a very natural finish and doesn&#x27;t steel the radiance of my skin. I would say it is between a sheer and matte finish if I had to say one, but the feel of wearing it is like a high quality cream or primer.  I also have very porcelain skin, I am very pale and I have a cool undertone. The product adjusted to match me really well, so I am sure it can for just about anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone who wants something to even out their skin tone without putting unhealthy products like foundation on everyday.</li>
            <li> I just received my cc cream by etude house, the only thing I liked about it was the scent. But when I apply it, it comes on white, theres no color change when it&#x27;s suppose to have a tint in it. This cc cream isn&#x27;t even something I can use as a highlight. I&#x27;m an NC30 with golden undertones and there&#x27;s no way I culd pass by wearing this without eye brows raised. This I wuld say is definitely better for pale skin.&lt;br /&gt;But the seller was great, I received it in about a week and a half.&lt;br /&gt;It does glide on kinda like a powdery feel. It says its good to use as a primer too which I didn&#x27;t have this cc cream with my bb cream on for more than 5 mins cuz the white was over powering my skin Color which bothered me lol..hope this helps</li>
            <li> This product is not for people who are trying to get alot of coverage!! I am a no-makeup kind of girl and this is awesome. I have acne so my face is red at times, this really evens out my skin tone and brightens my skin. It smells wonderful. The packaging it also really pretty!</li>
            <li> Better than my Lancome BB</li>
            <li> The reviews I&#x27;ve read seem to indicate a misunderstanding (or misrepresentation by this listing) of this product. I bought this product while in Korea and was told it was a zero-coverage cream. It&#x27;s meant to be beneficial for the skin and reduce redness without adding any color whatsoever. I&#x27;ve used it often and it goes on like a moisturizer. No white cast, no color. It does even out my skin tone, however, and I&#x27;m not sure how it does that! It&#x27;s a great product for reducing redness without the makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BB creams offer coverage. CC creams are no coverage but offer redness reduction and evens the skin tone a bit.</li>
            <li> This cream is great for covering but it leaves my skin dry and flaky and also it makes my whole face looks like a mask.</li>
            <li> I love Etude House and I love their CC cream just as much as I love all of their other products. The shipping was extremely  fast considering it was from Korea!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about Etude House a lot and after seeing a video tutorial, I decided to take the chance and purchase this. I was on the market for a BB cream but decided a CC cream was probably what would suit my purposes more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the tube looks like a squeeze tube, the cap covers a pump which makes it easier to get the CC cream out. The CC cream comes out white and takes a while to adapt to your skin tone. I used a brush to even it out over my face. The consistency and smell reminded me of sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m of Asian descent so my skin is a light tan and after waiting a bit for the CC cream to adapt to my skin tone, I still felt like my face was slightly lighter than normal so if your skin is more tan/darker, I&#x27;m not sure how this particular CC cream will work out for you. My skin looked and felt dewy after applying this CC cream and my complexion was much more even and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note- when taking off the CC cream, I noticed the make-up remover cotton pad took on a tan/orange hue.</li>
            <li> I really like this CC cream -- I&#x27;m a big fan of Etude House products and this didn&#x27;t disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose &amp;#34;Silky&amp;#34; because I didn&#x27;t want a glitzy/dewy look that is popular in Korean products (it can often come across as oily rather than shiny). It definitely does this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes out as white but blends out to match skin tone so please don&#x27;t worry if you have darker or tanner tones -- it will work for you too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But be aware -- CC creams aren&#x27;t for coverage like a foundation -- that&#x27;s what BB creams do. CC creams try and even out your skin tone to create a clear canvas -- which this product definitely does!</li>
            <li> I made my first review on this product when I first received it. To be honest I was not thrill with it and did not liked it. But after giving it a few more tries, I absolute adore it. Not only for the packaging, but for the fragance it self. This CC cream is not going to work miracles, but it gives a fair coverage. It comes out white, all I do is used a small amount. Your skin will look like it has a healthy glow for hours. I will definitely keep buying this product. Thanks</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and smooth light feel and blends into your natural skin tone.</li>
            <li> CC cream promises wonderful things!  I got a dead white face, not for me!  Also felt grainy.</li>
            <li> fast delivery, i received this product in 3 days. it  has brightening effect and i used it as a daily sunscreen, giving my skin a very natural but glowing effect</li>
            <li> I enjoy it so much that i plan 2 purchase oit. It blends in with my skin color and protects me from the sun</li>
            <li> I usually use Etude House products and made the mistake of purchasing a regular American CC Cream as an emergency when I ran out of my regular CC cream. I broke out in pimples almost immediately with the American made cream. After that incident and my family and friends asking me what happened to my face I purchased this CC Cream and I love it!. It is a little chalky inconsistency and needs a lot of blending, but it really does what it is supposed to do. This cream evens out my tone perfectly and hides all of the redness that I get around my nose, my freckles, and the occasional pimple. This coupled with the BB Cream are definitely my go to makeup products.</li>
            <li> Helped my face not burn on summer days.  Really good CC cream.</li>
            <li> I really like this CC cream. It, somehow, makes my skin look really healthy and plump. I have noticed that it brings out my pink undertones (in a good way) and makes me skin glow. I&#x27;m very pale naturally so I don&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;white cast&amp;#34; problem that many people have had. Personally, I like to mix half a pump of the CC cream with a drop of light coverage foundation and my skin looks flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  also really like that it is SPF 30! That means I dont have to use a greasy sunscreen under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the texture of this cream, it dries with a plump, matte finish. So its definitely not a chalky/dry matte, which I like. It still feels moisturizing. Definitely going to repurchase when I run out.</li>
            <li> I have read many reviews and bought &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; rather than #02 &amp;#34;Glow&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;This silky one gives more of a matte finish which I liked very much.(I have combination skin, sometime gets oily after a long day, so I like the matte finish much better) The texture is little bit thicker than etude precious mineral bb cream, (another good product I recommend) but it is still easy to apply and looks super natural without any cakey kinda feeling, meanwhile, it brighten my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many reviews said, it doesn&#x27;t have as much coverage as regular bb cream. I didn&#x27;t have much flaws to cover on my face, my only concern is sallowness of my skin tone, so I found this enough for daily/normal occasions. If you like some more coverage, you could still put bb cream after this, and this cc cream would work as a great primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a rather thin package, yet a little goes a long way. This is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Though I found it incredible that this cream could make my black heads seem to disappear, it doesn&#x27;t work well for those with dry of combination skin. It makes your skin look even dryer--flakey-- even. And,, like most korean products, it does make your face look a bit whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, a little of it does go a long way and it does do some of what it says. I have not used it enough to say that the long term effects really happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may enjoy it, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Etude House CC cream for about a month and I absolutely love it!  This product is extremely smooth, looks completely natural and offers added sun protection.  I look forward to using it every time.</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a great price. Makes your skin look great without wearing &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34; so if you&#x27;re a guy with acne or redness, this product will make your face look better and improve confidence. Another great pro is it&#x27;s very inexpensive, but the quality if product and packaging doesn&#x27;t feel low end at all!</li>
            <li> I love it.  It gives clean and clear skin effect.  Great product! Great seller.</li>
            <li> Have you ever gone to the beach or out in the sun, put on maybe too much sunscreen and after endless rubbing still have that light film of white on your skin?&lt;br /&gt;Well yeah, that&#x27;s what your face will look like.&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s kind of trending so I guess it hit the mark.</li>
            <li> I like this CC cream, it has very light coverage so its good for those days that you just want minimal coverage. It looks white in color almost like your applying sunscreen, then it blends in to match your skin color.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day, Blends out well, Looks very pale/white when first applied but keep blending and it blends in. Gave 4 stars instead of 5 because the only issue I have is that if I don&#x27;t exfoliate well it can get blotchey</li>
            <li> Etude House shipped this item really fast and it was delivered before estimated delivery. Etude House never fails to impress on their service.&lt;br /&gt;The product itself IS FANTASTIC! I absolutely love this. I am throwing out all my BB creams. This is great for all skin types, I believe, but I have oily/combination/ace prone and sensitive skin (rosacea). I did not need a primer with this nor a finishing powder or even oil sheets. It went on smooth, has a matte finish and did not make my face oily. If you have dry skin, you may need to put your face lotion on before, but I had a small dry spot and it did not show with this CC cream.&lt;br /&gt;Heads up, it does come out white (out of the tube) but adjusts to your skin when you put it on. I had no issues with it matching to my skin tone!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely give it a try if you&#x27;re in the market for a CC cream. I also hear people are using it under BB cream/other foundation, so that can be an option for you as well seeing how it has the 8 different skin benefits!</li>
            <li> This is the best CC cream I ever used.&lt;br /&gt;The color blends perfectly, it&#x27;s does not feel cakey or look whitish as other users said.&lt;br /&gt;My complexion is color is light-olive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes perfectly with the Etude House Moistfull Lotion for light and fresh make up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been one who was very big into any sort of makeup, including BB or CC creams, because my face is just to sensitive. However, because of this creams high SPF and all of the benefits it said to offer I decided to give it a shot and I am glad I did! This cream is so light on my face that I often forget it is there and I do notice a positive difference in my skin after wearing this product for a day! I was surprised at the amount of coverage that this product offers, but it isn&#x27;t caky and looks very natural. I am very glad that I purchased this product and I won&#x27;t hesitate to pick up another one when mine runs out! :)</li>
            <li> I had a little sample of this that I used for 3 days and liked very much.  The formula is nice and smooth, the Silky one is very matte.  I thought I&#x27;d found a great alternative to wearing pore-clogging sunblock on my face.  But I just got my full sized tube and it is much too dark for me!  Even if I blend it in really well it looks like an orange spray tan.  It gives my skin a dull, ruddy tinge.  I&#x27;m so disappointed.  I will save it to use only as a peachy blush, when I&#x27;m wearing orangey colors.</li>
            <li> Light/barely there coverage, but smooths out my complexion. It can get stuck in my pores, so I use a primer before using this. I have oily skin and need to reapply this during the day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle. Everything you could ask for in a cc cream. I was a little worried because the bottle is a little small. But a little goes a looooong way. Starts off a little white but settles into perfection within a few minutes. I definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> My daughter likes this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a couple reviews here stating that this cc cream is not good for oily or acne-prone skin. I guess everyone is different because I&#x27;ve consistently had acne from 9 years old and up to my present 45 years of age.  My skin won&#x27;t give a lot of products a break it will flare up with huge cystic acne the same day I first use a product.  But this hasn&#x27;t happened yet while I&#x27;ve been wearing this cc cream and I am totally impressed.    No this cc cream doesn&#x27;t have pigment, unless you count white as a pigment.  What I appreciate is that although it makes your skin a little lighter than it really is, it doesn&#x27;t have that dreaded grayish cast that I&#x27;ve experienced with some bb creams, instead it looks like your natural tone except slightly lighter.  And I like that.    Yes it really does even out your skin tone but without the heavy foundation gooey feel.  I did try another cc cream but it made my face appear way too white and a little sparkly it was as if my face was reflective.  But not so with this cc cream.  After application my skin has a natural dewy look, not shiny but not totally matte, so I apply sebum control powder after the cc cream and I am good to go.  I think it is a product worth trying to see if it works for you as it has for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been months since I&#x27;ve purchased this, but I used it as a regular foundation.  It turned into my skin tone as i blended it in, and was perfectly matte, but not drying.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good CC cream and a friend recommended this from Etude House. I can&#x27;t praise it enough! I&#x27;ve got very splotchy red skin and after using this it&#x27;s completely smoothed out. I&#x27;ve also got pretty sensitive skin too, I can break out from pretty much anything but no reaction yet! It definitely doesn&#x27;t hide pores or acne scarring very much but that&#x27;s fine with me. I can deal with that as long as the redness is gone. I apply it with my fingers after my morning moisturizer and it goes on smoothly. I also use some finishing powder too to set it if I don&#x27;t plan on wearing make up as well, which makes it last almost all day for me.</li>
            <li> Too oily for combination or oily skin, I do think it does benefit your skin, but it is too oily to stick on your face for the whole day. I will not recommend it for some one with oily skin or combination type of skin.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it disappointed me..</li>
            <li> I love this CC cream! its light and not too &amp;#34;white&amp;#34;  for my lighter asian skin tone. The smell was fine for me, it wasn&#x27;t too &amp;#34;stinky&amp;#34; or unpleasant. As for the colors, it does take a little time to completely oxidize, but I don&#x27;t mind. I just put on some bronzer and Its good to go. Its nice that it has SPF as well for the days I don&#x27;t wear make up.</li>
            <li> I love this better than any other makeup I own. I wear it alone as foundation and it blends perfectly into my skin tone while still providing a smooth even coverage that leave my skin looking beautiful unlike any foundation i&#x27;ve ever used. It goes on my skin and keeps my skin feeling silky and wonderful all day. I&#x27;m definitely buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> Packaging came on time, product well packaged. This product was too light for my skin, but it was ok since I blended it with another cc cream to match my skin. I liked that this product went smoothly on my skin, but what I did not like was, it did dryed out my skin.</li>
            <li> Pretty satisfied. The box was a little squashed but the product itself was fine. Shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like Etude House&#x27;s CC Cream but unfortunately my skin did not react well to it. It clung to my dry patches even though I always moisturize beforehand (I use Apricot Oil and also use Shiesedo Senka sunscreen). It just made my skin feel even drier than it was despite moisturizing it and I could already feel my skin reacting badly to it only 10 mins after applying it. Not only that, but the cream also has a scent to it which was subtle, but I can see how maybe that could affect those who have sensitive skin like me. The product is also more of a medium-weight rather than lightweight and takes some time in order to blend in properly. But, I will say it&#x27;s much lighter than Missha&#x27;s M BB Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, while the packaging is cute and I liked the concept, it didn&#x27;t work for me and I ended up returning it.</li>
            <li> Light, goes on smoothly, evens out the color a little bit. I don&#x27;t need to cover up anything so it works for me quite well. If you need a good coverage you can probably use this as a primer and apply something heavier on top of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ã©tude for a while and by far their products are one of the best in the market. Transitioned to CC because spf was higher than the BB and because coverage is lighter/can be built depending on needs. Not greasy and the pump will draw cream too the last drop so waste of cream here!!! I get compliments regularly and I&#x27;m sure part of this I owe to Ã©tude!</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s a good CC cream. Well, it&#x27;s my first CC cream purchased. I&#x27;m not quite sure how it supposed to work. The white cream does change color to beige (as advertised it should match the face skin color). May be it&#x27;s something wrong with my face but this CC cream is quite visible, in fact it looks like a mask. Surprisingly, my BB cream with more dense coverage is less visible than this one.  May be I spread too much cream on the face. It&#x27;s nice product but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This cc cream is really bad. The texture is like sand mixed with water, moisturizer and tint. When you put it on your face it won&#x27;t blend well and it does not help cover up at all. The product just spreads around more and seems like a mask.</li>
            <li> Coverage - 3 stars - It doesn&#x27;t provide much coverage.  If I&#x27;m breaking out, you can still see the redness of the breakout.  If it&#x27;s cold outside and my nose turns red, it shows through as if I weren&#x27;t wearing anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisture - 2 stars - It doesn&#x27;t add much moisture back into skin, which is fine during the summer. Sometimes I have to use it in combination with a BB cream so my skin doesn&#x27;t get dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color - 5 stars - I have fair skin, and it matches my skin tone really well when I&#x27;m really pale and when I&#x27;ve been getting sun.</li>
            <li> My friend came to visit from Asia and gave me a sample to try of this CC cream. I put it on, smelled great, and my sister noticed the difference right away! So I bought it online and I&#x27;ve been using it for months and still have it! Will definitely be buying a second one, also bought it for my younger sister for Xmas! She loves it too and it is not heavy like councilors, great for our Asian skin, if you have darker skin I suggest not getting it though because it will not match your complexion but I suggest getting the bb cream as it does not look so white like this one. Other than that I love &amp;eacute;tude house and this is the only product going on my face</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly considering I have prime. I have an almost-used-up tube so I wanted to buy another one before I run out. I use it with the Etude House conditioning cream and they give me a natural look with brightened skin. The cc cream stays on pretty good throughout the day although I do layer it up with some bb cream if I need to go out at night after work - just for some extra coverage. It is not too drying on my dry skin and feels lightweight. Recommended if you don&#x27;t need a ton of coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the date printed at the end of the tube is supposed to be the manufactured date or the expiration because if it happens to be the expiration (20150407), I might as well order it from eBay next time since the products there come directly from South Korea and have not been stored in the U.S. for fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I like how it seems to be clear at application but then blends to the skin tone. I am medium tan Asian complexion so it does have a slight lightening effect but I only dot a little on each area of my face, a little more on my cheeks as they become pink at times from rosacea so the cc cream evens out my skin tone there. Very light feeling and not greasy. Feels great and lasts through the day. I would recommend this quality product.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with this product.  It goes on white.  However when you apply foundation over it......your skin looks amazing.  This is one product that I will continue to purchase as long as the continue to import it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vella Neck Tight Cream (that is how it is written on the jar) is absolutely the most remarkable of all lotions, potions, serums, creams, etc.  Use it once at night and you won&#x27;t believe your eyes when you look at your neck in the mirror the following morning.  Unfortunately the company that originally brought this miracle cream to the USA is no longer doing so.  And if you want it, you must purchase it from a third party and pay 3 times the amount.  Now I do not like paying 3 times the amount, but I do it because it is truly unbelievably miraculous.</li>
            <li> Very light coverage, which I happen to love, but if you want more coverage, you can layer it under your foundation for all the great benefits of this product!</li>
            <li> I like the smell and texture of that CC cream, however, it does not work too well with my combination skin. It does not absorb completely and leave my face shiny and sticky.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE WILL BE REPURCHASING WHEN I RUN OUT!</li>
            <li> It was ok.  Just didn&#x27;t go as smoothly as I thought it would.  Coverage was good.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, so I thought it would be a perfect product for me. The applicator is a pump so it is very hygienic and easy to control the amount of product you want. But when I used it, it left a white cast and it was too pale for my skin tone. I am around a n20-n25 on the mac scale. Also, this product does cling on to dry patches. The coverage is very low considering it is a CC cream, and wear time is around 4-5 hours before I need to start blotting. I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> This CC cream is Amazing. It make my skin feel very Smooth and I don&#x27;t need to put on Primer.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that this is not only a make up cream but also nourish your skin that&#x27;s what I always looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Spf 30 PA++ is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;When i put on my face my pores are all coverage, the make up look like no make up, I look like having a nature flawless skin.&lt;br /&gt;During the time that I use this cc cream, my skin was irritate with an acne cream treatment that I brought, it make my skin feeling burn when I use cleanser,toner... &amp;#34;everything&amp;#34; and it did not happen to me before. But When I use this cc cream on my face, I didn&#x27;t feel anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one things. The cream is perfect for me but I don&#x27;t recommend for someone who&#x27;s looking for a high coverage or acne skin( it not gonna have enough pigment to cover your acne), if you want high coverage you should look for bb cream.</li>
            <li> Impressed by how this cream works as well. The product comes out white, which is definitely not my skin tone, but manages to match my hue once spread out. Doesn&#x27;t provide complete coverage but it does make my red marks/hyperpigmentation look considerably less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best CC cream! It dispenses out white, and when you apply to your face it matches to your skin tone! I was worried with being really pale that it would settle too dark/yellow but honestly nothing has matched so perfectly!! It smells amazing and I LOVE the spf which is a super bonus!! A light, buildable coverage is just enough to even out my skintone and cover redness. I just need a wee bit of concealer afterwards on the more redder parts of my face. It sets to a fairly matte finish, but I still like to set with a bit of sheer powder after because I have quite oily skin. This makes my skin so radiant, I will never stop using this!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I love Etude House products, they have been working great for my skin so far and they are always affordable compared to designer brands. I&#x27;m really glad I found this because I have a lot of days where I go out to the grocery store, to lunch, or to see my therapist, etc, and I want some coverage but not too much you know? I just want something light and simple and this cream makes that possible. So now when I go out for errands, I don&#x27;t have to do my full skin care routine + foundation, all I have to do is toner + cc cream. It&#x27;s just enough to smooth out my skin, cover red spots, cover blemishes and imperfect areas, and even adds a little glow. I used it on half of my face first to compare it to the other uncovered half and it definitely makes a difference. The covered half looks healthier and glowy and even. Remember it&#x27;s not FULL coverage, just minimal. But I love it and am really impressed by it. The instructions says to use it after your regular skin care routine but using after just toner works for me.</li>
            <li> Very good, like the color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m probably not using good enough moisturizer for this cream but it goes on my skin flaky. Maybe it&#x27;s because I have sensitive skin but it also itches slightly when I have it on throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I was kind of hoping it would work really well with my skin, but to be honest it&#x27;s about the same as The Face Shop&#x27;s BB cream. It&#x27;s not like a miracle foundation or anything , but it is much lighter weight and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave my face feeling as yucky as other products.</li>
            <li> .  I don&#x27;t wear alot make up because they usually make my skin break out. This gives me nice coverage with out a heavy feeling and it lasts all day.</li>
