            <li>Love this tool</li>
            <li>GOOD DELIVERY EXACT ITEM</li>
            <li>The new roller I installed seems identical to the one that originally came with the callous remover -- and at a great savings.</li>
            <li>It easily sands off the overactive cell build up.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful</li>
            <li>I am retired and it makes it a lot easy on my pocket.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for anyone who is looking to easily remove callus with out breaking there backs to work</li>
            <li>Easy to replace into the appliance</li>
            <li>good price - use them with the plug in version of the micro pedi - highly recommend that product</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy more for any friends who would like one!</li>
            <li>These fit the emjoi fine and work well to give you smooth feet.  </li>
            <li>These fit the Micro Pedi</li>
            <li>Fit my Micro  Pedi .  </li>
            <li>my feet are so smooth</li>
            <li>This product actually works so happy that I went ahead and brought the item.  </li>
            <li>They work great &amp; with sandal season starting up</li>
            <li>Is gentle but effective in dealing with callouses.  </li>
            <li>try the more coase next time, but a good product.</li>
            <li>I loved that it cost less and does the job.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your ad at Amazon.com, it really is nice that you have a choice.</li>
            <li>I have tried the replacement roller, it does not do the job that the original roller did.</li>
            <li>The original issue&lt;br</li>
            <li>work ok, but it takes double time, as they are not as effective as the original emjoi brand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>quick and smooth.</li>
            <li>These are great for my incredibly dry Arizona feet.  </li>
            <li>These are great for dry heels and are replacements.  </li>
            <li>I thought I hqd the right one, and rally didn&#x27;t think the size would be a problem, just thought there was a choice between fine and course.</li>
            <li>just the right size and delivery was quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>The coarseness is not painful.  </li>
            <li>Price is good but probably will go with originals next time.  </li>
            <li>Worked great and as expected!</li>
            <li>This products wear off too quickly</li>
            <li>one can keep one&#x27;s feet up-to-date easily with this product in the privacy of home (no mean feat!).  </li>
            <li>First time I have replaced the original roller</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth trying.</li>
            <li>but the project is well worth the price</li>
            <li>Nice to get several in a package</li>
            <li>As good as expected I&#x27;d say..</li>
            <li>I like this Micro Pedi very much.</li>
            <li>I like the product very much and have bought one for a friend.  </li>
            <li>I would think twice about ordering the machine in the first place because of the replacement costs.</li>
            <li>I had hoped these would be more coarse than the ones that came with my Micro Pedi.  </li>
            <li>They did absolutely nothing for me!</li>
            <li>Plese Delete that first review by dj.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I love this little machine and these rollers work just fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;lasted much longer than this roller , which is inefficient in its first use.  </li>
            <li>The original rollers that came with the Micro Pedi did not perform well for the thickness of calluses I was trying to smooth down.</li>
            <li>By using the Micro Pedi with the course rollers, my feet feel much smoother and my stockings are saved.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;Received my order very promptly.</li>
            <li>the as the real ones.</li>
            <li>They worked very well.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Now I can go back to the smooth ones.  </li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>and I really like the convenience of using the product any time I need to.</li>
            <li>they will eliminate dry skin on your feet and leave your feet smooth</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what Extra Coarse meant</li>
            <li>they emjois  lasted much longer and took more dead skin  off.  </li>
            <li>Found cost high if replacement is needed so soon.</li>
            <li>LOVE my little rollers…</li>
            <li>I was surprised that this product works as well as the real thing.</li>
            <li>These little rollers are so amazing at quickly removing dead skin, and softening feet.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that it is a quality item for a decent price.  </li>
            <li>I purchased my first Emjoi Micro Pedi machine 4 months ago, since then purchased a second machine.  </li>
            <li>I use these every day and my feet are super soft, never cravked or dry?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why these rollers are advertised as &amp;#34;extra coarse&amp;#34; as they are sooooooo much smoother textured than the one that originally came with the micropedi.  </li>
            <li>They work very well and they are what I expected.</li>
            <li>Pedicures are nice but expensive and the Micro Pedi does everything it says it will.</li>
            <li>Having purchased other vendors&#x27; replacement roller packs, I had a much lower expectation of how these were going to work.  </li>
            <li>These rollers really do the job rough feet!</li>
            <li>only reason I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars is because  they fit a little loose.  </li>
            <li>No more dead skin on my feet any more.</li>
            <li>This roller replacements cost significantly less than the original rollers, but I notice that they are less corse and work not as well.</li>

            <li> My old, old feet get callouses all the time and my rough heels destroy stockings.  </li>
            <li> Will see how long they hold up.  </li>
            <li> Depending on how dry the skin on your heals is.  </li>
            <li> I would start with the course green and then use the blue for a final polish  </li>
            <li> Not true as they feel the same.  </li>
            <li> But if you aren&#x27;t such a bad case as I am, these will work fine.</li>
            <li> These are as expected.  </li>
            <li> I go barefooted a lot and have rough feet.</li>
            <li> I found that after using  only a couple times they were not very effective.</li>
            <li> I have very rough feet though</li>
            <li> These refils did not fit the heel sander that I also bought from Amazon.</li>
            <li> had always ordered the brand name, but decided to save a few $.</li>
            <li> I usually pay 19.00 for 3</li>
            <li> Maybe I recieved a bum product, or a defected one, not sure, but did NOTHING for my feet.  </li>
            <li> what I mean is remove the dead skin.  </li>
            <li> and I had used it at least 2 dozen times.</li>
            <li> They work just as well if not better than the originals!!!</li>
            <li> They work but are too expensive for my budget.</li>
            <li> Descriptions are vague.</li>
            <li> I got the coarse ones because my feet were in terrible shape.  </li>

            <li> They work but are too expensive for my budget.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what Extra Coarse meant but now I know that I need to order the next level up next time.  Descriptions are vague.</li>
            <li> WORKS!!! I can go 3 weeks between pedis during summer months. If I didn&#x27;t like to have polish I could go even longer. Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> These replacement rollers were just what I needed.  I love the Micro Pedi.  My old, old feet get callouses all the time and my rough heels destroy stockings.  By using the Micro Pedi with the course rollers, my feet feel much smoother and my stockings are saved.</li>
            <li> good price - use them with the plug in version of the micro pedi - highly recommend that product</li>
            <li> These fit the Micro Pedi I ordered online at a shopping channel.  The are just the right size and delivery was quick and easy.  I do think they are overpriced, however, this is what they are going for no matter where you purchase them.  I would think twice about ordering the machine in the first place because of the replacement costs.</li>
            <li> LOVE my little rollers….better than what a pedicure does for me and easy to clean… They do a great job!</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Emjoi Micro Pedi machine 4 months ago, since then purchased a second machine.  This rollers are perfect</li>
            <li> The new roller I installed seems identical to the one that originally came with the callous remover -- and at a great savings.</li>
            <li> This product is the answer to my psoriasis on my feet. It easily sands off the overactive cell build up.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;Received my order very promptly.</li>
            <li> I bought this item on a whim because my feet crack and callous up terribly.&lt;br /&gt;Not anymore. Took this on a Caribbean vacation didn&#x27;t even need to change to roller,&lt;br /&gt;and I didn&#x27;t need a pedicure!!</li>
            <li> These rollers are perfect for the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Callus Remover ... pop in, clean great, can be reused ... were shipped quickly ... am a happy customer ... and ... thanks!</li>
            <li> they are not as good the as the real ones. they emjois  lasted much longer and took more dead skin  off.  I will only buy the emjoi refills from now on.</li>
            <li> This roller replacements cost significantly less than the original rollers, but I notice that they are less corse and work not as well. but hey, they are so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Love the product and excellent price.</li>
            <li> They worked very well.  The coarseness is not painful.  Still feels like the originals.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars is because  they fit a little loose.  I have to keep my finger on the end so that it doesn&#x27;t rattle when in use.</li>
            <li> Having purchased other vendors&#x27; replacement roller packs, I had a much lower expectation of how these were going to work.  I was pleasantly surprised that it is a quality item for a decent price.  I would definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> I had hoped these would be more coarse than the ones that came with my Micro Pedi.  Not true as they feel the same.  But I do love y Micro Pedi.  Was just hoping for a extra coarse roller.  This is definitely not a extra coarse roller.</li>
            <li> These are as expected.  Fit my Micro  Pedi .  I like this Micro Pedi very much. Use it a lot</li>
            <li> This product I bought to replace rollers in my Callus Remover by Emjoi.They work very well and they are what I expected.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this product works as well as the real thing. I loved that it cost less and does the job.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your ad at Amazon.com, it really is nice that you have a choice. I am retired and it makes it a lot easy on my pocket.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Bonnie</li>
            <li> These little rollers are so amazing at quickly removing dead skin, and softening feet. They lasted longer than I thought they would. Love them!!</li>
            <li> I love this little machine and these rollers work just fine. No more dead skin on my feet any more.</li>
            <li> These are okay but they are not as good as the &#x27;official&#x27; ones from Emjoi.  I have very rough feet though so that may have something to do with it.  I will keep them but do not plan to reorder.</li>
            <li> These work as well as the ones that came with my MicroPedi.  It would have been nice of the manufacturers to warn users that none of them work if the skin is damp for any reason.</li>
            <li> These are perfect and such a great price. I stopped my auto delivery of the ones I was getting from QVC because these are just as good</li>
            <li> Worked great and as expected!</li>
            <li> These are great when it&#x27;s time to replace. Like that they come in packs of multiples. I do my wife&#x27;s feet with these.</li>
            <li> These are 5 star if you don&#x27;t need really coarse filing.  I read extra coarse and thought they would do the trick....not on MY feet they don&#x27;t!  But if you aren&#x27;t such a bad case as I am, these will work fine.</li>
            <li> fit and working perfectly. fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I usually pay 19.00 for 3 so this is a great deal to me. they will eliminate dry skin on your feet and leave your feet smooth I will order these again</li>
            <li> my feet are so smooth</li>
            <li> Great replacement rollers</li>
            <li> Wears out after one use.</li>
            <li> This products wear off too quickly</li>
            <li> this one does an excellent job smoothing out theold skin or what I mean is remove the dead skin.  My feet have not been better since using these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this product and just bought the replacement rollers as shown. I go barefooted a lot and have rough feet. Pedicures are nice but expensive and the Micro Pedi does everything it says it will. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This product works great for me. I would recommend this product for anyone who is looking to easily remove callus with out breaking there backs to work one there feet. quick and smooth.</li>
            <li> Thank you! Just as described!</li>
            <li> These rollers are great.  They will make your feet feel great.  Calluses are gone.</li>
            <li> These are great for my incredibly dry Arizona feet.  I use these every day and my feet are super soft, never cravked or dry?  I would hihgly reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> Price is good but probably will go with originals next time.  Will see how long they hold up.  Worth trying.</li>
            <li> They do not hold up. I found that after using  only a couple times they were not very effective. Found cost high if replacement is needed so soon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this when I purchased Powerful Emjoi Micro-Pedi Callus Remover, I have not yet tried them as the one that came with my order is still good.</li>
            <li> Depending on how dry the skin on your heals is.  I would start with the course green and then use the blue for a final polish  but the project is well worth the price</li>
            <li> GOOD DELIVERY EXACT ITEM</li>
            <li> Not as good as the EMJOY originals.</li>
            <li> Great!  Nice to get several in a package</li>
            <li> As good as expected I&#x27;d say..&lt;br /&gt;If it was any better it&#x27;d be perfect</li>
            <li> I like the product very much and have bought one for a friend.  A very nice alternative to a salon visit and one can keep one&#x27;s feet up-to-date easily with this product in the privacy of home (no mean feat!).  I will certainly buy more for any friends who would like one!</li>
            <li> These rollers really do the job rough feet!</li>
            <li> I have used the micro pedi for years and these refills are awful. They did absolutely nothing for me! disappointed</li>
            <li> These are great!!! They work just as well if not better than the originals!!! I was very happy with my purchase and they were delivered very quickly!!</li>
            <li> I have leather feet ad these work great!</li>
            <li> Really disappointed. These refils did not fit the heel sander that I also bought from Amazon. I thought I hqd the right one, and rally didn&#x27;t think the size would be a problem, just thought there was a choice between fine and course. Now I&#x27;m leery to purchase more.</li>
            <li> LOVE &amp;#34;EM LOVE &#x27;EM</li>
            <li> This product actually works so happy that I went ahead and brought the item.  Very pleased with my purchase.  I have and will continue to recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
            <li> These are great for callouses on your feet.  I got the coarse ones because my feet were in terrible shape.  Now I can go back to the smooth ones.  Thank you for great feet.</li>
            <li> i love my rollers for my micro pedi..They work great &amp; with sandal season starting up I got them just in time!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why these rollers are advertised as &amp;#34;extra coarse&amp;#34; as they are sooooooo much smoother textured than the one that originally came with the micropedi.  Maybe I recieved a bum product, or a defected one, not sure, but did NOTHING for my feet.  Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Works great. been using them for years. Can&#x27;t find anything better.</li>
            <li> This is an edit of the review I wrote before I tried it....Plese Delete that first review by dj.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have tried the replacement roller, it does not do the job that the original roller did. The original issue&lt;br /&gt;lasted much longer than this roller , which is inefficient in its first use.  It says Extra Coarse on the package,but is worn out after one INEFFICIENT use!!!  The replacement just DOES NOT DO THE JOB.&lt;br /&gt;Please send this review to the Micro Pedi company. and to THE PEDI STORE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******** P.S.&lt;br /&gt;This roller replacement is made by The Pedi Store!!!!! and The Emjoi Micro Pedi company tells me this is COUNTERFEIT.&lt;br /&gt;It is not the quality of their Replacement Roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should NOT be selling this product because it is a PHONEY and does Not Do The Job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I now RETURN this product??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dj</li>
            <li> These are great for dry heels and are replacements.  Not as coarse as you would think.&lt;br /&gt;Will try the more coase next time, but a good product.</li>
            <li> These fit the emjoi fine and work well to give you smooth feet.  Are the same as the roller that came with it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like these!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work ok, but it takes double time, as they are not as effective as the original emjoi brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had always ordered the brand name, but decided to save a few $.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with these rollers.  Is gentle but effective in dealing with callouses.  I do not find pedicures enjoyable and I really like the convenience of using the product any time I need to.</li>
            <li> Great replacement rollers.  Love this tool</li>
            <li> The original rollers that came with the Micro Pedi did not perform well for the thickness of calluses I was trying to smooth down. The Extra Coarse Replacements made the chore faster and easier.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace into the appliance and it does a great job.  First time I have replaced the original roller and I had used it at least 2 dozen times.</li>
            <li> These work like a charm.</li>
