            <li>Nice quality.</li>
            <li>The brush is a nice size as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Quality of this item was astounding.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice brush, but it does not seem to be 100% boar hair.</li>
            <li>Also good for lightly getting the bed head out of my buzzed hair on top</li>
            <li>I bought this Zeus Oval brush as a smaller version of another beard brush I own, thinking it would be perfect to have at work or in the car.</li>
            <li>It looks nice and classy and if you didn&#x27;t know brushing is good for the skin and to increase the rate of growth in hair as it massages the area when you brush!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m satisfied.  </li>
            <li>but I do know I love this brush.</li>
            <li>but it seems to be truly 100% boar hair and my beard has been getting more compliments since I stated using it to brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Probably better for &amp;#34;Grizzly Adams&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It feels more like plastic than boar hair, looks like it too, but</li>
            <li>This has to be my favorite beard brush brand.</li>
            <li>I love the cupped edge to the wood backing.  </li>
            <li>but this is a lot faster and more dignified.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I use it once in the morning before work after working some balm into my locks and it distributes any excess residue perfectly through my facial</li>
            <li>The size is great and it&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying this beard brush,  it helps exfoliate the skin also.  </li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Its smaller than I thought it would be, but now that I&#x27;ve had it a while its perfect.</li>
            <li>Even so, it fits comfortably in your palm, and is excellent for travel and overnight stays garnered by the gloriously maintained facial hair that this brush contributes to.</li>
            <li>It has a good amount of stiffness and doesn&#x27;t scratch the skin too much.</li>
            <li>It is concave and really lets your fingertips get a good hold on it.  </li>
            <li>great brush fits right in ur pocket fast shipping</li>
            <li>Great little brush high quality and it works, along with beard oil beard feels and looks so much better and feels great</li>
            <li>Great price, nice little brush.</li>
            <li>Perfect everyday carry or travel brush.  </li>
            <li>The product is so good that I would probably buy another one once my current brush looses too many hairs.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure to expect, being my first purchase for my mustache grooming kit.</li>
            <li>I am not an expert in animal hair or synthetic fibers, but I am pretty sure that the brush is NOT 100% boar&#x27;s hair as they describe it.</li>
            <li>but I WANTED a small brush when I bought it, so this is perfect).</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know if that normal for this type of brush.</li>
            <li>will work well for on the go, but I need to look further for a good beard brush to use at home.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually a good size for people starting to grow their beard.</li>
            <li>This is a very handsome brush that was slightly smaller than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>The brush works great on the tangles mess of a beard I have and appears to be well made.</li>
            <li>Great little brush.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying, even if just for a travel bag.</li>
            <li>Beard stays soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I found the size of the brush to be about the right size to keep in a vehicle.  </li>
            <li>the size is perfect, I just wish it was about half the coarseness like the larger brush</li>
            <li>but right now I can&#x27;t use much pressure around the more sensitive areas of my beard like the neck and moustache.</li>
            <li>Simple, easy to use !</li>
            <li>It is a lot more gentle on my beard than my wife&#x27;s brush since this one is natural and not plastic or metal.</li>
            <li>When using it near or around your mouth (as on your mustache )  ... it is easy to stick yourself in the nose with some of the rogue edge bristles.</li>
            <li>This boar bristle brush is *very* aggressive on first use, but softens with time!</li>
            <li>Perfect little brush for hair that is about 3-4&amp;#34; long.</li>
            <li>The bristles do not have a consistent texture, appearance, look, etc.</li>
            <li>It is the first brush that I have purchased for my beard.  </li>
            <li>A couple bristles fell out the first week but none since.</li>
            <li>I have a beard thats about 3&amp;#34;, and this is a great pocket sized tool to work oil or balm (i&#x27;ve used both with it) through your beard, and to brush it down and shape it before going out to reduce the stray hairs that make a beard look wild.</li>
            <li>Overall very good product, my only issue was that the board hairs would occasionally fall out.</li>
            <li>much more so than I expected.</li>
            <li>The stiffness of the brush is a bit too much for me.  </li>
            <li>If you really care about the health of your beard, take some time and purchase this baby.</li>
            <li>Gives my beard a very groomed look.</li>
            <li>He still liked it and used it everyday</li>
            <li>The perfect small little brush for keeping in my pocket.  </li>
            <li>Works for both full and short beards.</li>
            <li>way too small to be effective</li>
            <li>Appears to be high quality.</li>
            <li>High quality product.</li>
            <li>Feels good when you use it and its small enough to carry with you anywhere you go</li>
            <li>The wooden base is super smooth and feels great in the hand.</li>
            <li>Perfect size to work mustache too (its very small, much smaller than I expected,</li>
            <li>It has strong bristles that won&#x27;t get softer with time and this is all combined with a small carry size that can be taken anywhere without using any significant space such as pocket, suitcase or car.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little firm at first, but eventually softens up and really does a nice job shaping your stache.</li>
            <li>The brush seems a little small but works great.</li>
            <li>I use it a little more than daily.</li>
            <li>If that doesn&#x27;t bother you, and it only took a few days for it to not bother me, this is a great little brush.</li>
            <li>Compact and practical for my busy life</li>
            <li>I actually like this because I feel it exfoliates my skin really well underneath the beard.</li>
            <li>As far as the &amp;#34;Boar&amp;#34; part of the bristles goes, I&#x27;m not buying it.</li>
            <li>Ok, maybe not the strength of Zeus himself but this brush does mean business.</li>
            <li>Running it through the beard works well to tame the hair and to lightly scratch</li>
            <li>There is the same exact brush that&#x27;s the same brand</li>
            <li>Keep long beards in line, and help short beards flow the right way.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very firm and the brush is just the right size in my opinion, very portable.</li>
            <li>Very pretty brush, but much smaller than expected.</li>
            <li>The brush is nice and firm for when you want to tame those curly cheek crawlers.</li>
            <li>Maybe the 1% of bristles that appear to be natural are actually boar bristles, but the majority of the bristles are man-made.  </li>
            <li>My beard isn&#x27;t too long or thick, so I am able to massage the oil with my hands and then go over it with the Zeus brush.</li>
            <li>They are SUPER stiff and actually scratch your skin if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>Bristles are stiff - but seem like just the right stiffness.</li>

            <li> The brush is nice and firm for when you want to tame those curly cheek crawlers.</li>
            <li> Maybe the 1% of bristles that appear to be natural are actually boar bristles, but the majority of the bristles are man-made.  </li>

            <li> long.</li>

            <li> My only criticism is that the bristles are actually too dense, which seems to lead to less beard penetration in the thicker parts of my beard.</li>

            <li> (this is characteristic of synthetic bristles, according to what I have researched).</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than I expected, but I did not really look at the specs for the size, so that is my fault.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s a little smaller than i thought it would be though.</li>

            <li> As suggested by other reviews, I burned some of the bristles that fell out, and they appeared to melt instead of burn</li>
            <li> It wasnt excessive, but enough that I could notice.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great little brush. Perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure to expect, being my first purchase for my mustache grooming kit. It&#x27;s a little firm at first, but eventually softens up and really does a nice job shaping your stache. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to my friends...</li>
            <li> Sturdy little brush! I use it everyday and none of the bristles have fallen out.</li>
            <li> Very pretty brush, but much smaller than expected. I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the specs...very narrow, much more so than I expected.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I bought one as a gift and one for myself.  Perfect size as an EDC item.  I did need to trim some of the longer brush hairs.  The bristles are very coarse initially, but have softened a little with use.</li>
            <li> Has worked wonders helping tame my husbands beard and moustache.</li>
            <li> The brush is nice and firm for when you want to tame those curly cheek crawlers. Has enough rigidity to change the direction of your hair over time of use. Also good for lightly getting the bed head out of my buzzed hair on top</li>
            <li> as advertised - good quality</li>
            <li> Perfect everyday carry or travel brush.  Uncertain if the bristles are 100% boar&#x27;s hair, but I&#x27;m satisfied.  This brush is small, about 3&amp;#34; long.</li>
            <li> Exactly right for brushing your pride and joy!</li>
            <li> great brush fits right in ur pocket fast shipping</li>
            <li> Not 100% boar bristle at all. It is still an effective beard brush, I&#x27;m just getting tired of all the false advertising on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know real boar hair from fake but I do know I love this brush. It feels great for the beard scratches and keeps my whiskers in line.</li>
            <li> Great comb!! Feels good when you use it and its small enough to carry with you anywhere you go</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small. Probably smaller smaller than you imagine, but it seems to be truly 100% boar hair and my beard has been getting more compliments since I stated using it to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great pocket brush.</li>
            <li> This thing is TINY!  It&#x27;s only a few inches long.  It works well, though.  Absorbs beard oil onto bristles and transfers oil to beard.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Size is perfect.</li>
            <li> The brush is good quality. It is a bit small. I didn&#x27;t see measurements on the web site. If it had the measurements posted I woul give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this brush, helps distribute product through my beard.</li>
            <li> This is not 100% boar bristle.  Maybe the 1% of bristles that appear to be natural are actually boar bristles, but the majority of the bristles are man-made.  They melt when tested with a lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it&#x27;s tiny.  If you have a substantial beard, this will not do.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Works for both full and short beards. Keep long beards in line, and help short beards flow the right way.</li>
            <li> Very firm bristles, and feels like plastic.  Probably better for &amp;#34;Grizzly Adams&amp;#34; types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks nice though.</li>
            <li> Compact and practical for my busy life</li>
            <li> This brush is about the size of a thumb. I obviously didn&#x27;t pay enough attention to the size description, but that&#x27;s my fault, not the product&#x27;s. I am not an expert in animal hair or synthetic fibers, but I am pretty sure that the brush is NOT 100% boar&#x27;s hair as they describe it. The bristles do not have a consistent texture, appearance, look, etc. to indicate they are from the same type of animal. As suggested by other reviews, I burned some of the bristles that fell out, and they appeared to melt instead of burn (this is characteristic of synthetic bristles, according to what I have researched). The brush is a great size for travel and based on the length of my beard, it will be sufficient, but it&#x27;s not an ideal brush for my needs. Aside from the bristle content, the brush is great. Running it through the beard works well to tame the hair and to lightly scratch/buff the underlying skin in a pleasant way. I do like the brush and its size will work well for on the go, but I need to look further for a good beard brush to use at home.</li>
            <li> As described. Feels well made. I prefer the smaller size as I do not have a very long beard.</li>
            <li> Nice brush and good quality.  It is a good size that I like.  It is the first brush that I have purchased for my beard.  It is a lot more gentle on my beard than my wife&#x27;s brush since this one is natural and not plastic or metal.</li>
            <li> Love this! I had to buy another one to have it on the go. I read a previous review about the size and it got me worried. It&#x27;s actually a good size for people starting to grow their beard. If the beard is just starting to leave your face, this is for you. Once I have a fuller beard I&#x27;ll test it to see if it works well. I&#x27;m assuming the brush would have to be a bit larger but time will have to tell.</li>
            <li> VERY stiff. I don&#x27;t know if a review can properly express this,but the bristles are VERY stiff. If that doesn&#x27;t bother you, and it only took a few days for it to not bother me, this is a great little brush. It feels more like plastic than boar hair, looks like it too, but w/e. I have a beard thats about 3&amp;#34;, and this is a great pocket sized tool to work oil or balm (i&#x27;ve used both with it) through your beard, and to brush it down and shape it before going out to reduce the stray hairs that make a beard look wild. Perfect size to work mustache too (its very small, much smaller than I expected, but I WANTED a small brush when I bought it, so this is perfect). Great price, nice little brush. Definitely worth buying, even if just for a travel bag.</li>
            <li> This brush feels quality. It serves its function nearly perfectly. My only criticism is that the bristles are actually too dense, which seems to lead to less beard penetration in the thicker parts of my beard. Otherwise, this is a very nice beard brush.</li>
            <li> This is a quality boar bristle beard brush. A lot smaller than I expected, but I did not really look at the specs for the size, so that is my fault. But I have no problems with it. My beard isn&#x27;t too long or thick, so I am able to massage the oil with my hands and then go over it with the Zeus brush. It has a good amount of stiffness and doesn&#x27;t scratch the skin too much. I am still planning on growing my beard, and I believe this will do the trick.</li>
            <li> The brush works great on the tangles mess of a beard I have and appears to be well made.</li>
            <li> This is a good looking brush. It is small enough to fit discretely in your pocket so you can tame the beast at a moments notice.</li>
            <li> This is a very handsome brush that was slightly smaller than I thought it would be. Despite the size it works well. My only gripe is that it seems it loses bristles frequently. I honestly don&#x27;t know if that normal for this type of brush.</li>
            <li> Great little brush high quality and it works, along with beard oil beard feels and looks so much better and feels great</li>
            <li> This boar bristle brush is *very* aggressive on first use, but softens with time! As other reviews have mentioned, it is fairly small. Even so, it fits comfortably in your palm, and is excellent for travel and overnight stays garnered by the gloriously maintained facial hair that this brush contributes to.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Perfect size.</li>
            <li> Perfect size to have at home or take in the dop kit while travelling.  Bristles are stiff - but seem like just the right stiffness.</li>
            <li> This has to be my favorite beard brush brand. A lot of my friends suggested I should get a brush for my beard and after reading the reviews I went with this one. It is in fact pretty small but I find it to work well as a pocket/car brush. There is the same exact brush that&#x27;s the same brand and  significantly bigger if you want a &amp;#34;home brush&amp;#34;. Warning though, the bristles are very firm. I actually like this because I feel it exfoliates my skin really well underneath the beard. However, I know that some people don&#x27;t like a firm brush. If you&#x27;re looking for a medium style brush then get the synthetic brush by the same brand.</li>
            <li> The perfect small little brush for keeping in my pocket.  Great for my beard.  I love the cupped edge to the wood backing.  It is concave and really lets your fingertips get a good hold on it.  Nice quality.</li>
            <li> The brush seems a little small but works great. It evenly distributed the beard balm I purchased with it.</li>
            <li> Simple, easy to use ! nice ! I was using a towel for a while but this is a lot faster and more dignified. now I can feel like a legend.</li>
            <li> Works well with my longer beard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not real fond of this brush. Part of the description is correct, the handle is made from wood.  As far as the &amp;#34;Boar&amp;#34; part of the bristles goes, I&#x27;m not buying it. I found the size of the brush to be about the right size to keep in a vehicle.  The stiffness of the brush is a bit too much for me.  I noticed some of the bristles falling out &amp; decided to see if it would burn like hair does or melt like plastic.  It melted.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday. Firm bristles that don&#x27;t fall out when brushing. My beard hasn&#x27;t complained yet!</li>
            <li> The bristles are very firm and the brush is just the right size in my opinion, very portable.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I use it a little more than daily. I, like others who have rated this product, didn&#x27;t think thoroughly of what a 3&amp;#34; by 1&amp;#34; brush in an oval shape would consist of, but it hasn&#x27;t changed my affinity for this product. I know it is meant for beards and mustaches, but I use it for my entire dome.</li>
            <li> Really small. Not worth the price in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Uncomfortably stiff and painful to use against the skin. Reminds me of a wire brush I need to take long breaks between groomings in order to preserve the skin under my beard.</li>
            <li> I blame myself for not reading the measurement since they are listed. So my bf loves it, just wishes it was bigger.</li>
            <li> The brush is a nice size as advertised.  The bristles are a bit tougher than I expected,  might be used to it later but right now I can&#x27;t use much pressure around the more sensitive areas of my beard like the neck and moustache.</li>
            <li> way too small to be effective</li>
            <li> This little dude was by far the smartest purchase I&#x27;ve made in some time. If you really care about the health of your beard, take some time and purchase this baby. I use it once in the morning before work after working some balm into my locks and it distributes any excess residue perfectly through my facial forest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, invest in your face and snag one of these beautiful brushes!</li>
            <li> I bought this Zeus Oval brush as a smaller version of another beard brush I own, thinking it would be perfect to have at work or in the car. The size is great and it&#x27;s very convenient. The issue I have is with the boar bristles themselves. They are SUPER stiff and actually scratch your skin if you are not careful. When using it near or around your mouth (as on your mustache )  ... it is easy to stick yourself in the nose with some of the rogue edge bristles. NOT cool. Again ... the size is perfect, I just wish it was about half the coarseness like the larger brush I have that I use at home.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, nice look and great brush for on the go brushing, doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.</li>
            <li> Have only had it for a few days. Appears to be high quality. Perfect size. No complaints. If you have a thick beard and use beard oil regularly then a brush like this is a must.</li>
            <li> this is awesome! it&#x27;s a little smaller than i thought it would be though. the bristles seem to be good quality none have came out yet.</li>
            <li> Perfect little brush for hair that is about 3-4&amp;#34; long. Brush is tiny and I couldn&#x27;t imagine using it on a really long, thick beard. Works perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this beard brush,  it helps exfoliate the skin also.  Gives my beard a very groomed look.</li>
            <li> Quality of this item was astounding. Bristles on the brush are sturdy and do not fall out when used. The wooden base is super smooth and feels great in the hand. I would purchase for a friend and family who have manly beards!</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe not the strength of Zeus himself but this brush does mean business. It has strong bristles that won&#x27;t get softer with time and this is all combined with a small carry size that can be taken anywhere without using any significant space such as pocket, suitcase or car. It looks nice and classy and if you didn&#x27;t know brushing is good for the skin and to increase the rate of growth in hair as it massages the area when you brush!</li>
            <li> Great feeling when using this brush for your beard. Beard stays soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Great brush, I bought it as a gift for my fiance and he really liked it,  i was silly by not reading the description, and when the package came in, it was so small since I was hoping for a hair brush. But! He still liked it and used it everyday</li>
            <li> The bristles are way too firm. Its like a steel brush.</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied.  High quality product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice brush, but it does not seem to be 100% boar hair.</li>
            <li> He loves it, so I am happy.</li>
            <li> Overall very good product, my only issue was that the board hairs would occasionally fall out. It wasnt excessive, but enough that I could notice. The product is so good that I would probably buy another one once my current brush looses too many hairs.</li>
            <li> Its smaller than I thought it would be, but now that I&#x27;ve had it a while its perfect. Quality is awesome. Works great!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed--seeing less straggly beard hairs over time.  A couple bristles fell out the first week but none since.</li>
