            <li>I purchased gel ones on Amazon and it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li>Okay for what I needed.  </li>
            <li>if you remove them without care they break easily.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable to wear also.</li>
            <li>They are cheap, but they help to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I originally rated it as a 1 because I had never received it after a month had gone by.  </li>
            <li>(it took about 20 days, not bad), then this is for you.</li>

            <li> were squished (and I was trying to fix but broke one trying to smooth it out) in some areas due to probably other things sitting on the small package</li>
            <li> so thin they barely even helped with the first pedicure.  </li>
            <li> I specifically ordered pink ones and instead I received blue.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how, but I received these the very next day after ordering.</li>
            <li> but they were out of shape due to the shipping</li>
            <li> They are a bit flimsy (so don&#x27;t pull hard on them) but will do the job for short wear while polishing&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li> It does not fit my preference.</li>
            <li> Very poor condition.</li>
            <li> A disappointed customer</li>

            <li> I will not but these again. They&#x27;re very flimsy and only a one time use. I purchased gel ones on Amazon and it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li> They may be funny looking but they are a great way to not have your toes smear. They are comfortable to wear also.</li>
            <li> Don’t touch my toes with polish! These are gonna be great as one of her stocking stuffers. She’s needed these for a while. I’m glad she didn’t already buy some and ruin Christmas! :)</li>
            <li> they are useful , they do their job of separating the toes during pedicures ...but they are fragile. if you remove them without care they break easily. but good deal for the money.</li>
            <li> I originally rated it as a 1 because I had never received it after a month had gone by.  After corresponding with the seller, they resent it and I did receive it.  The reason I gave it only 3 stars is that it comes from China, so it takes a lot longer to receive the item.</li>
            <li> Cute on their little toes</li>
            <li> I am not sure how, but I received these the very next day after ordering. I wear a 6.5 in women&#x27;s shoes, and these work well for me. They&#x27;re soft and pliable. I would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> they are good and does the work</li>
            <li> Great products, except that I Received blue color instead pink.</li>
            <li> Great product but they were out of shape due to the shipping otherwise was very happy with them !</li>
            <li> They are a bit flimsy (so don&#x27;t pull hard on them) but will do the job for short wear while polishing&lt;br /&gt;Mine were squished (and I was trying to fix but broke one trying to smooth it out) in some areas due to probably other things sitting on the small package&lt;br /&gt;But for the price and one time use, I like them</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so flimsy,  they don&#x27;t actually separate your toes.  I should have guessed from the price.</li>
            <li> When I received them they were damage mash together. Very poor condition. A disappointed customer</li>
            <li> Okay for what I needed.  Fast wervice</li>
            <li> They are as good as the price I paid for them. They are cheap, but they help to get the job done. I often use them twice before they break. If you don&#x27;t mind waiting for them to arrive (it took about 20 days, not bad), then this is for you.</li>
            <li> Pretty small in size and pretty flimsy but I&#x27;m sure they will work fine, these would be nice for a little girl spa party or for a little girl gift bag at a party or something to that effect!!</li>
            <li> I specifically ordered pink ones and instead I received blue. It does not fit my preference.</li>
            <li> so thin they barely even helped with the first pedicure.  was completely flattened after 1 use.  so, consider these 1 use disposables.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT SELLER.ON TIME</li>
