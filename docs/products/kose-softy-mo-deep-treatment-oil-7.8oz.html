    <ol>
            <li>I am very happy</li>
            <li>The best cleansing / makeup removing oil I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I read this excellent seller rating of this Kose Cleansing Oil, and I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great!!</li>
            <li>This is the perfect (inexpensive) oil for that.</li>
            <li>Yes it smells wonderful and would use this for the rest of my life, but I want to know what assurances do I have that purchasing a product</li>
            <li>I have repurchased and will probably continue doing so just because it&#x27;s an awesome product.</li>
            <li>Not my best purchase.</li>

            <li>Excellent!!</li>
            <li>but besides that it takes everything off PERFECTLY.</li>
            <li>I was using one of the Shu Uemura cleansing oil and as this product is a best seller in Japan, I thought I could it a try.</li>

            <li>Awesome at removing waterproof mascera!</li>

            <li>Not the best.</li>
            <li>it cleans off anything stubborn and especially great for waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>best way to take off mascara!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy at all after you rinse it, but it removes waterproof makeup excellently.</li>
            <li>too oily for me, and doesn&#x27;t do very good job either.</li>
            <li>Really good at dissolving dirt, I can feel the grits getting worked out of my pores when I use this!</li>
            <li>Great cleansing oil</li>
            <li>It does a great job of removing the makeup</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with how effective it is.</li>
            <li>Removes makeup, works with my Mia, and my son uses it for his acne prone skin and gets great results.</li>
            <li>but like make up remover it great...</li>
            <li>and it does a really great job with removing my waterproof makeup and sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It works great and I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li>This is a great cleansing oil.</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>Packaging not as attractive,</li>
            <li>I thought it was great, but will not purchase again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great quality of cleansing oil,</li>
            <li>I use this oil to remove the makeup from my face and it works great.  </li>
            <li>great replacement t for M.A.C. cleanse off gel</li>
            <li>and itâ€™s a great value at this price</li>
            <li>Works great</li>

            <li>This is a really great product.</li>
            <li>It seemed to do a great job removing my make up.</li>
            <li>And I can say this product is great.</li>
            <li>This is a seriously amazing regiment!    </li>
            <li>nicely removing make up things, even eyeliner too!</li>
            <li>Note you must use another cleanser after this because cleansing oils are not meant to be used on their own!</li>
            <li>To use this product successfully you must follow these steps:  1.</li>
            <li>My skin felt great, looked shiny, and very healthy.</li>
            <li>Really a great product and an amazing deal.</li>
            <li>it does a good job</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used an oil cleanser before but heard good things about the DHC cleansing oil.</li>
            <li>It is good to its price.</li>
            <li>Not quite as good as dhc</li>
            <li>Good for removing makeups</li>
            <li>this is just as good  cheaper</li>
            <li>it was a good dupe.</li>
            <li>and she loved it.  </li>
            <li>Good for price.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work that great on its own.</li>
            <li>I am good friends with a girl (about my age) who is from Korea but visits the USA often.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for a good 2 months before going for this review, and I must say...</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for a good 2 months before going for this review, and I must say...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no problems with offensive odors nor skin/eye irritations and it does a good job removing my make up.</li>
            <li>but I find that Kose&#x27;s version does a good job.</li>
            <li>This works perfectly to dissolve a full face of waterproof sunscreen and/or makeup.</li>
            <li>It does effectively remove eye makeup and has a pleasant smell</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, it&#x27;s a great addition to any skincare routine.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful first step in a cleansing routine.</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this oil!</li>
            <li>It emulsifies well, but as a tip: be sure to follow this cleanser up with either a foaming or a milk cleanser, to get the best clean face.</li>
            <li>It does have a very pleasant smell, but I do not believe it is as effective as the higher price brand.</li>
            <li>(if you can get the Aquamoist bubble wash, it&#x27;s amazing -- has hyaluronic acid which is amazing for moisturization)</li>
            <li>They have truly amazing products.</li>
            <li>The bright sunny packaging is cute to.</li>
            <li>effective was it?&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it felt about 80% effective as DHC&#x27;s product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This two-step process was effective at removing sunblock for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gotta wash it off with warm water, ladies-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice orange smell too.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice scent</li>
            <li>I use a make up remover, THEN use this for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>I made me own by combining water, olive oil and aloe vera  in a bottle.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving oils in everything -- in this cleanser and in bio oil.  </li>
            <li>This method is not aggressive for the skin as you do not use cotton ball etc but oil to lift the make up and your own skin to rub the product.</li>
            <li>So I wondered what kind of cheaper options were out there</li>
            <li>But I honestly think it does the job as well as the DHC one.</li>
            <li>Rub/massage it in for 1-2 min then after that, rinse with warm water - it&#x27;ll emulsify and look milky.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a nice Oil Cleanser to help remove my make up at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I liked the feel and the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>Love that I can buy it off Amazon, and price is good (though it used to be like $11...</li>
            <li>It is so satisfying to literally be able to see it unclogging my pores!</li>
            <li>I prefer this to DHC, more cost effective and works just as well.  </li>
            <li>The Kose oil has a nice orange scent but it&#x27;s much more oily on my skin and doesn&#x27;t rinse off with water like the DHC oil does.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see, but so far everything has been great!</li>
            <li>Liked it better than Bobbi Brown and MAC as well.  </li>
            <li>By far the best makeup remover I have ever used and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or skin</li>
            <li>By far, the best cleansing oil I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Great for double cleansing and great price.</li>
            <li>It is a great first step to my evening</li>
            <li>It was a great first step to remove the bulk of my face make up</li>
            <li>This oil works great as a first step cleanser.</li>
            <li>Most good cleansing oils are supposed to make you feel clean after and remove all the dirt for your face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to wash off, and it does leave my face feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>I will buy more when I mine is all gone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You pump the oil into your hands, massage them on your face for about a minute to rub the makeup out, then (the most important step), you wash your face with warm water.</li>
            <li>SU product would be the best removing white heads</li>
            <li>This seems to one of the more inexpensive cleansing oils for it size and it delivers.</li>
            <li>I love this product, makeup melts away</li>
            <li>It feels better than that one.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I decided to purchase this product as many say that it is comparable to the DHC cleansing oil.</li>
            <li>the King sooper makeup remover does much better job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several cleansing oils over the years and this one is the best value for the money.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful cleanser for removing makeup and for daily use.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Its so amazing and leaves my skin so silky and smooth</li>
            <li>Work very well and also great price .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using DHC Oil Cleanser for over 10 years and love how it removes makeup so well.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m OK with that for a $6 savings per bottle.</li>
            <li>I still feel conflicted over my $11 purse :) )</li>
            <li>Works better than Shiseido and Origins.  </li>
            <li>should probably also mention that I have worked in the cosmetics/skincare industry for over a decade and have a lot of experience with many brands.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>love using this stuff for my double-cleansing method.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad I gave it a try because I can now put the search of finding &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34; to rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Seems most that dislike this one have been using the DHC cleanser for a while and ended up trying this one for the price because it was recommended as a &amp;#34;dupe&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Seems most that dislike this one have been using the DHC cleanser for a while and ended up trying this one for the price because it was recommended as a &amp;#34;dupe&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use a cleanser afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this oil cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I was totally satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li>Excellent for using privately.</li>
            <li>The Speedy Cleansing oil also made by Kose is MUCH better-</li>
            <li>Sometimes if I do use this and a cleanser and do not apply a moisturizer I will feel a bit of tightness, but nothing more.</li>
            <li>I myself have come to love cleansing w/straight mineral oil and grapseed oil as well,</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a steal in my opinion :) -It removes ALL of my long-wearing makeup and daily sunscreen -great stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this cleansing oil.</li>
            <li>I think The Face Shop Rice Water Cleansing Oil is a much better buy</li>
            <li>I use this cleansing oil mostly to take off my eye-makeup.</li>
            <li>(this melts even more makeup).  </li>
            <li>This is much cheaper than DHC, so I was kind of worried that it won&#x27;t be as good.</li>
            <li>and I just ordered 2 more bottles.</li>
            <li>The results are so close that I am glad that I made the switch.</li>
            <li>And the best thing is the low price.</li>
            <li>I love this make up remover</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried DHC, so I can&#x27;t say if it works better or not.</li>
            <li>Longer I massage more stuff comes out.</li>
            <li>It breaks down my makeup nicely and it emulsifies perfectly so</li>
            <li>/&gt;Feels very oily but rinses off amazing clean -- squeaky clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got really good reviews from top notch web beauty gurus like Musings of a Muse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The awesome thing about this is that when it touches water, it turns into this light and white foam, which makes your skin feel very clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>and the smell is not unpleasant washes off nicely</li>
            <li>It does a fantastic job at removing all my makeup and even gets off the most stubborn waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t doing this because I didn&#x27;t have a good makeup remover for my whole face.  </li>
            <li>but when I can&#x27;t spend that much, this is a good budget priced item.  </li>
            <li>Not all cleansing oils are the same - this one is a mid-range price that is a good consistency and melts make-up so well!</li>
            <li>I love how it clean my face...</li>
            <li>My pores clog easily, and whenever I try to treat that my skin dries out and flakes - no matter what it is that I do.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes if my face has a lot of makeup, I will follow up with another cleanser to make sure my skin is completely clean.  </li>
            <li>it rinses cleanly and the oil is thinner in consistency and cleanses better.</li>
            <li>Then I wipe off everything quite easily with a washcloth.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, just more oily than was expecting.</li>
            <li>It seems work fine.</li>
            <li>This product does an excellent job at removing all my makeup and washes away cleanly, leaving no greasy residue like some other oil cleansers I have tried</li>
            <li>really good cleansing oil, remove the make up completely and easy to wash with water.</li>
            <li>I love that it is reasonably priced!!  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty interesting and leaves my skin clean!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s cheap and works.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a cheaper cleaning oil to see if fit my need</li>
            <li>I was being cheap, and decided to try this out.  </li>
            <li>I like the scent, consistency, and the fact that it actually works great for taking off makeup.</li>
            <li>I like the light citrus smell</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to precise some point here as I can read in some review perturbing statements.</li>
            <li>My face always feels smooth and supple after washing with this.  </li>
            <li>For $9 and free shipping here at Amazon</li>
            <li>I like the light, citrusy scent</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great make up remover that does the job</li>
            <li>This trifecta works great for cleaning and prepping your skin for subsequent serums and treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I thought it might be a good starting point in my quest for healthy skin like my friend&#x27;s.    </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>When I rinse, however, I still feel as though I have a fine film on my skin, while the DHC cleansing oil leaves a &#x27;soap-and-water&#x27; clean feeling without the soap and water.  </li>
            <li>so I can buy more.....am running out fast!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle but removes even the most full-coverage foundations.</li>
            <li>I loved the shiseido, But I believe I love this one a little more.</li>
            <li>( I have combination skin - too rich for me ).  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I decided to purchase this product as many say that it is comparable to a higher priced alternative.  </li>
            <li>it my first oil remover and it still magical....</li>
            <li>It cost about $70-$80 for everything which is pretty obscene (I don&#x27;t like spending more than $10 on anything for myself...</li>
            <li>It might just be my opinion but this one gives me an actually clean feeling after using it.</li>
            <li>I clean the make up well.</li>
            <li>and I will never understand how my skin feels soooooo clean and refreshed after using an oil.  </li>
            <li>Super cheap.</li>
            <li>The oil removes all makeup and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>I tried didn&#x27;t clean as well..</li>
            <li>Rinse and the oil turns into a milk and rinses away clean without stripping your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I feel like my face isn&#x27;t as clean after washing it off</li>
            <li>I use it to clean sunscreen.</li>
            <li>My skin was clean and makeup removed.</li>
            <li>: Cleansing oils are not meant to rinse 100% clean, you are supposed to follow up with another cleanser to get rid of the residue.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent and works similarly</li>
            <li>Good to have this oil and better than I expected</li>
            <li>It has a nice really subtile smell (really light smell of citrus fruit), and it transform in a nice &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34; texture in the 2nd part of the massage on your skin (when you add a bit of water to continue the massage).</li>
            <li>This product would be really great for any skin types - acneic, dry, combo and even oily (oily what?!</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that this would work because I have so many things about cleansing oils.</li>
            <li>A good cleansing oil to use to remove all traces of makeup before you do your final face wash.</li>
            <li>Except I love this one and really dislike the DHC.he</li>
            <li>Except I love this one and really dislike the DHC.</li>
            <li>you have never tried a cleansing oil, this one is a really good one if you do not want to spend $30+ for the same amount of product.</li>
            <li>This one isn&#x27;t as good at removing makeup, it leaves a super greasy residue, that I found stayed around even after my second cleansing step, and I&#x27;m not a fan of the orangey scent</li>
            <li>I am SO happy to find this on amazon, now I&#x27;ll never run empty again!   </li>
            <li>I am Dutch and Irish and for that I have very fair and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>A lot of reviewers also compare this to DHC, which I&#x27;ve never actually tried, but I don&#x27;t know why anyone would pay more than half the price of this when this works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Almost as good as the similar products worth 20-30 dollars.</li>
            <li>I need put some face cream quick after...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s super functional.</li>
            <li>Overall, this cleanser is very effective and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I like this cleanser very much!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not super happy about the mineral oil in it.</li>
            <li>It really does what it says it does, and my skin started to look better after consistent use.</li>
            <li>Takes off everything gently, thoroughly and then washes off easily.</li>
            <li>As I believe that most of the people would love to use DHC Olive Deep Cleansing Oil as their first choices.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>but hours later, my face compensates by OVERproducing more oil!</li>
            <li>This cleansing oil isn&#x27;t as effective or luxurious feeling as high priced DHC or Shu Uemura oils, but it&#x27;s vastly cheaper AND honestly, if this is used in combo with a followup face wash, it really doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>You cannot clean a skin that have a layer of make up on it, it seems logical.</li>
            <li>very* good, is gentle, but takes away every little bit of makeup.</li>
            <li>love it so far</li>
            <li>But it dose worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Moisturize  I definitely suggest checking out this blog for more detailed instructions:</li>
            <li>But this was seriously worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d better stick with my old cleansing oil</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised and I now love this product.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love how soft it leaves your skin &amp;</li>
            <li>Then again, I don&#x27;t think I ever really notice the scent/smell of any product unless it&#x27;s super strong and overwhelming, enough to cause my nose to crinkle up and make me sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then again, I don&#x27;t think I ever really notice the scent/smell of any product unless it&#x27;s super strong and overwhelming, enough to cause my nose to crinkle up and make me sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is not only better priced but has a mild scent and works just as well for me with makeup removal.</li>
            <li>I use two quick pumps and rub on my face, then add one more pump for extra eye make-up.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and recommend it very very highly for anyone who has sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>This product works very well on my combination and sensitive skin, better than Cetaphil, I have to say.</li>
            <li>Price is half of the DHC, which is a good deal.</li>
            <li>This is such a great basic oil cleanser.</li>
            <li>Compare to Shu, I think I definitely like this one a lot better.</li>
            <li>The oil will disintegrate and it will leave your skin soft and makeup free.</li>
            <li>The packaging isn&#x27;t pretty</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying a cleansing oil though</li>
            <li>This is my first cleansing oil from japan</li>
            <li>I started with this product and it worked wonders after the first use.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it absolutely melted away my mascara and eyeliner!  </li>
            <li>Moisture -  I use Sana By Noevir Hadanomy Deep Mist to top it all off.</li>
            <li>I can really see a change after 2-3 days!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get the greasy feeling that most have stated they get even after using their second cleanser.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get the greasy feeling that most have stated they get even after using their second cleanser.</li>
            <li>That was the exact item that I ordered.</li>
            <li>I will keep buying more of this as I run out in the future.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin feeling pretty stripped considering itâ€™s an oil cleanser</li>
            <li>Wet fingers with warm (or lukewarm) water and rub onto eyes</li>
            <li>This is my first oil cleanser.</li>
            <li>I first remove my eye make up with a seperate eye make up remover, and then I massage the oil to my face and let it set for two minutes.</li>
            <li>But I have used Shu Uemura deep cleansing oil, and I can tell more stuff coming out and coming out faster than Shu Uemura.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to deal with oils again, but after a few months, I gave in and decided to suck it up and look for a good oil cleanser to get all my makeup off.</li>
            <li>AsianBeauty to see what kind of other oil cleansers I could give a try.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be surprised at how clean it&#x27;ll be when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve sent this question to the company and hope I get some positive response</li>
            <li>Therefore, I&#x27;ve been looking for a good cleansing oil for these past weeks besides DHC products.</li>
            <li>It emulsifies really well and makes my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li>If you are thinking about trying out a cleansing oil for the first time or looking for a new one, this is definitely the way to go with the most bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>I have the world&#x27;s most frustrating skin: oily, acne-prone and very easily clogged.</li>
            <li>think this is a little more moisturizing (because of the mineral oil) but removes makeup well for me, has a lot more fragrance, and is generally a cheaper</li>
            <li>This product has a loose more liquid feel where the DHC feels smoother thus goes on easier.</li>
            <li>other than that, it did a fantastic job at melting away my full face of make up.</li>
            <li>It does a fine job of getting waterproof sunscreen off (Japanese sunscreens stick to skin like glue).  </li>
            <li>so my real cleanser can do its job.  </li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t notice much when it&#x27;s on my face.</li>
            <li>I find that I have to really massage to get rid of all my makeup.</li>
            <li>but it costs twice as much.</li>
            <li>Really removes all my make up</li>
            <li>I like to have a very regimented schedule for my skin care, etc -</li>
            <li>but I really like this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has never broken me out or irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>Some say there is an orange scent to it, but I don&#x27;t really notice it.</li>
            <li>Some say there is an orange scent to it, but I don&#x27;t really notice it.</li>
            <li>It removes make-up, sunscreen, dirt, and oil very well.</li>
            <li>the pollution/dust... of the day, 2 really cleanse your skin.</li>
            <li>It does work very well at getting all of my face makeup off</li>
            <li>Plus, this product works well on my very sensitive/acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the whole point of facewash for me, so I won&#x27;t be re-ordering it.</li>
            <li>It removes all the gunk from my face at the end of the day and removes makeup very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I then use a gentle face wash to get the rest off, and follow that up with a sweep of Thayers witch hazel.</li>
            <li>I wish I could buy alongside my favorite \\&quot;for sensitive skin\\&quot; Neutrogena products and only cost me $7!</li>
            <li>It felt nice and slick on the skin with a pleasant orange citrus scent and wasn&#x27;t too thick.</li>
            <li>and itâ€™s not very expensive either.</li>
            <li>I rinses easily, lasts a very long time and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts.  </li>
            <li>The DHC product is also great, but this oil offers the same performance for less money.</li>
            <li>This cleansing oil can clean deeply.</li>
            <li>Price was reasonable and lasts a decent time</li>
            <li>I previously used the The Face Shop bright rice cleansing oil and it was overly fragranced and made my eyes burn the entire night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new holy grail cleansing oil!</li>
            <li>After I tried this Kose Softymo Deep Cleansing Oil, I found its quality and price was definitely worth to buy and better than what I expected!</li>
            <li>When the oil meets water it does not turn into the white, milky thing as much and as completely, and it doesn&#x27;t rinse off as cleanly as the DHC Cleasing Oil.</li>
            <li>and I was able to find it conveniently at my local Japanese store (Mitsuwa, for just $9</li>
            <li>Since my skin is super oily, I sometimes pair the cleansing oil with another foam cleanser to pick up all the extra oil.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t particularly like this cleansing oil.</li>
            <li>I cannot rave ENOUGH about how amazing this product is for my dry, sensitive, acne-prone skin!</li>
            <li>I did some research about makeup removers and an cleaning oil was highly praised.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also highly suggested that you throw  in some exfoliation 2 or 3 times a week, but I haven&#x27;t picked one yet.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this cleanser.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little thinner than what I&#x27;m used to, but it still serves its purpose and for its price, what could be better than that?</li>
            <li>It just gets the gunk off my face and gets out whatever is down in my pores, leaving my face feeling really smooth and decently clean before moving on to my next cleanser.</li>
            <li>It just gets the gunk off my face and gets out whatever is down in my pores, leaving my face feeling really smooth and decently clean before moving on to my next cleanser.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to continue using it since it&#x27;s been pretty much the same experience for me.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth the extra $$$.</li>
            <li>I use this to remove makeup, rinse it off, then wash my face with my normal soap.</li>
            <li>If it goes in your eyes, of course your vision will be blurry for a bit but nothing to worry about, it&#x27;s normal as it is oil, and it doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then I use warm water to slowly wash off the oil.</li>
            <li>It has really helped clear up my acne and my skin is so soft and smooth after using, no longer flakey and dry.</li>
            <li>This product feels cheap and not like other cleansing oils.</li>
            <li>I use it every night, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my face nor does it leave it super dry.</li>
            <li>One major difference is that Kose Softymo is much thinner than DHC one.</li>
            <li>So my skin is very young looking as it is, but I want to keep it that way.</li>
            <li>I generally have acne prone skin, so I was really scared to try an oil for my face.</li>
            <li>is the first step in my nightly skincare routine, only when I put on sunscreen during the day.</li>
            <li>A little background: I am 30, but still get laughed at when I try and buy adult beverages,  and altogether get mistaken for being vastly younger than I am on a very regular basis.</li>
            <li>I think I even use about the same amount to clean my face with similar results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product- use dry hands and massage product onto dry face until the makeup begins to move and dissolve.</li>
            <li>light on the skin as a cleansing oil is supposed to, while doing the job extremely well!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is one of the products in which I will repurchase due to its ability to clean my skin well, and the fact it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>Everything else has done really well during my routine, so I gathered it had to be it since it was the only new thing I had introduced.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even had any breakouts, which is odd because I figured I would surely go through &amp;#34;the purge&amp;#34; or something similar, but nope.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even had any breakouts, which is odd because I figured I would surely go through &amp;#34;the purge&amp;#34; or something similar, but nope.</li>
            <li>It has little (if any) fragrance (which is important for people who might be sensitive to fragrance).  </li>
            <li>DHC was usually the brand most recommended, so I had a friend pump out a decent amount into a smaller bottle with a pump for me to try</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be spending a little bit extra for the DHC when I need a re-fill, but liked it well enough to make it through the bottle.  </li>
            <li>B00070QF20 AcneFree Clear Skin System, 3-Step Kit</li>
            <li>think DHC leaves your face clean, but ultimately less moisturized.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really see the result, especially on my nose.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all.</li>
            <li>I only really wear eye makeup and concealer and it does not get my waterproof mascara off.</li>
            <li>It has a soft orange scent and cleans my pores out so well.</li>
            <li>It removes my sunscreen and does really well at getting my BB creams and eyeliner off, which was a big plus for me.</li>
            <li>It removes my sunscreen and does really well at getting my BB creams and eyeliner off, which was a big plus for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still early days</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It removes makeup completely</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes and clog-prone skin - this doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes</li>
            <li>but it adds an extra step to my routine because I have to use a separate eye makeup remover to get all my makeup off and end up using more lotion because my face gets dried out.</li>
            <li>I have tried lots of brands, and spent lots of money on my skin and had just about given up on finding the &#x27;right thing&#x27; until....</li>
            <li>With this oil, it strips all of my make off with little effort, &amp; leaves my face feeling clean &amp; not just stripped.</li>
            <li>I use what I suppose is the Japanese double cleansing method: I rub a couple pumps of the oil in circular motions all over my (dry) face and eyes, then use a warm, wet washcloth to remove the oil and my makeup.</li>
            <li>I love double cleansing, but I do not love this oil cleanser.</li>
            <li>As part of the Japanese double cleansing method to really get the make up off</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was worried and even more apprehensive when I realized the product had orange oil and a faint citrus scent, as I am very reactive to products with essences and</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m actually giving this product a tepid recommendation:  80% effective at a 50% savings, still leaves me ahead of the game.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t mean you have to use something strong and dry out your face, I use a really gentle cleanser like Aquanil.</li>
            <li>Too oily and smelled not good not like what I thought originally!</li>
            <li>in all, an affordable cleansing oil that generally works well.</li>
            <li>and wasn&#x27;t too fond of how my skin reacted, didn&#x27;t mesh too well with my sensitive eyes, or how they didn&#x27;t remove enough of my sunscreen and makeup.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t remove makeup nearly as well, I always had residue even after rubbing it into my skin for longer than necessary, and seemed to just irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Despite the name it is more like a thin orange-y gel than an oil.</li>
            <li>get me wrong, it did well at removing all my makeup and sunscreen, but my skin wasn&#x27;t loving it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s odd and more than a little reminiscent of household cleanser which I don&#x27;t want anywhere near my face, not to mention it sticks around with the greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I have had previous success with Japanese beauty products, and decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>For the second half of the Double Cleanse -  I followed up with Kose Softymo Super Cleansing Wash w/ Collagen.  </li>
            <li>I am a big fan of DHC deep cleansing, but used the product for the really longer years, so tried this product for a change to give facial skin different environment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thin oil but smells and feels nice.</li>
            <li>It lasts a really long time, so that&#x27;s not a small committment.</li>
            <li>and because I follow up with a cream cleanser afterwards, by the end of my cleansing steps my skin is feeling pretty tight and stripped.</li>
            <li>In the end, I feel like I&#x27;ve save a lot of money in the long run by paying more for the right thing - rather than the hit-and-miss of trying many, many less expensive brands that don&#x27;t work for me, and therefore end up being a complete waste of my very hard earned money.</li>
            <li>I put a little of this on a cotton pad and apply it all over my face with the pad first</li>
            <li>It stung a little the first time</li>
            <li>I feel so bad because that stuff is a cult-classic and is highly praised by so many!</li>
            <li>Considering the minor differences noted in the performance of this product when compared to DHC and the considerable monetary savings I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>It washes off pretty well, though, you do have to use another cleanser to get the few remaining bits off.</li>
            <li>I have combo skin (dry cheeks, oily T-zone) and so far have had no problems with breakouts.</li>
            <li>My skin never broke out with this and it leaves my skin feeling balanced, not tight, dry or oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over 2 months now and don&#x27;t really have any complaints.</li>
            <li>I think the pump does dispense a little to much product at a time</li>
            <li>your face needs oil, if you didn&#x27;t know now you know, so this basically takes away the bad oils that clog your pores in a way that doesn&#x27;t strip your skin of the good oils too.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> it was a good dupe.</li>
            <li> and she loved it.  </li>
            <li> Good for price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that great on its own.</li>
            <li> I am good friends with a girl (about my age) who is from Korea but visits the USA often.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for a good 2 months before going for this review, and I must say...</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for a good 2 months before going for this review, and I must say...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems with offensive odors nor skin/eye irritations and it does a good job removing my make up.</li>
            <li> but I find that Kose&#x27;s version does a good job.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly to dissolve a full face of waterproof sunscreen and/or makeup.</li>
            <li> It does effectively remove eye makeup and has a pleasant smell</li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, it&#x27;s a great addition to any skincare routine.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful first step in a cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this oil!</li>
            <li> It emulsifies well, but as a tip: be sure to follow this cleanser up with either a foaming or a milk cleanser, to get the best clean face.</li>
            <li> It does have a very pleasant smell, but I do not believe it is as effective as the higher price brand.</li>
            <li> (if you can get the Aquamoist bubble wash, it&#x27;s amazing -- has hyaluronic acid which is amazing for moisturization)</li>
            <li> They have truly amazing products.</li>
            <li> The bright sunny packaging is cute to.</li>
            <li> effective was it?&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it felt about 80% effective as DHC&#x27;s product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This two-step process was effective at removing sunblock for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gotta wash it off with warm water, ladies-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a nice orange smell too.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice scent</li>
            <li> I use a make up remover, THEN use this for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> I made me own by combining water, olive oil and aloe vera  in a bottle.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving oils in everything -- in this cleanser and in bio oil.  </li>
            <li> This method is not aggressive for the skin as you do not use cotton ball etc but oil to lift the make up and your own skin to rub the product.</li>
            <li> So I wondered what kind of cheaper options were out there</li>
            <li> But I honestly think it does the job as well as the DHC one.</li>
            <li> Rub/massage it in for 1-2 min then after that, rinse with warm water - it&#x27;ll emulsify and look milky.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice Oil Cleanser to help remove my make up at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I liked the feel and the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> Love that I can buy it off Amazon, and price is good (though it used to be like $11...</li>
            <li> It is so satisfying to literally be able to see it unclogging my pores!</li>
            <li> I prefer this to DHC, more cost effective and works just as well.  </li>
            <li> The Kose oil has a nice orange scent but it&#x27;s much more oily on my skin and doesn&#x27;t rinse off with water like the DHC oil does.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see, but so far everything has been great!</li>
            <li> Liked it better than Bobbi Brown and MAC as well.  </li>
            <li> By far the best makeup remover I have ever used and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or skin</li>
            <li> By far, the best cleansing oil I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Great for double cleansing and great price.</li>
            <li> It is a great first step to my evening</li>
            <li> It was a great first step to remove the bulk of my face make up</li>
            <li> This oil works great as a first step cleanser.</li>
            <li> Most good cleansing oils are supposed to make you feel clean after and remove all the dirt for your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to wash off, and it does leave my face feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> I will buy more when I mine is all gone.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You pump the oil into your hands, massage them on your face for about a minute to rub the makeup out, then (the most important step), you wash your face with warm water.</li>
            <li> SU product would be the best removing white heads</li>
            <li> This seems to one of the more inexpensive cleansing oils for it size and it delivers.</li>
            <li> I love this product, makeup melts away</li>
            <li> It feels better than that one.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided to purchase this product as many say that it is comparable to the DHC cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> the King sooper makeup remover does much better job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several cleansing oils over the years and this one is the best value for the money.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful cleanser for removing makeup and for daily use.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Its so amazing and leaves my skin so silky and smooth</li>
            <li> Work very well and also great price .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DHC Oil Cleanser for over 10 years and love how it removes makeup so well.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m OK with that for a $6 savings per bottle.</li>
            <li> I still feel conflicted over my $11 purse :) )</li>
            <li> Works better than Shiseido and Origins.  </li>
            <li> should probably also mention that I have worked in the cosmetics/skincare industry for over a decade and have a lot of experience with many brands.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> love using this stuff for my double-cleansing method.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad I gave it a try because I can now put the search of finding &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34; to rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Seems most that dislike this one have been using the DHC cleanser for a while and ended up trying this one for the price because it was recommended as a &amp;#34;dupe&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Seems most that dislike this one have been using the DHC cleanser for a while and ended up trying this one for the price because it was recommended as a &amp;#34;dupe&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use a cleanser afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this oil cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I was totally satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li> Excellent for using privately.</li>
            <li> The Speedy Cleansing oil also made by Kose is MUCH better-</li>
            <li> Sometimes if I do use this and a cleanser and do not apply a moisturizer I will feel a bit of tightness, but nothing more.</li>
            <li> I myself have come to love cleansing w/straight mineral oil and grapseed oil as well,</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a steal in my opinion :) -It removes ALL of my long-wearing makeup and daily sunscreen -great stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> I think The Face Shop Rice Water Cleansing Oil is a much better buy</li>
            <li> I use this cleansing oil mostly to take off my eye-makeup.</li>
            <li> (this melts even more makeup).  </li>
            <li> This is much cheaper than DHC, so I was kind of worried that it won&#x27;t be as good.</li>
            <li> and I just ordered 2 more bottles.</li>
            <li> The results are so close that I am glad that I made the switch.</li>
            <li> And the best thing is the low price.</li>
            <li> I love this make up remover</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried DHC, so I can&#x27;t say if it works better or not.</li>
            <li> Longer I massage more stuff comes out.</li>
            <li> It breaks down my makeup nicely and it emulsifies perfectly so</li>
            <li> /&gt;Feels very oily but rinses off amazing clean -- squeaky clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got really good reviews from top notch web beauty gurus like Musings of a Muse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The awesome thing about this is that when it touches water, it turns into this light and white foam, which makes your skin feel very clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> and the smell is not unpleasant washes off nicely</li>
            <li> It does a fantastic job at removing all my makeup and even gets off the most stubborn waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t doing this because I didn&#x27;t have a good makeup remover for my whole face.  </li>
            <li> but when I can&#x27;t spend that much, this is a good budget priced item.  </li>
            <li> Not all cleansing oils are the same - this one is a mid-range price that is a good consistency and melts make-up so well!</li>
            <li> I love how it clean my face...</li>
            <li> My pores clog easily, and whenever I try to treat that my skin dries out and flakes - no matter what it is that I do.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes if my face has a lot of makeup, I will follow up with another cleanser to make sure my skin is completely clean.  </li>
            <li> it rinses cleanly and the oil is thinner in consistency and cleanses better.</li>
            <li> Then I wipe off everything quite easily with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, just more oily than was expecting.</li>
            <li> It seems work fine.</li>
            <li> This product does an excellent job at removing all my makeup and washes away cleanly, leaving no greasy residue like some other oil cleansers I have tried</li>
            <li> really good cleansing oil, remove the make up completely and easy to wash with water.</li>
            <li> I love that it is reasonably priced!!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty interesting and leaves my skin clean!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s cheap and works.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a cheaper cleaning oil to see if fit my need</li>
            <li> I was being cheap, and decided to try this out.  </li>
            <li> I like the scent, consistency, and the fact that it actually works great for taking off makeup.</li>
            <li> I like the light citrus smell</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation, especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to precise some point here as I can read in some review perturbing statements.</li>
            <li> My face always feels smooth and supple after washing with this.  </li>
            <li> For $9 and free shipping here at Amazon</li>
            <li> I like the light, citrusy scent</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great make up remover that does the job</li>
            <li> This trifecta works great for cleaning and prepping your skin for subsequent serums and treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I thought it might be a good starting point in my quest for healthy skin like my friend&#x27;s.    </li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> When I rinse, however, I still feel as though I have a fine film on my skin, while the DHC cleansing oil leaves a &#x27;soap-and-water&#x27; clean feeling without the soap and water.  </li>
            <li> so I can buy more.....am running out fast!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle but removes even the most full-coverage foundations.</li>
            <li> I loved the shiseido, But I believe I love this one a little more.</li>
            <li> ( I have combination skin - too rich for me ).  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided to purchase this product as many say that it is comparable to a higher priced alternative.  </li>
            <li> it my first oil remover and it still magical....</li>
            <li> It cost about $70-$80 for everything which is pretty obscene (I don&#x27;t like spending more than $10 on anything for myself...</li>
            <li> It might just be my opinion but this one gives me an actually clean feeling after using it.</li>
            <li> I clean the make up well.</li>
            <li> and I will never understand how my skin feels soooooo clean and refreshed after using an oil.  </li>
            <li> Super cheap.</li>
            <li> The oil removes all makeup and rinses clean.</li>
            <li> I tried didn&#x27;t clean as well..</li>
            <li> Rinse and the oil turns into a milk and rinses away clean without stripping your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I feel like my face isn&#x27;t as clean after washing it off</li>
            <li> I use it to clean sunscreen.</li>
            <li> My skin was clean and makeup removed.</li>
            <li> : Cleansing oils are not meant to rinse 100% clean, you are supposed to follow up with another cleanser to get rid of the residue.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent and works similarly</li>
            <li> Good to have this oil and better than I expected</li>
            <li> It has a nice really subtile smell (really light smell of citrus fruit), and it transform in a nice &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34; texture in the 2nd part of the massage on your skin (when you add a bit of water to continue the massage).</li>
            <li> This product would be really great for any skin types - acneic, dry, combo and even oily (oily what?!</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that this would work because I have so many things about cleansing oils.</li>
            <li> A good cleansing oil to use to remove all traces of makeup before you do your final face wash.</li>
            <li> Except I love this one and really dislike the DHC.he</li>
            <li> Except I love this one and really dislike the DHC.</li>
            <li> you have never tried a cleansing oil, this one is a really good one if you do not want to spend $30+ for the same amount of product.</li>
            <li> This one isn&#x27;t as good at removing makeup, it leaves a super greasy residue, that I found stayed around even after my second cleansing step, and I&#x27;m not a fan of the orangey scent</li>
            <li> I am SO happy to find this on amazon, now I&#x27;ll never run empty again!   </li>
            <li> I am Dutch and Irish and for that I have very fair and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> A lot of reviewers also compare this to DHC, which I&#x27;ve never actually tried, but I don&#x27;t know why anyone would pay more than half the price of this when this works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Almost as good as the similar products worth 20-30 dollars.</li>
            <li> I need put some face cream quick after...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s super functional.</li>
            <li> Overall, this cleanser is very effective and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser very much!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not super happy about the mineral oil in it.</li>
            <li> It really does what it says it does, and my skin started to look better after consistent use.</li>
            <li> Takes off everything gently, thoroughly and then washes off easily.</li>
            <li> As I believe that most of the people would love to use DHC Olive Deep Cleansing Oil as their first choices.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> but hours later, my face compensates by OVERproducing more oil!</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil isn&#x27;t as effective or luxurious feeling as high priced DHC or Shu Uemura oils, but it&#x27;s vastly cheaper AND honestly, if this is used in combo with a followup face wash, it really doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> You cannot clean a skin that have a layer of make up on it, it seems logical.</li>
            <li> very* good, is gentle, but takes away every little bit of makeup.</li>
            <li> love it so far</li>
            <li> But it dose worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Moisturize  I definitely suggest checking out this blog for more detailed instructions:</li>
            <li> But this was seriously worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d better stick with my old cleansing oil</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised and I now love this product.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love how soft it leaves your skin &amp;</li>
            <li> Then again, I don&#x27;t think I ever really notice the scent/smell of any product unless it&#x27;s super strong and overwhelming, enough to cause my nose to crinkle up and make me sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then again, I don&#x27;t think I ever really notice the scent/smell of any product unless it&#x27;s super strong and overwhelming, enough to cause my nose to crinkle up and make me sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not only better priced but has a mild scent and works just as well for me with makeup removal.</li>
            <li> I use two quick pumps and rub on my face, then add one more pump for extra eye make-up.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and recommend it very very highly for anyone who has sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> This product works very well on my combination and sensitive skin, better than Cetaphil, I have to say.</li>
            <li> Price is half of the DHC, which is a good deal.</li>
            <li> This is such a great basic oil cleanser.</li>
            <li> Compare to Shu, I think I definitely like this one a lot better.</li>
            <li> The oil will disintegrate and it will leave your skin soft and makeup free.</li>
            <li> The packaging isn&#x27;t pretty</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying a cleansing oil though</li>
            <li> This is my first cleansing oil from japan</li>
            <li> I started with this product and it worked wonders after the first use.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it absolutely melted away my mascara and eyeliner!  </li>
            <li> Moisture -  I use Sana By Noevir Hadanomy Deep Mist to top it all off.</li>
            <li> I can really see a change after 2-3 days!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the greasy feeling that most have stated they get even after using their second cleanser.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the greasy feeling that most have stated they get even after using their second cleanser.</li>
            <li> That was the exact item that I ordered.</li>
            <li> I will keep buying more of this as I run out in the future.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my skin feeling pretty stripped considering itâ€™s an oil cleanser</li>
            <li> Wet fingers with warm (or lukewarm) water and rub onto eyes</li>
            <li> This is my first oil cleanser.</li>
            <li> I first remove my eye make up with a seperate eye make up remover, and then I massage the oil to my face and let it set for two minutes.</li>
            <li> But I have used Shu Uemura deep cleansing oil, and I can tell more stuff coming out and coming out faster than Shu Uemura.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to deal with oils again, but after a few months, I gave in and decided to suck it up and look for a good oil cleanser to get all my makeup off.</li>
            <li> AsianBeauty to see what kind of other oil cleansers I could give a try.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be surprised at how clean it&#x27;ll be when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sent this question to the company and hope I get some positive response</li>
            <li> Therefore, I&#x27;ve been looking for a good cleansing oil for these past weeks besides DHC products.</li>
            <li> It emulsifies really well and makes my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking about trying out a cleansing oil for the first time or looking for a new one, this is definitely the way to go with the most bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> I have the world&#x27;s most frustrating skin: oily, acne-prone and very easily clogged.</li>
            <li> think this is a little more moisturizing (because of the mineral oil) but removes makeup well for me, has a lot more fragrance, and is generally a cheaper</li>
            <li> This product has a loose more liquid feel where the DHC feels smoother thus goes on easier.</li>
            <li> other than that, it did a fantastic job at melting away my full face of make up.</li>
            <li> It does a fine job of getting waterproof sunscreen off (Japanese sunscreens stick to skin like glue).  </li>
            <li> so my real cleanser can do its job.  </li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t notice much when it&#x27;s on my face.</li>
            <li> I find that I have to really massage to get rid of all my makeup.</li>
            <li> but it costs twice as much.</li>
            <li> Really removes all my make up</li>
            <li> I like to have a very regimented schedule for my skin care, etc -</li>
            <li> but I really like this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has never broken me out or irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Some say there is an orange scent to it, but I don&#x27;t really notice it.</li>
            <li> Some say there is an orange scent to it, but I don&#x27;t really notice it.</li>
            <li> It removes make-up, sunscreen, dirt, and oil very well.</li>
            <li> the pollution/dust... of the day, 2 really cleanse your skin.</li>
            <li> It does work very well at getting all of my face makeup off</li>
            <li> Plus, this product works well on my very sensitive/acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the whole point of facewash for me, so I won&#x27;t be re-ordering it.</li>
            <li> It removes all the gunk from my face at the end of the day and removes makeup very well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I then use a gentle face wash to get the rest off, and follow that up with a sweep of Thayers witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I wish I could buy alongside my favorite \\&quot;for sensitive skin\\&quot; Neutrogena products and only cost me $7!</li>
            <li> It felt nice and slick on the skin with a pleasant orange citrus scent and wasn&#x27;t too thick.</li>
            <li> and itâ€™s not very expensive either.</li>
            <li> I rinses easily, lasts a very long time and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts.  </li>
            <li> The DHC product is also great, but this oil offers the same performance for less money.</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil can clean deeply.</li>
            <li> Price was reasonable and lasts a decent time</li>
            <li> I previously used the The Face Shop bright rice cleansing oil and it was overly fragranced and made my eyes burn the entire night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new holy grail cleansing oil!</li>
            <li> After I tried this Kose Softymo Deep Cleansing Oil, I found its quality and price was definitely worth to buy and better than what I expected!</li>
            <li> When the oil meets water it does not turn into the white, milky thing as much and as completely, and it doesn&#x27;t rinse off as cleanly as the DHC Cleasing Oil.</li>
            <li> and I was able to find it conveniently at my local Japanese store (Mitsuwa, for just $9</li>
            <li> Since my skin is super oily, I sometimes pair the cleansing oil with another foam cleanser to pick up all the extra oil.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t particularly like this cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> I cannot rave ENOUGH about how amazing this product is for my dry, sensitive, acne-prone skin!</li>
            <li> I did some research about makeup removers and an cleaning oil was highly praised.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also highly suggested that you throw  in some exfoliation 2 or 3 times a week, but I haven&#x27;t picked one yet.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this cleanser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thinner than what I&#x27;m used to, but it still serves its purpose and for its price, what could be better than that?</li>
            <li> It just gets the gunk off my face and gets out whatever is down in my pores, leaving my face feeling really smooth and decently clean before moving on to my next cleanser.</li>
            <li> It just gets the gunk off my face and gets out whatever is down in my pores, leaving my face feeling really smooth and decently clean before moving on to my next cleanser.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to continue using it since it&#x27;s been pretty much the same experience for me.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth the extra $$$.</li>
            <li> I use this to remove makeup, rinse it off, then wash my face with my normal soap.</li>
            <li> If it goes in your eyes, of course your vision will be blurry for a bit but nothing to worry about, it&#x27;s normal as it is oil, and it doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I use warm water to slowly wash off the oil.</li>
            <li> It has really helped clear up my acne and my skin is so soft and smooth after using, no longer flakey and dry.</li>
            <li> This product feels cheap and not like other cleansing oils.</li>
            <li> I use it every night, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my face nor does it leave it super dry.</li>
            <li> One major difference is that Kose Softymo is much thinner than DHC one.</li>
            <li> So my skin is very young looking as it is, but I want to keep it that way.</li>
            <li> I generally have acne prone skin, so I was really scared to try an oil for my face.</li>
            <li> is the first step in my nightly skincare routine, only when I put on sunscreen during the day.</li>
            <li> A little background: I am 30, but still get laughed at when I try and buy adult beverages,  and altogether get mistaken for being vastly younger than I am on a very regular basis.</li>
            <li> I think I even use about the same amount to clean my face with similar results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product- use dry hands and massage product onto dry face until the makeup begins to move and dissolve.</li>
            <li> light on the skin as a cleansing oil is supposed to, while doing the job extremely well!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one of the products in which I will repurchase due to its ability to clean my skin well, and the fact it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> Everything else has done really well during my routine, so I gathered it had to be it since it was the only new thing I had introduced.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even had any breakouts, which is odd because I figured I would surely go through &amp;#34;the purge&amp;#34; or something similar, but nope.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even had any breakouts, which is odd because I figured I would surely go through &amp;#34;the purge&amp;#34; or something similar, but nope.</li>
            <li> It has little (if any) fragrance (which is important for people who might be sensitive to fragrance).  </li>
            <li> DHC was usually the brand most recommended, so I had a friend pump out a decent amount into a smaller bottle with a pump for me to try</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be spending a little bit extra for the DHC when I need a re-fill, but liked it well enough to make it through the bottle.  </li>
            <li> B00070QF20 AcneFree Clear Skin System, 3-Step Kit</li>
            <li> think DHC leaves your face clean, but ultimately less moisturized.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really see the result, especially on my nose.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all.</li>
            <li> I only really wear eye makeup and concealer and it does not get my waterproof mascara off.</li>
            <li> It has a soft orange scent and cleans my pores out so well.</li>
            <li> It removes my sunscreen and does really well at getting my BB creams and eyeliner off, which was a big plus for me.</li>
            <li> It removes my sunscreen and does really well at getting my BB creams and eyeliner off, which was a big plus for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still early days</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It removes makeup completely</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and clog-prone skin - this doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes</li>
            <li> but it adds an extra step to my routine because I have to use a separate eye makeup remover to get all my makeup off and end up using more lotion because my face gets dried out.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of brands, and spent lots of money on my skin and had just about given up on finding the &#x27;right thing&#x27; until....</li>
            <li> With this oil, it strips all of my make off with little effort, &amp; leaves my face feeling clean &amp; not just stripped.</li>
            <li> I use what I suppose is the Japanese double cleansing method: I rub a couple pumps of the oil in circular motions all over my (dry) face and eyes, then use a warm, wet washcloth to remove the oil and my makeup.</li>
            <li> I love double cleansing, but I do not love this oil cleanser.</li>
            <li> As part of the Japanese double cleansing method to really get the make up off</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was worried and even more apprehensive when I realized the product had orange oil and a faint citrus scent, as I am very reactive to products with essences and</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m actually giving this product a tepid recommendation:  80% effective at a 50% savings, still leaves me ahead of the game.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t mean you have to use something strong and dry out your face, I use a really gentle cleanser like Aquanil.</li>
            <li> Too oily and smelled not good not like what I thought originally!</li>
            <li> in all, an affordable cleansing oil that generally works well.</li>
            <li> and wasn&#x27;t too fond of how my skin reacted, didn&#x27;t mesh too well with my sensitive eyes, or how they didn&#x27;t remove enough of my sunscreen and makeup.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t remove makeup nearly as well, I always had residue even after rubbing it into my skin for longer than necessary, and seemed to just irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Despite the name it is more like a thin orange-y gel than an oil.</li>
            <li> get me wrong, it did well at removing all my makeup and sunscreen, but my skin wasn&#x27;t loving it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s odd and more than a little reminiscent of household cleanser which I don&#x27;t want anywhere near my face, not to mention it sticks around with the greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I have had previous success with Japanese beauty products, and decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> For the second half of the Double Cleanse -  I followed up with Kose Softymo Super Cleansing Wash w/ Collagen.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of DHC deep cleansing, but used the product for the really longer years, so tried this product for a change to give facial skin different environment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin oil but smells and feels nice.</li>
            <li> It lasts a really long time, so that&#x27;s not a small committment.</li>
            <li> and because I follow up with a cream cleanser afterwards, by the end of my cleansing steps my skin is feeling pretty tight and stripped.</li>
            <li> In the end, I feel like I&#x27;ve save a lot of money in the long run by paying more for the right thing - rather than the hit-and-miss of trying many, many less expensive brands that don&#x27;t work for me, and therefore end up being a complete waste of my very hard earned money.</li>
            <li> I put a little of this on a cotton pad and apply it all over my face with the pad first</li>
            <li> It stung a little the first time</li>
            <li> I feel so bad because that stuff is a cult-classic and is highly praised by so many!</li>
            <li> Considering the minor differences noted in the performance of this product when compared to DHC and the considerable monetary savings I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> It washes off pretty well, though, you do have to use another cleanser to get the few remaining bits off.</li>
            <li> I have combo skin (dry cheeks, oily T-zone) and so far have had no problems with breakouts.</li>
            <li> My skin never broke out with this and it leaves my skin feeling balanced, not tight, dry or oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over 2 months now and don&#x27;t really have any complaints.</li>
            <li> I think the pump does dispense a little to much product at a time</li>
            <li> your face needs oil, if you didn&#x27;t know now you know, so this basically takes away the bad oils that clog your pores in a way that doesn&#x27;t strip your skin of the good oils too.</li>
            <li> The orange and vegetable oil-like scent is a little odd but mild.</li>
            <li> Other times, I just use this cleansing oil as the only wash since I have dry skin and don&#x27;t want it to dry out too much.</li>
            <li> I have always really liked the idea of them, but in the past I have broken out-</li>
            <li> I only really use a small amount, so I feel like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It was a case of - &#x27;must look worse before it looks better&#x27; as a lot of little red bumps appeared -</li>
            <li> Just get about 2 pumps and massage it to dry face, then splash with cold or slightly warm water.</li>
            <li> I only use this for removing eye makeup, as using it on my whole face will cause closed comedones after a few uses.</li>
            <li> At first, it didn&#x27;t feel as thick and luxurious as the DHC oil I got before (which I adore).</li>
            <li> However, I developed some cystic acne after about a month in a half of use and had to discontinue using it.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little odd at first</li>
            <li> My skin is really weird, where after I wash my face, it&#x27;s like every single bit of natural oil my face produces is stripped off, leaving my skin super dry...</li>
            <li> atleast if I&#x27;m going to have dry facial skin, it&#x27;s all dry!</li>
            <li> It lasts fairly long like SU.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ve been using it for a long time now, then stick with it.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ve been using it for a long time now, then stick with it.</li>
            <li> As long as I do wipe it off with a washcloth</li>
            <li> I used DHC for a long time (the sensitive pink bottle one) and went to this since it was a little cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, the cleanser usually leaves my skin very soft and refreshed afterwards.    </li>
            <li> My last makeup cleansing product could not clean my makeup thoroughly, and left my skin large-pore-looking...</li>
            <li> I also noticed that the consistency of this oil is a bit thicker than other cleansing oils, it doesnâ€™t seem to affect its performance but it might cause clogged pores if you donâ€™t double cleanse when using this.</li>
            <li> I had been using olive oil, but that left my skin a bit oily and was hard to remove completely after cleansing, even with a lathering cleanser.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to use another cleanser that would dry my face out.  </li>
            <li> Having dry skin AND using waterproof mascara</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, oily in the T Zone where I am prone to blackheads and dry on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I have fairly dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin is acne-prone and dry; hence, checking the ingredients is a must-do for anything that I put upon my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Massage the product on a dry face, and wash it off with water.</li>
            <li> but I like how it cleans and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li> so I try not to depress it all the way.</li>
            <li> I wet my face with lukewarm water really well before applying and use the tiniest bit (no more than a pea-size since it&#x27;s a little thick) while massaging it into my face really well.</li>
            <li> I wet my face with lukewarm water really well before applying and use the tiniest bit (no more than a pea-size since it&#x27;s a little thick) while massaging it into my face really well.</li>
            <li> You want to pump it into your dry hands and rub it onto your dry face - if either are wet, it will not work.</li>
            <li> When I attempted to simply use the Kose Softymo Deep Cleansing Oil and not an additional cleanser I started to develop small patches of breakout at my jawline and forehead.  </li>
            <li> so I believe it does need an additional wash-off step, although my mom likes using only this to wash everything off (she uses much less make-up than I) and does not use a follow-up cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have serious blackheads on my nose, and I use cleansing oil mainly for removing blackheads.</li>
            <li> I also think DHC is a little bit overpriced for what it is, but is generally a little nicer on the skin for people who might be sensitive to mineral oil or need a non-scented product.</li>
            <li> but then I moved away and for several months tried to find a replacement product but nothing could melt my eye make-up like this little beauty.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with acne for the last few years.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few different oil to milk type formulas-</li>
            <li> The Kose Softymo Deep Cleaning Oil - mentioned here and there by a few users.</li>
            <li> Kose Softymo Deep Cleaning Oil - mentioned here and there by a few users.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used shu uemura (pink bottle) and DHC cleansing oil and decided to try this out since it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is extremely prone to blackheads/enlarged pores in my t-zone and dryness/sensitivity everywhere else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle, it would last at least 6 months with everyday use.</li>
            <li> I guess I will have to give the other brands a try and compare.</li>
            <li> It does not have the orange scent as in past Kose Softymo Deep Cleansing Oils I have purchased through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Follow with your usual facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> have tried other products like this</li>
            <li> it dry it a little bit..</li>
            <li> I normally use DHC Deep Cleansing Oil, but this is less expensive and it works almost as well.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t strong, and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  </li>
            <li> When I used just the conventional face soap, I felt like all the make up just stayed on my face.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very difficult to find a cleanser that is gentle enough AND remove waterproof makeup.</li>
            <li> It worked very well when I used DHC oil to get rid of the foundation and a face soap afterwards, but it was getting too expensive.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take off my waterproof mascara though, so that it&#x27;s a down side</li>
            <li> This product does break down makeup, I dont wear waterproof mascara</li>
            <li> This cleanser breaks down oil and makeup</li>
            <li> Skip this one, buy the other!</li>
            <li> Only a little hard to wash it off after emulsification, comparing to DHC</li>
            <li> When the oil touches water, it turns into a slight foamy consistency.</li>
            <li> I found this product and it works just as well for half the price.  </li>
            <li> With my previous product I could forego an additional cleansing step after removing my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Feels less greasy</li>
            <li> Smells slightly citrus-y</li>
            <li> Mineral oil typically clogs up skin, however I have not YET had that issue.</li>
            <li> And as a bonus--it costs less than all of them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not overly perfumed, the pump is well made, and you can keep the little plastic clip to use when you take the bottle traveling, to avoid the pump getting pushed down accidentally when it&#x27;s packed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue on my face after I rinse with water nor does it make my face feel tight.  </li>
            <li> I use waterproof mascara &amp; with sudsings soap it takes some hard scrubbing, soap gets in my eye, &amp; I usually have mascara still left over.</li>
            <li> Cleans as well as Shu&#x27;s green oil for so much less money.</li>
            <li> I squirt a little in my hand and rubbing all over my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;Afterwards, I could still feel a little sunblock on my face.  </li>
            <li> Not sure that I can use the product with like that warning on the bottle: - this product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm</li>
            <li> it on your face in circular motion&lt;br /&gt;add a little water a time to lather</li>
            <li> You can use it to remove eye maekup, even waterproof mascara, but it can make your vision a little blurry until you rinse it off well.</li>
            <li> Just after couple of strokes, I can feel little particles coming out of my skin.</li>
            <li> I use to use DHC oil but found it was a bit too heavy.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if this works on heavy eye makeup, but it does say on the packaging that it washes off waterproof mascara.     </li>
            <li> St. Ives Green Tea Cleanser - 6.75 oz]].</li>
            <li> You are, however, supposed to use essence everyday.</li>
            <li> I tried out a few oils from Shiseido, The Face Shop, Etude, etc.</li>
            <li> but when I&#x27;m looking for one with emulsifiers that rinses clean(no film left behind)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combo skin, sadly it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> The DHC Deep Cleansing Oil produced an immediate and dramatic difference in the size of my pores and the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed after you try this product!</li>
            <li> Although you must close eyes very, very tightly when you use it, esp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s less thick than DHC&#x27;s version.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less thick than DHC  </li>
            <li> A little thick for me.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to explain it,</li>
            <li> (not sure if it makes sense)</li>
            <li> I get a few grits every time!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible, I feel like most of the makeup is still on my face after using this product</li>
            <li> I previously used Shiseido&#x27;s benefique cleansing oil and found it too thick (and pricey!).  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin with the occasional breakouts here and there (maybe once every few months), but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> I do not feel any tightness or dryness around my delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> My experience with less expensive cleansing oils is that the pump on the bottle is usually leaky, but there is no problem with the Kose.</li>
            <li> I tried this as a less expensive alternative to DHC and there is no comparison.</li>
            <li> I do see minor breakouts because of this, nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I have acnes on my forehead, and I am not sure if it is caused by it.</li>
            <li> I have tired all sorts of stuff.  </li>
            <li> My guess is that my skin reacts poorly to mineral oil in cosmetics, so if you have a sensitivity I recommend avoiding this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The people who claim to have broken out were probably just wiping the product off with a cotton ball or some type of cloth.</li>
            <li> I was game to try</li>
            <li> I was game to try</li>
            <li> I usually finish with an additional step of cleansing my face with some cetaphil after all of that, but that&#x27;s only because I have very annoying skin.</li>
            <li> I like the faint scent of oranges too.  </li>
            <li> It also has a vague \\&quot;fishy\\&quot; smell.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found that it is not.  </li>
            <li> The product itself it quite mediocre.</li>
            <li> Sadly, will not be repurchasing because it has mineral oil.</li>
            <li> I tried this product by random chance</li>
            <li> So sad-</li>
            <li> But, DHC is expensive, so I tried this option.</li>
            <li> I think this works almost as well as the expensive DHC.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to try it based on some of the reviews, but the price helped push me to the edge, so I made a jump for it and gave it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to use if you are oily.</li>
            <li> No stinging, but very weird</li>
            <li> I just received this product and am disappointed with it.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to find a cheaper alternative to my staple cleansing oil by Boscia, and I was disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> but it break me out :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> There are oil cleansers out there being marketed with simaliar ingredients for three times the price -outrageous!</li>
            <li> Before I started using this product I had horrible combination skin on my face.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use to use DHC oil but found it was a bit too heavy. This is not only better priced but has a mild scent and works just as well for me with makeup removal. Sometimes I even use it with my clarisonic</li>
            <li> Great cleansing oil that&#x27;s cheap and works. Compare to Shu, I think I definitely like this one a lot better. It might just be my opinion but this one gives me an actually clean feeling after using it. I haven&#x27;t try it on my eye makeup so I don&#x27;t know if this works on heavy eye makeup, but it does say on the packaging that it washes off waterproof mascara.     One star off because it should have the deep pore cleansing feature but I don&#x27;t really see the result, especially on my nose.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with acne for the last few years.  I have tired all sorts of stuff.  I found the [[ASIN:B00070QF20 AcneFree Clear Skin System, 3-Step Kit (Purifying Cleanser, Renewing Toner, Repair Lotion)]] product and it does a good job but it didn&#x27;t seem to be enough.  On the AcneFree cleanser it states you should wash and remove all makeup before applying.  I didn&#x27;t doing this because I didn&#x27;t have a good makeup remover for my whole face.  I didn&#x27;t want to use another cleanser that would dry my face out.  I did some research about makeup removers and an cleaning oil was highly praised.  I wanted to try a cheaper cleaning oil to see if fit my need so I brought this product.  It is a great first step to my evening face washing routine.  I squirt a little in my hand and rubbing all over my face and then I just was it off.  It does a great job of removing the makeup so my real cleanser can do its job.  I haven&#x27;t used it as my only cleanser but it seems to work for what I use it for.  I like the faint scent of oranges too.  I will buy more when I mine is all gone.  Since working it into my routine my acne has improved!</li>
            <li> This product feels cheap and not like other cleansing oils. Most good cleansing oils are supposed to make you feel clean after and remove all the dirt for your face. This feels like grease is left on your face. Don&#x27;t be fooled by trying the cheaper stuff, go to a brand like Dermalogica (PreCleanse)! I had to switch back.</li>
            <li> I use these products to remove sunblock from my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like DHC&#x27;s Deep Cleansing Oil.  Since this is product is 50% cheaper, so I decided to give it a test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it feel in my palm?&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s less thick than DHC&#x27;s version.  DHC feels like like olive oil, this product feels like oily water.  It also has a vague \\&quot;fishy\\&quot; smell.  The scent isn&#x27;t strong, and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  It didn&#x27;t linger after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How effective was it?&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, I could still feel a little sunblock on my face.  I&#x27;d say it felt about 80% effective as DHC&#x27;s product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is my recommendation?&lt;br /&gt;Use this product, then follow-up with your regular, non-oil cleanser.  This two-step process was effective at removing sunblock for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m actually giving this product a tepid recommendation:  80% effective at a 50% savings, still leaves me ahead of the game.</li>
            <li> I clean the make up well. (Both face and eyes make up)&lt;br /&gt;I used cleansing after so I do not feel greasy afterward.&lt;br /&gt;I love it so far and it does not cause me break up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an oil cleanser before but heard good things about the DHC cleansing oil. I decided to try this out since it was cheaper and I was able to find it conveniently at my local Japanese store (Mitsuwa, for just $9 --on sale). I absolutely love it! Softymo Deep cleansing oil removes all my makeup in one go, including waterproof eyeliner/mascara! I&#x27;m very impressed with how effective it is. When the oil touches water, it turns into a slight foamy consistency. Not sure how to explain it, but it&#x27;s pretty interesting and leaves my skin clean! Since my skin is super oily, I sometimes pair the cleansing oil with another foam cleanser to pick up all the extra oil. Otherwise, the cleanser usually leaves my skin very soft and refreshed afterwards.    Overall, this cleanser is very effective and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This product works very well on my combination and sensitive skin, better than Cetaphil, I have to say. My pimples are noticeably reduced even in Summer. I like to apply Lancome Cleansing Water for Face, Eyes, Lips after using this cleasing oil.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is extremely prone to blackheads/enlarged pores in my t-zone and dryness/sensitivity everywhere else. I was terrified to try a cleansing oil. I have had previous success with Japanese beauty products, and decided to give this a try. It really does what it says it does, and my skin started to look better after consistent use. However, I developed some cystic acne after about a month in a half of use and had to discontinue using it. My guess is that my skin reacts poorly to mineral oil in cosmetics, so if you have a sensitivity I recommend avoiding this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you unsure about purchasing it based on lack of ingredients list, here it is: oryza sativa (rice) bran oil, mineral oil, sorbeth-30 tetraoleate, triethyl hexanoine, cyclomethicone, orange oil, tocopherol, simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil, glycerin, polyglyceryl-2 diisostearate, trilaureth-4 phosphate, water, phenoxyethanol</li>
            <li> It is good to its price. Only a little hard to wash it off after emulsification, comparing to DHC</li>
            <li> A little thick for me. But it dose worth the money.  Almost as good as the similar products worth 20-30 dollars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleansing oil for years and my skin definitely loves it. I think some people still don&#x27;t know how to use this product because the instructions are in Japanese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You pump the oil into your hands, massage them on your face for about a minute to rub the makeup out, then (the most important step), you wash your face with warm water. The oil will disintegrate and it will leave your skin soft and makeup free. The people who claim to have broken out were probably just wiping the product off with a cotton ball or some type of cloth. Gotta wash it off with warm water, ladies- that&#x27;s what the instructions say.</li>
            <li> I use to buy the DHC makeup remover (olive oil) at 25.00 each. I found this product and it works just as well for half the price.  I am very happy and so is my wallet. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I used to use Shu Uemura Cleansing oils and DHC.  SU product would be the best removing white heads but when I can&#x27;t spend that much, this is a good budget priced item.  It lasts fairly long like SU. It doesn&#x27;t leave oily feeling after you wash with DHC&#x27;s ( I have combination skin - too rich for me ).  After wash feeling is bit drier than SU balancing.  It doesn&#x27;t take out white heads like SU products. So, when I need extra care, I leave the oil longer on my face and wash off.  It seems work fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a cheaper alternative to DHC Deep Cleansing Oil. It has a pleasant scent and works similarly but I&#x27;m not super happy about the mineral oil in it. I will be going back to the DHC and maybe repurchase this only if I&#x27;m low on funds.</li>
            <li> Not sure that I can use the product with like that warning on the bottle: - this product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm</li>
            <li> This seems to one of the more inexpensive cleansing oils for it size and it delivers. I massaged my face with it for about ten minutes and swear I could feel the plugs in my pores loosen and come out. It felt nice and slick on the skin with a pleasant orange citrus scent and wasn&#x27;t too thick. It was a great first step to remove the bulk of my face make up and then I followed up with my foaming cleanser [[ASIN:B004HJ5500 St. Ives Green Tea Cleanser - 6.75 oz]]. I had a bit of mascara still left on my lashes, but other than that, it did a fantastic job at melting away my full face of make up. If you are thinking about trying out a cleansing oil for the first time or looking for a new one, this is definitely the way to go with the most bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> I was being cheap, and decided to try this out.  It works, but it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the DHC product.  I&#x27;ll be spending a little bit extra for the DHC when I need a re-fill, but liked it well enough to make it through the bottle.  It lasts a really long time, so that&#x27;s not a small committment.</li>
            <li> The best cleansing / makeup removing oil I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This product does an excellent job at removing all my makeup and washes away cleanly, leaving no greasy residue like some other oil cleansers I have tried</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already a big fan of Japanese Cleansing Oil! As I believe that most of the people would love to use DHC Olive Deep Cleansing Oil as their first choices.  Therefore, I&#x27;ve been looking for a good cleansing oil for these past weeks besides DHC products. I read this excellent seller rating of this Kose Cleansing Oil, and I gave it a try. After I tried this Kose Softymo Deep Cleansing Oil, I found its quality and price was definitely worth to buy and better than what I expected! I sure you won&#x27;t be disappointed after you try this product!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided to purchase this product as many say that it is comparable to a higher priced alternative.  Unfortunately, I found that it is not.  With my previous product I could forego an additional cleansing step after removing my makeup.  When I attempted to simply use the Kose Softymo Deep Cleansing Oil and not an additional cleanser I started to develop small patches of breakout at my jawline and forehead.  It does have a very pleasant smell, but I do not believe it is as effective as the higher price brand.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!! Not quite as good as dhc but it gets the job done. Someone said something about a fishy smell but I think it&#x27;s actually a citrus scent they are smelling. Really good at dissolving dirt, I can feel the grits getting worked out of my pores when I use this! I have sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all. Will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> Having dry skin AND using waterproof mascara it&#x27;s very difficult to find a cleanser that is gentle enough AND remove waterproof makeup. This is the perfect (inexpensive) oil for that. I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle, it would last at least 6 months with everyday use. Just get about 2 pumps and massage it to dry face, then splash with cold or slightly warm water.</li>
            <li> As part of the Japanese double cleansing method to really get the make up off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels very oily but rinses off amazing clean -- squeaky clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got really good reviews from top notch web beauty gurus like Musings of a Muse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instructions:&lt;br /&gt;squirt on your hands&lt;br /&gt;work it on your face in circular motion&lt;br /&gt;add a little water a time to lather&lt;br /&gt;after massaging entire face with it&lt;br /&gt;rinse and follow up with a foamy cleanser (if you can get the Aquamoist bubble wash, it&#x27;s amazing -- has hyaluronic acid which is amazing for moisturization)</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife. It works well for her.</li>
            <li> nicely removing make up things, even eyeliner too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m another convert from DHC Deep Cleansing oil. The DHC product is also great, but this oil offers the same performance for less money. I like the scent, consistency, and the fact that it actually works great for taking off makeup. I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this.</li>
            <li> I love this product, makeup melts away and I will never understand how my skin feels soooooo clean and refreshed after using an oil.  Yes it smells wonderful and would use this for the rest of my life, but I want to know what assurances do I have that purchasing a product, that is plant-based, coming out of post-earthquake Japan is not tainted by radiation?  I&#x27;ve sent this question to the company and hope I get some positive response so I can buy more.....am running out fast!!!</li>
            <li> Good for removing makeups</li>
            <li> Thicker than Softymo white cleansing oil. It feels better than that one. Sadly, I have acnes on my forehead, and I am not sure if it is caused by it.</li>
            <li> I know some people have had issues with this and have gone back to DHC.  I used DHC for a long time (the sensitive pink bottle one) and went to this since it was a little cheaper.  I&#x27;ve had no issues with breakouts, residue, it not working well, etc...  It&#x27;s got a nice orange smell too.  I&#x27;ve noticed no difference in my skin since switching to this one, so I think I&#x27;m going to continue using it since it&#x27;s been pretty much the same experience for me.  I think I even use about the same amount to clean my face with similar results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a little more moisturizing (because of the mineral oil) but removes makeup well for me, has a lot more fragrance, and is generally a cheaper product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think DHC leaves your face clean, but ultimately less moisturized.  It has little (if any) fragrance (which is important for people who might be sensitive to fragrance).  I also think DHC is a little bit overpriced for what it is, but is generally a little nicer on the skin for people who might be sensitive to mineral oil or need a non-scented product.</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser very much! Despite the name it is more like a thin orange-y gel than an oil. It smells *very* good, is gentle, but takes away every little bit of makeup. Although you must close eyes very, very tightly when you use it, esp. for contact lenses wearers because it will leave and oily film in yours eyes! 0.o  No stinging, but very weird and you need eye drops to get it out. Will re-purchase when I run out. Only set back? I wish I could buy alongside my favorite \\&quot;for sensitive skin\\&quot; Neutrogena products and only cost me $7!</li>
            <li> I prefer this to DHC, more cost effective and works just as well.  Removes makeup, works with my Mia, and my son uses it for his acne prone skin and gets great results.</li>
            <li> I love how it clean my face... it dry it a little bit.. I need put some face cream quick after... but like make up remover it great... it my first oil remover and it still magical.... how i leaved all my life without?</li>
            <li> I have used this one and the shiseido. I loved the shiseido, But I believe I love this one a little more. Feels less greasy (not sure if it makes sense) but it does the job of removing makeup. DO IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Super cheap. Gets the job done. Smells slightly citrus-y but I really don&#x27;t notice much when it&#x27;s on my face. It breaks down my makeup nicely and it emulsifies perfectly so nothing is left on my face. The packaging isn&#x27;t pretty but it&#x27;s super functional. I have repurchased and will probably continue doing so just because it&#x27;s an awesome product.</li>
            <li> I generally have acne prone skin, so I was really scared to try an oil for my face. The product itself it quite mediocre. I find that I have to really massage to get rid of all my makeup. It doesn&#x27;t take off my waterproof mascara though, so that it&#x27;s a down side the this product. I got it because a lot of the comments said that it&#x27;s comparable to the DHC cleansing oil. Sadly, will not be repurchasing because it has mineral oil. I do see minor breakouts because of this, nothing too bad. Still on the search for another oil.</li>
            <li> I previously used Shiseido&#x27;s benefique cleansing oil and found it too thick (and pricey!).  I personally like the lighter consistency of this cleansing oil and it does a really great job with removing my waterproof makeup and sunscreen.  I like the light citrus smell but I do with this product didn&#x27;t have mineral oil.  Mineral oil typically clogs up skin, however I have not YET had that issue.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided to purchase this product as many say that it is comparable to the DHC cleansing oil. However I think the quality is not fully comparable. When the oil meets water it does not turn into the white, milky thing as much and as completely, and it doesn&#x27;t rinse off as cleanly as the DHC Cleasing Oil. I&#x27;ll go back to the DHC one, it&#x27;s worth the extra $$$.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on customer reviews. I had tried sample packs of DHC&#x27;s cleansing oil but it costs twice as much. The Kose oil has a nice orange scent but it&#x27;s much more oily on my skin and doesn&#x27;t rinse off with water like the DHC oil does. I prefer the lighter, rinsable option and just ordered the DHC cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> I have used it a couple time and I dont like it. I only really wear eye makeup and concealer and it does not get my waterproof mascara off. the King sooper makeup remover does much better job. This is my first time trying a cleansing oil though and I have not tried the DHC one or M.A.C. one. I was really hoping that this would work because I have so many things about cleansing oils. I guess I will have to give the other brands a try and compare.</li>
            <li> dhc olive user for years  this is just as good  cheaper yes and the smell is not unpleasant washes off nicely and i will deff use again.</li>
            <li> I tried this as a less expensive alternative to DHC and there is no comparison. For my skin&#x27;s needs this product just doesnt do the job. I have combination skin, oily in the T Zone where I am prone to blackheads and dry on my cheeks. The DHC Deep Cleansing Oil produced an immediate and dramatic difference in the size of my pores and the texture of my skin. This product did not produce any results on my skin. It does effectively remove eye makeup and has a pleasant smell so I have been using it for that.  For cleansing I will be going back to DHC. They have truly amazing products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several cleansing oils over the years and this one is the best value for the money. It has a nice scent but it&#x27;s not overly perfumed, the pump is well made, and you can keep the little plastic clip to use when you take the bottle traveling, to avoid the pump getting pushed down accidentally when it&#x27;s packed. My experience with less expensive cleansing oils is that the pump on the bottle is usually leaky, but there is no problem with the Kose. The oil removes all makeup and rinses clean. If this causes people problems with their skin, just remember that it&#x27;s a makeup remover and not necessarily a face wash. I use this to remove makeup, rinse it off, then wash my face with my normal soap. It works great and I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I love double cleansing, but I do not love this oil cleanser. I bought it after running out of my DHC Olive Oil one because I&#x27;d read it was a good dupe. But it&#x27;s not in my opinion. This one isn&#x27;t as good at removing makeup, it leaves a super greasy residue, that I found stayed around even after my second cleansing step, and I&#x27;m not a fan of the orangey scent, it&#x27;s odd and more than a little reminiscent of household cleanser which I don&#x27;t want anywhere near my face, not to mention it sticks around with the greasy feeling. Not my best purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful cleanser for removing makeup and for daily use.  I love that it is reasonably priced!!  I rinses easily, lasts a very long time and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts.  Even my teenage daughters use it!</li>
            <li> This is my first cleansing oil from japan and I love it. It removes the dirt but doesn&#x27;t leave my face dehydrated.</li>
            <li> great product! will buy again</li>
            <li> This oil works great as a first step cleanser. It does a fantastic job at removing all my makeup and even gets off the most stubborn waterproof mascara. I have combo skin (dry cheeks, oily T-zone) and so far have had no problems with breakouts. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love it! Its so amazing and leaves my skin so silky and smooth</li>
            <li> I got for my friend who used my This cleansing oil and she loved it.  A couple month ago, I changed to this from DHC Cleansing Oil.  Work very well and also great price .</li>
            <li> This is a great cleansing oil. It has a soft orange scent and cleans my pores out so well. I get a few grits every time! It emulsifies well, but as a tip: be sure to follow this cleanser up with either a foaming or a milk cleanser, to get the best clean face.</li>
            <li> Good for price. I am a big fan of DHC deep cleansing, but used the product for the really longer years, so tried this product for a change to give facial skin different environment. It works well for me. Price is half of the DHC, which is a good deal.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that great on its own. I use a make up remover, THEN use this for it to be effective. I actually don&#x27;t use it anymore. I made me own by combining water, olive oil and aloe vera  in a bottle. It works great</li>
            <li> Really removes all my make up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible, I feel like most of the makeup is still on my face after using this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using DHC Oil Cleanser for over 10 years and love how it removes makeup so well. Decided to try this brand based on the reviews, since it was quite a bit cheaper. It works just as well. Packaging not as attractive, but I&#x27;m OK with that for a $6 savings per bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!    A little background: I am 30, but still get laughed at when I try and buy adult beverages,  and altogether get mistaken for being vastly younger than I am on a very regular basis. So my skin is very young looking as it is, but I want to keep it that way. I am Dutch and Irish and for that I have very fair and sensitive skin. I also happen to have a rather fickle (sometimes rosey) complexion. My pores clog easily, and whenever I try to treat that my skin dries out and flakes - no matter what it is that I do.  I have tried lots of brands, and spent lots of money on my skin and had just about given up on finding the &#x27;right thing&#x27; until....**drumroll**    ... I heard about the Korean 5-Step regiment and thought, Why not?  I am good friends with a girl (about my age) who is from Korea but visits the USA often. Her skin looks so amazingly flawless, so I finally asked her what it is that she uses. Her go-to is SK-II. At about $100+ per bottle, per product, it is way out of my price but I thought it might be a good starting point in my quest for healthy skin like my friend&#x27;s.    So the 5-step break-down is:    1. Double cleansing â€”&gt; 2. Massage &amp; mask â€”&gt; 3. Tone â€”&gt; 4. Essence â€”&gt; 5. Moisturize  I definitely suggest checking out this blog for more detailed instructions: [...]    1. Double Cleanse. I started with this product and it worked wonders after the first use. My skin felt great, looked shiny, and very healthy. It was a case of - &#x27;must look worse before it looks better&#x27; as a lot of little red bumps appeared - but I could instantly tell that those were the pores that had been purged of oil and residue. Oh, and it absolutely melted away my mascara and eyeliner!  For the second half of the Double Cleanse -  I followed up with Kose Softymo Super Cleansing Wash w/ Collagen.  It is a cream based cleanser that also works to remove make-up. I put a little of this on a cotton pad and apply it all over my face with the pad first and then massageit in before rinsing.    2. Mask - I picked out a Kracie Moisture Mask with Collagen but haven&#x27;t tried it yet. We&#x27;ll see, but so far everything has been great! I like to have a very regimented schedule for my skin care, etc - So Friday night is mask night. I&#x27;ll know how it works by this Saturday morning I suppose.    3. Toning - I use  Rohto Hadalabo Shirojyun Albutin Milk (toner). It stung a little the first time but my goodness did it work! When I used it the next morning there was no stinging whatsoever.    4. Essence/Serum - I haven&#x27;t picked one out yet - In the meantime I&#x27;m counting on the essence from the Kracie mask.  You are, however, supposed to use essence everyday. So, I&#x27;ll need to find a daily at some point.    5. Moisture -  I use Sana By Noevir Hadanomy Deep Mist to top it all off. This is a seriously amazing regiment!    It&#x27;s also highly suggested that you throw  in some exfoliation 2 or 3 times a week, but I haven&#x27;t picked one yet.  It cost about $70-$80 for everything which is pretty obscene (I don&#x27;t like spending more than $10 on anything for myself...Anything! I still feel conflicted over my $11 purse :) ) But this was seriously worth it. In the end, I feel like I&#x27;ve save a lot of money in the long run by paying more for the right thing - rather than the hit-and-miss of trying many, many less expensive brands that don&#x27;t work for me, and therefore end up being a complete waste of my very hard earned money.</li>
            <li> I normally use DHC Deep Cleansing Oil, but this is less expensive and it works almost as well. It does a fine job of getting waterproof sunscreen off (Japanese sunscreens stick to skin like glue).  When I rinse, however, I still feel as though I have a fine film on my skin, while the DHC cleansing oil leaves a &#x27;soap-and-water&#x27; clean feeling without the soap and water.  No irritation for my rosacea with the Softymo cleansing oil.  Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and am disappointed with it.  It does not have the orange scent as in past Kose Softymo Deep Cleansing Oils I have purchased through Amazon.  The consistency also is not the same, it seems thicker.  Additionally It has a smell similar to vegetable oil.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Excellent!! I can really see a change after 2-3 days!</li>
            <li> My last makeup cleansing product could not clean my makeup thoroughly, and left my skin large-pore-looking... This cleansing oil can clean deeply. It even softens my face.</li>
            <li> I went on an oil cleansing binge.  I tried them all and this won.  It&#x27;s less thick than DHC  Works better than Shiseido and Origins.  Liked it better than Bobbi Brown and MAC as well.  I have fairly dry skin but it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and leaves my skin somehow totally cleansed but moist at the same time.  And as a bonus--it costs less than all of them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have tried a few different oil to milk type formulas- I have always really liked the idea of them, but in the past I have broken out- or another I tried didn&#x27;t clean as well.. I love this product- use dry hands and massage product onto dry face until the makeup begins to move and dissolve. Rinse and the oil turns into a milk and rinses away clean without stripping your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried and even more apprehensive when I realized the product had orange oil and a faint citrus scent, as I am very reactive to products with essences and citrus- but I really like this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should probably also mention that I have worked in the cosmetics/skincare industry for over a decade and have a lot of experience with many brands. Such a neat find!</li>
            <li> A good cleansing oil to use to remove all traces of makeup before you do your final face wash. Price was reasonable and lasts a decent time</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful first step in a cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> Too oily and smelled not good not like what I thought originally! Will try another brands of cleansing oil next time!</li>
            <li> I cannot rave ENOUGH about how amazing this product is for my dry, sensitive, acne-prone skin! I tried this product by random chance almost 3+ years ago and every time I try something else, it never measures up and I come back to this. It always cleans my makeup without stripping or drying my face. It has never broken me out or irritated my skin. I LOVE this product and recommend it very very highly for anyone who has sensitive, acne-prone skin. This product does break down makeup, I dont wear waterproof mascara but besides that it takes everything off PERFECTLY. 5 solid stars!</li>
            <li> I love this makeup remover.  Takes off everything gently, thoroughly and then washes off easily.</li>
            <li> This company does animal testing. So sad- I thought it was great, but will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> SHORT REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using this stuff for my double-cleansing method. I have combination skin with the occasional breakouts here and there (maybe once every few months), but nothing too bad. I had read about it on /r/AsianBeauty and decided to check it out. I was afraid to try it based on some of the reviews, but the price helped push me to the edge, so I made a jump for it and gave it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over 2 months now and don&#x27;t really have any complaints. Removes makeup, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on my skin, and hasn&#x27;t caused me any breakouts. So far, so good. It&#x27;s definitely one of those YMMV types of products, so what works for me, may not work for you. I&#x27;m just glad I gave it a try because I can now put the search of finding &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34; to rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LONG REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently started the Asian skincare routine a while back, and for a while I didn&#x27;t do the double-cleansing method. I didn&#x27;t want to deal with oils again, but after a few months, I gave in and decided to suck it up and look for a good oil cleanser to get all my makeup off. I tried out a few oils from Shiseido, The Face Shop, Etude, etc. and wasn&#x27;t too fond of how my skin reacted, didn&#x27;t mesh too well with my sensitive eyes, or how they didn&#x27;t remove enough of my sunscreen and makeup. DHC was usually the brand most recommended, so I had a friend pump out a decent amount into a smaller bottle with a pump for me to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it did well at removing all my makeup and sunscreen, but my skin wasn&#x27;t loving it. Breakout City. I feel so bad because that stuff is a cult-classic and is highly praised by so many! Everything else has done really well during my routine, so I gathered it had to be it since it was the only new thing I had introduced. I gave the remaining bit back to my friend, then decided to hop back on /r/AsianBeauty to see what kind of other oil cleansers I could give a try. So, I found this stuff - The Kose Softymo Deep Cleaning Oil - mentioned here and there by a few users. Reviews seemed iffy, but what the heck. The price was up my alley and Prime could have it on my doorstep in 2 days. I was game to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for a good 2 months before going for this review, and I must say...I love it. It removes my sunscreen and does really well at getting my BB creams and eyeliner off, which was a big plus for me. I wet my face with lukewarm water really well before applying and use the tiniest bit (no more than a pea-size since it&#x27;s a little thick) while massaging it into my face really well. I use a damp cotton ball around my eyes to get my eye makeup off. I don&#x27;t get the greasy feeling that most have stated they get even after using their second cleanser. I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation, especially around my eyes. I haven&#x27;t even had any breakouts, which is odd because I figured I would surely go through &amp;#34;the purge&amp;#34; or something similar, but nope. It just gets the gunk off my face and gets out whatever is down in my pores, leaving my face feeling really smooth and decently clean before moving on to my next cleanser. Some say there is an orange scent to it, but I don&#x27;t really notice it. Then again, I don&#x27;t think I ever really notice the scent/smell of any product unless it&#x27;s super strong and overwhelming, enough to cause my nose to crinkle up and make me sick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As all products are, YMMV (your milage may vary) with this one. If the DHC oil cleanser works well for you and you&#x27;ve been using it for a long time now, then stick with it. Seems most that dislike this one have been using the DHC cleanser for a while and ended up trying this one for the price because it was recommended as a &amp;#34;dupe&amp;#34;. A lot say they can tell a big difference between the two, and I agree, I definitely don&#x27;t see it as a dupe. Except I love this one and really dislike the DHC.he Kose Softymo Deep Cleaning Oil - mentioned here and there by a few users. Reviews seemed iffy, but what the heck. The price was up my alley and Prime could have it on my doorstep in 2 days.

            <li> My skin is acne-prone and dry; hence, checking the ingredients is a must-do for anything that I put upon my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first step in my nightly skincare routine, only when I put on sunscreen during the day. Massage the product on a dry face, and wash it off with water. It removes make-up, sunscreen, dirt, and oil very well. Make sure to use a cleanser afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the products in which I will repurchase due to its ability to clean my skin well, and the fact it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> Does the job. I prefer the boscia one. But the this is cheaper. It&#x27;s a thinner formula so I feel like my face isn&#x27;t as clean after washing it off</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still early days but I like how it cleans and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry. The smell is a little odd at first but I&#x27;ve gotten use to it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this oil cleanser.  As I&#x27;m aging my skin is getting drier and I&#x27;m loving oils in everything -- in this cleanser and in bio oil.  Highly recommend this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will purchase this again....too oily for me, and doesn&#x27;t do very good job either. I&#x27;d better stick with my old cleansing oil</li>
            <li> I was using one of the Shu Uemura cleansing oil and as this product is a best seller in Japan, I thought I could it a try. I was pleasantly surprised and I now love this product. It&#x27;s a great quality of cleansing oil, light on the skin as a cleansing oil is supposed to, while doing the job extremely well! It handle my make up  with no issue at all.&lt;br /&gt;If you have never tried a cleansing oil, this one is a really good one if you do not want to spend $30+ for the same amount of product. It has a nice really subtile smell (really light smell of citrus fruit), and it transform in a nice &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34; texture in the 2nd part of the massage on your skin (when you add a bit of water to continue the massage). If it goes in your eyes, of course your vision will be blurry for a bit but nothing to worry about, it&#x27;s normal as it is oil, and it doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to precise some point here as I can read in some review perturbing statements. Rather you use a cleansing oil or not, you should always double cleanse your skin : 1 to remove your make up and the pollution/dust... of the day, 2 really cleanse your skin. You cannot clean a skin that have a layer of make up on it, it seems logical. This method is not aggressive for the skin as you do not use cotton ball etc but oil to lift the make up and your own skin to rub the product. In addition to that, NO a cleansing oil won&#x27;t give you cystic acne or whatever, as cystic acne is a inflammatory response to bacteria not to mineral oil or whatever can be stated by some. And NO oil does not clog your pores nor does the mineral oil. The skin is supposed to always have a protective barrier especially during the day and the skin care products help ensuring that it does its job...&lt;br /&gt;I break out from time to time (1 or 2 pimples on the chin) and the double cleansing had always helped me as well as layering my skin care product.</li>
            <li> I use this oil to remove the makeup from my face and it works great.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue on my face after I rinse with water nor does it make my face feel tight.  My face always feels smooth and supple after washing with this.  Sometimes if my face has a lot of makeup, I will follow up with another cleanser to make sure my skin is completely clean.  Other times, I just use this cleansing oil as the only wash since I have dry skin and don&#x27;t want it to dry out too much.</li>
            <li> That was the exact item that I ordered. I was totally satisfied with this item. Thank you so much!! Excellent for using privately.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t particularly like this cleansing oil. The Speedy Cleansing oil also made by Kose is MUCH better- it rinses cleanly and the oil is thinner in consistency and cleanses better. Skip this one, buy the other!</li>
            <li> I will keep buying more of this as I run out in the future. By far the best makeup remover I have ever used and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes or skin (even removes waterproof mascara). I use what I suppose is the Japanese double cleansing method: I rub a couple pumps of the oil in circular motions all over my (dry) face and eyes, then use a warm, wet washcloth to remove the oil and my makeup. I follow this step with CeraVe Foaming Cleanser for Normal/Oily skin and the combination works well for me.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and was looking for something to remove make-up before I use my lathering cleanser. I had been using olive oil, but that left my skin a bit oily and was hard to remove completely after cleansing, even with a lathering cleanser. I use two quick pumps and rub on my face, then add one more pump for extra eye make-up. Then I wipe off everything quite easily with a washcloth. I have removed regular make-up, waterproof eye make-up, mascara, and face paint with this. As long as I do wipe it off with a washcloth I never notice any residue or oiliness. I have used it without a lathering cleanser afterward and had no oiliness. Sometimes if I do use this and a cleanser and do not apply a moisturizer I will feel a bit of tightness, but nothing more. I love this! Perfect for me!</li>
            <li> great replacement t for M.A.C. cleanse off gel</li>
            <li> This is such a great basic oil cleanser. There are oil cleansers out there being marketed with simaliar ingredients for three times the price -outrageous! I myself have come to love cleansing w/straight mineral oil and grapseed oil as well, but when I&#x27;m looking for one with emulsifiers that rinses clean(no film left behind) this is always the one I reach for. For $9 and free shipping here at Amazon it&#x27;s a steal in my opinion :) -It removes ALL of my long-wearing makeup and daily sunscreen -great stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing oil.</li>
            <li> I use this cleansing oil as part of my double cleansing routine and Iâ€™m in the middle about it. It does work very well at getting all of my face makeup off but it doesnâ€™t get all of my eye makeup off and it tends to make my contacts cloudy after use. It also leaves my skin feeling pretty stripped considering itâ€™s an oil cleanser and because I follow up with a cream cleanser afterwards, by the end of my cleansing steps my skin is feeling pretty tight and stripped. I also noticed that the consistency of this oil is a bit thicker than other cleansing oils, it doesnâ€™t seem to affect its performance but it might cause clogged pores if you donâ€™t double cleanse when using this. I only need one pump for my entire face and itâ€™s a great value at this price but it adds an extra step to my routine because I have to use a separate eye makeup remover to get all my makeup off and end up using more lotion because my face gets dried out. I think The Face Shop Rice Water Cleansing Oil is a much better buy and itâ€™s not very expensive either.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Don&#x27;t be afraid to use if you are oily. This cleanser breaks down oil and makeup then the second water hits it, it washes away with no residue. Awesome at removing waterproof mascera!</li>
            <li> After Shu Uemura went out of US store distribution I ordered this to give a try. Cleans as well as Shu&#x27;s green oil for so much less money. I have&#x27;t tried DHC yet to compare it to. I like the light, citrusy scent and it doesn&#x27;t linger after the oil is removed. The bright sunny packaging is cute to. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I think the pump does dispense a little to much product at a time so I try not to depress it all the way.</li>
            <li> Good to have this oil and better than I expected</li>
            <li> Does not compare to DHC&#x27;s oil cleanser, although I thought it would. Not a bad product, just more oily than was expecting.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I use waterproof mascara &amp; with sudsings soap it takes some hard scrubbing, soap gets in my eye, &amp; I usually have mascara still left over. With this oil, it strips all of my make off with little effort, &amp; leaves my face feeling clean &amp; not just stripped. Even if you have oily skin &amp; the thought of cleaning your face with oil mortifies you, try it. You&#x27;ll love how soft it leaves your skin &amp; you&#x27;ll be surprised at how clean it&#x27;ll be when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Kose cleansing oil for 3 years now. It truly helps in my evening makeup removing process. I lather this on for 30 seconds, wash off, and then use another cleanser (Purity or Cerave) to remove the oily residue it leaves. This combination removes ALL of my daily makeup: moisturizer, sunscreen, foundation, concealer, setting powder, blush, bronzer, eyeliner, eyeshadow and eyelash glue. My skin never broke out with this and it leaves my skin feeling balanced, not tight, dry or oily.&lt;br /&gt; Note you must use another cleanser after this because cleansing oils are not meant to be used on their own! A lot of reviewers also compare this to DHC, which I&#x27;ve never actually tried, but I don&#x27;t know why anyone would pay more than half the price of this when this works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I use this to remove my makeup. It&#x27;s very gentle but removes even the most full-coverage foundations. You can use it to remove eye maekup, even waterproof mascara, but it can make your vision a little blurry until you rinse it off well. I don&#x27;t get any irritation, even when used on eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now. It has been the BEST at removing all my make-up, waterproof mascara included! I used to purchase this product from a specialty store but then I moved away and for several months tried to find a replacement product but nothing could melt my eye make-up like this little beauty. I am SO happy to find this on amazon, now I&#x27;ll never run empty again!   I use this cleansing oil mostly to take off my eye-makeup. To use this product successfully you must follow these steps:  1. A couple pumps onto fingers and onto my eyes (this starts to melt the makeup).  2. Wet fingers with warm (or lukewarm) water and rub onto eyes (this melts even more makeup).  3. Follow with your usual facial cleanser.  4. Rinse  And done! Remember, this is a cleansing oil so I believe it does need an additional wash-off step, although my mom likes using only this to wash everything off (she uses much less make-up than I) and does not use a follow-up cleanser. After I use this to wash off my eye-make up I do not feel any tightness or dryness around my delicate eye area. Also, while rubbing this product into my eyes it does not hurt my eyes at all, but it does cause a hazy film that goes away with after rinsing. Not all cleansing oils are the same - this one is a mid-range price that is a good consistency and melts make-up so well! This is my holy grail eyemakeup/regular makeup remover!</li>
            <li> I wear foundation on a daily basis because I have a lot of acne scaring. When I used just the conventional face soap, I felt like all the make up just stayed on my face. After applying toner on my face, I noticed foundation still coming off of my face onto the cotton pad. After doing some research, I found out about DHC oil cleanser. It worked very well when I used DHC oil to get rid of the foundation and a face soap afterwards, but it was getting too expensive. So I wondered what kind of cheaper options were out there and I found this product. This is much cheaper than DHC, so I was kind of worried that it won&#x27;t be as good. One major difference is that Kose Softymo is much thinner than DHC one. But I honestly think it does the job as well as the DHC one. As I did with the DHC one, I use Kose to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; the foundation and I like to wipe it with a Kleenex. Then I wash with a face cleanser afterwards. I use toner after cleaning, and I don&#x27;t see any residue of foundation on the cotton pad after wiping. Plus, this product works well on my very sensitive/acne prone skin. I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and I&#x27;m gonna continue to use it!</li>
            <li> Not the best. I use it to clean sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin oil but smells and feels nice.</li>
            <li> I hoped this would remove makeup, but it doesn&#x27;t (not even regular mascara and eyeshadow). That&#x27;s the whole point of facewash for me, so I won&#x27;t be re-ordering it.</li>
            <li> It removes makeup completely</li>
            <li> At first, it didn&#x27;t feel as thick and luxurious as the DHC oil I got before (which I adore). But, DHC is expensive, so I tried this option. I use it every morning to wash my face. Works great and I just ordered 2 more bottles.</li>
            <li> your face needs oil, if you didn&#x27;t know now you know, so this basically takes away the bad oils that clog your pores in a way that doesn&#x27;t strip your skin of the good oils too. it cleans off anything stubborn and especially great for waterproof mascara. I use the double cleansing formula so this is a must.</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil works great, even on my oily/ acne prone skin. It emulsifies really well and makes my skin soft and clean. I previously used the The Face Shop bright rice cleansing oil and it was overly fragranced and made my eyes burn the entire night. I tried to fight through it and that was a mistake. I switched to this and it&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s my new holy grail cleansing oil!</li>
            <li> best way to take off mascara!</li>
            <li> Great for double cleansing and great price. I&#x27;ve found one pump to be enough for me to remove makeup and sunscreen before using a follow-up cleanser. The orange and vegetable oil-like scent is a little odd but mild.</li>
            <li> I got this after seeing a review on youtube for this product. It&#x27;s very easy to wash off, and it does leave my face feeling very clean. Before I started using this product I had horrible combination skin on my face. This product has gotten rid of the oily parts. so it&#x27;s easier for me to work with my skin now, atleast if I&#x27;m going to have dry facial skin, it&#x27;s all dry! So I like it. It has made my tricky skin easier to deal with.</li>
            <li> I think this works almost as well as the expensive DHC. I&#x27;ve had no problems with offensive odors nor skin/eye irritations and it does a good job removing my make up. It does have a different feel in comparison with the more expensive product. This product has a loose more liquid feel where the DHC feels smoother thus goes on easier. Regardless which product I use I always follow with a non oily cleanser. Considering the minor differences noted in the performance of this product when compared to DHC and the considerable monetary savings I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> This is my first oil cleanser. When used correctly, it works wonders. You want to pump it into your dry hands and rub it onto your dry face - if either are wet, it will not work. Gently rub into your skin, it will remove makeup, dead skin and sometimes even clogged pores (looks and feels like gritty pieces of sand). It is so satisfying to literally be able to see it unclogging my pores! It has really helped clear up my acne and my skin is so soft and smooth after using, no longer flakey and dry. Rub/massage it in for 1-2 min then after that, rinse with warm water - it&#x27;ll emulsify and look milky. I always cleanse with a foaming cleanser after use but it isn&#x27;t mandatory. This product would be really great for any skin types - acneic, dry, combo and even oily (oily what?! Yes oil dissolves oil)! :) I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone, it&#x27;s a great addition to any skincare routine.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find a cheaper alternative to my staple cleansing oil by Boscia, and I was disappointed with this one. It didn&#x27;t remove makeup nearly as well, I always had residue even after rubbing it into my skin for longer than necessary, and seemed to just irritate my skin. Will definitely have to be sticking to Boscia.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s meant to do- be an oil cleanser! It&#x27;s a little thinner than what I&#x27;m used to, but it still serves its purpose and for its price, what could be better than that?</li>
            <li> I only use this for removing eye makeup, as using it on my whole face will cause closed comedones after a few uses. It does the job though! I only really use a small amount, so I feel like it will last a long time. I have no idea why the areas around my eyes don&#x27;t break out because I&#x27;ve used products that have done that before...</li>
            <li> I have been using another brand of deep cleansing oil and decided to try the Kose product because of the price.  The results are so close that I am glad that I made the switch.</li>
            <li> Really a great product and an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> really good cleansing oil, remove the make up completely and easy to wash with water. And the best thing is the low price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using cleansing oils for years. I&#x27;ve used shu uemura (pink bottle) and DHC cleansing oil and decided to try this out since it was cheaper. Every time I use this it remove all my eyes and face makeup but it break me out :( so it&#x27;s a no for me. I have sensitive combo skin, sadly it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. I use it every night, and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on my face nor does it leave it super dry. My skin is really weird, where after I wash my face, it&#x27;s like every single bit of natural oil my face produces is stripped off, leaving my skin super dry... but hours later, my face compensates by OVERproducing more oil! This face wash has given me that sort of &amp;#34;balance&amp;#34; that I need, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with dryness or oiliness as of yet.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nice Oil Cleanser to help remove my make up at the end of the day. I liked the feel and the smell of this product. It seemed to do a great job removing my make up. I actually did follow up removing my make up with this product with a foaming cleanser I trust that I know doesn&#x27;t break me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only TWO DAYS of using this product, I got a cyst the size of a nickle on my cheek. I never EVER break out my cheeks, ever. And it hurt like hell.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used DHC Cleansing Oil but I find that Kose&#x27;s version does a good job. It removes all the gunk from my face at the end of the day and removes makeup very well. It washes off pretty well, though, you do have to use another cleanser to get the few remaining bits off. It didn&#x27;t break my face out or irritate it either. Overall, I like this product and would use it again.</li>
            <li> I have the world&#x27;s most frustrating skin: oily, acne-prone and very easily clogged. I love this make up remover and I&#x27;m on my second bottle now! I first remove my eye make up with a seperate eye make up remover, and then I massage the oil to my face and let it set for two minutes. Then I use warm water to slowly wash off the oil. The awesome thing about this is that when it touches water, it turns into this light and white foam, which makes your skin feel very clean afterwards. I usually finish with an additional step of cleansing my face with some cetaphil after all of that, but that&#x27;s only because I have very annoying skin. Overall, this is a great make up remover that does the job well. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have serious blackheads on my nose, and I use cleansing oil mainly for removing blackheads. And I can say this product is great. I haven&#x27;t tried DHC, so I can&#x27;t say if it works better or not. But I have used Shu Uemura deep cleansing oil, and I can tell more stuff coming out and coming out faster than Shu Uemura. All I do is pump 3 times and massage the oil onto my face concentrating on the area around my nose and cheek. Just after couple of strokes, I can feel little particles coming out of my skin. Longer I massage more stuff comes out. Gosh it is addictive!</li>
            <li> This cleansing oil isn&#x27;t as effective or luxurious feeling as high priced DHC or Shu Uemura oils, but it&#x27;s vastly cheaper AND honestly, if this is used in combo with a followup face wash, it really doesn&#x27;t matter. I&#x27;ve used this oil for 3+ years and based on my experience, this will remove a majority of your makeup. I then use a gentle face wash to get the rest off, and follow that up with a sweep of Thayers witch hazel. This trifecta works great for cleaning and prepping your skin for subsequent serums and treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, an affordable cleansing oil that generally works well. One bottle lasts me 6+ months. If your skincare routine is already multi-step, there is no reason to shell out for a more expensive oil.</li>
            <li> By far, the best cleansing oil I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s not greasy at all after you rinse it, but it removes waterproof makeup excellently.</li>
            <li> have tried other products like this but those products never did the job, the kose softymo deep cleansing oil does. My skin was clean and makeup removed. I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly to dissolve a full face of waterproof sunscreen and/or makeup. I have sensitive eyes and clog-prone skin - this doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes (I have used a lot of Asian cleansing oils and this is one of the only ones that doesn&#x27;t sting), doesn&#x27;t break me out. . Love that I can buy it off Amazon, and price is good (though it used to be like $11... sigh should have stocked up then).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: Cleansing oils are not meant to rinse 100% clean, you are supposed to follow up with another cleanser to get rid of the residue. Doesn&#x27;t mean you have to use something strong and dry out your face, I use a really gentle cleanser like Aquanil.</li>
