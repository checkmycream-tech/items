            <li>I love my veil....</li>
            <li>Overall very happy with this veil.</li>
            <li>luckily my husband re-cut the end to get rid of the ragged cut and we used our own combs.</li>
            <li>Very basically cut but good quality and can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>This veil is so beautiful and long!</li>
            <li>You are better off going to a local fabric shop and buying your own tulle</li>
            <li>Not as dense and full.</li>
            <li>It is soft and long, very good quality.</li>
            <li>pretty good deal very simple....</li>
            <li>I received this today (earlier than expected) and it is beautiful, much better than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Is amazing is super long</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>but it is just cut straight..</li>
            <li>The cob fix the veil firm in the head, but not looks nice because it is straight</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super pretty and very simple like I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited that I only paid $25 for this!</li>
            <li>We plan to add rhinestones for a little more wow factor.</li>
            <li>I have no trouble with this staying in my hair and</li>
            <li>Wow..</li>
            <li>Super long, simple, and came with the comb.</li>
            <li>This veil is notably less opaque than the picture would imply, but it is definitely 118 inches long, and it has two thick layers of really nice tulle, securely connected to a clear plastic comb.</li>
            <li>Seeing how good the price is, I  was a little skeptical  about the quality of the product.</li>

This veil is notably less opaque than the picture would imply, but it is definitely 118 inches long, and it has two thick layers of really nice tulle, securely connected to a clear plastic comb. I have no trouble with this staying in my hair and the veil is really lovely. I&#x27;m so excited that I only paid $25 for this! After our wedding, I&#x27;ll upload some pictures of it with my gown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated to add pics! This veil is beautiful!</li>

            <li> It was just tulle on a comb nothing fancy and even the cut at the end was uneven and ragged. It was a last minute veil and luckily my husband re-cut the end to get rid of the ragged cut and we used our own combs. You are better off going to a local fabric shop and buying your own tulle and you can do what you want.</li>
            <li> Product was as described. Very basically cut but good quality and can&#x27;t beat the price. We plan to add rhinestones for a little more wow factor. Overall very happy with this veil.</li>
            <li> This veil is perfect! It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. I love it!</li>
