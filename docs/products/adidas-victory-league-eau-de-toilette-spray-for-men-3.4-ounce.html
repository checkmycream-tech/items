            <li> Great scent. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is the scent seems to wear off fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and it smells great.  My wife really enjoys this on me.  It&#x27;s a lighter scent so it&#x27;s not overpowering.  If you&#x27;re looking for something musky or heavy you should look elsewhere.  Despite it&#x27;s light nature, this lasts longer on me than most colognes.</li>
            <li> Very good price excellent product</li>
            <li> Lovin it for years, sing 2006 victory league deodorant. Its getting harder to get, i&#x27;m gonna buy a lifetime supply of it :D</li>
            <li> the product is good, but the package was open , not plastic coated and looks used.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice but doesn&#x27;t last long, not even an hour! For the price, it is a steal but I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend really likes this smell, and I do too. It is very sweet and soft, yet masculine, never overpowering. I notice vanilla for sure. Very inexpensive, which allows you to put it on more liberally, which you will have to do. The scent does not last as long as more established colognes, but it will linger faintly. Recommended for those who don&#x27;t need a powerful scent or want something to carry with you and put on after exercising.</li>
            <li> This stuff has given me so many compliments over the years.I kinda wish it was more expensive so it doesnt seem like i buy cheap cologne</li>
            <li> great cheap lotion for everyday and work out at gym use</li>
            <li> I get almost daily compliments. I have worn a lot of different colognes over the years. Ranging from extremely expensive to cheap. This is my favorite and worn it for over a year.</li>
            <li> I bought one because I knew it, and this was my third one. It smells good, lasts long, and girls love it. so get one people</li>
            <li> just look like water no smile</li>
            <li> I use it for in between times for jobs. Leave it in my glovebox and use a couple spritz. So far so good and this smells good too. I was trying to replace my HUGO BOSS cologne that i had for years.</li>
            <li> i knows my colognes. this is a good scent can fetch a compliment but has to be within 10 minutes of applying because after that its non existent. the only way this should be purchased is to keep in a gym bag n smell aight when hittin the gym for an hour. will never buy again</li>
            <li> A good Cologne For everyday wearing.  Nice smell to it. Quick delivery. David Hill</li>

            <li> Smells great,not over powering but great please sense.</li>
            <li> Smells quite close to aeropostales Benton cologne, except Benton lasts about 2 hours but the smell can be found if you smell your shirt</li>
