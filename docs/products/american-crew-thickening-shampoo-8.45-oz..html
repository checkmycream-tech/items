            <li>SMELLS GOOD.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t work that great but is ok</li>
            <li>I travel some, so I often try hotel provided shampoos, some of which are quite nice.  </li>
            <li>i tried many shampoos over the years and this one is by far the best for my needs.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo will thicken the hair shafts as well as making your hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, and love the way it works.  </li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo</li>
            <li>This American Crew Hair Thickening shampoo is the best I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Instead irritated my scalp and gave me more dandruff.</li>
            <li>I have always love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>but it appears to me my thinning hair looks better, which is a confidence booster.</li>
            <li>all i know is that my hair has never looked better..</li>
            <li>I notice my hair feels more &amp;#34;substantial&amp;#34; as I brush it.  </li>
            <li>smell is ok to me.  </li>
            <li>Until then, I believe the demographic that liked the original will not be the one who likes this product and will be looking for something better.</li>
            <li>But there are many more important had beens that are no longer available.</li>
            <li>I notice a huge difference in the way my hair behaves.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Great product especially for those of us losing our hair!</li>
            <li>i lightly put this in my hair and rinse it off.</li>
            <li>My experience is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>use this in conjunction with American Crew gel, which is also a great product</li>
            <li>Smell is fine, hair is clean</li>
            <li>The scent is clean and light.  </li>
            <li>I got this when the original Thickening Shampoo became unavailable.</li>
            <li>The original formula was a 5 star product that I used for years.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to this version vs the &#x27;original&#x27; that I&#x27;ve read</li>
            <li>scent, great product, just needs to get packaged from amazon a little better.</li>
            <li>Between this and the conditioner, I&#x27;d have to spend $60/month to clean my friggin&#x27; hair...</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t feel clean after washing.</li>
            <li>I used to use Paul Mitchel for men and while I do like the smell of that shampoo better, the AC gives FAR better results for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good shampoo that gets you&#x27;re hair clean and fresh smelling (in the most masculine way possible).  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t pay full price in the store for Crew over some cheap-o brand, but I think it&#x27;s worth it for the discount you get buying online through amazon.  </li>
            <li>With luck, this will go the way of New Coke and return to the original.</li>
            <li>Although the use of thickening shampoo will not reverse the problem, it can thicken the hair each day to give us the needed appearance that we are not getting older (or not as quickly).</li>
            <li>I use it on a daily basis and have done so for many years.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s works for me, really does thick your hair and make it stronger and with more texture i love the product, it would be nice if Amazon start carrying the American Crew Hair Recovery Ampoules, that way i don&#x27;t have to buy it some</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way the peppermint feels on my hair and head, especially in the morning!  </li>
            <li>Takes awhile to start seeing the results but should notice change in your hair after the first 3-4 days after use.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>American Crew Thickening Shampoo cleans nicely without the harshness of many other brands and types.  </li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo, which not only smells great and \\&quot;manly\\&quot;, but gives my thinning hair enough &#x27;fluff&#x27; to hide the fact.</li>
            <li>I usually love American Crew, but this one didn&#x27;t really impress.</li>
            <li>Be honest with yourself, this is only a holding action as you will not look like your 20 again by just washing your hair.</li>
            <li>DID NOT NOTICE MUCH DIFFERENCE IN HAIR THINNING.&lt;br /&gt;USED</li>
            <li>I consider it reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t that all that really matters?</li>
            <li>Good products...but not much better than normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>After the first week of using this daily, my hair is thicker and my scalp is not visible at a quick glance.  </li>
            <li>My husbands head looks a bit better, but going to try other things before trying this again.</li>
            <li>There are plenty of other options, such as Pantene, that lather, smell great, and produce the same result as this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It means each strand will be microscopically thicker, and added together, your hair will be slightly thicker - not that you will have more hair.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Only downside of this product is the smell when applying the shampoo, for me the smell is a little too strong and smells a little &amp;#34;chemically&amp;#34; for my taste, but other than that great.</li>
            <li>I used this everyday and my hair feels very clean and always looks shiny.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it is preventing the hair loss at all, but it does make my hair look healthy and manageable..</li>
            <li>Not sure what is in this shampoo, but I bought it thinking that it would be more natural ingredients and help my hair.</li>
            <li>I got this for my hair because it had started receding and it didn&#x27;t do much, so I got finasteride instead, and my hair is coming back!</li>
            <li>Product that showed online was the old formula that was just the thickening shampoo</li>
            <li>Too Early to See.</li>
            <li>So Far.</li>
            <li>I love it, I am using several other things to help my hair from thinning, so iam not sure which product is really doing..</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it advertises, and is not as pungent as other gels/cremes.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell, but maybe he did not use it long enough, or didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough.</li>
            <li>I decided to use the stimulating conditioner and it has caused a severe rash / Eczema that caused my whole face to turn red and peel in blotches so dramatically that I was forced to go to Dr. and was advised to stop using the new hair products immediately.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to describe it other than slight musk mixed with an almost ozone smell, like right before it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting but so far this seems almost the same as the basic American Crew shampoo I always use.</li>
            <li> Not exactly growing hair like an Arab, but have only been using for a short time...</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning in the front and my scalp is easily visible through my very thin almost wispy hair.  </li>
            <li> , I was busy with the other 900 things I have to buy a month!!</li>
            <li> I hate when companies will not leave good things alone.</li>
            <li> This new one leaves an oily film on my hair and makes it flat and dull.</li>
            <li> Maybe a victim of freezing??  </li>
            <li> As long as you are going to shower and shampoo your hair each day, why not get a little something extra.  </li>
            <li> A little lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I do miss a product that American Crew made in the past, which was a leave in, thickening conditioner.</li>
            <li> Just as others have said: The shampoo fails to lather, unless you use large quantities.  </li>
            <li> Like watered down maybe?  </li>
            <li> It seemed to make the hair a little thicker looking than some other products but not a miracle cure if your hair is thinning.</li>
            <li> I just mess it up with my hands and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using this product for a couple of weeks now, I did sort of notice that my hair looks a little thicker every time after taking a shower.</li>
            <li> After reading other&#x27;s reviews of the American Crew Thickening Shampoo, I was skeptical, but I bought it anyway.  </li>
            <li> I will also note that I also purchased a second bottle of this shampoo at Target, thinking that maybe it was a bad online purchase, but it, too, produced the same result.</li>
            <li> Seems to slow down the balding process at least a little bit.</li>
            <li> No magic here.  </li>
            <li> My wife tells me the hair feels twice as thick as it did before using this shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bad enough paying $11 for a bottle of shampoo, but to have it show up and</li>
            <li> Whether you are 19 or 99, none of us want our scalp hair to thin and disappear.</li>
            <li> While it performs no miracles, it makes my thin hair manageable.  </li>
            <li> This bottle however seems a bit thin?  </li>
            <li> Who knows, not happy.</li>
            <li> I thought the smell was a little like medicine but not too bad.</li>
            <li> yes I should have noticed it, but I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> Fake product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fake as can be.</li>
            <li> And sorry guys, it gives women volume, too!!!</li>

            <li> Product works great for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I used this everyday and my hair feels very clean and always looks shiny.</li>
            <li> Only shampoo my husband will use.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is preventing the hair loss at all, but it does make my hair look healthy and manageable..</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t work that great but is ok</li>

I do miss a product that American Crew made in the past, which was a leave in, thickening conditioner. But there are many more important had beens that are no longer available.</li>
            <li> I got this for my hair because it had started receding and it didn&#x27;t do much, so I got finasteride instead, and my hair is coming back!</li>
            <li> SMELLS GOOD. DID NOT NOTICE MUCH DIFFERENCE IN HAIR THINNING.&lt;br /&gt;USED FOR 3 WEEKS NO BENIFIT I CAN SEE/FEEL.&lt;br /&gt;IT ISNT ANYTHING I WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite shampoos.  I love the smell, and love the way it works.  My hair is fuller and shinier.  A little lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> American Crew Thickening Shampoo cleans nicely without the harshness of many other brands and types.  i tried many shampoos over the years and this one is by far the best for my needs.  The scent is clean and light.  I consider it reasonably priced.  While it performs no miracles, it makes my thin hair manageable.  I use it on a daily basis and have done so for many years.  I purchase it from Amazon because I cannot find it in stores.  I travel some, so I often try hotel provided shampoos, some of which are quite nice.  When I return, however, I always resume using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I m so happy with this shampoo... I hope soon will see the effect it has on my hair</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it.  It does exactly what it advertises, and is not as pungent as other gels/cremes.</li>
            <li> Good products...but not much better than normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo it&#x27;s works for me, really does thick your hair and make it stronger and with more texture i love the product, it would be nice if Amazon start carrying the American Crew Hair Recovery Ampoules, that way i don&#x27;t have to buy it some where else since i have Prime member, please Amazon bring the hair recovery ampoules!</li>
            <li> This was not the same product picture that was online.  Product that showed online was the old formula that was just the thickening shampoo so that&#x27;s what I thought I ordered.  When I received product it was the recovery formula.  I do not like this formula</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bad enough paying $11 for a bottle of shampoo, but to have it show up and its the size of a travel bottle is obscene!! Yes, the size is listed...yes I should have noticed it, but I&#x27;m sorry, I was busy with the other 900 things I have to buy a month!! They should be ashamed of themselves for even offering a bottle this size. Between this and the conditioner, I&#x27;d have to spend $60/month to clean my friggin&#x27; hair...and there&#x27;s not even much left! For this price Minoxidol should be IN the bottle.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I have been very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> The only shampoo I use.  Great product especially for those of us losing our hair!</li>
            <li> I got this when the original Thickening Shampoo became unavailable. I hate when companies will not leave good things alone. The original formula was a 5 star product that I used for years. This new one leaves an oily film on my hair and makes it flat and dull. It also doesn&#x27;t feel clean after washing. With luck, this will go the way of New Coke and return to the original. Until then, I believe the demographic that liked the original will not be the one who likes this product and will be looking for something better.</li>
            <li> This American Crew Hair Thickening shampoo is the best I&#x27;ve tried.  Not just for thickening, but for controlling my hair.  I have been using it for about one year and whenever I travel and am without it I notice a huge difference in the way my hair behaves.  A lot of days, I don&#x27;t even use a brush or comb.  I just mess it up with my hands and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without this shampoo, my hair is flyaway and all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With it, each strand is thicker and stays put when it dries after brushing when wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(For those who are expecting miracles like covering bald spots, that is not what \\&quot;thickener\\&quot; means.  It means each strand will be microscopically thicker, and added together, your hair will be slightly thicker - not that you will have more hair.)</li>
            <li> This shampoo is not a miracle worker, you can still see where my bald spot is comming in, but I do feel my hair becomming noticably thicker after only two weeks use. I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son.  He loves the crew collection.  He said, it is a perfect match for him.  He would recommend the crew collection to boys &amp; men!!</li>
            <li> Too Early to See. Hair Feels Great and Looks Good So Far.</li>
            <li> Not sure what is in this shampoo, but I bought it thinking that it would be more natural ingredients and help my hair. Instead irritated my scalp and gave me more dandruff.</li>
            <li> I have always love this shampoo.  I &amp;#34;claim&amp;#34; I bought it for my husband, but who are we kidding - I use it too!  I absolutely love the way the peppermint feels on my hair and head, especially in the morning!  It&#x27;s invigorating!  And sorry guys, it gives women volume, too!!!</li>
            <li> Maybe it is mostly psychological but it appears to me my thinning hair looks better, which is a confidence booster.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a couple of weeks now, I did sort of notice that my hair looks a little thicker every time after taking a shower. When  washing your hair why not use a product that helps thicken hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside of this product is the smell when applying the shampoo, for me the smell is a little too strong and smells a little &amp;#34;chemically&amp;#34; for my taste, but other than that great. Will probably purchase again.</li>
            <li> like how my hair feels and looks after using crew</li>
            <li> Product works great. Takes awhile to start seeing the results but should notice change in your hair after the first 3-4 days after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used American crew for a while now.  This bottle however seems a bit thin?  Like watered down maybe?  Smells the same, runs out of the bottle.  Maybe a victim of freezing??  Who knows, not happy.</li>
            <li> Smells like industrial chemicals. Used it once and tossed out</li>
            <li> I love it, I am using several other things to help my hair from thinning, so iam not sure which product is really doing.. all i know is that my hair has never looked better.. i lightly put this in my hair and rinse it off.</li>
            <li> Fake product. I should have listened to the reviews. It&#x27;s fake as can be. Amazon needs to tighten up the quality control before lawsuits are filed.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo, which not only smells great and \\&quot;manly\\&quot;, but gives my thinning hair enough &#x27;fluff&#x27; to hide the fact.</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase of this shampoo for the gentleman in my life... He can see some thickening of his hair... Isn&#x27;t that all that really matters?</li>
            <li> Great stuff for thinning hair</li>
            <li> I feel it actually makes my hair feel greasier and flatter. I usually love American Crew, but this one didn&#x27;t really impress.</li>
            <li> I thought the smell was a little like medicine but not too bad. It seemed to make the hair a little thicker looking than some other products but not a miracle cure if your hair is thinning. Be honest with yourself, this is only a holding action as you will not look like your 20 again by just washing your hair.</li>
            <li> My husbands head looks a bit better, but going to try other things before trying this again. I really can&#x27;t tell, but maybe he did not use it long enough, or didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough.</li>
            <li> Seems to slow down the balding process at least a little bit.</li>
            <li> Quality product at a great price!!</li>
            <li> After reading other&#x27;s reviews of the American Crew Thickening Shampoo, I was skeptical, but I bought it anyway.  Just as others have said: The shampoo fails to lather, unless you use large quantities.  There are plenty of other options, such as Pantene, that lather, smell great, and produce the same result as this shampoo.  I will also note that I also purchased a second bottle of this shampoo at Target, thinking that maybe it was a bad online purchase, but it, too, produced the same result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen bigger at target or walmart for the same price.</li>
            <li> No magic here.  It&#x27;s a good shampoo that gets you&#x27;re hair clean and fresh smelling (in the most masculine way possible).  I wouldn&#x27;t pay full price in the store for Crew over some cheap-o brand, but I think it&#x27;s worth it for the discount you get buying online through amazon.  No complaints w/ my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with this shampoo.  I can&#x27;t speak to this version vs the &#x27;original&#x27; that I&#x27;ve read existed before.  My experience is fantastic.  My hair is thinning in the front and my scalp is easily visible through my very thin almost wispy hair.  After the first week of using this daily, my hair is thicker and my scalp is not visible at a quick glance.  I notice no build up and I have no itching or dryness.  I notice my hair feels more &amp;#34;substantial&amp;#34; as I brush it.  My wife tells me the hair feels twice as thick as it did before using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is ok to me.  I don&#x27;t know how to describe it other than slight musk mixed with an almost ozone smell, like right before it rains.&lt;br /&gt;I use this in conjunction with American Crew gel, which is also a great product and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I used to use Paul Mitchel for men and while I do like the smell of that shampoo better, the AC gives FAR better results for me.</li>
            <li> When I received this it was soaked from a crack in the bottle. There was enough of the shampoo left in the bottle so I didn&#x27;t complain to the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great scent, great product, just needs to get packaged from amazon a little better.</li>
            <li> Not exactly growing hair like an Arab, but have only been using for a short time... Will update review later.</li>
            <li> I have been using American Crew Gel faithfully for years.  I decided to use the stimulating conditioner and it has caused a severe rash / Eczema that caused my whole face to turn red and peel in blotches so dramatically that I was forced to go to Dr. and was advised to stop using the new hair products immediately.  It has caused red puffiness that turned into peeling skin, which has resulted in my face having what appears to have left permanent scars on my face and nose.  My scalp is covered with lesions that bleed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I was expecting but so far this seems almost the same as the basic American Crew shampoo I always use. Smell is fine, hair is clean but I&#x27;ve yet to see any noticeable improvement to the hairline. I should probably add some version of Rogaine to the mix and allow this to be the supplement. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
