            <li>It has one of the best scents of any hand soap I&#x27;ve ever used, leaving your hands feeling soft and clean, not perfumed.</li>
            <li>One recipient liked it so much that she began buying it on her own and continues to use it.</li>
            <li>All natural great smelling product</li>
            <li>What I really love is the added benefit of how this product is derived - \\&quot;full circle\\&quot; creation from the making of bio-diesel fuel.  </li>

            <li>Beautiful, aromatic scent; gentle suds and classic packaging.</li>
            <li>I liked that it is very bubbly</li>
            <li>I fell in LOVE with this soap when I first used it at Osteria Mozza.  </li>

            <li>I also loved the personal hand written thank</li>
            <li>leaves you clean and feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li>Not the super smell that was posted on the reviews..</li>
            <li>This is a rare find - the packaging is simple and chic (looks great next to the sink), the soap feels silky and has a light fresh scent, and the company that makes Further is made up of genuinely nice people with a cool mission.</li>

            <li>I was hooked by the smell when I first used it at the Fairmont Hotel, but that is just one piece of the puzzle.</li>
            <li>an avid hand washer, this soap thoroughly cleans my hands.</li>
            <li>I first use this hand soap in S.F.Ca.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend Further.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so earthy and light at the same time.</li>
            <li>Plus I&#x27;m supporting a local family - just him, his wife, (and their son helps, too).</li>
            <li>Even my 14 year old son likes it!  </li>

            <li> love the soap, a bit expensive though.</li>
            <li> I so enjoy the smell of this soap! I just wish it was a bit less expensive.</li>
            <li> You HAVE to try this hand soap.  It literally is the best smelling hand soap there is.  I love it and my guests love it.  Also, this soap that is about sustainability and simplicity which needs to be supported.  I know I know lets not get too deep about our handsoap, but I think theses people who take grease from gourmet eateries (Mario Batali) and turn them into soap should be supported for their sustainability and innovation.    It is expensive for soap -- your guests will ask about it -- promise.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, aromatic scent; gentle suds and classic packaging. What I really love is the added benefit of how this product is derived - \\&quot;full circle\\&quot; creation from the making of bio-diesel fuel.  Truly genius!</li>
            <li> After sampling this soap at the LA Street Food Fest at the Rose Bowl, we bought this soap for all of our home bathrooms, as well as our office. Everyone LOVES it. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling dry and the scent is the most amazingly clean and wonderful scent of any hand soap I&#x27;ve ever experienced. We find ourselves LOVING washing our hands simply to smell them. Plus I&#x27;m supporting a local family - just him, his wife, (and their son helps, too). I also loved the personal hand written thank you note from the owner.</li>
            <li> I love everything about Further. I was hooked by the smell when I first used it at the Fairmont Hotel, but that is just one piece of the puzzle. It&#x27;s fantastic that they have a pure soap made from recycled oil - so creative.  Also, when I got my lotion and soap in the mail it came with a hand written note. If that wasn&#x27;t enough, they called me to ask me how to improve their bottles. A batch of their caps were leaky and they wanted to promptly fix the issue.  Good people, good idea and good product. Further - hats off to you!</li>
            <li> I emailed the company to ask if this product was hypoallergenic obviously because of what it&#x27;s made of. The owner emailed me back and asked if I&#x27;d like a sample. I was admittedly shocked because not many companies feel that confident in a product to send samples without charging me. Sufficed to say, I haven&#x27;t broken out and I love the smell. It might have actually improved my skins texture. I usually hate fragranced products, except Byredo soaps, but this is pleasant and deeply earthy scent, which I love because I&#x27;m a guy. I still have the sample and now I&#x27;m waiting for the actual product to arrive. this product is great for anybody, like myself, who likes luxury organic products.</li>
            <li> I fell in LOVE with this soap when I first used it at Osteria Mozza.  The fragrance is captivating.  Even my 14 year old son likes it!  The fact that we are supporting a local family is the best part.  Looking forward to trying the lotion and keeping our home stocked with Further products.  Kudos!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift on two different occasions. One recipient liked it so much that she began buying it on her own and continues to use it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I could ask for is room spray with the same scent.  This is an environmentally conservative seller, so I&#x27;m betting I don&#x27;t get my wish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The free shipping was greatly appreciated.</li>
            <li> I found this soap in a restaurant called Bandera here in Sacramento CA. The smell is beautiful. That was one of the things that caught my attention when I went into the Men&#x27;s restroom and washed my hands when I used their hand soap, the smell was so aromatic it captured my senses. I recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> Not the super smell that was posted on the reviews..I liked that it is very bubbly but since I bought it for its fragrance the price is not worth it.</li>
            <li> smells awesome and feels good to support this sustainable company.</li>
            <li> Love this. Its time for me to reorder. I did not like the price so good.</li>
            <li> Amazing soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an avid hand washer, this soap thoroughly cleans my hands.</li>
            <li> Lovely smell and bottle and label and good value.</li>
            <li> leaves you clean and feeling fresh.  A bit more pricey than most hand soaps but I love it !  A nice luxury.</li>
            <li> awesome company. makes a great and responsible gift.</li>
            <li> All natural great smelling product</li>
            <li> This is a rare find - the packaging is simple and chic (looks great next to the sink), the soap feels silky and has a light fresh scent, and the company that makes Further is made up of genuinely nice people with a cool mission. I use this soap all around my house plus often give it as a gift. I strongly recommend Further.</li>
            <li> The hand soap and the hand moisturizer are excellent!  They are not only smell great, but they work well as well!  Unforgettable smell!  My husband and I went to Fairmont Hotel for our wedding anniversaries and everytime I use these at home, it always reminds us of our great time there!</li>
            <li> I first use this hand soap in S.F.Ca. I love the smell and feel of the product.  I purchase 3 bottles.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It&#x27;s so earthy and light at the same time. It has one of the best scents of any hand soap I&#x27;ve ever used, leaving your hands feeling soft and clean, not perfumed.</li>
