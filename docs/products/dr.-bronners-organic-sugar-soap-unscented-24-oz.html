    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s so wonderful.</li>
            <li>This soap does not irritate my skin, and it is perfect that it is organic.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and earthy, like vanilla dirt...</li>
            <li>The bottle and pump are very good quality.</li>
            <li>Great product.. Cleans every well when  giving our  baby  a bath.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember why I hadn&#x27;t found the castile soap at the time and why I went with this stuff, but both are good.</li>
            <li>so we will see how good the soap is to his skin when the time comes.</li>
            <li>but I guess works as good as any dr bronner soap.</li>
            <li>This is good and health.</li>
            <li>This is good no doubt it</li>
            <li>If you want to feel squeaky clean, this is the best soap I&#x27;ve found for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ans rinses easily, is an effective cleanser, and leaves the skin feeling good.    </li>
            <li>even gave the cat a quick rinse with some of this dissolved in the warm water, and she looks good too!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: This soap may not be great for everybody, but I really enjoy using it</li>

            <li>This soap is amazing.</li>
            <li>Not sure if that was the best description, but it is great stuff!!!</li>
            <li>The value is very good; you do not have to use a lot of product to work up a decent lather.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product to switch to if you&#x27;re interested in moving away from bars of soap to something liquid in a bottle.  </li>
            <li>This is a good mild, soap that does the trick.</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what was going on.</li>
            <li>This soap has a lightly sugary scent that reminds me of my favorite kind of sponge cake, I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Also I love that it&#x27;s a clean-rinsing soap</li>
            <li>Also the smell of it is like eating a sponge cake without any of the calories :)  </li>

            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>And yes I mainly use this for my face, but its great in the shower and as hand soap too.</li>
            <li>After washing my hair, body, and face, I could feel my body is squeaky clean!</li>
            <li>get dandruff easily</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very runny for a liquid soap, but it feels good in hand and lathers up great with only a half-pump.</li>
            <li>I think the castile soap is better priced though, and both are available in unscented baby mild.</li>
            <li>I am a huge Dr Bronners fan and have used their castile soap on my body and hair for years.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s very worth trying.  </li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s very worth trying.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best purely botanical soap that I&#x27;ve tried so far, but it&#x27;s definitely among the most effective at cleansing, and the smell is my favorite so far, tied with the orange blossom soap from Trader Joe&#x27;s.ue on my hands).  </li>

            <li>The scent was unique.</li>
            <li>you rinse it off, your hands feel squeaky-deeky clean.</li>
            <li>But if you are looking for something that will leave your skin squeaky clean with no residue, then this is the product for you.  </li>
            <li>It foams up and you can feel that the skin is clean.</li>
            <li>The smaller bottle size has a more appropriately sized pump, while this one is more economical in terms of the product itself.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant and mild smell reminiscent of molasses cookies that doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because they actually use good ingredients.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t it enough to have your values represented in the ingredients and fair trade affiliation?</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the smell is a bit sweet.</li>
            <li>Good enough to eat.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mildly sweet but also a bit like mud.</li>
            <li>gentle, healthy shampoo.  </li>
            <li>thank you dr bronners for making safe, high quality products!  </li>
            <li>To be honest, the soaps from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s main line clean equally well and the Shikakai does not seem to be more moisturizing for my skin, but I do love the way this soap smells, while most of the soaps in the main line smell very \\&quot;soapy.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and many allergies.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use this if you expect to be able to use it on super sensitive baby skin.</li>
            <li>However, the color (liquid-y brown) is off-putting, and I wish it had some kind of essential oil fragrance.</li>
            <li>(Not to mention I would be using it on a fresh tattoo..)</li>
            <li>I add my own choice of essential oil to this shampoo to customize it to my tastes.</li>
            <li>It is unscented in the sense that there are no additional ingredients, natural or otherwise, added for the purpose of adding a particular smell, but it does have its own distinctive smell.  </li>
            <li>The reason I give this product 4 stars instead of 5 is that the pump dispenses too large an amount of soap and makes it easy to use more than necessary.  </li>
            <li>I used it a few more times to make sure that this was the cause.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a great purchase for my little girls and their super sensitive skin, both girls scream and cry every time I have used this on them.  </li>
            <li>My baby likes very much.</li>
            <li>I used it with some coconut oil and hot water to make flannel wipes, and also use in the bath for her hair and body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The texture is much the same as the rest of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products, which is to say, fairly runny, not the typical viscous, milky texture of most liquid soaps or bodywash.  </li>
            <li>Great for giving love gifts in empty prescription containers mixed with essential oils</li>
            <li>The scent is not very strong, and there are no artificial ingredients, so I would imagine it&#x27;s still suitable for hypoallergenic</li>
            <li>Pretty much all the \\&quot;drugstore brands\\</li>
            <li>But for someone like me who has only facial skin, I love that it gets me so clean.</li>
            <li>I use this as my hand soap, and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really rather not have to think about this.</li>
            <li>Dr Bronners really knows how to make their soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin always feels moisturized and it froths really well in my hands.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a very thorough soap, which does carry with it the caveat that it will strip a lot of oils from your skin.  </li>
            <li>REVIEW FOR UNSCENTED (apparently reviews for the scented ones are mixed into these): I know this soap is better for your health and the environment, and I like the dispensing bottle it comes in.</li>
            <li>So, I was very nervous about irritation because I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin in the first place</li>
            <li>The larger dispenser seems more intended for use in the shower/bath, as the amount dispensed by one full pump is more suitable for washing an entire limb, and not just your hands; but if you only press it half way you can pump out less at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>was considering a different scent but got this to try for baby... and blue is my favorite color.</li>
            <li>it on my new tattoo</li>
            <li>Had the soap worked for me, I would have been fine with the scent and the dark brown color.</li>
            <li>My kidlet has been having some sensitivities to various products, and we have gotten through our first bottle of this product that was a gift.</li>
            <li>It leave my body and face&#x27;s skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I imagine it&#x27;s just the natural shikakai scent.</li>
            <li>I like how it doesn&#x27;t have artificial foaming chemicals (SLS) but gives a really luxurious and satisfying foam, very quickly and with little effort.  </li>
            <li>, they feel like they barely break up any of the grime and leave a foul-smelling residue on my hands).  </li>

            <li> , they feel like they barely break up any of the grime and leave a foul-smelling residue on my hands).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super concentrated like other Dr. Bronners varieties, but it works very well as a soap and above all else: It doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li> Basically I was in whole foods and asked them to show me &amp;#34;a body wash with the least # of ingredients, the simplest one you sell&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it: Most soap stinks.</li>
            <li> Im a long time fan of Dr. Bronners castile soap.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> but my hair was so dry and tangled after using this that I didn&#x27;t use it on my hair</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this soap for people with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I brought this last month, and its already half of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner actually spent time in mental institutions!  </li>
            <li> Due to the thicker part I have to refill the dispenser before it&#x27;s empty.  </li>
            <li> Im due any day now with my baby</li>
            <li> Almost all other soaps labeled for &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Im giving it 3 stars because it was COVERED in hard yellow soap residue when I received it.</li>
            <li> Although this soap is &#x27;unscented&#x27; there is a slight smell to the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to know how much money they are they flushing down the toilet because of their nut job rants on the label.</li>
            <li> The liquid may look brown and disgusting, but the scent is amazing.</li>
            <li> However, it does what a soap should do; it cleans the skin well and leaves no residue or an overly dried out texture to the skin.  </li>
            <li> (I get rashes from grass...), and my prior experiences have been poor.</li>
            <li> &quot; like Dial and Oil of Olay put way too much artificial scents into their products and the smell is ridiculously over-powering; even though I&#x27;m skeptical about the whole \\&quot;organic\\&quot; movement and think a lot of products that label themselves as organic are doing it as a marketing ploy, I have to say that I&#x27;m very glad for the body care products that don&#x27;t use artificial scents, because they are the only ones that don&#x27;t make me feel ill when I smell them.  </li>
            <li> Unscented liquid soaps are hard to find.</li>
            <li> Apparently, I&#x27;m allergic to this. :(</li>
            <li> but I have very thick, curly, out of control hair</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember why I hadn&#x27;t found the castile soap at the time and why I went with this stuff, but both are good. I think the castile soap is better priced though, and both are available in unscented baby mild.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because they actually use good ingredients. What a nut job this guy was personally! I don&#x27;t appreciate all the religious rants, which make no sense, on this product. Isn&#x27;t it enough to have your values represented in the ingredients and fair trade affiliation? I&#x27;m returning the product because I don&#x27;t want to support whack jobs like this and his family, who continue to keep the label as a memorial to Dr. Bronner. The only thing it&#x27;s a memorial to, is/are how crazy he and his family are/was. They would all do well to enroll in a business ethics 101 course. I&#x27;d hate to know how much money they are they flushing down the toilet because of their nut job rants on the label. Dr. Bronner actually spent time in mental institutions!  What a shame, I actually wanted to buy this product.  [...]</li>
            <li> Although this soap is &#x27;unscented&#x27; there is a slight smell to the product.  However, it does what a soap should do; it cleans the skin well and leaves no residue or an overly dried out texture to the skin.  The value is very good; you do not have to use a lot of product to work up a decent lather.  I use this as my hand soap, and it works very well.  This is a great product to switch to if you&#x27;re interested in moving away from bars of soap to something liquid in a bottle.  The bottle and pump are very good quality.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  It has a pleasant and mild smell reminiscent of molasses cookies that doesn&#x27;t stick to the skin.  I am not a cosmetics-type person but I know that this soap lathers ans rinses easily, is an effective cleanser, and leaves the skin feeling good.    The reason I give this product 4 stars instead of 5 is that the pump dispenses too large an amount of soap and makes it easy to use more than necessary.  The smaller bottle size has a more appropriately sized pump, while this one is more economical in terms of the product itself.</li>
            <li> Im due any day now with my baby so we will see how good the soap is to his skin when the time comes. Im a long time fan of Dr. Bronners castile soap. I thought this was neat that they make a pump foaming style soap. Im giving it 3 stars because it was COVERED in hard yellow soap residue when I received it.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great purchase for my little girls and their super sensitive skin, both girls scream and cry every time I have used this on them.  Telling me it burns their bottoms.  Don&#x27;t use this if you expect to be able to use it on super sensitive baby skin.</li>
            <li> I brought this last month, and its already half of the bottle. I use it as shampoo, body wash, and face wash. It&#x27;s so wonderful. The liquid may look brown and disgusting, but the scent is amazing. After washing my hair, body, and face, I could feel my body is squeaky clean! It leave my body and face&#x27;s skin so soft. As for my hair, it got rid of buildup, and keep the &amp;#34;future buildup&amp;#34; away. As for my fiance, it help him to get rid of dandruff in his hair! We love it. I will definitely continue buying this product!</li>
            <li> If you want to feel squeaky clean, this is the best soap I&#x27;ve found for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that the soap separates into a thinner and thicker portions.  Shoiuld i be mixing them together?  Due to the thicker part I have to refill the dispenser before it&#x27;s empty.  I&#x27;d really rather not have to think about this.</li>
            <li> I am a huge Dr Bronners fan and have used their castile soap on my body and hair for years. I saw this shikakai stuff and thought Id give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the smell is a bit sweet. Smells almost like molasses and honey sorta. I cannot put my finger on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very runny for a liquid soap, but it feels good in hand and lathers up great with only a half-pump. I am always amazed at how well it foams, because its organic and uses no synthetic foaming agents. Dr Bronners really knows how to make their soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you rinse it off, your hands feel squeaky-deeky clean. Some people might not like this, and may consider the soap too stripping. But for someone like me who has only facial skin, I love that it gets me so clean. And yes I mainly use this for my face, but its great in the shower and as hand soap too.</li>
            <li> This is the only body wash I use!! All the ingredients are legit things (not 20 letter chemicals!) My skin always feels moisturized and it froths really well in my hands. The bottle lasts a long time too. Def recommend this for anyone looking for a simple body wash. Basically I was in whole foods and asked them to show me &amp;#34;a body wash with the least # of ingredients, the simplest one you sell&amp;#34;. They stopped selling it so now I get it on amazon. My boyfriend likes to use it as a shampoo sometimes too.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do it. It&#x27;s a trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was considering a different scent but got this to try for baby... and blue is my favorite color. Off smell but I guess works as good as any dr bronner soap. Just not anything close to what I wanna smell. It&#x27;s put away for when I run out of everything else</li>
            <li> I use it daily in shower and I also mix it with essential oils when needed for healing.  Good enough to eat.  Great for giving love gifts in empty prescription containers mixed with essential oils</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I have to be very careful about the products I use. This soap does not irritate my skin, and it is perfect that it is organic.</li>
            <li> Great product.. Cleans every well when  giving our  baby  a bath. Leaves no residue. After a bathing,  we occasionally apply unscented lotion to keep the baby skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and many allergies. I was searching on Amazon for some soap without perfumes or dyes and came across this. I was looking forward to trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get dandruff easily but I have very thick, curly, out of control hair and I read that this might work for it. I had yet to find a product that could manage both. It did not make my dandruff worse but my hair was so dry and tangled after using this that I didn&#x27;t use it on my hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use it as hand soap only. I started getting awful rashes and eczema all over the palms and backs of my hands. I&#x27;d never had eczema on my hands that bad before. I wasn&#x27;t sure what was going on. I used it a few more times to make sure that this was the cause. Apparently, I&#x27;m allergic to this. :( So I had to throw the rest away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a scent. I imagine it&#x27;s just the natural shikakai scent. It&#x27;s mildly sweet but also a bit like mud. The scent was unique. I wouldn&#x27;t say that I seek out to have things in this scent, but it wasn&#x27;t unpleasant either. Had the soap worked for me, I would have been fine with the scent and the dark brown color.</li>
            <li> Pretty much all the \\&quot;drugstore brands\\&quot; like Dial and Oil of Olay put way too much artificial scents into their products and the smell is ridiculously over-powering; even though I&#x27;m skeptical about the whole \\&quot;organic\\&quot; movement and think a lot of products that label themselves as organic are doing it as a marketing ploy, I have to say that I&#x27;m very glad for the body care products that don&#x27;t use artificial scents, because they are the only ones that don&#x27;t make me feel ill when I smell them.  This soap has a lightly sugary scent that reminds me of my favorite kind of sponge cake, I absolutely love it.  It is unscented in the sense that there are no additional ingredients, natural or otherwise, added for the purpose of adding a particular smell, but it does have its own distinctive smell.  The scent is not very strong, and there are no artificial ingredients, so I would imagine it&#x27;s still suitable for hypoallergenic purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very thorough soap, which does carry with it the caveat that it will strip a lot of oils from your skin.  I would not recommend this soap for people with dry skin.  But if you are looking for something that will leave your skin squeaky clean with no residue, then this is the product for you.  To be honest, the soaps from Dr. Bronner&#x27;s main line clean equally well and the Shikakai does not seem to be more moisturizing for my skin, but I do love the way this soap smells, while most of the soaps in the main line smell very \\&quot;soapy.\\&quot;  The texture is much the same as the rest of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products, which is to say, fairly runny, not the typical viscous, milky texture of most liquid soaps or bodywash.  I like how it doesn&#x27;t have artificial foaming chemicals (SLS) but gives a really luxurious and satisfying foam, very quickly and with little effort.  Also I love that it&#x27;s a clean-rinsing soap (I can&#x27;t stand to use stuff like Dial and Softsoap anymore, they feel like they barely break up any of the grime and leave a foul-smelling residue on my hands).  The larger dispenser seems more intended for use in the shower/bath, as the amount dispensed by one full pump is more suitable for washing an entire limb, and not just your hands; but if you only press it half way you can pump out less at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This soap may not be great for everybody, but I really enjoy using it and I think it&#x27;s very worth trying.  Also the smell of it is like eating a sponge cake without any of the calories :)  I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best purely botanical soap that I&#x27;ve tried so far, but it&#x27;s definitely among the most effective at cleansing, and the smell is my favorite so far, tied with the orange blossom soap from Trader Joe&#x27;s.ue on my hands).

            <li> REVIEW FOR UNSCENTED (apparently reviews for the scented ones are mixed into these): I know this soap is better for your health and the environment, and I like the dispensing bottle it comes in. However, the color (liquid-y brown) is off-putting, and I wish it had some kind of essential oil fragrance. I don&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;, even after washing my hands the requisite time amount to rinse off bacteria.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I use(d) it on my new tattoo and it has never irritated my skin. Almost all other soaps labeled for &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; that I have tried have been very disappointing. So, I was very nervous about irritation because I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin in the first place (I get rashes from grass...), and my prior experiences have been poor. (Not to mention I would be using it on a fresh tattoo..) But there was no irritation whatsoever. It foams up and you can feel that the skin is clean. I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> This is good and health. My baby likes very much. No problem to eyes. This is good no doubt it</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it: Most soap stinks. To simply wash your hands, you have to endure unwanted, cloying odors. And if you happen to be sensitive to artificial scents and chemicals, they can be more than bothersome; they can trigger bodily reactions. Unscented liquid soaps are hard to find. Dr. Bronner makes another one, but that one clogs soap dispensers. The Shikakai Organic Baby Unscented Boady Soap does not. It&#x27;s not super concentrated like other Dr. Bronners varieties, but it works very well as a soap and above all else: It doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing. I use it for my hair, face. Body, kids, and baby. It smells wonderful and earthy, like vanilla dirt... Not sure if that was the best description, but it is great stuff!!!</li>
            <li> We have used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps for 30 years, but my husband can&#x27;t use the scented ones on his face because of rosacea.  This is a good mild, soap that does the trick.</li>
            <li> My kidlet has been having some sensitivities to various products, and we have gotten through our first bottle of this product that was a gift. I used it with some coconut oil and hot water to make flannel wipes, and also use in the bath for her hair and body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not apply this product to her face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even gave the cat a quick rinse with some of this dissolved in the warm water, and she looks good too!</li>
            <li> gentle, healthy shampoo.  thank you dr bronners for making safe, high quality products!  I add my own choice of essential oil to this shampoo to customize it to my tastes.</li>
