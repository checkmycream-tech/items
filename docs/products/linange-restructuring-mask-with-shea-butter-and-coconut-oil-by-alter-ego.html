            <li> A little bit goes a long ways with a heating cap my hair shines and is sooooo soft!</li>
            <li> but should entertain a less expensive means to send will purchase again unless able to beat cost</li>
            <li> I had better results with a less expensive conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely dry, chemically relaxed and color treated.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Mizani Relaxers, but after reviews on a forum I frequent I decided to give the mask, along with the relaxer and neutralizer a try.  </li>
            <li> My hair actually seemed a little on the dry side after using this system.</li>
            <li> When I saw I still had waves with the neutralizing conditioner on, I was a little disappointed, but, after I put this restructuring mask on, and left it on a little longer than 5 minutes, my roots were exactly how I wanted them to be.</li>
            <li> Needless to say i&#x27;ll be going back to Mizani.</li>
            <li> I usually place a plastic cap on and go under the dryer for 15 min.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and tightly coiled hair and I perm.</li>

            <li> This Mask will leave your hair feeling very strong.I would recommend anyone using this mask to follow it up with a moisturizing conditioner.This is suppose to be used during the hair relaxing process.You use it after the neutralizing conditioner is washed out.It does what it says.</li>
            <li> excellent product but should entertain a less expensive means to send will purchase again unless able to beat cost</li>
            <li> love it :: the product came on time and it work very well.</li>
            <li> I usually use Mizani Relaxers, but after reviews on a forum I frequent I decided to give the mask, along with the relaxer and neutralizer a try.  The conditioner itself did not \\&quot;wow\\&quot; me. It felt really good going on, but after rinsing my hair just felt like, regular. My hair actually seemed a little on the dry side after using this system. The mask works well for my thicker haired family members, but nothing really special or out of the ordinary. Needless to say i&#x27;ll be going back to Mizani.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have ever used. Linange is a product made by Alter Ego and since I started using this product my hair has became completely healthy and has had rapid growth. I have severe dandruff so I shampoo with Head and Shoulders put this product on my hair sit under the drier for fifteen minutes with a shower cap and done. Also it is very mild and natural other products burn and make my scalp itch but not this one. I strongly recommed it. By the way I wash my hair twice a week</li>
            <li> Loved this stuff. When I saw I still had waves with the neutralizing conditioner on, I was a little disappointed, but, after I put this restructuring mask on, and left it on a little longer than 5 minutes, my roots were exactly how I wanted them to be. Love this line.</li>
            <li> My hair can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff. I shampoo my hair with the new Garnier in the yellow bottle which is great for women with dry hair then I use this hair mask. When I&#x27;m finished my hair is detangled and silky smooth which I love. After roller setting and sitting under the dryer my hair is bouncy and shiny and I love it.</li>
            <li> I first experienced this at my hair dressers love this product always keeps me wanting more...I use it every time I shampoo... :-)</li>
            <li> This is the second time I buy this. Pruduct is excellent, it really helped me and softened my hair. I strongly recomend it.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and shiny! I love this stuff! I wish I would have known about this earlier.</li>
            <li> Product received in a timely manner and it has excellent conditioning properties for my fine tightly curly hair...it has loosened them up nicely.  Thanks and I will definitely order from you again!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my hair silky smooth after the Linange Texturizer. Instead it felt rather course. I had better results with a less expensive conditioner.</li>
            <li> i tried lots  of hair treatments and most of yhem dried my hair  out but this product leaves my hair feeling silky and gives a great sheen, since using this treatment my hair is so mhch healthier</li>
            <li> I have tried many deep conditioners and this one is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. For best results, let it sit in your hair for about 20-40 minutes after washing with shampoo, and then rinse. This conditioner leaves your hair feeling very soft along with a sweet, light coconut fragrance. Works especially well for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I am an African American girl, who has struggled to have my hair grow in length and to have body. My hair is avg in thickness.  When my hair dresser used this conditioner in my hair, i fell in loved  w it.However this is not a conditioner, that you rinse out right away.  I usually place a plastic cap on and go under the dryer for 15 min. Then rinse my hair out and roller set.My hair as a result has built strength and is feeling thicker. Even after having my hair straighten, my hair maintains some volume.</li>
            <li> Hello all! I bought this mask about one month ago and since then can stop recommending it to all my friends. It is a great product! My hair never been better! I am definitely buying more!!!</li>
            <li> It works very well.  And I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed a change in the first week of using it and my hair feels stronger and less breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This relaxes my hair exactly how I want it to........NOT BONE STRAIGHT! If you&#x27;re looking for a bone straight look, this is not for you. Overall I think this is a great product that will maintain the texture and strength of your hair although it&#x27;s a relaxer.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by co worker. Once I got it I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. It smells great!!! It made my hair very soft. I use it as a deep conditioner. I have very thick and tightly coiled hair and I perm. Compared to other conditioners my hair would stay soft for 4 days tops! I can vouch that this conditioner will make your hair very soft and easy to manage. I also use this with the Alter Ego shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely dry, chemically relaxed and color treated.  This product is great at adding back moisture (helping to minimize breakage) and leaving my hair feeling smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Its well worth the money if you want to nourish your hair and have it smell good</li>
