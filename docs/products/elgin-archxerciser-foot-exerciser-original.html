            <li>Great, great tool.</li>
            <li>great product used this also at the therapist office</li>
            <li>Great product, good for ballet.&lt;br /&gt;You can work your foot muscles, ankles &amp; arch.really great for therapy on your muscles if needed.</li>
            <li>I knew there had to be a better and easier way to do the exercise and this device was perfect for that need.  </li>
            <li>A fairly good product</li>
            <li>Sturdy with good tension.</li>
            <li>Works good will help strengthen foot and ankle</li>
            <li>but I guess a good exercise for stretching</li>
            <li>This works great, but my foot tires easily when using it.</li>
            <li>You can make up your own exercises to get foot strength.</li>
            <li>Seems to be effective in strengthening arch and ankle muscles.  </li>
            <li>It was just what I wanted &amp; was delivered on time in great condition - Thanks I love it!!</li>
            <li>Seems to be a good product and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The lift seems to make it more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it and use it all of the time.</li>
            <li>There are occasions when I skip days but to date, my plantar fasciitis has not been better.</li>
            <li>Could use more floor traction.</li>
            <li>One could use a towel to do this motion and strengthen, but this device seems much better because there is better tension on it.  </li>
            <li>Save your money for better shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s better cause</li>
            <li>You can do exercises that work as well or better than this device.  </li>
            <li>This looked like a better idea than it turned out to be in practice.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than using a towel and scrunching it under my toes, like I was doing before.  </li>
            <li>Marble pickup works better</li>
            <li>The spring isn&#x27;t as resistive as I&#x27;d like, so I will often do many (MANY) repetitions in the hopes that it&#x27;s helping.  </li>
            <li>I had my ankle adjusted by the chiropractor many times, soaking my foot in epsom salts, etc., and it just was not feeling much better.  </li>
            <li>GReat and highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>Avoid this device if you are looking for any meaningful strengthening and conditioning of your foot muscles.</li>
            <li>I use it both morning and night and it has been the single greatest source of relief for my foot pain that I have found.  </li>
            <li>, this makes it easy to remember and convenient to use.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s easy to do exercises with it while working at your computer -</li>
            <li>This really works, cheap and good for you toning the foot/heel that hurts.  </li>
            <li>Fairly easy to use when sitting around.  </li>
            <li>It will strengthen your arch and is so easy to do....</li>
            <li>Much easier, yet probably more effective, than scrunching a towel.  </li>
            <li>This product has truly helped me, and I can get through my intense workouts much better!</li>
            <li>It is a huge bargain, and I suggest it to everyone I know who has foot or arch pain.</li>
            <li>It makes sense: strengthen the relevant muscles; but the &amp;#34;use a towel&amp;#34; thing just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>primary muscles</li>
            <li>/&gt;The muscles of the arch that you primarily want to focus on are the intrinsic muscles (the ones in the foot itself).  </li>
            <li>but you have to do many many repetitions of the exercise to really get desired benefits.</li>
            <li>The towel scrunchy is harder, and so more effective.</li>
            <li>:) Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>After the first day I used this I felt a difference!</li>
            <li>Great little gadget for exercising your feet.  </li>
            <li>This incredible little device really does help.</li>
            <li>Over-all it was worth the investment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if nothing else is helping.</li>
            <li>The concept is nice but it should last longer than 4 months.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t give up your elastic bands, but this is useful</li>
            <li>Also rec by PT but is only partially effective.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that my arches are also strong wearing high heals since using this.  </li>
            <li>My Physical Therapist used it on me and it gave me so much relief that I just had to have my own.</li>
            <li>Sure, a person can probably achieve the same results by using a towel and scrunching it up with your toes, and then re-positioning the towel, etc.</li>
            <li>She is a dancer and it really helps her feet get stronger!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is intended to.  </li>
            <li>This item isn&#x27;t bad, but I would have liked it better if it had some kind of tension control; an option to increase the resistance.</li>
            <li>You can add some weight on top of the towel to increase the resistance if necessary.</li>
            <li>But this is way more convenient, and therefore, you will actually do your foot</li>
            <li>It is best used for short periods of time several times a day on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I only had to use it a month or two and have not had any more problems.</li>
            <li>and gosh it is really debilitating!  </li>
            <li>better exercise for strengthening the arch is to stand so that those three points of your foot are in solid contact with the ground and then try to bring the points closer together and hold it for about 15-20 seconds, then relax.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I start using it again, the aching totally will be gone.  </li>
            <li>As others have said, don&#x27;t expect miracles overnight, but with plantar fasciitis you have to take a broad approach to healing yourself and the archexerciser is certainly a very useful tool in this process.</li>
            <li>This product is really amazing, and has helped me much with my foot soreness, and tiredness due to fallen arches.</li>
            <li>This easy to use device stays put on my living room and office floor which are carpeted and those are the only two places that I use the device.</li>
            <li>I found this to be of limited use, mostly for the novelty effect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no dancer but this thing is great for working my weak arches.  </li>
            <li>I followed the advice in a previous review to put the toes of my other foot under my heel when I used it for a more effective stretch.  </li>
            <li>This device really works the foot muscles.</li>
            <li>but this tool makes the process of strengthening your arch so much easier.  </li>
            <li>And towels and marbles are like free weights to this things third rate sold on TV ab machine.</li>
            <li>For plantar fasciitis, strengthening the foot muscles would seem to be a reasonable therapy.</li>
            <li>This really helped me.</li>
            <li>It really helped to strengthen my arch.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>I can sit and watch TV and work with it without much thought.</li>
            <li>Once I get back into running I will definitely continue to use this to make sure and keep my feet as healthy as possible.  </li>
            <li>and i think it really helps.</li>
            <li>It does not seem to offer much resistance when using the device.  </li>
            <li>A good way to tell if the level of effort you are giving appropriate is if the near segment of your big toe is pressed flat to the ground but the far segment has not started to curl under or make the knuckle of the big toe rise.  </li>
            <li>After researching the internet and asking many other sufferers questions, I found the ELGIN Archxerciser.  </li>
            <li>use it for high arch problems and my daughter uses it for ballet strengthening.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone recovering from Plantar Fascia pain.</li>
            <li>The advantage over towel crunches is a little more range of motion is allowed in the toe flexion direction.  </li>
            <li>My 11 year old didn&#x27;t feel much tension in the springs on this particular product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 11 year old daughter because she wants to strengthen her feet for ballet.</li>
            <li>I find the archexerciser so useful that I am buying a second one to keep under my desk at work.  </li>
            <li>She saw it in a documentary and pretty much had to have it.</li>
            <li>Much too hard for most people to use.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks of using it faithfully I am completely pain free!  </li>
            <li>It is a pretty basic movement that like others have stated, could be achieved through using a towel.</li>
            <li>This product does offer the benefit of added resistance, which is simply achieved by moving your foot further back so there is more tension on the spring.</li>
            <li>If you have super weak fit</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, most people have adequate big toe flexion, it is big toe extension that is lacking and necessary for walking and other activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems to do the job as my arch is certainly sore the next day.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a month and a half, a month of that time being out of PT, and I have noticed a significant difference and no longer have any plantar fascia pain at all.  </li>
            <li>I used the Archxerciser for a couple of days in a row, and the stiffness and pain were gone, the aching subsided considerably.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it would be nice to adjust the tension.</li>
            <li>The exercises may seem like a good idea in theory, but in practice they are nearly irrelevant to treating plantar fasciitis.     </li>
            <li>I think slow releves en pointe are far more beneficial, but I figure it can&#x27;t hurt to have this gadget around.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes that this product would deliver something so unique as I was looking to rehab my foot from an injury, but for plantar its not much better than the traditional towel scrunching a PT would have you do and for ankles its much less comfortable than a normal stretch resistance band.</li>
            <li>On my first few tries with this device, I was easily able to do 10-20 repetitions multiple times at the maximum tension allowed by the device.</li>
            <li>It is to light to stay in place if you do not put a lot of weight on it which, if you intend to use it sitting down while watching TV for instance, you won&#x27;t necessarily do.</li>
            <li>but that is a hassle and the price is not too high, so having a second one makes life easier.  </li>
            <li>(The far segment of your big toe is controlled by extrinsic muscles while the near segment is controlled by intrinsic muscles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(The far segment of your big toe is controlled by extrinsic muscles while the near segment is controlled by intrinsic muscles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helps me after a long day of being on concrete floors.</li>
            <li>To put it a simply, the spring which produces the tension for this device is too weak to achieve any meaningful strengthening of the foot muscles.</li>
            <li>My feet were very sore due to standing on them all day.  </li>
            <li>If you want do exercise your toe flexors for other reasons, a much cheaper solution is simply scrunching a towel on the floor.  </li>
            <li>and this is the only significant change of late.</li>
            <li>the towel trick only works on a bare floor.</li>
            <li>Even if the resistance were high enough, the movement only activates the toe flexors (which are actually located under the large muscles of the calves) and not the small stabilizing muscles in the arch of the foot itself.</li>
            <li>this machine exercises are your extrinsic big toe flexor muscles (the ones in the calf), which actually do not contribute that much to arch support and would have little impact on plantar fasciitis.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> A good way to tell if the level of effort you are giving appropriate is if the near segment of your big toe is pressed flat to the ground but the far segment has not started to curl under or make the knuckle of the big toe rise.  </li>
            <li> After researching the internet and asking many other sufferers questions, I found the ELGIN Archxerciser.  </li>
            <li> use it for high arch problems and my daughter uses it for ballet strengthening.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone recovering from Plantar Fascia pain.</li>
            <li> The advantage over towel crunches is a little more range of motion is allowed in the toe flexion direction.  </li>
            <li> My 11 year old didn&#x27;t feel much tension in the springs on this particular product.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11 year old daughter because she wants to strengthen her feet for ballet.</li>
            <li> I find the archexerciser so useful that I am buying a second one to keep under my desk at work.  </li>
            <li> She saw it in a documentary and pretty much had to have it.</li>
            <li> Much too hard for most people to use.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using it faithfully I am completely pain free!  </li>
            <li> It is a pretty basic movement that like others have stated, could be achieved through using a towel.</li>
            <li> This product does offer the benefit of added resistance, which is simply achieved by moving your foot further back so there is more tension on the spring.</li>
            <li> If you have super weak fit</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, most people have adequate big toe flexion, it is big toe extension that is lacking and necessary for walking and other activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to do the job as my arch is certainly sore the next day.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month and a half, a month of that time being out of PT, and I have noticed a significant difference and no longer have any plantar fascia pain at all.  </li>
            <li> I used the Archxerciser for a couple of days in a row, and the stiffness and pain were gone, the aching subsided considerably.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it would be nice to adjust the tension.</li>
            <li> The exercises may seem like a good idea in theory, but in practice they are nearly irrelevant to treating plantar fasciitis.     </li>
            <li> I think slow releves en pointe are far more beneficial, but I figure it can&#x27;t hurt to have this gadget around.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes that this product would deliver something so unique as I was looking to rehab my foot from an injury, but for plantar its not much better than the traditional towel scrunching a PT would have you do and for ankles its much less comfortable than a normal stretch resistance band.</li>
            <li> On my first few tries with this device, I was easily able to do 10-20 repetitions multiple times at the maximum tension allowed by the device.</li>
            <li> It is to light to stay in place if you do not put a lot of weight on it which, if you intend to use it sitting down while watching TV for instance, you won&#x27;t necessarily do.</li>
            <li> but that is a hassle and the price is not too high, so having a second one makes life easier.  </li>
            <li> (The far segment of your big toe is controlled by extrinsic muscles while the near segment is controlled by intrinsic muscles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (The far segment of your big toe is controlled by extrinsic muscles while the near segment is controlled by intrinsic muscles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps me after a long day of being on concrete floors.</li>
            <li> To put it a simply, the spring which produces the tension for this device is too weak to achieve any meaningful strengthening of the foot muscles.</li>
            <li> My feet were very sore due to standing on them all day.  </li>
            <li> If you want do exercise your toe flexors for other reasons, a much cheaper solution is simply scrunching a towel on the floor.  </li>
            <li> and this is the only significant change of late.</li>
            <li> the towel trick only works on a bare floor.</li>
            <li> Even if the resistance were high enough, the movement only activates the toe flexors (which are actually located under the large muscles of the calves) and not the small stabilizing muscles in the arch of the foot itself.</li>
            <li> this machine exercises are your extrinsic big toe flexor muscles (the ones in the calf), which actually do not contribute that much to arch support and would have little impact on plantar fasciitis.  </li>
            <li> You can get more resistance and leverage if you placw your other foot behind the one that is &amp;#34;working&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I bought an Archexerciser a few months ago when I developed a case of plantar fasciitis.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take long to do.</li>
            <li> I feel I get a stronger pull when I place the big toe of the other foot under the heel of the exercising foot.</li>
            <li> I could not live without my orthotics from the podiatrist, but I still get some soreness and tiredness when on my feet alot.</li>
            <li> So when I try to pull the toe bar down, basically all I accomplish is scooting the entire mechanism backward.</li>
            <li> As some of the other reviews have pointed out, there are other ways to achieve the same effect - like picking up coins or pulling a towel toward you with your toes -</li>
            <li> Perhaps the spring is not wound tight enough?</li>
            <li> Exercising your extrinsic big toe flexor muscles will do little for heel spurs (bony protrusions in the heel) as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this so I could strengthen my feet for ballet practice, but I just don&#x27;t feel that the spring is to loose to get any effects from it!</li>
            <li> It only takes a few minutes</li>
            <li> I was cautious and followed the directions carefully.</li>
            <li> This product is money well spent.</li>
            <li> There is no way to adjust the tension and my foot keeps slipping.</li>
            <li> It also helps to loosen up the big toe that is healing and is stiff.</li>
            <li> but it is like any other excersize routine.</li>
            <li> I continue to use the arch exerciser because like any other muscle you do have to continue the therapy or the problem</li>
            <li> These muscles are better strengthened by doing &#x27;foot doming&#x27; exercises: [...]    </li>
            <li> Now I need to find something other than theraband to strengthen my ankles.</li>
            <li> But after five days of using this device, my p.f. pain was far worse than it had been previously.  </li>
            <li> My physiotherapist understood immediately the value of this product and immediatelyl took down the information about it.</li>
            <li> the spring is extremely weak and provides only minimal resistance, so doing 10-20 (or</li>
            <li> I got this device and a few other items</li>
            <li> This is not a quick fix, but I have seen a slight improvement in the relief of my PF.</li>
            <li> My PT also diagnosed me with a slight case of Plantar Fasciitis.  </li>
            <li> My phsyical therapist said it was way too tight.</li>
            <li> This helps to stretch out the tight muscles and relieve soreness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In order to strengthen these muscles, it is helpful to know a little anatomy.  </li>
            <li> Please read my review under the Thera-Band foot roller, it goes hand in hand with this neat little devise.</li>
            <li> I try to use it everyday along with massaging the arch afterwards with a lacrosse ball.</li>
            <li> I am recovering from a broken big toe and soreness and tightness in my feet from walking \\&quot;funny\\&quot; during the healing.</li>
            <li> It will be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I had to scoot my foot way down to grab the small bar with my toes.  </li>
            <li> and I have completed a few marathons in the past few years.  </li>
            <li> Tried various streching shoes and boots but they all were uncomfortable and did little to help.</li>
            <li> I have this Elgin Archxerciser and do 3 sets of 10 twice a day for the past 2 months.  </li>
            <li> The problem was not that I went overboard using the device.  </li>
            <li> strain too hard in raising your arch.  </li>
            <li> If you strain to hard, you will begin to recruit the extrinsic muscles of your foot in addition to the intrinsic muscles.  </li>

            <li> So is picking up marbles with your toes, which I do daily and haven&#x27;t gotten sick of yet.</li>
            <li> And to make matters worse, there is no adjustment on the device for the amount of tension.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use these two products to break down the scar tissue that prevents your feet from regaining flexibility they will become stiff and  very painful to walk on.</li>
            <li> one at the heel, one at the base of the big toe and one at the base of the little toe.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This incredible little device really does help. My Physical Therapist used it on me and it gave me so much relief that I just had to have my own.</li>
            <li> A simple practical product that is efficient for strengthening the arch. Sure, a person can probably achieve the same results by using a towel and scrunching it up with your toes, and then re-positioning the towel, etc. The Archxerciser, though, makes doing this exercise a lot simpler and efficient. My physiotherapist understood immediately the value of this product and immediatelyl took down the information about it.</li>
            <li> Much too hard for most people to use.  My phsyical therapist said it was way too tight.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this! She is a dancer and it really helps her feet get stronger! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> The same exercise could be achieved by scrunching a towel with your toes, but I like the gadget. It is well designed and sturdy. I feel I get a stronger pull when I place the big toe of the other foot under the heel of the exercising foot. The lift seems to make it more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one thing will cure plantar fasciitis--I use it along with orthotics, daily stretches and a night splint. This is not a quick fix, but I have seen a slight improvement in the relief of my PF. Best of luck to you.</li>
            <li> My feet were very sore due to standing on them all day.  I used this and they improved.  I stopped using and they got sore.  I use this and they improved.  Now I use when they get sore, i probably should use it all the time but it is like any other excersize routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from Planar Fascitis for 15 years now. This foot exerciser is the best exercise or stretch for my feet. I love it and use it all of the time.</li>
            <li> I have this Elgin Archxerciser and do 3 sets of 10 twice a day for the past 2 months.  There are occasions when I skip days but to date, my plantar fasciitis has not been better.</li>
            <li> Works well. Could use more floor traction.</li>
            <li> This device really works the foot muscles. After using it, my foot muscles are sore as they are after a weight lifting workout. Definitely great for strengthening the foot muscles.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from Plantar Fasciitis for years.  I also suffered from horrible cramps in the arches of my feet while exercising (I actually had to quit going to spin class because of it).  I took a chance and bought this arch exerciser.  After a few weeks of using it faithfully I am completely pain free!  I no longer suffer from the cramps in my arches and have returned to spin class!  I continue to use the arch exerciser because like any other muscle you do have to continue the therapy or the problem will return.  I only use it a couple times per week now or when I feel my arches stiffen.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is intended to.  Strengthens your ankles and it is very simple to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no dancer but this thing is great for working my weak arches.  I should have bought 2 so I caould do both feet at once to save time.</li>
            <li> I got this to strengthen my arch. It seems to do the job as my arch is certainly sore the next day. It is a pretty basic movement that like others have stated, could be achieved through using a towel. But I like that I can just set it under my desk and use it while I am at the computer and don&#x27;t want to continuously replace the towel and scrunch it with my toes over and over again. This product does offer the benefit of added resistance, which is simply achieved by moving your foot further back so there is more tension on the spring. Over-all it was worth the investment. I try to use it everyday along with massaging the arch afterwards with a lacrosse ball.</li>
            <li> This device didn&#x27;t do anything to help my plantar fasciitis but use of it does strengthen my feet. Sometimes after a session I can feel some soreness in my feet the next day which says to me that it&#x27;s working. Yes it performs that same exercise that scrunching a towel does but the towel trick only works on a bare floor. This easy to use device stays put on my living room and office floor which are carpeted and those are the only two places that I use the device. I&#x27;m thinking about buying another one so that I don&#x27;t have to transport it back and forth between home and work.</li>
            <li> This item isn&#x27;t bad, but I would have liked it better if it had some kind of tension control; an option to increase the resistance.</li>
            <li> I bought an Archexerciser a few months ago when I developed a case of plantar fasciitis. I used it daily for several weeks, diligently following the included instructions, but found it to be no help whatsoever in treating my PF symptoms.  The exercises may seem like a good idea in theory, but in practice they are nearly irrelevant to treating plantar fasciitis.     The flaws with the device are twofold: 1.) the spring is extremely weak and provides only minimal resistance, so doing 10-20 (or even 100) contractions with the toes feels like no exercise at all. 2.) Even if the resistance were high enough, the movement only activates the toe flexors (which are actually located under the large muscles of the calves) and not the small stabilizing muscles in the arch of the foot itself. These muscles are better strengthened by doing &#x27;foot doming&#x27; exercises: [...]    If you want do exercise your toe flexors for other reasons, a much cheaper solution is simply scrunching a towel on the floor.  You can add some weight on top of the towel to increase the resistance if necessary.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter. She is a ballerina. She loves it! We saw it in a dance movie and found it at Amazon.</li>
            <li> You can make up your own exercises to get foot strength. Just google for ideas. But this is way more convenient, and therefore, you will actually do your foot exercises!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for high arch problems and my daughter uses it for ballet strengthening. We just keep it on the floor in the family room and whenever we sit in there or walk through, we just do a set of 10 reps on each foot. We both do feel a difference with arch strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key is to do your exercises, this makes it easy to remember and convenient to use.</li>
            <li> Using for plantar fasciitis. Seems to be a good product and is easy to use. I use it in the evening while watching t.v. Doesn&#x27;t take long to do. I would recommend this item. I think whoever thought of this is exerciser is a genius!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend doing it with a towel. I don&#x27;t think it gives the required stretch for the muscles /tendons in the sole.</li>
            <li> I was suffering with plantar fasciitis and a heel spur for about 6 months.  I had 2 cortisone shots, tried acupuncture, did the stretches, wore the boot...all with no luck.  After the first day I used this I felt a difference! I brought it to work with me and used it whenever I started to feel some pain.  I followed the advice in a previous review to put the toes of my other foot under my heel when I used it for a more effective stretch.  Now a month later, I would say I am at 80% recovery.  It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if nothing else is helping.</li>
            <li> As some of the other reviews have pointed out, there are other ways to achieve the same effect - like picking up coins or pulling a towel toward you with your toes - but this tool makes the process of strengthening your arch so much easier.  I find the archexerciser so useful that I am buying a second one to keep under my desk at work.  I had been taking my archexerciser back and forth so that I could use it both at home and at work - it&#x27;s easy to do exercises with it while working at your computer - but that is a hassle and the price is not too high, so having a second one makes life easier.  As others have said, don&#x27;t expect miracles overnight, but with plantar fasciitis you have to take a broad approach to healing yourself and the archexerciser is certainly a very useful tool in this process.</li>
            <li> Sits under my desk at work and home and put an end to my fasciitis. Tried various streching shoes and boots but they all were uncomfortable and did little to help. My only complaint is that it would be nice to adjust the tension.</li>
            <li> I bought this so I could strengthen my feet for ballet practice, but I just don&#x27;t feel that the spring is to loose to get any effects from it!</li>
            <li> This product is great for exercising the arch in your foot.  I was introduced to it in therapy for my foot and like the stretching and release feeling of the Elgin.</li>
            <li> This works great, but my foot tires easily when using it. It is best used for short periods of time several times a day on a daily basis. Now I need to find something other than theraband to strengthen my ankles.</li>
            <li> This product is really amazing, and has helped me much with my foot soreness, and tiredness due to fallen arches. I could not live without my orthotics from the podiatrist, but I still get some soreness and tiredness when on my feet alot. This product has truly helped me, and I can get through my intense workouts much better!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11 year old daughter because she wants to strengthen her feet for ballet. She saw it in a documentary and pretty much had to have it. I personally wasnt expecting it to be as big as is but its great quality and she uses it every day. She has had it since Christmas and there is already improvement in her foot strength when on pointe. I would def recommend this product for the aspiring dedicated dancer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this strengthening device for my father.  He suffers from planter fasciitis.  He was amazed at the difference it made.  He says he can now get up in the morning and walk without pain in his arch.  He would recommend this product to anyone with the same problem.</li>
            <li> I like running and I have completed a few marathons in the past few years.  Recently I have had pain in the ball of my feet.  I got this device and a few other items and I do believe the pain is vanished after about 2 months of use (for now anyway).</li>
            <li> Great little gadget for exercising your feet.  Much easier, yet probably more effective, than scrunching a towel.  As well as pulling with your toes, you can also do a sideways push that strengthens your arch.</li>
            <li> My doctor suggested I buy this and do ~300 every day on each foot.  It only takes a few minutes and I can do it while online or watching TV.  It seems to be helping a lot.</li>
            <li> Cautiously optimistic!  Seems to be strengthening my arches.  I&#x27;m trying to keep plantar faciaitis from recurring.  I have noticed that my arches are also strong wearing high heals since using this.  One could use a towel to do this motion and strengthen, but this device seems much better because there is better tension on it.  I wish there was a way to adjust the tension to make it more difficult over time.</li>
            <li> Bogus. I found this to be of limited use, mostly for the novelty effect. The towel scrunchy is harder, and so more effective. So is picking up marbles with your toes, which I do daily and haven&#x27;t gotten sick of yet. This gizmo only makes the foot work in one way, with no variation or adaptation. If you have super weak fit I guess it may do something, but plantar fasciitis is an injury, not just weakness. And towels and marbles are like free weights to this things third rate sold on TV ab machine. Save your money for better shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I do toe raises while doing dishes. Same work, but against body weight. And it&#x27;s better cause your feet and ankles have to deal with balance and propreoception.</li>
            <li> You can do exercises that work as well or better than this device.  Googgle arch strengthening exercises.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a ballet dancer. She uses this daily to help develop her arch. We just purchased this in March and it already broke. I had to purchase another one. The concept is nice but it should last longer than 4 months.</li>
            <li> The PF battle seems to be going my way... and this is the only significant change of late. It makes sense: strengthen the relevant muscles; but the &amp;#34;use a towel&amp;#34; thing just didn&#x27;t work for me. This seems to work. I do about 50 reps every morning.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that this product would deliver something so unique as I was looking to rehab my foot from an injury, but for plantar its not much better than the traditional towel scrunching a PT would have you do and for ankles its much less comfortable than a normal stretch resistance band. I&#x27;d stick with those if you are looking to strengthen your foot.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it works quite well.  However, my foot is very small and I had to scoot my foot way down to grab the small bar with my toes.  Would it be possible to make one for smaller feet?  Otherwise I&#x27;m using it and I can feel the difference already.</li>
            <li> This really works, cheap and good for you toning the foot/heel that hurts.  I use it a lot and do recommend it.</li>
            <li> Daughter uses this for ballet. Works well.</li>
            <li> As a dancer, this product is really great as I can exercise my feet (alternating) even though I am in front of the computer just like what I am doing now. :) Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It would probably work the way it claims for smaller feet.  Does not work well for my size 13 foot.</li>
            <li> For plantar fasciitis, strengthening the foot muscles would seem to be a reasonable therapy. But after five days of using this device, my p.f. pain was far worse than it had been previously.  The problem was not that I went overboard using the device.  I was cautious and followed the directions carefully. And, yes, the pain did decrease to its pre-device level within a week of my stopping.</li>
            <li> This really helped me. I only had to use it a month or two and have not had any more problems.</li>
            <li> HELP ME HEAL MY PLANTERS</li>
            <li> I had Plantar Fascia and gosh it is really debilitating!  I wanted to see if I could create a therapy regime for myself to alleviate the pain.  After researching the internet and asking many other sufferers questions, I found the ELGIN Archxerciser.  It really helped to strengthen my arch.  Now I keep it under my desk, and use it whilst working on the computer.  It helps me after a long day of being on concrete floors.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my doctor as a supplement to Physical Therapy for a tendon injury.  Seems to be effective in strengthening arch and ankle muscles.  Fairly easy to use when sitting around.  eg. Watching TV.  The ankle pivot exercise is somewhat difficult to do.  Don&#x27;t give up your elastic bands, but this is useful</li>
            <li> I have a recurring injury in my ankle and this has helped immensely.</li>
            <li> After using this just two or three times, I felt relief from the pain of plantar fasciitis. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Like others have said, this machine is basically a big toe only version of towel crunches (an exercise in which you put your foot on a towel and curl your toes repeatedly, which pleats the towel).  The advantage over towel crunches is a little more range of motion is allowed in the toe flexion direction.  Unfortunately, most people have adequate big toe flexion, it is big toe extension that is lacking and necessary for walking and other activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary muscles this machine exercises are your extrinsic big toe flexor muscles (the ones in the calf), which actually do not contribute that much to arch support and would have little impact on plantar fasciitis.  Exercising your extrinsic big toe flexor muscles will do little for heel spurs (bony protrusions in the heel) as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The muscles of the arch that you primarily want to focus on are the intrinsic muscles (the ones in the foot itself).  These include the lumbricals and the interossei.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to strengthen these muscles, it is helpful to know a little anatomy.  The arch of the foot can be thought of as having three points: one at the heel, one at the base of the big toe and one at the base of the little toe.  When these three points spread out, your arch collapses.  When they are brought together, your arch rises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A better exercise for strengthening the arch is to stand so that those three points of your foot are in solid contact with the ground and then try to bring the points closer together and hold it for about 15-20 seconds, then relax.  Repeat until your arches feel fatigued.  Visualizing can help a lot here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t strain too hard in raising your arch.  If you strain to hard, you will begin to recruit the extrinsic muscles of your foot in addition to the intrinsic muscles.  A good way to tell if the level of effort you are giving appropriate is if the near segment of your big toe is pressed flat to the ground but the far segment has not started to curl under or make the knuckle of the big toe rise.  (The far segment of your big toe is controlled by extrinsic muscles while the near segment is controlled by intrinsic muscles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that was understandable and that it helps some of you.to curl under or make the knuckle of the big toe rise.  (The far segment of your big toe is controlled by extrinsic muscles while the near segment is controlled by intrinsic muscles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that was understandable and that it helps some of you.</li>
            <li> This helps with my daughter for pointe! Great buy!</li>
            <li> This product really works. I am recovering from a broken big toe and soreness and tightness in my feet from walking \\&quot;funny\\&quot; during the healing. This helps to stretch out the tight muscles and relieve soreness. It also helps to loosen up the big toe that is healing and is stiff.</li>
            <li> This looked like a better idea than it turned out to be in practice. It is to light to stay in place if you do not put a lot of weight on it which, if you intend to use it sitting down while watching TV for instance, you won&#x27;t necessarily do. So when I try to pull the toe bar down, basically all I accomplish is scooting the entire mechanism backward. It&#x27;s awkward.</li>
            <li> A fairly good product but you have to do many many repetitions of the exercise to really get desired benefits. It is simpler to take a squeegee ball or a towel and grip it with your toes to obtain similar benefits.&lt;br /&gt;A bit too expensive for the function!!</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted something to help her arch.  She used this for two days and could she the difference.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This product at home helps me keep going with the exercises I have to do for my feet.  It&#x27;s much better than using a towel and scrunching it under my toes, like I was doing before.  Sturdy with good tension.</li>
            <li> same as I&#x27;m using when i was doing therapy.it helps.</li>
            <li> Also rec by PT but is only partially effective.  Marble pickup works better</li>
            <li> I bought this item in the hopes that it would help strenghten my feet for pointe work in ballet.  The spring isn&#x27;t as resistive as I&#x27;d like, so I will often do many (MANY) repetitions in the hopes that it&#x27;s helping.  I think slow releves en pointe are far more beneficial, but I figure it can&#x27;t hurt to have this gadget around.  I can sit and watch TV and work with it without much thought.</li>
            <li> Please read my review under the Thera-Band foot roller, it goes hand in hand with this neat little devise. You&#x27;ll want to buy both products.  After surgery, scar tissue builds up as you heal. If you don&#x27;t use these two products to break down the scar tissue that prevents your feet from regaining flexibility they will become stiff and  very painful to walk on. Your podiatrist will tell you, you need custom orthodics that cost hundreds of dollars and come from Gemany, when in reality they are made locally and cost under $75! This product is money well spent.</li>
            <li> For almost a year I had pain, aching and tenseness/stiffness in my righ foot and ankle, and nothing helped it.  I had my ankle adjusted by the chiropractor many times, soaking my foot in epsom salts, etc., and it just was not feeling much better.  I used the Archxerciser for a couple of days in a row, and the stiffness and pain were gone, the aching subsided considerably.  I&#x27;m sure if I start using it again, the aching totally will be gone.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> GReat and highly recommended!  It will strengthen your arch and is so easy to do....you can do it while your watching tv!</li>
            <li> I was in PT for 3 months with multiple tendon injuries from running.  My PT also diagnosed me with a slight case of Plantar Fasciitis.  Nearing the end of my treatment, he had me start doing exercises involving scrunching a towel with my toes to strengthen the tendon along the bottom of my foot.  I knew there had to be a better and easier way to do the exercise and this device was perfect for that need.  I have been using it for about a month and a half, a month of that time being out of PT, and I have noticed a significant difference and no longer have any plantar fascia pain at all.  Once I get back into running I will definitely continue to use this to make sure and keep my feet as healthy as possible.  I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone recovering from Plantar Fascia pain. Great, great tool.</li>
            <li> I have one foot with tendon damage that has resulted in chronic and extremely painful plantar fasciitis.  This tool replaces the &amp;#34;towel scrunch&amp;#34; and has been a miracle!  I use it both morning and night and it has been the single greatest source of relief for my foot pain that I have found.  It is a huge bargain, and I suggest it to everyone I know who has foot or arch pain.</li>
            <li> great product used this also at the therapist office</li>
            <li> It was terrible...didn&#x27;t work at all. Don&#x27;t buy this; what a didappointment.</li>
            <li> Works good will help strengthen foot and ankle</li>
            <li> Item works as advertised and beautifully excersizes arch muscles and plantar flexors.</li>
            <li> Great product, good for ballet.&lt;br /&gt;You can work your foot muscles, ankles &amp; arch.really great for therapy on your muscles if needed.</li>
            <li> There is no way to adjust the tension and my foot keeps slipping. This would probuably work for as man or woman with larger feet.</li>
            <li> Just like the one I used at the PT.</li>
            <li> I use this in physical therapy. It helps me a lot.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like using it..but I guess a good exercise for stretching</li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted &amp; was delivered on time in great condition - Thanks I love it!!</li>
            <li> I have and have had Plantar Fasciitis for several years. I recently decided to something about it. I bought this product in the hopes it could help. It didn&#x27;t, it can&#x27;t, and it never will. To put it a simply, the spring which produces the tension for this device is too weak to achieve any meaningful strengthening of the foot muscles. On my first few tries with this device, I was easily able to do 10-20 repetitions multiple times at the maximum tension allowed by the device.And to make matters worse, there is no adjustment on the device for the amount of tension. Avoid this device if you are looking for any meaningful strengthening and conditioning of your foot muscles. It will be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> i use it daily, and i see the results. i used this device, for improving my arch and foot strength. it also improved my jumping ability..</li>
            <li> I got this as part of my physical therapy rehab for plantar fasciatis and i think it really helps. You can get more resistance and leverage if you placw your other foot behind the one that is &amp;#34;working&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It does not seem to offer much resistance when using the device.  Perhaps the spring is not wound tight enough?</li>
            <li> My 11 year old didn&#x27;t feel much tension in the springs on this particular product.  I didn&#x27;t either when I tried it.</li>
