    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great for oily parts of the face!</li>
            <li> I like the natural ingredients of this product and how it leaves my face feeling clean and fresh with the natural tingling of peppermint.  However.. this product is gentle but not effective to cover my toner needs. I didn&#x27;t notice any changes controlling oil production, unclogging pores or minimizing them so I will stick to my sulfur toner.   (Keep it in the fridge for a cooler sensation! It also works great mixed with clay or benzonite powder for a clarifying mask)</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products to help minimize pores and this one is truly amazing! I love that it is all natural and NOT tested on animals. It takes a lot of commitment and a strong passion to make cosmetics animal free. I have recommended it to everyone I know. The change is visible is 2 days, at least for me. My make up stayed looking fresh all day, some days no touch ups are needed. Used another product while waiting for my Andalou and noticed a negative difference. This gives real results, not promises. Love it! Which it was available in stores not just on line as I often forget until the lastinure to order. The order arrived right on time. Perfect.</li>
            <li> I like this for cleaning my pores.  It cleans but is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Not a bad toner at all. It will sting a bit. At least it does on me and my skin isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive so those who are might want to consider something less astringent. I&#x27;ve never been prone to break outs but I do have the old oily t-zone. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed much shrinkage in the pores but it does keep that area oil free at least for the morning and pulls up the last of the day&#x27;s make up residue at night.</li>
            <li> has  a nice smell,  but don&#x27;t feel or see any effects from it.  will use it till its gone though...if my opinion changes I will write another review</li>
            <li> I like the smell and it is very refreshing</li>
            <li> I I just purchased this and am already in love.  Like another reviewer stated, it has peppermint so you will have a subtle minty scent until it dries.  I spray it on.  If for any reason the product does not live up to my expectations I will update this review, but for right now I love it (like all Andalou products!)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for well over a month and have not noticed a difference.  Will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I actually minimized my pores BUT my face is softer and now where near a oily as it used to be. I use it twice a day everyday and will order more once it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Andalou Naturals Aloe + Willowbark Pore Minimizer is soothing (no alcohol &#x3D; no stinging) and doesn&#x27;t make my skin look greasy/shiny (no glycerin). It&#x27;s good for my oily, acne-prone skin.     Ingredients:  Aloe barbadensis juice* hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel)*, panthenol (Pro-vitamin B5), tocopherol (vitamin E) lauric acid, fruit stem cells (malus domestica, solar vitis)  and bioactive 8 berry complex*, epilobium angustifolium (willow herb) extract, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate (vitamin C), salix alba (willow bark) and spiraea ulmaria (meadowsweet) extracts*, salicylic acid, aspalathus linearis (rooibos), hibiscus rosa-sinensis, and camellia sinesis (white tea) extracts*, phenethyl alcohol, ethylhexylglycerin, cinnamomum camphora (camphor) oil, mentha piperita (peppermint) and thymus vulgaris (thyme) oils*    * Organic   Fair Trade</li>
            <li> it is very helpful.  It makes my skin smoother and softer. It is a very good toner to remove dull or dead skin.</li>
            <li> The product works better than expected.  Andalou feels so good on my skin.Would definitely buy again.  Great Product.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, which gets dry in the winter and oily in the hot summer. This toner cleared my skin and prevented further breakouts. It also makes makes my skin soft and smooth and isn&#x27;t over-drying either. Very refreshing, love the tingling after I put it on.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product I cannot do without it! My hair is manageable and shiny!</li>
            <li> I enjoy everything about this product. The fragrance is clean and fresh. It does shrink my pores, and I look forward to using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Andalou Clarifying line for about a month now and I am very pleased with it.  I am 51 and have fair skin with an oily T-zone.  My skin has become very sensitive so finding products that work well has been difficult.  This line leaves my skin very smooth and my pores less visible.  I still have some oiliness after a long day but now like before using the clarifying line.  My pores are not congested and my skin actually seems a little tighter.  The fragrance is clean smelling.  I am very pleased and will continue to use the products in the future.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this product line and I just love this line! My lines have decreased immensely.</li>
