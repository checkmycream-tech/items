            <li>I love Aveeno, and this product lives up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it more for my chapped hands and switched to something else for the baby.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite lotion for years.</li>
            <li>i enjoyed this product worked as advertised</li>
            <li>I am still giving it 4 stars because it works great for my older son.</li>
            <li>I love, love all aveeno products, specially the lavander lotion.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and refreshing, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best baby lotion you can buy</li>
            <li>We tried many lotions and this is the only one she liked.</li>
            <li>My son has super dry skin and this lotion works great for him.</li>
            <li>I use this lotion on my sweet baby boy.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and really moisturizes so well.</li>
            <li>Our daughter is hypersensitive to touch and we use this to calm her while we give her a baby massage</li>
            <li>Although &amp;#34;I&amp;#34; like the fragrance, it does not help calm or soothe my Baby.</li>
            <li>I assumed since my older child was fine</li>
            <li>I use it to massage my babies right before bes time ..</li>
            <li>This product smells great, comforts my little one and leaves him with incredibly soft smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I love Aveeno lotion for my baby because he has mild excema, and Aveeno is the only thing that clears it up.</li>
            <li>Wonderful for my 97 yr old mother&#x27;s delicate skin and my skin as well.  </li>
            <li>Lotion left baby&#x27;s skin sticky and the scent was more like baby powder and not lavender.  </li>
            <li>Very deceiving labeling, read the ingredient lust before buying!</li>
            <li>Just make sure to test it on a small area of skin first to make sure that your child isn&#x27;t allergic.</li>
            <li>i love this lotion-it really helps in dry MN winter.</li>
            <li>The smell calms her and makes our job so much easier.</li>
            <li>i use it with the bath soap and my daughter (16 mo) really likes it.</li>
            <li>It helps with his eczema and dry skin and the scent helps him fall asleep and makes him smell great when mommy kisses his little face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first scented product I&#x27;ve put on my 6-month old twins</li>
            <li>I use a natural lotion with real lavender in it now and it works wonders!</li>
            <li>Switched my baby over from Johnson&#x27;s to Aveeno due to his sensitive, dry skin and the results were remarkable.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My 6 week old has subhoreic dermatitis on his face so we started using this cream on his whole body.</li>
            <li>The next day redness disappeared and by the 3rd day her skin became smooth again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I feel comforted that it&#x27;s made with natural products</li>
            <li>We use it on our 9 month old and 2 yr old.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t live in US and only on May I will be there.</li>

            <li> The lotion smells so great on my babies right as they get out of the bath! It&#x27;s the first scented product I&#x27;ve put on my 6-month old twins and it didn&#x27;t irritate their skin at all</li>
            <li> I use this lotion on my sweet baby boy. It helps with his eczema and dry skin and the scent helps him fall asleep and makes him smell great when mommy kisses his little face. I feel comforted that it&#x27;s made with natural products</li>
            <li> Our daughter is hypersensitive to touch and we use this to calm her while we give her a baby massage so she can get used to the sensation of touch. We tried many lotions and this is the only one she liked. The smell calms her and makes our job so much easier.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from my sister who lives in the States.  At the my LO has chapped skin due to the change in weather.  People recommended me to use something as ridiculous as La Mer but I tried this Aveeno Baby Calming Comfort Lotion on her little face and Viola!  The next day redness disappeared and by the 3rd day her skin became smooth again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now purchase them in bulk whenever someone travels to the States.  This is by far the best baby lotion! and it smells so good my godson (who is 3), volunteers to put it on after shower because it smells so good!</li>
            <li> I love Aveeno lotion for my baby because he has mild excema, and Aveeno is the only thing that clears it up. This lavendar one is my favorite because it smells wonderful and does an excellent job at keeping his skin soft and moisturized. Hands down the best baby lotion you can buy I think.</li>

            <li> Not just for babies.  Wonderful for my 97 yr old mother&#x27;s delicate skin and my skin as well.  Does not feel oily.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite lotion for years. Love the smell and really moisturizes so well. No lotion compares all aveeno lotions are great at moisturizing. The scent to this one is amazing.</li>
            <li> One friend of mine received my order. I don&#x27;t live in US and only on May I will be there. So I can&#x27;t evaluate these stuffs.</li>
            <li> i love this lotion-it really helps in dry MN winter. i use it with the bath soap and my daughter (16 mo) really likes it.</li>
            <li> Very deceiving labeling, read the ingredient lust before buying! Does not contain Lavender or Vanilla. This item contains fragrance, which is  a chemical concoction to create the scent not actual ingredients. I called the company to confirm this and the scent is not natural.</li>
            <li> Although &amp;#34;I&amp;#34; like the fragrance, it does not help calm or soothe my Baby. Also after buying this I found it at the local market for Half the price!  I use a natural lotion with real lavender in it now and it works wonders!</li>
            <li> We have used this on my toddler for 2 years now. He has eczema and it works well. My 6 week old has subhoreic dermatitis on his face so we started using this cream on his whole body. He broke out in a horrible allergic rash. Poor guy was miserable. I am still giving it 4 stars because it works great for my older son. Just make sure to test it on a small area of skin first to make sure that your child isn&#x27;t allergic. I assumed since my older child was fine my baby would be too and we paid the price with a very fussy itchy baby for a few days.</li>
            <li> i enjoyed this product worked as advertised</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this lotion. My little one loves it too. Aveno is the best!</li>
