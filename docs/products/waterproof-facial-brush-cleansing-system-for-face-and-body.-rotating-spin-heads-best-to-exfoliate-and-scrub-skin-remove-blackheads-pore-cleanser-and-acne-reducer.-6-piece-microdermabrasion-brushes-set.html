            <li>It feels good</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it was good while it lasted, it lasted from March 22 to June 30th.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think having to replace an item after 3 months of use is good at all.</li>
            <li>The body brush is also good</li>
            <li>but I wanted to give this system a fair evaluation.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a diagram on the inside cover, which is a rare and wonderful thing.  </li>

            <li>Edit of review August 2015: I received a replacement product in July after contacting the vendor and I am happy to report that the replacement is still going strong.</li>
            <li>This product is just amazing.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to get a product that would work good and help me feel better about my skin again.</li>
            <li>its like having your own spa system at home.</li>
            <li>The bag that came with it is also a nice one to keep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter already claimed the body attachment for her own bc</li>
            <li>: I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review.</li>
            <li>My aunt has been dying to use one of these and was immediately thrilled when she opened it.</li>
            <li>and she is still loving it.</li>
            <li>Would have liked a faster speed on that brush.  </li>
            <li>The bag is a nice way to hold the device and the attachments to keep it all together.</li>
            <li>so that is nice.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited!!</li>

            <li>Sample provided for sincere review.</li>
            <li>I love the pumice attachment too.</li>
            <li>Cute travel bag</li>
            <li>The others had more than one speed, but were not waterproof and did not come with as many attachments.</li>
            <li>I love the sponge that came with this brush also.</li>
            <li>And a wonderful facial sponge which makes applying serums or moisturizers a</li>

            <li>Awsome... in love with this brush set.</li>
            <li>I use it as a face cleaning tool mostly.</li>
            <li>Okay item, I thought the item had more than one speed.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>The best part is you can use this for so many different things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love getting pedicures but can&#x27;t always afford them so in between</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a zippered carry pouch as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I chose this brand.</li>
            <li>and although the thing came apart it went back perfectly and never missed a beat.</li>
            <li>The best way to describe the difference in washing my face with this system would be for you to imagine using a manual toothbrush after using an electric one, somehow it just seems less effective.</li>
            <li>feels very clean after using this product.</li>
            <li>In all honesty, I was initially most excited about the chevron print cute bag it came</li>
            <li>As for the large body brush I loved it,great exfoliater.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable, and it does a really good job.  </li>
            <li>she loved it so much.</li>
            <li>Motor is strong and there are a lot of very fine bristles that truly clean and polish your skin.</li>
            <li>Unique to this brand, the brush set comes with a cute carrying case.</li>
            <li>I use it night and day and the travel case makes it easy to pack without having to worry about losing the brush heads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Changing brush is easy, you just pull it and push to replace with another one.  </li>
            <li>The batteries are easy to install.  </li>
            <li>The batteries are easy to install.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is easy to use, just battery powered so no cords, and a set of 4 brushes along with a nifty bag.</li>
            <li>and it opens easily.</li>
            <li>It is compact and easy to use though</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everything is really easy to use</li>
            <li>I really love this skin cleaning system, its very complete and hardworking, I have tried many a brush system and this one is awesome for this low price .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So this set, a remarkable set, has allowed me to exfoliate my skin with an efficiency that surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I already mentioned, the pumice is nice but the rotation isn&#x27;t quite enough for rougher areas, but good for light smoothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li>an amazing combination!)&lt;br /&gt;The vendor for this product sent me 2 or three pleasant, completely unexpected educational and informative emails on how to use the device.</li>
            <li>Decreases wrinkles and fine lines&lt;</li>
            <li>The sponge distributes the moisturizer and serum evenly and dries quickly because they aren&#x27;t sitting on top of the skin slowing sinking</li>
            <li>Comes with 1 waterproof and cordless rotating machine, 1 facial brush, 1 large body brush, 1 serum and moisturizer applicator sponge, 1 pumice stone, and BONUS 1 beautiful and stylish travel and storage bag.a face brush, The Cordless Sonic Rotating Cleanser Machine is sturdy for sure.</li>
            <li>The pouch it comes with is pretty big, perfect for carrying all your tools and special creams.</li>
            <li>using a creme cleanser with this makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>There is a huge difference between washing my face by hand and using this device.  </li>
            <li>Is is just fantastic.  </li>
            <li>received a free sample in order to make an informed review</li>
            <li>but my opinions are my own thanks for looking at the video review</li>
            <li>I have been trying out different serums and moisturizers and this sponge works great at applying them.</li>
            <li>cleansing system also includes a free cosmetics bag to keep everything together</li>
            <li>Works okay, but not as powerful as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>I bought this about two months ago and waited to review to see results which have been fantastic.</li>
            <li>You just pop the brush on and push it in to secure it.</li>
            <li>This is a great set in one for body and facial cleansing.</li>
            <li>Because it is waterproof I can leave it my shower - very convenient!!!</li>
            <li>The brush is super easy to use and comes with everything you need to take care of your face and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The item came quickly and completely intact, works great right out the box.  </li>
            <li>They are more than willing to answer any questions you may have.</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth your money!</li>
            <li>and I just wanted to get one to help clean my skin.</li>
            <li>This is so far the best facial skin cleaning system.</li>
            <li>Works great for acne prone skin, but I dont recommend it for not normal or combined.</li>
            <li>BUT this product, which I use in the shower, is quick and powerful enough to have have changed the look of my arms and legs to the point where I am feeling GREAT about their appearance.</li>
            <li>and this one is actually just as good, if not</li>
            <li>and I am loving it so far.</li>
            <li>nice bag is included for travel or storage, although I wouldn&#x27;t store it since I am busy using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sponge is a cool idea.  </li>
            <li>This cool looking pouch keeps it all</li>
            <li>Now I have my granddaughter using it as she seems to be starting with mild acne--start good habits now</li>
            <li>I have used so many in past, so far this is the best one ever.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make this even better is to have more settings than On/Off.</li>
            <li>She said it has Made a tremendous difference on her skin.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and great for my skin which is sensitive.</li>
            <li>def worth the money and makes your skin soft and super clean :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very nice brush and I love having the extra heads for different uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin very clean and highly recommend to all.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and it even makes my legs feel more relaxed.</li>
            <li>He said the head pieces are very soft against his face and he love the pumice head piece for his feet.</li>
            <li>I would HIGLY recommend this to my friends or anyone interested!</li>
            <li>This is great for removing dead skin cells on your feet, knees and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned after testing.&lt;br /&gt;Views and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>My face just feels fresh after using it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll actually DO something, and the directions recommend using it with warm water.  </li>
            <li>The point is to use it to work skin care products into freshly cleansed skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this set for its reasonable price, and its very well thought out choice of attachments.  </li>
            <li>I love this set for its reasonable price, and its very well thought out choice of attachments.  </li>
            <li>I love that the button isn&#x27;t supper sensitive like my Olay one bc</li>
            <li>Her face feels smooth, refreshed, young and super clean .</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth your money!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received complimentary/free products for the purpose of this review.</li>
            <li>Although I assure you that my skin feels significantly smoother and my skin tone is more even overall.</li>
            <li>I am trying it again because other reviews were good</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect to be this excited about this skin cleansing system.</li>
            <li>It came with a very cute real and white chevron storage pouch so you&#x27;ll never lose any of the attachments.</li>
            <li>My pores look really clean after washing with the brush, and feels very refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I would have to say that at least so far this product is working perfectly.</li>
            <li>Love this so much and my face feels amazingly clean especially in the morning after I wake up.</li>
            <li>The brushes are dense but very gentle on your skin.  </li>
            <li>and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>My skin feels ten times better than it did when I would just use my hands.</li>
            <li>The owners of the company have sent me two emails with tips on how to use the product and seem interested in what I have to say about the product.</li>
            <li>only challenging part is replacing the batteries.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am quite pleased with this brush and would recommend.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it only takes a few minutes to work through the whole tool kit--less time than it takes to use one of those towelettes.  </li>
            <li>It takes almost no time or energy, your face will love you for it, and you&#x27;ll feel like a better person, especially the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t included, which is something you should be aware of.  </li>
            <li>love you for it, and you&#x27;ll feel like a better person, especially the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t included, which is something you should be aware of.  </li>
            <li>I love all the attachments, but my favorites are the facial and foot one.</li>
            <li>received the Beaute La Royale Facial Cleansing System a couple of weeks ago and have enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>My Beaute La Royale Skin Cleansing System really works!</li>
            <li>This device really exfoliates your skin making it feel fresh.  </li>
            <li>My personal favorite is the pumice stone because after just the first use my feet all ready for sandals season.</li>
            <li>I had the &#x27;other&#x27; one for some time and liked it</li>
            <li>Since this is my first purchase of this type product I really have nothing to compare it too....</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the product I use it everyday</li>
            <li>Do not use a hair drier to make sure it is dry.  </li>
            <li>I do alternate Neutrogena face cleaner and a face cleaner that is to soften and reduce fine lines with this</li>
            <li>I also really like that it came with a large body brush.</li>
            <li>The pumice stone is a great bonus that is normally not included with other sets.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the brush on my skin for about four days and already it feels so much smoother and healthier.</li>
            <li>I‚Äôve been using the cleansing brush on my face for about 2 weeks now and it has really changed the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough not to feel like I&#x27;m spinning my face off, but strong enough to feel clean and I can practically feel the increased circulation to my face.</li>
            <li>you will break that habit fast.  </li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll be ready to go when your system arrives.  </li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll be ready to go when your system arrives.  </li>
            <li>The one speed is not that fast</li>
            <li>I really like this brush because it is waterproof</li>
            <li>It really did exfoliate my skin, it looks and feels fresher and cleaner than using an exfoliating wash.</li>
            <li>No way was I going to spend that much on another one</li>
            <li>It does make my face feel cleaner and much smoother after using it.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t seem to do much for them.  </li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>This is really the absolute coolest beauty tool.</li>
            <li>We have been through a number of these facial cleansers even branded ones but this one is the most complete.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth and has already begun to clear up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for elbows, feet and other rough areas of the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This spin brush not only had the face brush, it has a larger body brush, a pumice stone for elbows, knees, and heels, and a sponge for putting on your moisturizer, which really does a nice job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spin action is comparable to others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I looked at some of the sonic brushes before buying this one, but the price was high and people kept complaining about the batteries running down too fast, so I thought I would try this one, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Over the years I have been really slack in this area and most nights my face should feel blessed to just get a wipe down before bed!</li>
            <li>One thing I would say is that there is only one speed and it is kinda slow, but it still works great for what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>The main tool is powered by four AA batteries.</li>
            <li>The kit I&#x27;m currently using insists on using its very fine grained pumice stone dry, which does nothing except create dust.  </li>
            <li>All of the other brushes I have own have either suffered from a short out or the batteries exploded.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a large body brush-head, a petite size for the face, a sponge head and a pumice.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the sonic vibration of a Clairsonic, this has a rotary action.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice that I can use this to cleanse my skin with the small soft brush and then use the applicator brush to get the serum deep into my freshly cleansed skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first two times I used the system I only used it on one side of my face to see if it really made a difference.</li>
            <li>and I would have to waste more</li>
            <li>I mostly use the small brush attachment, but the other ones come in handy for different purposes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;‚Ä¢ Stimulates new skin regeneration</li>
            <li>I live in Florida</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t go to bed with gunk sitting on top of your skin, and you&#x27;re only five minutes away from going to bed with clean, treated skin rather than having to greet Wednesday morning with the remnants of Tuesday still on your face because you were too tired to do the whole</li>
            <li>I like that the attachments give you more use than other brands that only come with one head.  </li>
            <li>: I noticed that when I applied the foaming gel to the my face first and use the facial sponge with the brush kit, there is no foam on my face.</li>
            <li>so I will have to update in the next couple of weeks of exactly what the experience was UPDATE::</li>
            <li>This will hopefully me my first and only beauty brush system.</li>
            <li>The brush is very simple to use, the heads change easily, even in a wet slippery</li>
            <li>My face is very sensitive to a lot of products but have found this to be gentle enough to not irritate my skin yet</li>
            <li>I received the same benefit when trying the Large Body Brush on my legs.</li>
            <li>It comes with four brushes: 1 facial brush, 1 large body brush, 1 serum and moisturizer applicator sponge, 1 pumice stone.</li>
            <li>This was clearly my fault.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money on a face brush, so I decided to look on Amazon for a similar product.</li>
            <li>but you couldn&#x27;t even tell, my skin was so soft.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying another to give to my 14 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>The sponge is incredibly soft, but durable.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>really like that the pumice stone is a bit coarse, so</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel baby soft-</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth every penny spent on it.</li>
            <li>However, the right soap and a little scrubbing and you feel really like you&#x27;ve exfoliated and cleaned thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks, I don&#x27;t know how long the brushes will last, but they still look good as of now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It removes dead dull flakes to help skin look bright and encourage new cell growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>battery cover is a very tight fit.  </li>
            <li>battery cover is a very tight fit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pumice Stone: works like a normal pumice stone only faster</li>
            <li>You get the large body brush, a regular brush, facial sponge and even a pumice stone.  </li>
            <li>That type of action makes it possible to have this tool be pumice friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush was so soft but don&#x27;t let that fool you if you use it too long with that idea in mind</li>
            <li>The only major downfall I see with this product is the fact that it only has 1 speed.</li>
            <li>Not great with foaming cleanser but still a huge difference regardless.</li>

            <li> Good service</li>
            <li> It feels good</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it was good while it lasted, it lasted from March 22 to June 30th.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think having to replace an item after 3 months of use is good at all.</li>
            <li> The body brush is also good</li>
            <li> but I wanted to give this system a fair evaluation.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a diagram on the inside cover, which is a rare and wonderful thing.  </li>

            <li> Edit of review August 2015: I received a replacement product in July after contacting the vendor and I am happy to report that the replacement is still going strong.</li>
            <li> This product is just amazing.</li>

            <li> its like having your own spa system at home.</li>
            <li> The bag that came with it is also a nice one to keep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter already claimed the body attachment for her own bc</li>
            <li> : I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review.</li>
            <li> My aunt has been dying to use one of these and was immediately thrilled when she opened it.</li>
            <li> and she is still loving it.</li>
            <li> Would have liked a faster speed on that brush.  </li>
            <li> The bag is a nice way to hold the device and the attachments to keep it all together.</li>
            <li> so that is nice.  </li>

            <li> I love the pumice attachment too.</li>
            <li> Cute travel bag</li>
            <li> The others had more than one speed, but were not waterproof and did not come with as many attachments.</li>
            <li> I love the sponge that came with this brush also.</li>
            <li> And a wonderful facial sponge which makes applying serums or moisturizers a</li>

            <li> I use it as a face cleaning tool mostly.</li>
            <li> Okay item, I thought the item had more than one speed.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> The best part is you can use this for so many different things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love getting pedicures but can&#x27;t always afford them so in between</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with a zippered carry pouch as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I chose this brand.</li>
            <li> and although the thing came apart it went back perfectly and never missed a beat.</li>
            <li> The best way to describe the difference in washing my face with this system would be for you to imagine using a manual toothbrush after using an electric one, somehow it just seems less effective.</li>
            <li> feels very clean after using this product.</li>
            <li> In all honesty, I was initially most excited about the chevron print cute bag it came</li>
            <li> As for the large body brush I loved it,great exfoliater.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable, and it does a really good job.  </li>
            <li> she loved it so much.</li>
            <li> Motor is strong and there are a lot of very fine bristles that truly clean and polish your skin.</li>
            <li> Unique to this brand, the brush set comes with a cute carrying case.</li>
            <li> I use it night and day and the travel case makes it easy to pack without having to worry about losing the brush heads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Changing brush is easy, you just pull it and push to replace with another one.  </li>
            <li> The batteries are easy to install.  </li>
            <li> The batteries are easy to install.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is easy to use, just battery powered so no cords, and a set of 4 brushes along with a nifty bag.</li>
            <li> and it opens easily.</li>
            <li> It is compact and easy to use though</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everything is really easy to use</li>
            <li> I really love this skin cleaning system, its very complete and hardworking, I have tried many a brush system and this one is awesome for this low price .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So this set, a remarkable set, has allowed me to exfoliate my skin with an efficiency that surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I already mentioned, the pumice is nice but the rotation isn&#x27;t quite enough for rougher areas, but good for light smoothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> an amazing combination!)&lt;br /&gt;The vendor for this product sent me 2 or three pleasant, completely unexpected educational and informative emails on how to use the device.</li>
            <li> Decreases wrinkles and fine lines&lt;</li>
            <li> The sponge distributes the moisturizer and serum evenly and dries quickly because they aren&#x27;t sitting on top of the skin slowing sinking</li>
            <li> Comes with 1 waterproof and cordless rotating machine, 1 facial brush, 1 large body brush, 1 serum and moisturizer applicator sponge, 1 pumice stone, and BONUS 1 beautiful and stylish travel and storage bag.a face brush, The Cordless Sonic Rotating Cleanser Machine is sturdy for sure.</li>
            <li> The pouch it comes with is pretty big, perfect for carrying all your tools and special creams.</li>
            <li> using a creme cleanser with this makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> There is a huge difference between washing my face by hand and using this device.  </li>
            <li> Is is just fantastic.  </li>
            <li> received a free sample in order to make an informed review</li>
            <li> but my opinions are my own thanks for looking at the video review</li>
            <li> I have been trying out different serums and moisturizers and this sponge works great at applying them.</li>
            <li> cleansing system also includes a free cosmetics bag to keep everything together</li>
            <li> Works okay, but not as powerful as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> I bought this about two months ago and waited to review to see results which have been fantastic.</li>
            <li> You just pop the brush on and push it in to secure it.</li>
            <li> This is a great set in one for body and facial cleansing.</li>
            <li> Because it is waterproof I can leave it my shower - very convenient!!!</li>
            <li> The brush is super easy to use and comes with everything you need to take care of your face and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The item came quickly and completely intact, works great right out the box.  </li>
            <li> They are more than willing to answer any questions you may have.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth your money!</li>
            <li> and I just wanted to get one to help clean my skin.</li>
            <li> This is so far the best facial skin cleaning system.</li>
            <li> Works great for acne prone skin, but I dont recommend it for not normal or combined.</li>
            <li> BUT this product, which I use in the shower, is quick and powerful enough to have have changed the look of my arms and legs to the point where I am feeling GREAT about their appearance.</li>
            <li> and this one is actually just as good, if not</li>
            <li> and I am loving it so far.</li>
            <li> nice bag is included for travel or storage, although I wouldn&#x27;t store it since I am busy using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sponge is a cool idea.  </li>
            <li> This cool looking pouch keeps it all</li>
            <li> Now I have my granddaughter using it as she seems to be starting with mild acne--start good habits now</li>
            <li> I have used so many in past, so far this is the best one ever.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make this even better is to have more settings than On/Off.</li>
            <li> She said it has Made a tremendous difference on her skin.</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and great for my skin which is sensitive.</li>
            <li> def worth the money and makes your skin soft and super clean :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very nice brush and I love having the extra heads for different uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin very clean and highly recommend to all.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and it even makes my legs feel more relaxed.</li>
            <li> He said the head pieces are very soft against his face and he love the pumice head piece for his feet.</li>
            <li> I would HIGLY recommend this to my friends or anyone interested!</li>
            <li> This is great for removing dead skin cells on your feet, knees and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned after testing.&lt;br /&gt;Views and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> My face just feels fresh after using it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll actually DO something, and the directions recommend using it with warm water.  </li>
            <li> The point is to use it to work skin care products into freshly cleansed skin.  </li>
            <li> I love this set for its reasonable price, and its very well thought out choice of attachments.  </li>
            <li> I love this set for its reasonable price, and its very well thought out choice of attachments.  </li>
            <li> I love that the button isn&#x27;t supper sensitive like my Olay one bc</li>
            <li> Her face feels smooth, refreshed, young and super clean .</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth your money!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received complimentary/free products for the purpose of this review.</li>
            <li> Although I assure you that my skin feels significantly smoother and my skin tone is more even overall.</li>
            <li> I am trying it again because other reviews were good</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect to be this excited about this skin cleansing system.</li>
            <li> It came with a very cute real and white chevron storage pouch so you&#x27;ll never lose any of the attachments.</li>
            <li> My pores look really clean after washing with the brush, and feels very refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I would have to say that at least so far this product is working perfectly.</li>
            <li> Love this so much and my face feels amazingly clean especially in the morning after I wake up.</li>
            <li> The brushes are dense but very gentle on your skin.  </li>
            <li> and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> My skin feels ten times better than it did when I would just use my hands.</li>
            <li> The owners of the company have sent me two emails with tips on how to use the product and seem interested in what I have to say about the product.</li>
            <li> only challenging part is replacing the batteries.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am quite pleased with this brush and would recommend.</li>
            <li> The best part is that it only takes a few minutes to work through the whole tool kit--less time than it takes to use one of those towelettes.  </li>
            <li> It takes almost no time or energy, your face will love you for it, and you&#x27;ll feel like a better person, especially the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t included, which is something you should be aware of.  </li>
            <li> love you for it, and you&#x27;ll feel like a better person, especially the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t included, which is something you should be aware of.  </li>
            <li> I love all the attachments, but my favorites are the facial and foot one.</li>
            <li> received the Beaute La Royale Facial Cleansing System a couple of weeks ago and have enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> My Beaute La Royale Skin Cleansing System really works!</li>
            <li> This device really exfoliates your skin making it feel fresh.  </li>
            <li> My personal favorite is the pumice stone because after just the first use my feet all ready for sandals season.</li>
            <li> I had the &#x27;other&#x27; one for some time and liked it</li>
            <li> Since this is my first purchase of this type product I really have nothing to compare it too....</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product I use it everyday</li>
            <li> Do not use a hair drier to make sure it is dry.  </li>
            <li> I do alternate Neutrogena face cleaner and a face cleaner that is to soften and reduce fine lines with this</li>
            <li> I also really like that it came with a large body brush.</li>
            <li> The pumice stone is a great bonus that is normally not included with other sets.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the brush on my skin for about four days and already it feels so much smoother and healthier.</li>
            <li> I‚Äôve been using the cleansing brush on my face for about 2 weeks now and it has really changed the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough not to feel like I&#x27;m spinning my face off, but strong enough to feel clean and I can practically feel the increased circulation to my face.</li>
            <li> you will break that habit fast.  </li>
            <li> so you&#x27;ll be ready to go when your system arrives.  </li>
            <li> so you&#x27;ll be ready to go when your system arrives.  </li>
            <li> The one speed is not that fast</li>
            <li> I really like this brush because it is waterproof</li>
            <li> It really did exfoliate my skin, it looks and feels fresher and cleaner than using an exfoliating wash.</li>
            <li> No way was I going to spend that much on another one</li>
            <li> It does make my face feel cleaner and much smoother after using it.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t seem to do much for them.  </li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> This is really the absolute coolest beauty tool.</li>
            <li> We have been through a number of these facial cleansers even branded ones but this one is the most complete.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth and has already begun to clear up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for elbows, feet and other rough areas of the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This spin brush not only had the face brush, it has a larger body brush, a pumice stone for elbows, knees, and heels, and a sponge for putting on your moisturizer, which really does a nice job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spin action is comparable to others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I looked at some of the sonic brushes before buying this one, but the price was high and people kept complaining about the batteries running down too fast, so I thought I would try this one, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Over the years I have been really slack in this area and most nights my face should feel blessed to just get a wipe down before bed!</li>
            <li> One thing I would say is that there is only one speed and it is kinda slow, but it still works great for what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> The main tool is powered by four AA batteries.</li>
            <li> The kit I&#x27;m currently using insists on using its very fine grained pumice stone dry, which does nothing except create dust.  </li>
            <li> All of the other brushes I have own have either suffered from a short out or the batteries exploded.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a large body brush-head, a petite size for the face, a sponge head and a pumice.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the sonic vibration of a Clairsonic, this has a rotary action.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice that I can use this to cleanse my skin with the small soft brush and then use the applicator brush to get the serum deep into my freshly cleansed skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first two times I used the system I only used it on one side of my face to see if it really made a difference.</li>
            <li> and I would have to waste more</li>
            <li> I mostly use the small brush attachment, but the other ones come in handy for different purposes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;‚Ä¢ Stimulates new skin regeneration</li>
            <li> I live in Florida</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t go to bed with gunk sitting on top of your skin, and you&#x27;re only five minutes away from going to bed with clean, treated skin rather than having to greet Wednesday morning with the remnants of Tuesday still on your face because you were too tired to do the whole</li>
            <li> I like that the attachments give you more use than other brands that only come with one head.  </li>
            <li> : I noticed that when I applied the foaming gel to the my face first and use the facial sponge with the brush kit, there is no foam on my face.</li>
            <li> so I will have to update in the next couple of weeks of exactly what the experience was UPDATE::</li>
            <li> This will hopefully me my first and only beauty brush system.</li>
            <li> The brush is very simple to use, the heads change easily, even in a wet slippery</li>
            <li> My face is very sensitive to a lot of products but have found this to be gentle enough to not irritate my skin yet</li>
            <li> I received the same benefit when trying the Large Body Brush on my legs.</li>
            <li> It comes with four brushes: 1 facial brush, 1 large body brush, 1 serum and moisturizer applicator sponge, 1 pumice stone.</li>
            <li> This was clearly my fault.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money on a face brush, so I decided to look on Amazon for a similar product.</li>
            <li> but you couldn&#x27;t even tell, my skin was so soft.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying another to give to my 14 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> The sponge is incredibly soft, but durable.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> really like that the pumice stone is a bit coarse, so</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel baby soft-</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth every penny spent on it.</li>
            <li> However, the right soap and a little scrubbing and you feel really like you&#x27;ve exfoliated and cleaned thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks, I don&#x27;t know how long the brushes will last, but they still look good as of now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It removes dead dull flakes to help skin look bright and encourage new cell growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> battery cover is a very tight fit.  </li>
            <li> battery cover is a very tight fit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pumice Stone: works like a normal pumice stone only faster</li>
            <li> You get the large body brush, a regular brush, facial sponge and even a pumice stone.  </li>
            <li> That type of action makes it possible to have this tool be pumice friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush was so soft but don&#x27;t let that fool you if you use it too long with that idea in mind</li>
            <li> The only major downfall I see with this product is the fact that it only has 1 speed.</li>
            <li> Not great with foaming cleanser but still a huge difference regardless.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the battery cover was hard to open as I was pulling it away from the handle until I realized it has to be pushed back</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a large body brush, a small facial brush, a pumice stone, and a sponge.  </li>
            <li> this kit, basically all you have to do is drag yourself into the bathroom, wet your face, apply a little mild soap to the correct head, and stand there while the device does all the work.  </li>
            <li> The face and body brushes are pretty standard for these things, but the pumice stone is not as common, and I&#x27;ve never seen a sponge in one of these kits</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a 4 is because I haven&#x27;t been using the product long enough to rate it as a 5.</li>
            <li> Afterward I washed the soap off the sponge and it went back to its regular shape and color, just like any other sponge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have owned several other electronic facial brushes before owning this one.</li>
            <li> Brush for face is too harsh and the soft sponge pulls hair when applying moisturizer on skin.</li>
            <li> The brush is too rough and my face gets hurt, you can see it&#x27;s red even with make-up.</li>
            <li> Expected the same speed for the Body Brush.</li>
            <li> so this attachment goes a long way to reduce both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not been influenced in any way.is attachment goes a long way to reduce both.  </li>
            <li> Had to glue the sponge back on to the base, but that was easy and the only problem so far.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of other facial brushes.</li>
            <li> If it had atleast 2 speeds it would fall above and beyond the other brushes I have tried.</li>
            <li> As a pre-shower dry brush it preps legs and arms.</li>
            <li> I would warn you though, that if you drop it in the shower and it comes apart, as in the batteries come out, let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> My skin was getting dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous how much I look forward to using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You could spend any amount of money on a similar product, from Clarisonic on down.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You could spend any amount of money on a similar product, from Clarisonic on down.  </li>
            <li> So I hope this one holds up since it was a lot less expensive but seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> Simply put a small amount of your regular cleanser on the brush head, turn it on, and let it do its thing.</li>
            <li> ( I also use Nivea for very dry skin for the shower with it</li>
            <li> The battery compartment is a little difficult to remove (this is also a pro due to  the compartment keeps the batteries from becoming wet)</li>
            <li> In the shower or tub use it wet with soap or body</li>
            <li> Stone: I didn&#x27;t use the pumice stone on my face, but I did use it on my neck and cleavage area (pulse (on and off)), because I have issues there with rough skin/hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> The brush requires batteries that I trust will need to be replaced soon, but it&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> so I do not have to worry about getting it wet and crapping out on me.</li>
            <li> There is a pumice stone that gets after those rough spots on your elbows, knees and feet.</li>
            <li> I have been using it a few times a week since purchasing it back in March.  </li>
            <li> I expected that the serum would soak in to the tool</li>
            <li> This item came in just a few short days, and was all I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I have no affiliation with any manufacturer or distributor other than choosing to review their item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : At first I thought this attachment was weird</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions; press down firmly, and pull.  </li>
            <li> Follow the instructions; press down firmly, and pull.  </li>
            <li> The battery cover fits tightly, and there&#x27;s a little loop to hang it on a suction hook or shower caddy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery cover fits tightly, and there&#x27;s a little loop to hang it on a suction hook or shower caddy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This little sponge is life changing.</li>

            <li> Hopefully this review was was helpful, but if not, just let me know what&#x27;s missing</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s as if they&#x27;re trapped in my pores forming dots all over.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re up to it, switch out the brush for the sponge, put a few dots of serum or night cream on your face, and let the sponge work it in.  </li>
            <li> dead skin cells&lt;</li>
            <li> everyday is an ordeal</li>
            <li> Dead.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> really expected this to be at least $50</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t want to waste my time on something if its not going to make a difference.</li>
            <li> No more black heads</li>
            <li> Works the same, less expensive AND you can replace the batteries.</li>
            <li> And I have used quite a few!</li>
            <li> I had machine for no more than a month when it started to feel like it was loosing power.</li>
            <li> After eight hours of being on my feet, the body brush massages my tired legs and even makes them feel less heavy.</li>
            <li> and it broke after very few uses.</li>
            <li> My face looked a little smoother and my blackheads are a little lighter, but nothing dramatic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard when you have an accessory with parts and there is nowhere to store it all.</li>
            <li> I like the product but was not thrilled that its not rechargeable.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s plenty of room for the base unit, the attachments, and several small containers of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s plenty of room for the base unit, the attachments, and several small containers of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I almost came to work today without makeup on, which I&#x27;ve only done when I was sick.  </li>
            <li> Then I made a poor decision and didn&#x27;t use it for a week or so</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong.</li>

            <li> My friend has a Clarisonic and she loves it. I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much money on a face brush, so I decided to look on Amazon for a similar product. I was hoping to get a product that would work good and help me feel better about my skin again. I&#x27;m glad I found the product I was looking for. I use it night and day and the travel case makes it easy to pack without having to worry about losing the brush heads. Since its waterproof I can use it in the shower, which makes it more convenient for me. I use the face brush with my organic face wash and the sponge to rub in my organic moisturizer. My skin feels ten times better than it did when I would just use my hands. I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve been using the brush on my skin for about four days and already it feels so much smoother and healthier. This product is waterproof and has a LIFETIME warreanty. How can you go wrong. I&#x27;d also like to mention I&#x27;ve actually owned a $100 cleansing brush and this one is actually just as good, if not better.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE :&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my brush for over a year and It&#x27;s still working great and I haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries yet!! Awesome product</li>
            <li> love this brush! def worth the money and makes your skin soft and super clean :)</li>
            <li> After checking reviews on this, it seemed like you got more bang for your buck.  I like that the attachments give you more use than other brands that only come with one head.  using a creme cleanser with this makes a huge difference.  No residue on my face and I even forgot to put moisturizer on afterward but you couldn&#x27;t even tell, my skin was so soft.  Not great with foaming cleanser but still a huge difference regardless.</li>
            <li> After the first use I already experienced a cleaner face. I will continue to use it every night. I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:9e43d779e06422e6f75bc77a12aa7ce2]] From the standpoint of a beauty device junkie, this brush set is an excellent value.&lt;br /&gt;It is battery operated, so no being tied to the electric outlet. It&#x27;s sealed so using it in the shower is no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a large body brush-head, a petite size for the face, a sponge head and a pumice.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the sonic vibration of a Clairsonic, this has a rotary action. That type of action makes it possible to have this tool be pumice friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, it shines the brightest as a body brush. As a pre-shower dry brush it preps legs and arms. In the shower or tub use it wet with soap or body cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;It removes dead dull flakes to help skin look bright and encourage new cell growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLOSURE: Product received to test, with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned after testing.&lt;br /&gt;Views and opinions are my own. I have no affiliation with any manufacturer or distributor other than choosing to review their item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are probably considering buying this product if you are reading this. Hopefully this review was was helpful, but if not, just let me know what&#x27;s missing and I&#x27;ll try to help you.</li>
            <li> This product is just amazing. I kept seeing these brushes advertised on TV and I just wanted to get one to help clean my skin. I‚Äôve been using the cleansing brush on my face for about 2 weeks now and it has really changed the way my skin looks and feels. My face just feels fresh after using it. I haven‚Äôt used the body brush or sponge yet but I used the pumice stone and I do like that one its like having your own spa system at home. I‚Äôm getting another one for my mom since mothers day is almost here.</li>
            <li> I had been on the fence about ordering one of these for years.  I decided to buy this one, and I am glad I did.  It is easy to use and my skin feels great after using it.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This thing works as advertised.  I&#x27;ve had mine for about 2 weeks now and I am in love!  I almost came to work today without makeup on, which I&#x27;ve only done when I was sick.  I use it in the shower and use an oil-free acne wash.  It definitely has reduced my pore size.  My skin has been glowing and people have made comments to me about it on several occasions.  The item came quickly and completely intact, works great right out the box.  I will be buying another to give to my 14 year old daughter.  BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple of other facial brushes. I like this one the best.  It is durable and seems to be made well.  I like the variety of brushes.  I would warn you though, that if you drop it in the shower and it comes apart, as in the batteries come out, let it air dry.  Do not use a hair drier to make sure it is dry.  I did this and it melted the battery compartment, so I could not get the batteries in it.  This was clearly my fault.  So, I bought another. The owners of the company have sent me two emails with tips on how to use the product and seem interested in what I have to say about the product.</li>
            <li> Just what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I received one free to test and share my honest opinion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am using a Foaming Gel Cleanser which requires circular movements, I decided to test the effectiveness of the facial brush too. It worked great! Here&#x27;s how I used each piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Facial Cosmetic Sponge: I noticed that when I applied the foaming gel to the my face first and use the facial sponge with the brush kit, there is no foam on my face. In order for the cleanser to foam, I applied the foaming gel cleanser directly onto the moist sponge, wet my face with water, then &amp;#34;brushed&amp;#34; my face. The sponge is incredibly soft, but durable. Afterward I washed the soap off the sponge and it went back to its regular shape and color, just like any other sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small Face Brush: After the foam, I wanted to see what would happen with the face brush. No longer was there any foam, but I did start to feel refreshed when using this exfoliating tool on my face and neck. I received the same benefit when trying the Large Body Brush on my legs. I have &amp;#34;dots&amp;#34; on my legs, they look like ingrown hairs that do not grow outward, so it&#x27;s as if they&#x27;re trapped in my pores forming dots all over. I will continue to use this brush in the hopes that the &amp;#34;dots&amp;#34; decrease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pumice Stone: I didn&#x27;t use the pumice stone on my face, but I did use it on my neck and cleavage area (pulse (on and off)), because I have issues there with rough skin/hyperpigmentation. It&#x27;s also great for elbows, feet and other rough areas of the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Opinion: This is a great tool that will get a lot of use. The only thing that would make this even better is to have more settings than On/Off. It only needs more speed options to be perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product about two weeks ago and I am loving it so far. My skin feels very soft and it even makes my legs feel more relaxed. After eight hours of being on my feet, the body brush massages my tired legs and even makes them feel less heavy. My personal favorite is the pumice stone because after just the first use my feet all ready for sandals season. I would have to say that at least so far this product is working perfectly. No complains whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Is is just fantastic.  Every one should have one!!</li>
            <li> This is a gem.  We have been through a number of these facial cleansers even branded ones but this one is the most complete.  You get the large body brush, a regular brush, facial sponge and even a pumice stone.  It runs on 4 AA batteries (not included).  The brushes are dense but very gentle on your skin.  It also sort of giving you a massage on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changing brush is easy, you just pull it and push to replace with another one.  The pumice stone is a great bonus that is normally not included with other sets.  This is great for removing dead skin cells on your feet, knees and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only challenging part is replacing the batteries.  You don&#x27;t twist it, you just pull it.  It needs some muscle strength to pull it off.  There is not a lot of grip to hold the tip.  A rubber band would be helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For under twenty bucks (price at the time of this review), this is a great deal for a nice kit.  The bag that came with it is also a nice one to keep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample item was sent to me for review and evaluation.</li>
            <li> Okay quality. Brush for face is too harsh and the soft sponge pulls hair when applying moisturizer on skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush! I&#x27;ve used it every night for about 2 weeks now and the results are amazing! Simply put a small amount of your regular cleanser on the brush head, turn it on, and let it do its thing. The brush is waterproof, which allows you to use in the shower. Since I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks, I don&#x27;t know how long the brushes will last, but they still look good as of now. The brush requires batteries that I trust will need to be replaced soon, but it&#x27;s to be expected. Unique to this brand, the brush set comes with a cute carrying case. Overall, I am quite pleased with this brush and would recommend.</li>
            <li> Best electronic facial brush I have ever used. And I have used quite a few! Motor is strong and there are a lot of very fine bristles that truly clean and polish your skin. It feel great. Because it is waterproof I can leave it my shower - very convenient!!!</li>
            <li> I have a skin brush that does a good job, so why would I need another one? Because this one has different heads for different functions. This spin brush not only had the face brush, it has a larger body brush, a pumice stone for elbows, knees, and heels, and a sponge for putting on your moisturizer, which really does a nice job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spin action is comparable to others I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s gentle enough not to feel like I&#x27;m spinning my face off, but strong enough to feel clean and I can practically feel the increased circulation to my face. The brush is very simple to use, the heads change easily, even in a wet slippery shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice bag is included for travel or storage, although I wouldn&#x27;t store it since I am busy using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice brush and I love having the extra heads for different uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sample provided for evaluation</li>
            <li> The brush is too rough and my face gets hurt, you can see it&#x27;s red even with make-up. And the machine uses 4 AA batteries, not use charging.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:ab7b0dc8391a2df6b194eefa5f9aed03]] I hope you have a look at this video review I really love this skin cleaning system, its very complete and hardworking, I have tried many a brush system and this one is awesome for this low price .&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own thanks for looking at the video review</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because it&#x27;s said it was water proof and came with traveling case and several attachments. I had machine for no more than a month when it started to feel like it was loosing power. I changed the batteries but it didn&#x27;t change anything üò¢. I am trying it again because other reviews were good</li>
            <li> I love this thing I use it in the shower. It makes my skin feel soft. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> just stated using this product and I like it very much. Now I have my granddaughter using it as she seems to be starting with mild acne--start good habits now and they will last a lifetime. The brush was so soft but don&#x27;t let that fool you if you use it too long with that idea in mind you will break that habit fast.  I definitely would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a number of these skin care systems since they were introduced many years ago, and consider myself a connoisseur of skin treatment devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Beaute La Royale Facial and Body Skin Cleansing System packs a lot of wallop into a smallish package.  There&#x27;s a large body brush, a small facial brush, a pumice stone, and a sponge.  The face and body brushes are pretty standard for these things, but the pumice stone is not as common, and I&#x27;ve never seen a sponge in one of these kits before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that the pumice stone is a bit coarse, so it&#x27;ll actually DO something, and the directions recommend using it with warm water.  The kit I&#x27;m currently using insists on using its very fine grained pumice stone dry, which does nothing except create dust.  I used that one once, and never again.  This one is great, and just in time to start working on sandal ready feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge is a cool idea.  The point is to use it to work skin care products into freshly cleansed skin.  If you&#x27;re using pricey creams and serums (sera?), this attachment will save on product.  It also feels good!  Skin looks and feels healthy and pampered.  The best part is that it only takes a few minutes to work through the whole tool kit--less time than it takes to use one of those towelettes.  You don&#x27;t go to bed with gunk sitting on top of your skin, and you&#x27;re only five minutes away from going to bed with clean, treated skin rather than having to greet Wednesday morning with the remnants of Tuesday still on your face because you were too tired to do the whole routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this kit, basically all you have to do is drag yourself into the bathroom, wet your face, apply a little mild soap to the correct head, and stand there while the device does all the work.  Rinse.  If you&#x27;re up to it, switch out the brush for the sponge, put a few dots of serum or night cream on your face, and let the sponge work it in.  It takes almost no time or energy, your face will love you for it, and you&#x27;ll feel like a better person, especially the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save the body brush and the pumice stone for the shower or bath.  The unit is waterproof, so no worries about using it in water.  You&#x27;re supposed to.  The battery cover fits tightly, and there&#x27;s a little loop to hang it on a suction hook or shower caddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power unit takes four AA batteries.  They aren&#x27;t included, which is something you should be aware of.  When you order this, either order batteries at the same time, or make a trip to the store so you&#x27;ll be ready to go when your system arrives.  You&#x27;ll want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery cover is a very tight fit.  Follow the instructions; press down firmly, and pull.  It&#x27;ll come off.  The batteries are easy to install.  There&#x27;s a diagram on the inside cover, which is a rare and wonderful thing.  The set also come with a bonus of a plastic lined, generously sized, very good quality makeup bag.  I&#x27;m planning on storing my system in the bag so I can travel with it.  There&#x27;s plenty of room for the base unit, the attachments, and several small containers of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You could spend any amount of money on a similar product, from Clarisonic on down.  I love this set for its reasonable price, and its very well thought out choice of attachments.  If you&#x27;re looking for something like this, you won&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My product was received for review.  I love it!will love you for it, and you&#x27;ll feel like a better person, especially the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save the body brush and the pumice stone for the shower or bath.

            <li> Great product!  I am very pleased.  Does a great job on my face and body.  My pores look really clean after washing with the brush, and feels very refreshed.  I looked at some of the sonic brushes before buying this one, but the price was high and people kept complaining about the batteries running down too fast, so I thought I would try this one, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  The price was reasonable, and it does a really good job.  What&#x27;s not to like.</li>
            <li> I makes sense that I would see skin improvement, especially acne, given that I don&#x27;t use a wash cloth. So this set, a remarkable set, has allowed me to exfoliate my skin with an efficiency that surprised me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is easy to use, just battery powered so no cords, and a set of 4 brushes along with a nifty bag. The device allows me to reach around my back even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice a big improvement in my skin. Sample provided for sincere review.</li>
            <li> Works great for acne prone skin, but I dont recommend it for not normal or combined. As for the large body brush I loved it,great exfoliater.</li>
            <li> I like the product but was not thrilled that its not rechargeable. The peoduct arrived on time. Good service</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! It came with a very cute real and white chevron storage pouch so you&#x27;ll never lose any of the attachments. I love that the button isn&#x27;t supper sensitive like my Olay one bc it won&#x27;t turn off mud scrub just from holding it. The moisturizer attachment is wonderful!! I love the pumice attachment too.,.its perfect! My daughter already claimed the body attachment for her own bc she loved it so much. I am beyond thrilled with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Pros: 1) Water Proof 2) Comes with 4 different attachments 3) Feels durable 4) Cute travel bag Cons: 1) Only one speed 2) The one speed is not that fast 3) The battery compartment is a little difficult to remove (this is also a pro due to  the compartment keeps the batteries from becoming wet) I have owned several other electronic facial brushes before owning this one. The others had more than one speed, but were not waterproof and did not come with as many attachments. All of the other brushes I have own have either suffered from a short out or the batteries exploded. I really like this brush because it is waterproof so I do not have to worry about getting it wet and crapping out on me. I also really like that it came with a large body brush. The only major downfall I see with this product is the fact that it only has 1 speed. If it had atleast 2 speeds it would fall above and beyond the other brushes I have tried. I love the sponge that came with this brush also. I have been trying out different serums and moisturizers and this sponge works great at applying them. Overall I give this cleanser system 4 stars. Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Nice and inexpensive, easy to use, and WATER PROOF!</li>
            <li> As soon as it arrived I noticed that some of the bristles were shredding.  After one use a section of bristles fell out and after the second use another section of bristles fell out.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> This works great &amp; its a amazing price</li>
            <li> this thing does felt like it is cleaning but the brush irritates my skin</li>
            <li> This was a gift so I will have to update in the next couple of weeks of exactly what the experience was UPDATE:: it was the perfect gift. My aunt has been dying to use one of these and was immediately thrilled when she opened it. It&#x27;s been a couple weeks and she is still loving it. She said it has Made a tremendous difference on her skin. Her face feels smooth, refreshed, young and super clean .</li>
            <li> Works great.  Suggestion by skin care specialist.  Cleans great and leaves skin feeling like I&#x27;ve scrubbed all impurities out of skin.</li>
            <li> I love this machine, it works great and is not abrasive on the face or skin. I love all the attachments, but my favorites are the facial and foot one. The pouch it comes with is pretty big, perfect for carrying all your tools and special creams. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Do you have a daily skin care routine? Over the years I have been really slack in this area and most nights my face should feel blessed to just get a wipe down before bed! Sad. I know..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Beaute La Royale Facial Cleansing System a couple of weeks ago and have enjoyed using it. I like the different brushes and cleansing heads. The cleansing brushes include one to use on your body and one for your face. There is a pumice stone that gets after those rough spots on your elbows, knees and feet. And a wonderful facial sponge which makes applying serums or moisturizers a cinch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Skin Cleansing System Can:&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Cleanse the skin 10x better than hand washing&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Removes all traces of makeup, sweat, oil, and dirt&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Prevents blemishes and unclogs your pores&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Massages your skin&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Stimulates new skin regeneration&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Exfoliates dead skin cells&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Decreases wrinkles and fine lines&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Treats and prevents acne&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Prevents and treats acne scars&lt;br /&gt;‚Ä¢ Removes blackheads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleansing system also includes a free cosmetics bag to keep everything together and ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> It was the greatest choice forever .. I like it bcoz my face skin is shiny more &amp; more day aftter day ‚ù§Ô∏è</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 days and I already feel and see a difference. My skin feels soft and smooth and has already begun to clear up. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because I haven&#x27;t been using the product long enough to rate it as a 5. This product comes with a lot of options. It has a insert for the face, body, a sponge insert and a pumice stone insert. All of this along with an adorable bag. The electric piece takes 4 AA batteries.The customer service of this company is great. They are more than willing to answer any questions you may have.</li>
            <li> Fabulous! I saw a difference almost immediately in the overall condition of my skin (face and body). Then I made a poor decision and didn&#x27;t use it for a week or so-I regret my decision and am back to using it every morning and night! My skin is starting to improve once again</li>
            <li> Nice set with stylish bag. The brushes are soft and great for my skin which is sensitive. This will hopefully me my first and only beauty brush system.</li>
            <li> Works okay, but not as powerful as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly well. I had a clarisonic and it broke after very few uses. So I hope this one holds up since it was a lot less expensive but seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really good, the best body brush !! It is resistant, perfect traction with the pressure body imprints. recommended product.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Awesome customer service. I bought this about two months ago and waited to review to see results which have been fantastic. I live in Florida and I have dry skin and also have a crazy busy schedule so taking time to loofa my legs and arms everyday is an ordeal so I wasn&#x27;t doing it BUT this product, which I use in the shower, is quick and powerful enough to have have changed the look of my arms and legs to the point where I am feeling GREAT about their appearance. ( I also use Nivea for very dry skin for the shower with it and it is an amazing combination!)&lt;br /&gt;The vendor for this product sent me 2 or three pleasant, completely unexpected educational and informative emails on how to use the device. I didnt contact, the vendor, I didnt need to.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price, shipped as pictured and described.  It really did exfoliate my skin, it looks and feels fresher and cleaner than using an exfoliating wash.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! At first I thought the battery cover was hard to open as I was pulling it away from the handle until I realized it has to be pushed back and it opens easily. Love this so much and my face feels amazingly clean especially in the morning after I wake up. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Would have liked a faster speed on that brush.  The olay brush does a better job for the face.  Expected the same speed for the Body Brush.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, I have been looking for a skin care product for a while and this one definitely works. It feels good and I have it in the shower. One thing I would say is that there is only one speed and it is kinda slow, but it still works great for what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I had the &#x27;other&#x27; one for some time and liked it and then one day it just quit. Dead. Probably the rechargeable batteries needed replacement but, there is no way to get the thing apart. No way was I going to spend that much on another one so I tried this one. Works the same, less expensive AND you can replace the batteries.</li>
            <li> I have never used cleansing sistem for my face before. But now I would recommend it to my friends. The effect of this deep cleaning is just incredible! I don&#x27;t need to take a picture of my skin to improve the difference before and after. It is obvious. My Beaute La Royale Skin Cleansing System really works! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really love this thing. I keep it hooked in the shower and use it every day since I bought it. What a great buy!</li>
            <li> This item came in just a few short days, and was all I expected it to be. It is compact with a travel bag, and is a great addition to my beauty routine. I love it!! I am thinking about ordering another for a gift.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my BF. He uses this with his proactive. He said the head pieces are very soft against his face and he love the pumice head piece for his feet.</li>
            <li> This is so far the best facial skin cleaning system. I love it! My skin starts to get smoother and smoother. Leaves my skin very clean and highly recommend to all.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a face cleanser this is the one to get. It was definitely worth every penny spent on it.</li>
            <li> The device works great.  I have been using it a few times a week since purchasing it back in March.  There is a huge difference between washing my face by hand and using this device.  This device really exfoliates your skin making it feel fresh.  I mostly use the small brush attachment, but the other ones come in handy for different purposes.  I &amp;#34;lift things up and put them down&amp;#34; and get calluses on my hand and the pumice stone helps remove them.  The bag is a nice way to hold the device and the attachments to keep it all together.</li>
            <li> My skin was getting dry and flaky. This makes my skin feel baby soft- I am so excited!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a facial brush before so I am unable to compare to others.  My face is very sensitive to a lot of products but have found this to be gentle enough to not irritate my skin yet feels very clean after using this product.</li>
            <li> works great just don&#x27;t drop it</li>
            <li> Since this is my first purchase of this type product I really have nothing to compare it too....It does make my face feel cleaner and much smoother after using it.  I think the attachments would rotate a bit faster and I did try the pumice stone on my calluses....didn&#x27;t seem to do much for them.  It is compact and easy to use though so that is nice.  Of course this wasn&#x27;t an expensive set so I don&#x27;t know if using something more expensive would be any different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for almost a month and I use it everyday. No problems with it. I just haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference in my skin. My face looked a little smoother and my blackheads are a little lighter, but nothing dramatic.</li>
            <li> Awsome... in love with this brush set. I have used so many in past, so far this is the best one ever. Love it!! It get the job done.</li>
            <li> Edit of review August 2015: I received a replacement product in July after contacting the vendor and I am happy to report that the replacement is still going strong. I use it as a face cleaning tool mostly. However, when I use the body brush and the stone attachment i immediately notice a difference in my skin. People can&#x27;t tell my age and I have received compliments on my skin. I do alternate Neutrogena face cleaner and a face cleaner that is to soften and reduce fine lines with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it was good while it lasted, it lasted from March 22 to June 30th. That is the reason why i gave it 1 star. I don&#x27;t think having to replace an item after 3 months of use is good at all. I sent an email to the vendor and will update this review depending upon the response if there is a response.</li>
            <li> Okay item, I thought the item had more than one speed. It&#x27;s no different from the one I got at CVS.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  Had to glue the sponge back on to the base, but that was easy and the only problem so far.  Perfect for the price.  Skin improves daily.</li>
            <li> This...is...heaven! If you want to feel like you are getting a facial at home, this kit is for you! I really didn&#x27;t expect to be this excited about this skin cleansing system. In all honesty, I was initially most excited about the chevron print cute bag it came with!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of different products on my face but never before have I felt so pampered! The brush is super easy to use and comes with everything you need to take care of your face and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything is really easy to use and I love the options! The main tool is powered by four AA batteries. It comes with four brushes: 1 facial brush, 1 large body brush, 1 serum and moisturizer applicator sponge, 1 pumice stone. The best part is you can use this for so many different things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love getting pedicures but can&#x27;t always afford them so in between, this is a great tool to use for my heels with the pumice stone. It&#x27;s waterproof so you can use it in the shower. You just pop the brush on and push it in to secure it. To remove and change it out, you just pull it off and stick the next one off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love any kind of pampering so it&#x27;s nice that I can use this to cleanse my skin with the small soft brush and then use the applicator brush to get the serum deep into my freshly cleansed skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really expected this to be at least $50 so I think $29 on Amazon is an awesome value!</li>
            <li> This is a great set in one for body and facial cleansing. I love that it comes with a zippered carry pouch as well. It&#x27;s hard when you have an accessory with parts and there is nowhere to store it all. This cool looking pouch keeps it all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit works well. It has just enough power to scrub without scraping. Which is actually a drawback when it comes to the pumice since it didn&#x27;t have quite enough power to get through some rougher heel skin. However, the right soap and a little scrubbing and you feel really like you&#x27;ve exfoliated and cleaned thoroughly. The body brush is also good but I don&#x27;t use that as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I already mentioned, the pumice is nice but the rotation isn&#x27;t quite enough for rougher areas, but good for light smoothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> Really works. I wish I can post a before &amp; after but forgot to do the before. Although I assure you that my skin feels significantly smoother and my skin tone is more even overall. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product I use it everyday and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I&#x27;m glad I chose this brand.</li>
            <li> My face has never felt cleaner.  It gets deep In my pores. No more black heads</li>
            <li> I received this brush for a promo price threw a online company and I must say it was a SCORE !!!! We have been using these for some time now and this one is one of the best. It is the perfect size and it glides smoothly across your face, leaving it feeling clean AND smooth. I would HIGLY recommend this to my friends or anyone interested!</li>
            <li> This is really the absolute coolest beauty tool. It&#x27;s ridiculous how much I look forward to using it. The best way to describe the difference in washing my face with this system would be for you to imagine using a manual toothbrush after using an electric one, somehow it just seems less effective. Once you feel the difference you cant go back. The first two times I used the system I only used it on one side of my face to see if it really made a difference. I wash my face twice a day religiously so I don&#x27;t want to waste my time on something if its not going to make a difference. The difference is incredible.&lt;br /&gt; The 6 in 1 Skin Cleansing Kit: Comes with 1 waterproof and cordless rotating machine, 1 facial brush, 1 large body brush, 1 serum and moisturizer applicator sponge, 1 pumice stone, and BONUS 1 beautiful and stylish travel and storage bag.a face brush, The Cordless Sonic Rotating Cleanser Machine is sturdy for sure. I dropped it once and although the thing came apart it went back perfectly and never missed a beat. Its water-proof so it works in the shower for scrubbing feet, body and my face and it&#x27;s no louder than an electric tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Face brush: perfect size, soft bristles, rinses easily.&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer sponge: At first I thought this attachment was weird but I wanted to give this system a fair evaluation. This little sponge is life changing. It evenly applies serum and moisturizer and has this incredible firming ability. I expected that the serum would soak in to the tool and I would have to waste more but it didn&#x27;t at all. The sponge distributes the moisturizer and serum evenly and dries quickly because they aren&#x27;t sitting on top of the skin slowing sinking in.&lt;br /&gt;Pumice Stone: works like a normal pumice stone only faster and so can be used daily and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Body Brush: I like the size of the brush. the vibration of the brush is said to help reduce the signs of cellulite and who doesn&#x27;t like that? I&#x27;m paranoid about razor bumps and ingrown hairs so this attachment goes a long way to reduce both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the good clean well scrubbed feeling this system gives me. This is definitely worth your money!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received complimentary/free products for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine.
