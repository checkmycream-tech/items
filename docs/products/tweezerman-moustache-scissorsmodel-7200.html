            <li>Nice scissors!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality of the construction of any Tweezerman products are so superb and I have added many of their line of grooming accessories to my dopp kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to anyone looking to trim their beard or moustache without buying an electric beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This product is a virtual clone of my beloved Hoffritz HH scissors, which I&#x27;ve owned and used since the 1980s.</li>
            <li>Shipping was good too.</li>
            <li>Timely delivery, good quality.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Great product and easy to use.</li>
            <li>They are light and easy to use and we are very happy with them!</li>
            <li>I own 2.</li>
            <li>if you like to keep a tidy goatee and moustache, this is a must to have.  </li>
            <li>Nice finish, and they have held their edge.</li>
            <li>handle rings are good and comfortable for your fingers and the sharpness is good.</li>
            <li>I had a nice pair of Hoffritz hardened steel mustache scissors that I bought at a mall about 25 years ago.</li>
            <li>Nice product..very durable. .I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>All you need is a nice handheld mirror and these scissors</li>
            <li>But cuts good, easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Tweezer man is the best by far!</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>I actually use these for my eyebrows, and they are perfect!</li>
            <li>My husband recently started growing a mustache and these scissors are perfect.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the size of this one</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if the scissors came with a protective case, but at the price, I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>If a 7 year old has a moustache and goatee these scissors would be great for him.</li>
            <li>Im sure they would be great to trim facial hair as well.</li>
            <li>They are perfect for that, had looked all over at different drug store and could not find just the right ones....</li>
            <li>Fine for what they say.</li>
            <li>Great scissors pretty straight forward</li>
            <li>the way, even if you don&#x27;t have a moustache - I don&#x27;t - these are great to have in the bathroom for such chores as eyebrow trimming and package opening.</li>
            <li>These scissors are precise.  </li>
            <li>he says they work exceptionally well and have stayed nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>I suggest you get your pair of unique small scissors while you can, they truly are perfect!</li>
            <li>I thought it was a tad too small when I opened the package but turns out the size is perfect.</li>
            <li>The scissors are well made and cut cleanly.</li>
            <li>they were good last a life time scissors like Fiscar or those ones made in Germany or Switzerland.</li>
            <li>the fit is just right.</li>
            <li>Tweezerman scissors look robust and will no doubt give many years of service, but they come in a soft plastic box more suitable for store display than daily use.</li>
            <li>Am ok with the product , but i consider the price to high for the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Well worth it, considering that they&#x27;re pretty cheap to begin with.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we needed!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re well made and the size works great for getting into tight places.</li>
            <li>Great little scissors...</li>
            <li>Sharp effective and easy to get percise cuts.</li>
            <li>They fit my big fingers (definite plus) and do a great job.  </li>
            <li>worth the money to have quality.</li>
            <li>So, when I saw these I thought it was well worth a try.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Just the right size for trimming one hair at a time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this review after I see what the do to make ti right</li>
            <li>Right now, they grip the hairs well</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s early signs of rust and they don&#x27;t seem as easy to use.</li>
            <li>They fit very comfortably in my fingers and the cutting motion is so satisfying with these I almost wanted to cut more of my hair.</li>
            <li>Supposed to be stainless steel!</li>
            <li>I bought these to trim my beard in lieu of spending more money and buying an actual electric trimmer</li>
            <li>but they were very sharp on arrival and work great so far.</li>
            <li>nice and sharp, right to the very tip.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp and the size of the blades allows me to make precision cuts to my moustache.</li>
            <li>Not as sharp as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>Nice sharp affordable scissors.</li>
            <li>with the kind of price i would have expected a Stainless Steel one.</li>
            <li>OK, maybe a larger one, but definitely not the ectomorph with  skinny fingers that would find these scissors comfortable.</li>
            <li>Sharp, comfortable to use, accurate,</li>
            <li>Very sharp and with nice pointed blades.</li>
            <li>I am less than thrilled.</li>
            <li>Cuts my wiry coarse mustache hair easily.  </li>
            <li>I wish the fingerholes were slightly larger but scissors still easy to control.</li>
            <li>The pointed edge makes it easier to get to certain spots on the &#x27;stache.</li>
            <li>I have a pair of singer sewing scissors made in Pakistan that are 20 + years old and they never rusted all the times i rinsed with warm water and let dry.</li>
            <li>Very high quality.</li>
            <li>Very high quality and do the job well</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re getting dull, so I thought this would be a good replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They really should come with some sort of sleeve that would protect the scissors in a drawer or medicine cabinet or toilet kit while giving the user easy access to the product.</li>
            <li>Still cut straight</li>
            <li>They are very pointy, so you probably don&#x27;t want to use them for trimming nose or ear</li>
            <li>These are in no way stainless steel.</li>
            <li>Maybe someone&#x27;s elses, haha,</li>
            <li>Prefect cut whether at the very end of the scissors or at the core.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used these a whole lot</li>
            <li>They much work</li>
            <li>i will really take care of these.</li>
            <li>Had these for a month thought they were stainless steel they are not.</li>
            <li>These scissors really do work well,</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I&#x27;ve had more time to use these I&#x27;ll update my review to reflect whether they stay sharp or not.</li>
            <li>Much better than I expected!</li>
            <li>Nice feel, very sharp but the first time you get them wet and close them without making sure they are completely dry; they will rust.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll come back to edit the review if the blades go dull or something breaks so unless this review is edited, assume that I&#x27;m still happy with these!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great for cutting wicks just right on the Fogger v4.</li>
            <li>I bought these to trim cotton wicks on my RBA/RDA for that purpose they work wonderfully, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>The price seems a bit high for a pair of scissors, but considering the quality</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend as a buy.</li>
            <li>High quality scissors.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sharp and catch hairs every easily.</li>
            <li>a normal size guy.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not really a complaint of mine, just keep them out of water.</li>
            <li>this is not common practice but we will do it this once.</li>
            <li>Compact, sharp, maneuverable, fine for trimming a mustache.    </li>
            <li>but over time they became loose causing un clean cuts of my course beard and mustache.</li>
            <li>These scissors are sharp and they work smoothly.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without mine.</li>
            <li>so I needed a new one.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and easy to use when trimming my moustache.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and strong but ends bent after 5-6 uses.</li>
            <li>the flip side, they are very sharp and do a fine job of snipp&#x27;n the smallest of rogue hairs.</li>
            <li>Not stainless steel, keep that in mind, otherwise they´re nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>Sharp!  Precise for mustache.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp, and cut great, only down side is they are prone to rust...</li>
            <li>Very sharp and precise.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These new scissors sit while I continue to use the old ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>as good as more expensive ones I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li>Far better than the pair that I just bought (blue package with little comb) at a national drug store chain for seven bucks.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t much care enough about that to complain.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any problems so far.  </li>
            <li>I also use my old moustache scissors for nose and ear hairs, etc.  </li>
            <li>(I am 68 years old hairs everywhere have become an issue.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There were just what my husband needed to complete the job when doing his grooming to his moustache.  </li>
            <li>I cut my bangs about every month and my old pair of scissors (which I had stolen from my dad) broke</li>
            <li>flash rinse with hot water, shake water off well than dry with towel promptly.</li>
            <li>These scissors are very sharp and have absolutely no issue trimming even the most stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li>I am concerned though with how well the stainless steel will hold an edge long term.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li>I still use these exclusively to cut my bangs, but the screw holding the whole thing together comes loose so frequently</li>
            <li>I actually bought them to trim my newly born granddaughter&#x27;s finger nails.</li>
            <li>At least it&#x27;s easy to do so with just your nail</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re small (that&#x27;s kind of the point) but also larger than other reviews had led me to expect.</li>
            <li>my husband loved it for cutting his mustache.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good to go for the cutting session.</li>

            <li> They are very pointy, so you probably don&#x27;t want to use them for trimming nose or ear</li>
            <li> These are in no way stainless steel.</li>
            <li> Maybe someone&#x27;s elses, haha,</li>
            <li> Prefect cut whether at the very end of the scissors or at the core.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used these a whole lot</li>
            <li> They much work</li>
            <li> i will really take care of these.</li>
            <li> Had these for a month thought they were stainless steel they are not.</li>
            <li> These scissors really do work well,</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I&#x27;ve had more time to use these I&#x27;ll update my review to reflect whether they stay sharp or not.</li>
            <li> Much better than I expected!</li>
            <li> Nice feel, very sharp but the first time you get them wet and close them without making sure they are completely dry; they will rust.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll come back to edit the review if the blades go dull or something breaks so unless this review is edited, assume that I&#x27;m still happy with these!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great for cutting wicks just right on the Fogger v4.</li>
            <li> I bought these to trim cotton wicks on my RBA/RDA for that purpose they work wonderfully, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> The price seems a bit high for a pair of scissors, but considering the quality</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend as a buy.</li>
            <li> High quality scissors.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp and catch hairs every easily.</li>
            <li> a normal size guy.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not really a complaint of mine, just keep them out of water.</li>
            <li> this is not common practice but we will do it this once.</li>
            <li> Compact, sharp, maneuverable, fine for trimming a mustache.    </li>
            <li> but over time they became loose causing un clean cuts of my course beard and mustache.</li>
            <li> These scissors are sharp and they work smoothly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without mine.</li>
            <li> so I needed a new one.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and easy to use when trimming my moustache.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and strong but ends bent after 5-6 uses.</li>
            <li> the flip side, they are very sharp and do a fine job of snipp&#x27;n the smallest of rogue hairs.</li>
            <li> Not stainless steel, keep that in mind, otherwise they´re nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> Sharp!  Precise for mustache.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp, and cut great, only down side is they are prone to rust...</li>
            <li> Very sharp and precise.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These new scissors sit while I continue to use the old ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> as good as more expensive ones I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li> Far better than the pair that I just bought (blue package with little comb) at a national drug store chain for seven bucks.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t much care enough about that to complain.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any problems so far.  </li>
            <li> I also use my old moustache scissors for nose and ear hairs, etc.  </li>
            <li> (I am 68 years old hairs everywhere have become an issue.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There were just what my husband needed to complete the job when doing his grooming to his moustache.  </li>
            <li> I cut my bangs about every month and my old pair of scissors (which I had stolen from my dad) broke</li>
            <li> flash rinse with hot water, shake water off well than dry with towel promptly.</li>
            <li> These scissors are very sharp and have absolutely no issue trimming even the most stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> I am concerned though with how well the stainless steel will hold an edge long term.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> I still use these exclusively to cut my bangs, but the screw holding the whole thing together comes loose so frequently</li>
            <li> I actually bought them to trim my newly born granddaughter&#x27;s finger nails.</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s easy to do so with just your nail</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small (that&#x27;s kind of the point) but also larger than other reviews had led me to expect.</li>
            <li> my husband loved it for cutting his mustache.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good to go for the cutting session.</li>
            <li> They work great until they get dull, which they do pretty quickly, not that bad for people who use scissors every now and then</li>
            <li> I figure with careful use and care this will last my life time.</li>
            <li> but it is more difficult to isolate that odd hair that goes against the grain.</li>
            <li> : Remember after washing your scissors make it dry using napkins otherwise</li>
            <li> I suggest that you keep it dry and don&#x27;t take it into the shower and leave on the soap dish.</li>
            <li> I can precisely cut cotton up to at least 1/8 in thick and probably thicker.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The old scissors have a shorter blade a small curve to them.  </li>
            <li> My complaint is the finger holes are pretty small for me, I&#x27;m 6&#x27; 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is chrome plated scissor not a stainless steel scissor.</li>
            <li> The quality was just what I expected at a</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t cut as expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> These, however, are not stainless; the package states &amp;#34;nickel plated&amp;#34; and it sticks to magnets.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not stainless.  </li>
            <li> Be careful as a</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t plan on using them for anything other than a mustache.</li>
            <li> They are not as sharp as i wanted them so you have to try to get a closer cut.</li>
            <li> I cut my nose with these and never done that before with other pairs.</li>
            <li> They are not that sharp.</li>
            <li> Decently sharp pair of scissors.  </li>
            <li> sharp and built well.</li>
            <li> I like how amazingly sharp these are.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on other people&#x27;s Amazon reviews I bought a pair of the Tweezermans to try.</li>
            <li> Scissors were sharp and worked well until got rusty.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend didn&#x27;t realize how sharp they were and cut his finger.</li>
            <li> I ruined his other scissors 5 years ago and now had them replaced.</li>
            <li> Sharp all through the blade, was a breeze to cut my bangs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are sharp and everything.</li>
            <li> They finally got rustly and dull.</li>
            <li> I have average man&#x27;s hands</li>
            <li> recommend this product but not worth for $11</li>
            <li> I have purchased cheap scissors in the past and been unhappy.  </li>
            <li> People with larger hands/fingers may find them a little small or tight on their fingers.    </li>
            <li> Very Sharp.</li>
            <li> They work well and are very sharp.</li>
            <li> They were up to the task, very sharp.</li>
            <li> Actually, they are just too tiny, period...and, uncomfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This got rusted in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Not much more to say, they do what I expected them to do.  </li>
            <li> Would be perect, but snags a little.  </li>
            <li> Yes they do rust a little</li>
            <li> y&#x27;all AMAZON, ONE LITTLE PART OF THE COMMUNITY WE CAN TRUST.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just Chrome - they rusted within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and small.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers commented on the small finger openings, and they are a bit small, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am somewhat of a grown man with average size hands and these are just too tiny for my fingers.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and can cut thick mustache and nose hairs without any problems.</li>
            <li> But, the blade started rusting after a few months, leading to a dull blade.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a scissors from a bad lot, or maybe they usually use poor-quality stainless steel.</li>
            <li> oh June 2013, for the past 5 moths am using it.</li>
            <li> might look for a pair with shorter blades and a small curve.  </li>
            <li> It is very inconvenient to hold the scissors as the rings for the fingers are smaller as compared to the one I am used to and also the size is smaller for a moustache scissors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He is really picky, so when I found this, I hoped it would work, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time trimming my mustache with them.</li>
            <li> They just seem to be common scissors like I used when I was a kid in kindergarten.</li>
            <li> at least now i know they will rust</li>
            <li> I will look into their warranty, but I&#x27;m afraid the shipping will cost the same as I paid for them.</li>
            <li> They are a touch thick but do the trick.</li>
            <li> These scissors are too stiff when cutting and not smooth as it should be, and there is no way to loosen the tension.</li>
            <li> Poor product.</li>
            <li> Worse than the ones I was replacing .</li>
            <li> I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> Was the wrong size.  </li>
            <li> RIP-OFF!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not too bad, but still not ideal to have to do this to a pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> The screw seems to loosen whenever you make a cutting motion.</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quite annoying.</li>
            <li> The problem is that the blades are set too close together which is really annoying.</li>
            <li> I AM SO MAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very sharp and strong but ends bent after 5-6 uses. Still cut straight but it is more difficult to isolate that odd hair that goes against the grain.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> Great scissors. Nice and sharp and the size of the blades allows me to make precision cuts to my moustache.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my purse! Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Compact, sharp, maneuverable, fine for trimming a mustache.    People with larger hands/fingers may find them a little small or tight on their fingers.    Don&#x27;t plan on using them for anything other than a mustache. It would take a while to trim a beard with these.    Fine for what they say.</li>
            <li> Amazon asked me to write a review on the Tweezerman Moustache scissors.  So here I go.............they work great.  Not much more to say, they do what I expected them to do.  I would say buy these if you need a trim.</li>
            <li> ...I didn&#x27;t get the comb that the product description says is supposed to be there.  I have plenty of mustache combs so I don&#x27;t much care enough about that to complain.</li>
            <li> Using this regularly.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> If a 7 year old has a moustache and goatee these scissors would be great for him. Unfortunately, I am somewhat of a grown man with average size hands and these are just too tiny for my fingers. Actually, they are just too tiny, period...and, uncomfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the flip side, they are very sharp and do a fine job of snipp&#x27;n the smallest of rogue hairs.</li>
            <li> got these for my boyfriend and he uses them for his mustache. he says they work exceptionally well and have stayed nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> the best scissors. I own 2.</li>
            <li> Would be perect, but snags a little.  Sometimes bringing a tear to my eye. But cuts good, easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I love them.  Just the right size for trimming one hair at a time.</li>
            <li> They are not as sharp as i wanted them so you have to try to get a closer cut. Not the best for the inside of your nose.  I cut my nose with these and never done that before with other pairs.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and with nice pointed blades. I have average man&#x27;s hands the fit is just right. I figure with careful use and care this will last my life time.</li>
            <li> Had these scissors for about a week and they work great. Sharp effective and easy to get percise cuts. Definitly recommend these scissors.</li>
            <li> This product is a virtual clone of my beloved Hoffritz HH scissors, which I&#x27;ve owned and used since the 1980s. Also Italian-made, the Hoffritz version comes in a red plastic case for protection. Both scissors and case are so well-worn that I decided to try the Tweezerman replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(By the way, even if you don&#x27;t have a moustache - I don&#x27;t - these are great to have in the bathroom for such chores as eyebrow trimming and package opening. They are very pointy, so you probably don&#x27;t want to use them for trimming nose or ear hairs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tweezerman scissors look robust and will no doubt give many years of service, but they come in a soft plastic box more suitable for store display than daily use. They really should come with some sort of sleeve that would protect the scissors in a drawer or medicine cabinet or toilet kit while giving the user easy access to the product.</li>
            <li> The size and shape is great. But, the blade started rusting after a few months, leading to a dull blade. Maybe I got a scissors from a bad lot, or maybe they usually use poor-quality stainless steel.</li>
            <li> Scissors rusted within a month. I would expect this from a cheaper pair. Will not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps happy shopping</li>
            <li> They work great until they get dull, which they do pretty quickly, not that bad for people who use scissors every now and then</li>
            <li> Tweezerman Rides Again: this is a second set--great tool....</li>
            <li> if you like to keep a tidy goatee and moustache, this is a must to have.  along with a quality electric stubble device, this puts the last definition to a trimmed look.  worth the money to have quality.</li>
            <li> Not stainless steel, keep that in mind, otherwise they´re nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> Nice feel, very sharp but the first time you get them wet and close them without making sure they are completely dry; they will rust.</li>
            <li> This is chrome plated scissor not a stainless steel scissor. with the kind of price i would have expected a Stainless Steel one. This got rusted in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> They are not that sharp. I have a hard time trimming my mustache with them. I am less than thrilled. They just seem to be common scissors like I used when I was a kid in kindergarten. I don&#x27;t understand the rave reviews. I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> These were great. I actually bought them to trim my newly born granddaughter&#x27;s finger nails. They are perfect for that, had looked all over at different drug store and could not find just the right ones....these were perfect. I would recommend them. Shipping was good too.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and small.  Perfect for trimming the mustache.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this item. The quality was just what I expected at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;The dealer provided me with prompt and great service too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Decently sharp pair of scissors.  Cuts my wiry coarse mustache hair easily.  Haven&#x27;t had any problems so far.  It would have been nice if the scissors came with a protective case, but at the price, I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Poor product. Wouldn&#x27;t cut as expected. Worse than the ones I was replacing .👎try another product if at all possible</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a mustache for over 40 years and trimming was always a bit of a challenge with regular barber scissors. So, when I saw these I thought it was well worth a try. They&#x27;re well made and the size works great for getting into tight places. Works equally as well on eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Nice finish, and they have held their edge. I don&#x27;t use them but once a month or so, but they are still working as advertised.</li>
            <li> my husband loved it for cutting his mustache.  He is really picky, so when I found this, I hoped it would work, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hi, I ordered Tweezerman Moustache Scissors  oh June 2013, for the past 5 moths am using it. Am ok with the product , but i consider the price to high for the product.&lt;br /&gt;I used to it to trim my mustache and am using it twice a week .The handle rings are good and comfortable for your fingers and the sharpness is good. Since I am using it only twice a week it will continue to give the same sharpness for another one year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note : Remember after washing your scissors make it dry using napkins otherwise rus will form in middle of the scissors joint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product but not worth for $11</li>
            <li> A Must Have For Bearded Ones! Perfect Size For Bathroom And Travel. Very Sharp. I Fully Recommend.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and precise.  I actually use these for my eyebrows, and they are perfect!</li>
            <li> These are in no way stainless steel. It&#x27;s just Chrome - they rusted within a few weeks. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> works well. sharp and built well.</li>
            <li> I like how amazingly sharp these are. They are a touch thick but do the trick. But now that I of course found the different ones that I lost I won&#x27;t be using these for my face. Maybe someone&#x27;s elses, haha, yeah.</li>
            <li> My husband recently started growing a mustache and these scissors are perfect. They are light and easy to use and we are very happy with them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same pair of scissors for 30 years. They&#x27;re getting dull, so I thought this would be a good replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a normal size guy. OK, maybe a larger one, but definitely not the ectomorph with  skinny fingers that would find these scissors comfortable. The finger holes aren&#x27;t man sized.</li>
            <li> Tweezer man is the best by far!</li>
            <li> I bought these to trim cotton wicks on my RBA/RDA for that purpose they work wonderfully, I highly recommend them. Im sure they would be great to trim facial hair as well. I can precisely cut cotton up to at least 1/8 in thick and probably thicker. Works great for cutting wicks just right on the Fogger v4.</li>
            <li> These scissors are precise.  They do not catch any hairs.  Prefect cut whether at the very end of the scissors or at the core.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used these a whole lot but they were very sharp on arrival and work great so far. The pointed edge makes it easier to get to certain spots on the &#x27;stache. No complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I&#x27;ve had more time to use these I&#x27;ll update my review to reflect whether they stay sharp or not.</li>
            <li> Nice scissors! They&#x27;re small (that&#x27;s kind of the point) but also larger than other reviews had led me to expect. They&#x27;re sharp and catch hairs every easily. The price seems a bit high for a pair of scissors, but considering the quality I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I also use my old moustache scissors for nose and ear hairs, etc.  (I am 68 years old hairs everywhere have become an issue.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old scissors have a shorter blade a small curve to them.  They much work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These new scissors sit while I continue to use the old ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might look for a pair with shorter blades and a small curve.  I imagine someone makes them.</li>
            <li> I had a nice pair of Hoffritz hardened steel mustache scissors that I bought at a mall about 25 years ago. They finally got rustly and dull. Hoffritz seem to have gotten out of the medical/personal scissor market. I see ads for vintage Hoffritz, so maybe they got bought-out and their current product quality has declined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on other people&#x27;s Amazon reviews I bought a pair of the Tweezermans to try. They are very sharp and can cut thick mustache and nose hairs without any problems. I am concerned though with how well the stainless steel will hold an edge long term. I guess time will tell. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Very nice scissors. Just what I expected. Very high quality.</li>
            <li> Sharp, comfortable to use, accurate, as good as more expensive ones I&#x27;ve bought in the past. Highly recommend as a buy.</li>
            <li> Scissors were sharp and worked well until got rusty. Supposed to be stainless steel!</li>
            <li> Great little scissors...but they&#x27;ve already started to show rust from the moisture in our bathroom after a couple months of ownership.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fail.</li>
            <li> Yes they do rust a little but that&#x27;s not really a complaint of mine, just keep them out of water. My complaint is the finger holes are pretty small for me, I&#x27;m 6&#x27; 2&amp;#34; if that helps? I don&#x27;t know my finger size.</li>
            <li> The scissors are well made and cut cleanly. I wish the fingerholes were slightly larger but scissors still easy to control. I definately would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very high quality and do the job well</li>
            <li> These were great.  There were just what my husband needed to complete the job when doing his grooming to his moustache.  Great product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> work well&lt;br /&gt;good value</li>
            <li> Sharp!  Precise for mustache.</li>
            <li> These work well. Well worth it, considering that they&#x27;re pretty cheap to begin with. I use them on my goatee.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace another pair of Italian made scissors that I had ruined, trying to sharpen. They are very sharp, and cut great, only down side is they are prone to rust...</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed!</li>
            <li> I suggest you get your pair of unique small scissors while you can, they truly are perfect! I can&#x27;t live without mine.</li>
            <li> Very good scissors to help keep my moustaches lined. Recommended</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> They work well and are very sharp. Far better than the pair that I just bought (blue package with little comb) at a national drug store chain for seven bucks. These, however, are not stainless; the package states &amp;#34;nickel plated&amp;#34; and it sticks to magnets.  Definitely not stainless.  I have a similar pair that have lasted for a couple of years without rusting. I suggest that you keep it dry and don&#x27;t take it into the shower and leave on the soap dish.</li>
            <li> This pair replaced a another pair that lasted 10 years. These are not going to make that longevity.  There&#x27;s early signs of rust and they don&#x27;t seem as easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great pair of scissors. Very sharp and easy to use when trimming my moustache.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend didn&#x27;t realize how sharp they were and cut his finger. He loves them. I ruined his other scissors 5 years ago and now had them replaced. that was his Christmas present.</li>
            <li> I sent it back.  Was the wrong size.  I need something longer.  Will try again with another order probably tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Timely delivery, good quality. I recommend it to anyone.  I use them for embroidery scissors as well as for hair trims.</li>
            <li> Great scissors pretty straight forward</li>
            <li> ..just wish they were a bit smaller</li>
            <li> Good scissors!  Much better than I expected!</li>
            <li> I have purchased cheap scissors in the past and been unhappy.  These scissors are awesome.  They fit my big fingers (definite plus) and do a great job.  Be careful as a I accidentally trimmed my ear a bit (definitely not the scissors fault, but talks to the sharpness of the product)!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of different scissors. they were good last a life time scissors like Fiscar or those ones made in Germany or Switzerland. These suck! $12.00 scissors and they already rusted. I cleaned them accordingly taking pain staking diligence to follow the Tweezerman web sight and they rusted. What a bunch of bologna. Made in Italy? who cares if they RUST. I have a pair of singer sewing scissors made in Pakistan that are 20 + years old and they never rusted all the times i rinsed with warm water and let dry. I AM SO MAD!!!!!!!!!!!!! RIP-OFF! I DON&#x27;T CARE IF THEY HAVE A WEB SIGHT OR THEY SELL THEM AT WALGREEN&#x27;S. KISS MY BOOTY TWEEZERBUT&#x27;S! YOU SUCK BIG TIME. UPDATE: i called and was determined and did speak with a lady named elaine she said i could get a replacement pair as a courtesy. this is not common practice but we will do it this once. i will really take care of these. she said these are nickle plated and would rust. at least now i know they will rust and i know what to expect. flash rinse with hot water, shake water off well than dry with towel promptly. bye y&#x27;all AMAZON, ONE LITTLE PART OF THE COMMUNITY WE CAN TRUST.</li>
            <li> These scissors are too stiff when cutting and not smooth as it should be, and there is no way to loosen the tension.</li>
            <li> I cut my bangs about every month and my old pair of scissors (which I had stolen from my dad) broke so I needed a new one. I wasn&#x27;t sure about the size of this one but I wanted to try it anyway. I thought it was a tad too small when I opened the package but turns out the size is perfect. They fit very comfortably in my fingers and the cutting motion is so satisfying with these I almost wanted to cut more of my hair. Sharp all through the blade, was a breeze to cut my bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s about 4inch in length and the blades are about 1.5inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll come back to edit the review if the blades go dull or something breaks so unless this review is edited, assume that I&#x27;m still happy with these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I downgraded my rating to 3 stars. I still use these exclusively to cut my bangs, but the screw holding the whole thing together comes loose so frequently it&#x27;s quite annoying. The screw seems to loosen whenever you make a cutting motion. I&#x27;ve given up using a screwdriver to tighten it because I know it will loosen anyway. Now before using it I just tighten that screw a bit with my nail and it&#x27;s good to go for the cutting session. At least it&#x27;s easy to do so with just your nail so it&#x27;s not too bad, but still not ideal to have to do this to a pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed. They were great when I got them but over time they became loose causing un clean cuts of my course beard and mustache. when I went to tighten the set screw I discovered that it is not a set screw it is a rivet made to look like a screw so they can&#x27;t be tightened. Hopefully they will see this review and respond. I will look into their warranty, but I&#x27;m afraid the shipping will cost the same as I paid for them. I&#x27;ll update this review after I see what the do to make ti right</li>
            <li> great for the price. The work well for trimming the stray hairs in my beard.</li>
            <li> Had these for a month thought they were stainless steel they are not.I was rinsing them of after use and cut my finger, the chrome platting was peeling off and it sliced my finger.</li>
            <li> It is very inconvenient to hold the scissors as the rings for the fingers are smaller as compared to the one I am used to and also the size is smaller for a moustache scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The agency has taken a deposit of 10.58 US$. there is no receipt for the same and it seems that there is no duty paid and there i expect to get the credit of US$10:58</li>
            <li> These scissors really do work well, nice and sharp, right to the very tip. Recommended!</li>
            <li> So, I use moustache scissors to cut my fingernails. These are sharp and everything. The problem is that the blades are set too close together which is really annoying.</li>
            <li> Excellent scissors. Delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> Nice product..very durable. .I&#x27;m a facial hair artist..</li>
            <li> Purchased to snip skin tags on the neck. They were up to the task, very sharp. I&#x27;ve used them on hang nails and they worked well. Nice sharp affordable scissors.</li>
            <li> High quality scissors. I use them to microtrim my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these to trim my beard in lieu of spending more money and buying an actual electric trimmer and I have to say these are some of the nicest grooming scissors that I have eveever come across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the construction of any Tweezerman products are so superb and I have added many of their line of grooming accessories to my dopp kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to anyone looking to trim their beard or moustache without buying an electric beard trimmer.  All you need is a nice handheld mirror and these scissors and you&#x27;re on your way! These scissors are very sharp and have absolutely no issue trimming even the most stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> These scissors are sharp and they work smoothly. Other reviewers commented on the small finger openings, and they are a bit small, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem.  Right now, they grip the hairs well and I can cut closely where needed.</li>
