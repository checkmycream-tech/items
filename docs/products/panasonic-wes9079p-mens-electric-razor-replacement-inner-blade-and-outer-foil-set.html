            <li>I am very pleased with a good product at a reasonable price and delivered promptly.</li>
            <li>This item is available as two separate items but the cost is more than the combo pack!</li>
            <li>I am glad they still have these.</li>
            <li>Perfect fit to my old razor.</li>
            <li>Maybe it will work better for you.</li>
            <li>It should work okay, but I found that also replacing this did improve performance.    </li>
            <li>It was still shaving OK but was noisy</li>
            <li>My Pansonic ES8066 is a dinosaur, yet it has wireless charging and still works better than any electric I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>but, I&#x27;m glad I bought these.</li>
            <li>Worked great - saved having to buy a new razor!</li>
            <li>Had high hopes that it would improve my shave greatly -</li>
            <li>I decided to buy a new blade and the shaver works great.</li>
            <li>Yes, the new blades are flimsier than the originals, but they still seem to be doing a great job.    </li>
            <li>This is a great product and make the razor work like new again.</li>
            <li>Works great... much better than the old blades &amp; foil.</li>
            <li>They are also the most comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Not to sound condescending but what can anyone do if the separate blades-type model isn&#x27;t available anymore?!?</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say it gives me a better shave, maybe a bit, but it does give me a good shave more quickly</li>
            <li>Very nice and quick delivery, and I&#x27;m very satisfy.</li>
            <li>It was easy to install</li>
            <li>The instructions were easy to follow.</li>
            <li>Researching was easy, received order promptly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relatively easy to replace the blades and foil.</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to replace.</li>
            <li>The battery seemed to still be strong</li>
            <li>Now my shaver works as good as new again and</li>
            <li>Shaver is as good as new now.</li>
            <li>Price was fine.</li>
            <li>I am using them and they work fine.</li>
            <li>Luckily I was able to buy this replacement.</li>
            <li>Original Panasonic  replacement foil and blade works like new, good price.</li>
            <li>These, seen on this page, never disappoint and continue to deliver a close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Would recommend the blades if this would fit your shaver.</li>
            <li>Pay attention to which end is which to ensure a smooth re-installation.  </li>
            <li>Still holds a charge and runs as smooth as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This newer blade is all there is available as a replacement blade.</li>
            <li>I could have sworn when I ordered this that it said it would fit the ES8080 model.</li>
            <li>The blades fit but the foil doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Item fit my shaver and performed as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>My Panasonic is about 5 years old now but still holds a good charge.</li>
            <li>Speaking of time, the shipper took it&#x27;s good old time in shipping this item.</li>
            <li>so glad we went this way instead of spending the $$$ to buy a new razor!!!</li>
            <li>All new foils and cutters work great out of the space bubble pack, but time is the real test of these products.</li>
            <li>I assumed it would be the original blade type</li>
            <li>, I recommend you purchase this item to regain your shaver&#x27;s original performance.</li>
            <li>Checked the original specs</li>
            <li>I had to disassemble the original foil, and I thought it was one piece.  </li>
            <li>They are original Panasonic replacement parts</li>
            <li>I had the original blades for 10+ years.</li>
            <li>It is so nice to have this new blade.</li>
            <li>it shaves clean, no pulls or tugs, unlike the set it replaced.</li>
            <li>However, let&#x27;s be fair, it performs decently and genuine replacement parts are for once at reasonable price compared to what it used to be.</li>
            <li>The new \\&quot;kit\\&quot; fits great and works like new.</li>
            <li>new blades work great; razor cuts like new again.</li>
            <li>SO I WENT BACK TO GILLETTE RAZOR BLADES, GOOD SHAVE,</li>
            <li>quickly</li>
            <li>Easy to install (takes about a minute) and brings the shaver back to performing good as new!  </li>
            <li>The original blades, as old as they are now, still work better than these.</li>
            <li>If your razor is not shaving as smooth as it used to, give replacing the parts a chance first.</li>
            <li>At first it did not look like the parts would fit.  </li>
            <li>however, i have a new philips norelco rotary that does a better job</li>
            <li>I thought that new blades would be better....</li>
            <li>With all the model change every year, the latest Panasonic shaver looks so different from what I have, but I am glad that the parts for those older models are still available.</li>
            <li>I have owned several brands of electric shavers in the past 60 years, and have found Panasonic products to be the best made and most dependable.</li>
            <li>Short and sweet: Replaced old blades, works great but can&#x27;t say better than the old.</li>
            <li>and I certainly plan to use Amazon many more times in the future.</li>
            <li>Fast forward to today, I have used and enjoyed this shaver so much</li>
            <li>I think these parts are well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I have had my ES8017 for nearly 10 years and it started to take more time for a shave.  </li>
            <li>well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it</li>
            <li>Bought this as a backup set for my older ES8066, which is still going strong after 14 years.</li>
            <li>Keeps the old shaver going though and better than spending 100 bucks.</li>
            <li>I drug my feet before buying it, but in the end it was worth it.</li>
            <li>And the price was right.  </li>
            <li>The list printed on the right side of the package includes my ES8068 shaver.</li>
            <li>To keep a razor working like new, it&#x27;s important to replace the foil and blades about every 12 - 18 months.  </li>
            <li>Purchased the replacement parts for this older model electric razor to get more life out of it instead of buying new.  </li>
            <li>This is a hard to fins shaver set for a great razor.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s pretty used.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and this is the first time I&#x27;ve replaced anything in it.  </li>
            <li>- you probably won&#x27;t get it rightthe first time.    </li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t the first time I purchased products through Amazon</li>
            <li>Just be sure that you double and triple check the model numbers before ordering.</li>
            <li>I bought my shaver refurbished many years ago &amp; while it still got the job done, it was taking more passes to clear my minimal facial hair &amp; my skin was becoming irritated.  </li>
            <li>Since then, the original shaver goes strong and it&#x27;s batteries hold a charge and last as if it was brand new.</li>
            <li>Arc4 Razor sharp blades with foil Cuts smoothly and very quickly</li>
            <li>They soon became available at a reasonable price so, naturally, I had to try one.</li>
            <li>The price was very competitive on Amazon (not a plant) vs independent dealers, and most of theirs was aftermarket/non-factory.</li>
            <li>I saw the same combo package elsewhere for as much as 30% more than Amazon&#x27;s price.  </li>
            <li>After much searching I finally found what I needed, the blades AND foil in one package at a better price.  </li>
            <li>This one came in grey, the original color!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The head and foils were smooth, thorough, and quiet.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I was very disappointe and have no idea why they changed to this.</li>
            <li>So if you are affected by credit crunch, do not hesitate to replace the blades and foil instead of the whole shaver.     </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than replacing the raozr.</li>
            <li>Installed it on the shaver and immediately noticed it was much quieter.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect much in the way of service from these people.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast, the product arrived as per description.</li>
            <li>it now works exactly as it did 10 years ago for 30% of a new shaver price..</li>
            <li>would rate it higher; but knew it was time for new shaving heads.</li>
            <li>I could clearly feel a difference right away after replacing the foil and blades.  </li>
            <li>When you detach the head to clean it there are actually 2 pieces in the head.</li>
            <li>the shaver is several years old and still works fine.  </li>
            <li>I used a pair of long-nosed needle nose pliers to grasp the end of each spring to pull it down and away from the plastic attachment point at the top and then pull it off of the bottom.  </li>
            <li>I considered buying a new shaver, but I like this model so much, I went with these replacement parts from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I saved a lot of money over buying a whole new shaver.  </li>
            <li>an older Panasonic wet/dry</li>
            <li>the reviewer who noted the updated blade construction is different, that is true, but I have not had a hair pulling issue with the new blades.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand those that bemoan this product, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Conception is pretty old (my Panasonic might be 11 years old)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several newer Panasonic shavers, all sharp and consistent, but the good old 882 is the workhorse of the group and the one used for travel and rough duty because it can take it</li>
            <li>If your shaver uses this set, rest asssured it will perform well with a new set.</li>
            <li>After changing the parts it shaved like a new razor again.</li>
            <li>Its like a brand new system all over again.</li>
            <li>Debating whether or not to replace the foil/blade or buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li>I had hoped that replacing the blade set and foil would be like having a new shaver again.    </li>
            <li>The razor might as well be new.</li>
            <li>Equipped with new blades and foil, now it&#x27;s like new, and I no longer look like I slept in an alley.</li>
            <li>and it also runs at 13,000 rpm so the new models are not an</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s like I have a new razor again.</li>
            <li>Still my next shaver will be undoubtedly a Lamdash ES-LA93-K or ES-LA92-K ;)</li>
            <li>makes my 15 year old razor perform likenew again!</li>
            <li>No problem with installation, just pull out old set and push new set into place.  </li>
            <li>But the shaver is so old that I don&#x27;t remember how well it shaved when new.</li>
            <li>I buy these for my dad and he said they make his old razor (15 years old) like brand new.  </li>
            <li>Why is the replacement gray in color when the original is black?</li>
            <li>I am still using this product after many years, it might be time to re-ordered because the blade might be getting dull after 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li>Less metal to the blades than the original but works well so far.</li>
            <li>In the early 90s, Pansonic began to introduce their \\&quot;Linear\\&quot; line of shavers.</li>
            <li>I have a model ES8066 that is 12 years old</li>
            <li>As for the color of the plastic foil housing, there is something you can do about that if you still have your old one.  </li>
            <li>My shaver, a Panasonic ES8068 is about 8 years old.</li>
            <li>My razor is eight years old, and until now it was all-original equipment.</li>
            <li>As far as I know, none of them are.</li>
            <li>,  I like my old Panasonic shaver</li>
            <li>I figured was too old to fix.</li>
            <li>You cannot beat the simple construction of the older models.</li>
            <li>The blades just pop off and you push the new ones back into place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to about the same life for this new set.</li>
            <li>Brought back to live</li>
            <li>Great for extending the cutting life of your current set of blades/foil.</li>
            <li>This is unusual as the linear motor never slows down for anything normally.  </li>
            <li>I will buy it again &amp; again as long as they&#x27;re available while my shaver is still functioning mechanically because my only other choice is to spend a significantly larger amount of money for a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At this point you will have new foils in your old housing, but the center blade will still be the old one.  </li>
            <li>Cut my shave time in half... had the original blade waaaaay too long though.</li>
            <li>I have owned my Panasonic Linear Shaver for a very long time and now it shaves like new!</li>
            <li>Yes as one reviewer stated the color is different but what the hay it&#x27;s an old shaver.</li>
            <li>no regrets.</li>
            <li>Adding to this is the fact that the shaver really is not a replacement for a real razor.</li>
            <li>These are hard to find locally and I found them on Amazon easily</li>
            <li>To put your new center blade into the old housing, pop it into the grooves on either end of the housing and reattach the springs with the needle nose pliers.  </li>
            <li>I received exactly what I ordered at a lot less price then was offered through Panasonic itself.  </li>
            <li>Do the same to your new foil housing and you can take the new foils and pop them into your old (black) foil housing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was in brand new condition, as expected, &amp; due to it being new blades &amp; foil, my shaver shaves like it did when it was brand new.</li>
            <li>Will buy this product directly from Panasonic (if possible) next time.</li>
            <li>I managed to replace both annually for the first few years</li>
            <li>I highly recommend replacing the foils and blades if your shaver is over a few years old.</li>
            <li>Naturally the blades were pretty dull.  </li>
            <li>I had this old Panasonic waterproof rechargeable razor for a very long time.</li>
            <li>It took less than 3 minutes to replace the parts and was ready to go.</li>
            <li>The color is grey, mine was black, adds a whole new look to the razor, other than that it seems to work well, but not much different than my old one..</li>
            <li>blade isn&#x27;t sharp as comparing I bought.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver become a new one after I changed foil and blade</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I purchased the ES 882 and was delighted with it&#x27;s performance and speedy shave it provided.</li>

            <li> This combo replacement shaver foil/blade set was purchased at a great price and shipped fast!...</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with a good product at a reasonable price and delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> This item is available as two separate items but the cost is more than the combo pack!</li>
            <li> I am glad they still have these.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit to my old razor.</li>
            <li> Maybe it will work better for you.</li>
            <li> It should work okay, but I found that also replacing this did improve performance.    </li>
            <li> It was still shaving OK but was noisy</li>
            <li> My Pansonic ES8066 is a dinosaur, yet it has wireless charging and still works better than any electric I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> but, I&#x27;m glad I bought these.</li>
            <li> Worked great - saved having to buy a new razor!</li>
            <li> Had high hopes that it would improve my shave greatly -</li>
            <li> I decided to buy a new blade and the shaver works great.</li>
            <li> Yes, the new blades are flimsier than the originals, but they still seem to be doing a great job.    </li>
            <li> This is a great product and make the razor work like new again.</li>
            <li> Works great... much better than the old blades &amp; foil.</li>
            <li> They are also the most comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Not to sound condescending but what can anyone do if the separate blades-type model isn&#x27;t available anymore?!?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say it gives me a better shave, maybe a bit, but it does give me a good shave more quickly</li>
            <li> Very nice and quick delivery, and I&#x27;m very satisfy.</li>
            <li> It was easy to install</li>
            <li> The instructions were easy to follow.</li>
            <li> Researching was easy, received order promptly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relatively easy to replace the blades and foil.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace.</li>
            <li> The battery seemed to still be strong</li>
            <li> Now my shaver works as good as new again and</li>
            <li> Shaver is as good as new now.</li>
            <li> Price was fine.</li>
            <li> I am using them and they work fine.</li>
            <li> Luckily I was able to buy this replacement.</li>
            <li> Original Panasonic  replacement foil and blade works like new, good price.</li>
            <li> These, seen on this page, never disappoint and continue to deliver a close, smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Would recommend the blades if this would fit your shaver.</li>
            <li> Pay attention to which end is which to ensure a smooth re-installation.  </li>
            <li> Still holds a charge and runs as smooth as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This newer blade is all there is available as a replacement blade.</li>
            <li> I could have sworn when I ordered this that it said it would fit the ES8080 model.</li>
            <li> The blades fit but the foil doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Item fit my shaver and performed as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> My Panasonic is about 5 years old now but still holds a good charge.</li>
            <li> Speaking of time, the shipper took it&#x27;s good old time in shipping this item.</li>
            <li> so glad we went this way instead of spending the $$$ to buy a new razor!!!</li>
            <li> All new foils and cutters work great out of the space bubble pack, but time is the real test of these products.</li>
            <li> I assumed it would be the original blade type</li>
            <li> , I recommend you purchase this item to regain your shaver&#x27;s original performance.</li>
            <li> Checked the original specs</li>
            <li> I had to disassemble the original foil, and I thought it was one piece.  </li>
            <li> They are original Panasonic replacement parts</li>
            <li> I had the original blades for 10+ years.</li>
            <li> It is so nice to have this new blade.</li>
            <li> it shaves clean, no pulls or tugs, unlike the set it replaced.</li>
            <li> However, let&#x27;s be fair, it performs decently and genuine replacement parts are for once at reasonable price compared to what it used to be.</li>
            <li> The new \\&quot;kit\\&quot; fits great and works like new.</li>
            <li> new blades work great; razor cuts like new again.</li>
            <li> SO I WENT BACK TO GILLETTE RAZOR BLADES, GOOD SHAVE,</li>
            <li> quickly</li>
            <li> Easy to install (takes about a minute) and brings the shaver back to performing good as new!  </li>
            <li> The original blades, as old as they are now, still work better than these.</li>
            <li> If your razor is not shaving as smooth as it used to, give replacing the parts a chance first.</li>
            <li> At first it did not look like the parts would fit.  </li>
            <li> however, i have a new philips norelco rotary that does a better job</li>
            <li> I thought that new blades would be better....</li>
            <li> With all the model change every year, the latest Panasonic shaver looks so different from what I have, but I am glad that the parts for those older models are still available.</li>
            <li> I have owned several brands of electric shavers in the past 60 years, and have found Panasonic products to be the best made and most dependable.</li>
            <li> Short and sweet: Replaced old blades, works great but can&#x27;t say better than the old.</li>
            <li> and I certainly plan to use Amazon many more times in the future.</li>
            <li> Fast forward to today, I have used and enjoyed this shaver so much</li>
            <li> I think these parts are well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I have had my ES8017 for nearly 10 years and it started to take more time for a shave.  </li>
            <li> well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it</li>
            <li> Bought this as a backup set for my older ES8066, which is still going strong after 14 years.</li>
            <li> Keeps the old shaver going though and better than spending 100 bucks.</li>
            <li> I drug my feet before buying it, but in the end it was worth it.</li>
            <li> And the price was right.  </li>
            <li> The list printed on the right side of the package includes my ES8068 shaver.</li>
            <li> To keep a razor working like new, it&#x27;s important to replace the foil and blades about every 12 - 18 months.  </li>
            <li> Purchased the replacement parts for this older model electric razor to get more life out of it instead of buying new.  </li>
            <li> This is a hard to fins shaver set for a great razor.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s pretty used.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and this is the first time I&#x27;ve replaced anything in it.  </li>
            <li> - you probably won&#x27;t get it rightthe first time.    </li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t the first time I purchased products through Amazon</li>
            <li> Just be sure that you double and triple check the model numbers before ordering.</li>
            <li> I bought my shaver refurbished many years ago &amp; while it still got the job done, it was taking more passes to clear my minimal facial hair &amp; my skin was becoming irritated.  </li>
            <li> Since then, the original shaver goes strong and it&#x27;s batteries hold a charge and last as if it was brand new.</li>
            <li> Arc4 Razor sharp blades with foil Cuts smoothly and very quickly</li>
            <li> They soon became available at a reasonable price so, naturally, I had to try one.</li>
            <li> The price was very competitive on Amazon (not a plant) vs independent dealers, and most of theirs was aftermarket/non-factory.</li>
            <li> I saw the same combo package elsewhere for as much as 30% more than Amazon&#x27;s price.  </li>
            <li> After much searching I finally found what I needed, the blades AND foil in one package at a better price.  </li>
            <li> This one came in grey, the original color!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The head and foils were smooth, thorough, and quiet.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I was very disappointe and have no idea why they changed to this.</li>
            <li> So if you are affected by credit crunch, do not hesitate to replace the blades and foil instead of the whole shaver.     </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than replacing the raozr.</li>
            <li> Installed it on the shaver and immediately noticed it was much quieter.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect much in the way of service from these people.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, the product arrived as per description.</li>
            <li> it now works exactly as it did 10 years ago for 30% of a new shaver price..</li>
            <li> would rate it higher; but knew it was time for new shaving heads.</li>
            <li> I could clearly feel a difference right away after replacing the foil and blades.  </li>
            <li> When you detach the head to clean it there are actually 2 pieces in the head.</li>
            <li> the shaver is several years old and still works fine.  </li>
            <li> I used a pair of long-nosed needle nose pliers to grasp the end of each spring to pull it down and away from the plastic attachment point at the top and then pull it off of the bottom.  </li>
            <li> I considered buying a new shaver, but I like this model so much, I went with these replacement parts from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I saved a lot of money over buying a whole new shaver.  </li>
            <li> an older Panasonic wet/dry</li>
            <li> the reviewer who noted the updated blade construction is different, that is true, but I have not had a hair pulling issue with the new blades.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand those that bemoan this product, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Conception is pretty old (my Panasonic might be 11 years old)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several newer Panasonic shavers, all sharp and consistent, but the good old 882 is the workhorse of the group and the one used for travel and rough duty because it can take it</li>
            <li> If your shaver uses this set, rest asssured it will perform well with a new set.</li>
            <li> After changing the parts it shaved like a new razor again.</li>
            <li> Its like a brand new system all over again.</li>
            <li> Debating whether or not to replace the foil/blade or buy a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I had hoped that replacing the blade set and foil would be like having a new shaver again.    </li>
            <li> The razor might as well be new.</li>
            <li> Equipped with new blades and foil, now it&#x27;s like new, and I no longer look like I slept in an alley.</li>
            <li> and it also runs at 13,000 rpm so the new models are not an</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s like I have a new razor again.</li>
            <li> Still my next shaver will be undoubtedly a Lamdash ES-LA93-K or ES-LA92-K ;)</li>
            <li> makes my 15 year old razor perform likenew again!</li>
            <li> No problem with installation, just pull out old set and push new set into place.  </li>
            <li> But the shaver is so old that I don&#x27;t remember how well it shaved when new.</li>
            <li> I buy these for my dad and he said they make his old razor (15 years old) like brand new.  </li>
            <li> Why is the replacement gray in color when the original is black?</li>
            <li> I am still using this product after many years, it might be time to re-ordered because the blade might be getting dull after 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;Long</li>
            <li> Less metal to the blades than the original but works well so far.</li>
            <li> In the early 90s, Pansonic began to introduce their \\&quot;Linear\\&quot; line of shavers.</li>
            <li> I have a model ES8066 that is 12 years old</li>
            <li> As for the color of the plastic foil housing, there is something you can do about that if you still have your old one.  </li>
            <li> My shaver, a Panasonic ES8068 is about 8 years old.</li>
            <li> My razor is eight years old, and until now it was all-original equipment.</li>
            <li> As far as I know, none of them are.</li>
            <li> ,  I like my old Panasonic shaver</li>
            <li> I figured was too old to fix.</li>
            <li> You cannot beat the simple construction of the older models.</li>
            <li> The blades just pop off and you push the new ones back into place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to about the same life for this new set.</li>
            <li> Brought back to live</li>
            <li> Great for extending the cutting life of your current set of blades/foil.</li>
            <li> This is unusual as the linear motor never slows down for anything normally.  </li>
            <li> I will buy it again &amp; again as long as they&#x27;re available while my shaver is still functioning mechanically because my only other choice is to spend a significantly larger amount of money for a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At this point you will have new foils in your old housing, but the center blade will still be the old one.  </li>
            <li> Cut my shave time in half... had the original blade waaaaay too long though.</li>
            <li> I have owned my Panasonic Linear Shaver for a very long time and now it shaves like new!</li>
            <li> Yes as one reviewer stated the color is different but what the hay it&#x27;s an old shaver.</li>
            <li> no regrets.</li>
            <li> Adding to this is the fact that the shaver really is not a replacement for a real razor.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find locally and I found them on Amazon easily</li>
            <li> To put your new center blade into the old housing, pop it into the grooves on either end of the housing and reattach the springs with the needle nose pliers.  </li>
            <li> I received exactly what I ordered at a lot less price then was offered through Panasonic itself.  </li>
            <li> Do the same to your new foil housing and you can take the new foils and pop them into your old (black) foil housing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was in brand new condition, as expected, &amp; due to it being new blades &amp; foil, my shaver shaves like it did when it was brand new.</li>
            <li> Will buy this product directly from Panasonic (if possible) next time.</li>
            <li> I managed to replace both annually for the first few years</li>
            <li> I highly recommend replacing the foils and blades if your shaver is over a few years old.</li>
            <li> Naturally the blades were pretty dull.  </li>
            <li> I had this old Panasonic waterproof rechargeable razor for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It took less than 3 minutes to replace the parts and was ready to go.</li>
            <li> The color is grey, mine was black, adds a whole new look to the razor, other than that it seems to work well, but not much different than my old one..</li>
            <li> blade isn&#x27;t sharp as comparing I bought.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver become a new one after I changed foil and blade</li>
            <li> Sometimes hard to find the right set.</li>
            <li> My shaver is black and the new, gray foil obviously a replacement.  </li>
            <li> My old Panasonic ES8036 shaver was really starting to bog down during the morning shave.  </li>
            <li> Instead of flat blades that stand vertically, these are flat strips bent into arches.</li>
            <li> I use my Panasonic shaver to trim it down to a length that&#x27;s easier to shave and then use the old Mach 3 with shaving gel.</li>
            <li> i buy direct  from remington-price is less and they ship</li>
            <li> bought an LF51 to see if the new versions are any better, but was disappointed by the predominantly plastic construction.</li>
            <li> There 4 springs in the center blade assembly, but you need only be concerned with the ones at each end.  </li>
            <li> I should have done this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really been putting off buying a new foil and blades for it because frankly, the shaver was expensive to start with.</li>
            <li> These fit my Panasonic ES8016 perfectly down to the same grey color &amp; made the shave less irritating.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers note, Panasonic went cheaper with these as they&#x27;re not individual blades as they used to be.  </li>
            <li> I had no idea how dull the old cutter/blade was until I replaced it, a BIG difference.</li>
            <li> Switching out the center blade in the foil housing is a little more complicated.  </li>
            <li> The color is different (gray instead of black) but that doesn&#x27;t matter to me &amp; does not affect performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is not performing like it used to even though it&#x27;s still functioning properly, &amp; you haven&#x27;t previously changed the foil &amp; blades</li>
            <li> As a result of the redesign, they are much much more prone to pulling whiskers when shaving... painful.  </li>
            <li> not much to say.  </li>
            <li> At this point you push the center blade all the way up, applying some lateral pressure to get it out of its grooved track and then pop it out.  </li>
            <li> Do this in an area with plenty of lighting and minimal clutter in case</li>
            <li> My ES8066 has never leaked and I always wet shave with it.</li>
            <li> I received the product and it works as expected.  </li>
            <li> but I thought I checked carefully.</li>
            <li> i got tired of shaving with a double-edge razor every day, so figured it was time to bring back the old electric friend.</li>
            <li> I had not changed the blades because they were hard to find at local stores, so I actually bought a Braun a few years ago and it only lasted about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> Stay sharp for me for roughly a year, then I replace it.</li>
            <li> However when I first saw the foil I thought that I had received the wrong one.</li>
            <li> The last set worked well for about three years until finally a small hole opened in the foil.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was wrong in scoffing at all of the folks who complained about the light gray color of the replacement foil.  </li>
            <li> The picture showed the black version which I&#x27;ve been coping with for years, due to price and availability.</li>
            <li> My Panasonic linear electric shaver was to the point that the blades were rather dull and I needed to replace the entire shaver or the blades.</li>
            <li> I went back to the Panasonic, which was really dull after about 8 years of use.</li>
            <li> AT LEAST 3 TIMES PRIOR TO THIS SET.</li>
            <li> and push in and down to release the foil.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp and fits both of my Shaves.  </li>
            <li> Closer shave and less razor burn.</li>
            <li> The picture online showed black plastic.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> - one has a little notch.  </li>
            <li> Way past due.</li>
            <li> As OEM equipment, there is little chance of it not working.</li>
            <li> My shaves got much worse this year, so I finally browsed on line &amp; found these replacements at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> the motor doesn&#x27;t even begin to slow down.  </li>
            <li> I never felt like the new blade set and foil were cutting as close as the shaver had when it was newer.</li>
            <li> I have had Braun, Remington, Norelco shavers in the past.</li>
            <li> There is the hard gray plastic head, and then if you look on the side of the head, there is a gray rubber V-shape with small protruding dots.</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding replacements</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize just how BAD my shaver had gotten over the years, as it&#x27;s been at least a few years since I last replaced the blades and foil.  </li>
            <li> I was about to go out and buy another one when I got this idea, definitely prompted by this economy, that maybe I should just look into replacing the cutting parts.</li>
            <li> I honestly do not notice the difference.</li>
            <li> I tested the replacement blade and foil on a four day beard (and I have thick hairs) and not a pull or tug was felt.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it was not like having a new shaver again.     </li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s a little too expensive for what it is but that won&#x27;t affect my choice about whether to buy this again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find this combo pack, props to Amazon for carrying it!  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been pondering purchasing this set, do it, you won&#x27;t be sorry in the least.</li>
            <li> GOT TIRED OF CUTS.</li>
            <li> Turns out that is not a good thing!</li>
            <li> For a couple of years now, after shaving with my electric, my face looked like a hobo&#x27;s after a three-day drunk.</li>
            <li> That movable head also has a lot of plastic movable parts that can fail.</li>
            <li> so what could be wrong with this?  </li>
            <li> works great-easy to install-lasts quite a while-pretty expensive here-</li>
            <li> Disappointed by Amazon&#x27;s advertising.  </li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> $30 for routine maintenance is insulting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just what I needed.  Very sharp and fits both of my Shaves.  And the price was right.  Cound not beat it.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I am glad they still have these. With all the model change every year, the latest Panasonic shaver looks so different from what I have, but I am glad that the parts for those older models are still available.</li>
            <li> not much to say.  I needed replacement blades for my electric razor (Panasonic) and I got what I ordered when I order them.  Good service.  I&#x27;ll use them again.</li>
            <li> In the early 90s, Pansonic began to introduce their \\&quot;Linear\\&quot; line of shavers. They soon became available at a reasonable price so, naturally, I had to try one. I&#x27;ve used Brauns, Remmington-USA made, and the Panasonics. I purchased the ES 882 and was delighted with it&#x27;s performance and speedy shave it provided. The head and foils were smooth, thorough, and quiet. Since then, the original shaver goes strong and it&#x27;s batteries hold a charge and last as if it was brand new. I&#x27;ve never had the case apart except for cleaning. Fast forward to today, I have used and enjoyed this shaver so much, I have ordered my next set of blades and foil. These, seen on this page, never disappoint and continue to deliver a close, smooth shave. I&#x27;ve used several newer Panasonic shavers, all sharp and consistent, but the good old 882 is the workhorse of the group and the one used for travel and rough duty because it can take it and so do the blades and foil. If your shaver uses this set, rest asssured it will perform well with a new set. I also use the Remmington shaver saver spray. It lubes and sharpens the entire head. It can be used once a week with amazing results. Great for extending the cutting life of your current set of blades/foil. If you&#x27;ve been pondering purchasing this set, do it, you won&#x27;t be sorry in the least.</li>
            <li> Price was fine. Had high hopes that it would improve my shave greatly - just OK!</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding replacements this made it a lot easier Thanks</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Less metal to the blades than the original but works well so far.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit to my old razor. After changing the parts it shaved like a new razor again. No snags or pulls. It took less than 3 minutes to replace the parts and was ready to go. A little pricey but that&#x27;s the razor business.</li>
            <li> I had this Panasonic electric shaver for years. This replacement works perfect. Its like a brand new system all over again. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a hard to fins shaver set for a great razor. In the walkin retail stores this product goes for twice what I was charged. Shipping, communication and entire transaction was an A++ affair.</li>
            <li> This product worked perfectly.  It was easy to install and I use it every day with no problems.  The instructions were easy to follow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for over 5 years and have never replaced the blades or screen.  Naturally the blades were pretty dull.  I considered buying a new shaver, but I like this model so much, I went with these replacement parts from Amazon.  The parts installed very easily and my shaver is \\&quot;brand new\\&quot; again.  I think these parts are well worth the money.  And, as always Amazon&#x27;s order fullfilment and shipping are Outstanding!!</li>
            <li> I looked closely at this and could not tell a design difference between the blade that came with my razor and this one. It is so nice to have this new blade. Cut my shave time in half... had the original blade waaaaay too long though. This one is quieter and smoother. Closer shave and less razor burn.</li>
            <li> I have had my ES8017 for nearly 10 years and it started to take more time for a shave.  By adding the kit of blades &amp; foil (WE9079P) it now works exactly as it did 10 years ago for 30% of a new shaver price..</li>
            <li> My Panasonic rechargeable shaver has been the best one I&#x27;ve owned and this replacement set makes it shave like new again.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> This item works great in my ES8068. I had worn a hole in the foil on my shaver so that&#x27;s pretty used. The new \\&quot;kit\\&quot; fits great and works like new. I had no idea how dull the old cutter/blade was until I replaced it, a BIG difference. Yes as one reviewer stated the color is different but what the hay it&#x27;s an old shaver. I&#x27;m just proud to be able to get parts, and factory at that. The price was very competitive on Amazon (not a plant) vs independent dealers, and most of theirs was aftermarket/non-factory.I can&#x27;t understand those that bemoan this product, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this replacement set online made by Panasonic. I assumed it would be the original blade type but it isn&#x27;t. When I received it, upon opening the package, I immediately noticed that the blades were different. Instead of flat blades that stand vertically, these are flat strips bent into arches. Instead of vertical, they are horizontal. As a result of the redesign, they are much much more prone to pulling whiskers when shaving... painful.  I was very disappointe and have no idea why they changed to this. The original blades, as old as they are now, still work better than these.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this replacement combo for my ES8068 electric shaver. The list printed on the right side of the package includes my ES8068 shaver. When it arrived I cut them out of the package but then I noticed the blades where not like the originals. The package has my model listed. I then go to the Panasonic.com website for product information. I find the specs sheet for my ES8068 electric shaver and the replacement inner blade is WES9070P not the WES9079P. The model numbers listed on the packages don&#x27;t coincide with the spec sheets at Panasonic. I thought the replacements were just lower in quality and thoght nothing of it because my model is listed there on the package. Will Amazon take them back if I have already used them?</li>
            <li> This item fit very well in my Panasonic shaver and works awesome, the shave is a lot smother that the factory&#x27;s original.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely i would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Panasonic shavers to me are great electric shavers. I have had Braun, Remington, Norelco shavers in the past. I am very pleased with the Panasonic shavers. This blade frame and screen package I ordered was a deal at amazon too.</li>
            <li> Debating whether or not to replace the foil/blade or buy a new shaver. I decided to buy a new blade and the shaver works great.</li>
            <li> Product is working great for my husband. Researching was easy, received order promptly. Would recommend the blades if this would fit your shaver. Would recommend Amazon&#x27;s service.</li>
            <li> My Panasonic linear electric shaver was to the point that the blades were rather dull and I needed to replace the entire shaver or the blades. The battery seemed to still be strong so I opted to replace just the blades and the foil. I had hoped that replacing the blade set and foil would be like having a new shaver again.    It&#x27;s relatively easy to replace the blades and foil. The blades just pop off and you push the new ones back into place. However when I first saw the foil I thought that I had received the wrong one. When you detach the head to clean it there are actually 2 pieces in the head. There is the hard gray plastic head, and then if you look on the side of the head, there is a gray rubber V-shape with small protruding dots. When you pull up on that rubber V-shape on both sides, the foil will detach from the head.    I&#x27;ve used the replacement blade set and foil for a year now. I never felt like the new blade set and foil were cutting as close as the shaver had when it was newer. It felt like maybe one of the blades wasn&#x27;t as close to the foil as it used to be. I was disappointed that it was not like having a new shaver again.     Maybe it will work better for you.</li>
            <li> Works as described. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Conception is pretty old (my Panasonic might be 11 years old) so I do not expect miracles. However, let&#x27;s be fair, it performs decently and genuine replacement parts are for once at reasonable price compared to what it used to be. So if you are affected by credit crunch, do not hesitate to replace the blades and foil instead of the whole shaver.     Still my next shaver will be undoubtedly a Lamdash ES-LA93-K or ES-LA92-K ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the replacement blades and foil for about a week now.  I have a model ES8066 that is 12 years old and this is the first time I&#x27;ve replaced anything in it.  Yes, the new blades are flimsier than the originals, but they still seem to be doing a great job.    As for the color of the plastic foil housing, there is something you can do about that if you still have your old one.  Look at the ends of the foil housing and and you will 2 rectangular holes on either end.  Use a push pin or toothpick, etc. and push in and down to release the foil.  You&#x27;ll need to do this in all 4 holes and then you can pop out both foils.  Do the same to your new foil housing and you can take the new foils and pop them into your old (black) foil housing.  At this point you will have new foils in your old housing, but the center blade will still be the old one.  It should work okay, but I found that also replacing this did improve performance.    *** Do not attempt the following if you are not mechanically inclined ***    Switching out the center blade in the foil housing is a little more complicated.  There 4 springs in the center blade assembly, but you need only be concerned with the ones at each end.  I used a pair of long-nosed needle nose pliers to grasp the end of each spring to pull it down and away from the plastic attachment point at the top and then pull it off of the bottom.  At this point you push the center blade all the way up, applying some lateral pressure to get it out of its grooved track and then pop it out.  Note that the two ends of the blade assembly are not entirely identical - one has a little notch.  Pay attention to which end is which to ensure a smooth re-installation.  To put your new center blade into the old housing, pop it into the grooves on either end of the housing and reattach the springs with the needle nose pliers.  Do this in an area with plenty of lighting and minimal clutter in case the springs go flying - you probably won&#x27;t get it rightthe first time.    I have to admit that I was wrong in scoffing at all of the folks who complained about the light gray color of the replacement foil.  I do prefer the original black/dark gray and it works great now that it has been refurbished.    Good luck!</li>
            <li> My Panasonic is about 5 years old now but still holds a good charge. I was about to go out and buy another one when I got this idea, definitely prompted by this economy, that maybe I should just look into replacing the cutting parts. What a difference! I should have done this a long time ago. If your razor is not shaving as smooth as it used to, give replacing the parts a chance first. You can save a lot of money and do some good by not throwing more electronic trash into the ground.</li>
            <li> I received exactly what I ordered at a lot less price then was offered through Panasonic itself.  This wasn&#x27;t the first time I purchased products through Amazon and I certainly plan to use Amazon many more times in the future.</li>
            <li> I buy these for my dad and he said they make his old razor (15 years old) like brand new.  Much cheaper than replacing the raozr.</li>
            <li> I received the foil and blade set promptly and it fit my shaver perfectly.  The last set worked well for about three years until finally a small hole opened in the foil.  I&#x27;m looking forward to about the same life for this new set.</li>
            <li> i got tired of shaving with a double-edge razor every day, so figured it was time to bring back the old electric friend. the blades needed to be replaced so i got this set. it shaves clean, no pulls or tugs, unlike the set it replaced. no regrets. great product. well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t replaced my blades or foil in about 5 years.  As I recall the instruction manual, it advised replacing blades every 6 months &amp; foil annually.  I managed to replace both annually for the first few years I owned this shaver but then slacked off.  My shaves got much worse this year, so I finally browsed on line &amp; found these replacements at Amazon.  The improvement in closeness &amp; speed of shave was immediate.  I saw the same combo package elsewhere for as much as 30% more than Amazon&#x27;s price.  IMHO this is a good product at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> This was shipped and received promptly &amp; as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was in brand new condition, as expected, &amp; due to it being new blades &amp; foil, my shaver shaves like it did when it was brand new. The color is different (gray instead of black) but that doesn&#x27;t matter to me &amp; does not affect performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a little too expensive for what it is but that won&#x27;t affect my choice about whether to buy this again. I will buy it again &amp; again as long as they&#x27;re available while my shaver is still functioning mechanically because my only other choice is to spend a significantly larger amount of money for a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have this shaver &amp; have always liked how it shaved but it is not performing like it used to even though it&#x27;s still functioning properly, &amp; you haven&#x27;t previously changed the foil &amp; blades, I recommend you purchase this item to regain your shaver&#x27;s original performance.</li>
            <li> My shaver, a Panasonic ES8068 is about 8 years old. It was still shaving OK but was noisy and I decided to replace the blades and foil.  At the local shaver shop this would have cost over $70 so I put it off.  I then saw this offer on Amazon,  and since I was planning to spend a couple of weeks in the USA,  ordered it to be delivered to our accommodation in the US.  Ordered on Thursday it arrived on the following Tuesday.  Installed it on the shaver and immediately noticed it was much quieter.  I can&#x27;t really say it gives me a better shave, maybe a bit, but it does give me a good shave more quickly and so the batteries last longer. I am very pleased with a good product at a reasonable price and delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> I have used my Panasonic linear shaver for about 12 years and have only replaced the foil and blades twice.</li>
            <li> Worked great - saved having to buy a new razor!</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic ES8036 shaver was really starting to bog down during the morning shave.  This is unusual as the linear motor never slows down for anything normally.  I&#x27;ve had this shaver for over 6 years now and I think I remember changing the blades one time, but never the foil.  After much searching I finally found what I needed, the blades AND foil in one package at a better price.  Now my shaver works as good as new again and the motor doesn&#x27;t even begin to slow down.  I should have replaced these parts years ago!  I saved a lot of money over buying a whole new shaver.  I highly recommend replacing the foils and blades if your shaver is over a few years old.</li>
            <li> I had this old Panasonic waterproof rechargeable razor for a very long time. I had not changed the blades because they were hard to find at local stores, so I actually bought a Braun a few years ago and it only lasted about a year and a half. I gave up on it, having the same problems finding replacement blades and screens. I went back to the Panasonic, which was really dull after about 8 years of use. I finally found replacement parts here and they are working great. The razor might as well be new. The only issue it has now is that the charge only lasts for about 5 days or so.</li>
            <li> JUST A GREAT SHAVING SYSTEM. I HAVE HAD THIS SHAVER FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND HAVE REPLACED THE BLADES AT LEAST 3 TIMES PRIOR TO THIS SET. i COULD NOT FIND THE REPLACEMENTS FOR QUITE A WHILE SO I WENT BACK TO GILLETTE RAZOR BLADES, GOOD SHAVE, GOT TIRED OF CUTS.</li>
            <li> This is oem stuff and behaves as such. All new foils and cutters work great out of the space bubble pack, but time is the real test of these products. Speaking of time, the shipper took it&#x27;s good old time in shipping this item. Don&#x27;t expect much in the way of service from these people.</li>
            <li> My razor is eight years old, and until now it was all-original equipment. Turns out that is not a good thing! For a couple of years now, after shaving with my electric, my face looked like a hobo&#x27;s after a three-day drunk. Equipped with new blades and foil, now it&#x27;s like new, and I no longer look like I slept in an alley.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Panasonic shaver for a couple of years. I&#x27;ve really been putting off buying a new foil and blades for it because frankly, the shaver was expensive to start with. $30 for routine maintenance is insulting. Adding to this is the fact that the shaver really is not a replacement for a real razor. As far as I know, none of them are. They are great supplemental shaving tools and they might get you by in a jam but I would never try to shave with this thing and go to work or something without finishing the shave with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use my Panasonic shaver to trim it down to a length that&#x27;s easier to shave and then use the old Mach 3 with shaving gel. I&#x27;ll probably buy one replacement set just because the shaver is still good and the battery still holds a great charge but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy another electric.</li>
            <li> Well made and good quality.  fits perfect into my Panasonic shaver.  No problem with installation, just pull out old set and push new set into place.  Pricey but worth it,  I like my old Panasonic shaver and this is what it needed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my brother.  It was the only place I could find it.  Thankgod for amazon.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a backup set for my older ES8066, which is still going strong after 14 years. Still holds a charge and runs as smooth as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought an LF51 to see if the new versions are any better, but was disappointed by the predominantly plastic construction. That movable head also has a lot of plastic movable parts that can fail. You cannot beat the simple construction of the older models. My ES8066 has never leaked and I always wet shave with it. Checked the original specs and it also runs at 13,000 rpm so the new models are not an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the reviewer who noted the updated blade construction is different, that is true, but I have not had a hair pulling issue with the new blades. I tested the replacement blade and foil on a four day beard (and I have thick hairs) and not a pull or tug was felt.</li>
            <li> makes my 15 year old razor perform likenew again!</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase. Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> item arrived on time.  color was slightly different than description, but not a big deal.  new blades work great; razor cuts like new again.</li>
            <li> This is the third replacement shaver foil and blade set I have purchased for my Panasonic shaver. Each replacement performed well for the two years it was designed to last. I have owned several brands of electric shavers in the past 60 years, and have found Panasonic products to be the best made and most dependable. They are also the most comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Short and sweet: Replaced old blades, works great but can&#x27;t say better than the old. But the shaver is so old that I don&#x27;t remember how well it shaved when new. Keeps the old shaver going though and better than spending 100 bucks.</li>
            <li> I received the product and it works as expected.  The picture online showed black plastic.  The product received is gray plastic.  A cosmetic difference.  My shaver is black and the new, gray foil obviously a replacement.  Disappointed by Amazon&#x27;s advertising.  Will buy this product directly from Panasonic (if possible) next time.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality replacement that fits perfectly.  I would recommend this as a replacement set.  Sometimes hard to find the right set.</li>
            <li> would rate it higher; but knew it was time for new shaving heads. Way past due. Need to put a date on the calendar to remember when it&#x27;s time to change them.</li>
            <li> This item is available as two separate items but the cost is more than the combo pack! It&#x27;s hard to find this combo pack, props to Amazon for carrying it!  Like other reviewers note, Panasonic went cheaper with these as they&#x27;re not individual blades as they used to be.  It&#x27;s a stamped sheet that is bent into a \\&quot;U\\&quot; shape forming openings that are the blades.  It does shave well, no complaints.   Not to sound condescending but what can anyone do if the separate blades-type model isn&#x27;t available anymore?!? I read the complaints about this before.   This newer blade is all there is available as a replacement blade. I&#x27;d give it a B+ where the separate blades were an A.   That said, if you need a blade for your Panasonic shaver, this works well and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement blades</li>
            <li> Brought back to live an older Panasonic wet/dry I figured was too old to fix.</li>
            <li> Purchased the replacement parts for this older model electric razor to get more life out of it instead of buying new.  Works great now, so glad we went this way instead of spending the $$$ to buy a new razor!!!</li>
            <li> To keep a razor working like new, it&#x27;s important to replace the foil and blades about every 12 - 18 months.  This is a great product and make the razor work like new again.</li>
            <li> At first it did not look like the parts would fit.  I had to disassemble the original foil, and I thought it was one piece.  Shaver is as good as new now.</li>
            <li> I bought Panasonic shaver 7 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I dropped shaver 1 month ago, so foil was cracked.&lt;br /&gt;The blade isn&#x27;t sharp as comparing I bought.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver become a new one after I changed foil and blade</li>
            <li> I have bought this combo before and they always work great. No problem whatsoever. Stay sharp for me for roughly a year, then I replace it.</li>
            <li> I could have sworn when I ordered this that it said it would fit the ES8080 model. It doesn&#x27;t. The blades fit but the foil doesn&#x27;t. Probably my mistake but I thought I checked carefully. The current ad for this product does not list the ES8080 as compatible. Just be sure that you double and triple check the model numbers before ordering.</li>
            <li> These are hard to find locally and I found them on Amazon easily and I found them about $10 cheaper than the last time that I bought them.  They are original Panasonic replacement parts so what could be wrong with this?  I am using them and they work fine.</li>
            <li> works great-easy to install-lasts quite a while-pretty expensive here-i buy direct  from remington-price is less and they ship&lt;br /&gt;very quickly</li>
            <li> The color is grey, mine was black, adds a whole new look to the razor, other than that it seems to work well, but not much different than my old one.. I have seen them when you have a choice of blk or gry.</li>
            <li> blades are great replacement. the shaver is several years old and still works fine.  however, i have a new philips norelco rotary that does a better job so i use my panasonic as a back up. not that i should ever need it.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, the product arrived as per description. I am still using this product after many years, it might be time to re-ordered because the blade might be getting dull after 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting product.</li>
            <li> My Pansonic ES8066 is a dinosaur, yet it has wireless charging and still works better than any electric I&#x27;ve tried.  Blades fit perfect and were a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace. Works great... much better than the old blades &amp; foil. Yaaay!</li>
            <li> Item fit my shaver and performed as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would recommend this item to anyone needing a replacement shaver foil and cutter models as listed.</li>
            <li> Original Panasonic  replacement foil and blade works like new, good price. The best part replacement I found. Panasonic WES 9079P</li>
            <li> Easy to install (takes about a minute) and brings the shaver back to performing good as new!  I didn&#x27;t realize just how BAD my shaver had gotten over the years, as it&#x27;s been at least a few years since I last replaced the blades and foil.  Guess I&#x27;ll be keeping this shaver for quite a while yet.</li>
            <li> I have owned my Panasonic Linear Shaver for a very long time and now it shaves like new! This combo replacement shaver foil/blade set was purchased at a great price and shipped fast!...</li>
            <li> panasonic Replacement Foil and Blades for The Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc4/ES-LA93-S Arc4 Razor sharp blades with foil Cuts smoothly and very quickly without Tearing your face off very good quality at a decent price and Delivered promptly by Amzon.com</li>
            <li> I dropped my razor and broke the plastic surrounding the foil. Luckily I was able to buy this replacement. I drug my feet before buying it, but in the end it was worth it. Now it&#x27;s like I have a new razor again.</li>
            <li> might not be actual panasonic parts?</li>
            <li> As OEM equipment, there is little chance of it not working. The picture showed the black version which I&#x27;ve been coping with for years, due to price and availability. This one came in grey, the original color! It all matches! Happy.</li>
            <li> Very nice and quick delivery, and I&#x27;m very satisfy.</li>
            <li> These fit my Panasonic ES8016 perfectly down to the same grey color &amp; made the shave less irritating.  I bought my shaver refurbished many years ago &amp; while it still got the job done, it was taking more passes to clear my minimal facial hair &amp; my skin was becoming irritated.  I could clearly feel a difference right away after replacing the foil and blades.  Nothing earth shattering but, I&#x27;m glad I bought these.</li>
            <li> Why is the replacement gray in color when the original is black? I had the original blades for 10+ years. I thought that new blades would be better.... I honestly do not notice the difference.</li>
