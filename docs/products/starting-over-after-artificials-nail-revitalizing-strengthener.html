            <li>My nails split and peeled even more when using.</li>
            <li>Pretty good product -</li>
            <li>for the firt time in my life I have long nails of my own!!!</li>
            <li>Once again they are strong and healthy.  </li>
            <li>and I have been using it since periodically just to keep my nails healthy and strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve almost worked my way through a whole bottle (tried to give it a fair test).</li>
            <li>This helps get them strong.</li>
            <li>Someone actually told me that I had beautiful, healthy nails and that she was jealous because they looked like the type of nails that I could grow out a little and get a mani and have them be picture perfect.</li>
            <li>The nurse at my dermatologist recomeneded it  and I am finally seeing strong healthy nails which makes me feel so good</li>
            <li>Thanks for making such a great product, Salon Sciences!!</li>
            <li>special re rejuvenating my nails which had been damaged from lacquer applications.</li>
            <li>Had taken off acrylics a couple months ago and my nails were not growing out as quick as before and ends just looked peeled.</li>
            <li>This went on good and smooth but it dried out my nails.  </li>
            <li>so I constantly try to smooth them out with my teeth and shear off the top split layer.</li>
            <li>I used it after taking my acrylics off and saw mimprovement, but what  amazes me is how my new nails are now strong and grow</li>
            <li>went to an expensive spa today and the manicurist exclaimed how wonderful they looked.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to grow my nails out, after one months use of this product I actually do have nails.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helping!</li>
            <li>You really need to use it as directed (1-2 coats on the first application, then add on one additional coat every other day; remove and repeat after 1 week), but you&#x27;ll get amazing results.</li>
            <li>I started using this product and now my nails don&#x27;t break and they are strong and long.</li>
            <li>This product is helping after trying 3 other top name brand product.</li>
            <li>I end up packing on layers(sometimes more than 3coats on 1 day instead of adding every other day)</li>
            <li>I finally switched to the product that I was recommend to use and my nails are finally growing out strong and much quicker!</li>
            <li>This helped keep my nails looking decent as they recovered from a decade of damage by acrylics.  </li>
            <li>This product will give you instant improvement since it smooths and seals any splits or cracks in the nail, and then more lasting effects because the new nail growth will be stronger and healthier.</li>
            <li>This product dries to a smooth, clear, super high-shine finish (I know some products I&#x27;ve tried previously dried to a matte finish that looked like I just had bare nails).</li>
            <li>I use it every other day faithfully and my nails are longer and stronger than they ever have been my whole life!!!</li>
            <li>but after going through the entire bottle - I can&#x27;t say that i works any better that a product I purchased at WalMart for half the price.</li>
            <li>My nails are so soft and they break and crack all the time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get manicures, trim my cuticles, or paint my nails frequently</li>
            <li>I had acrylic nails for over 20 years because my own nails had always been so paper thin and would never grow.  </li>
            <li>After just 2 weeks, I could tell my nails are much stronger and slowly starting to grow back.</li>
            <li>However, you must use it consistently and apply every other day as directed.</li>
            <li>starting over again on my natural nails.  </li>
            <li>My natural nails were a hot mess after they came off!  </li>
            <li>but my nails tended to be in constant rough shape due to a combo of health issues and super frequent hand-washing.</li>
            <li>I still use it once or twice each month when I don&#x27;t feel like actually having color but don&#x27;t want &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; nails or regular clear nail polish.</li>

            <li> I find that other clear polishes work just as well while you are waiting for your nails to grow out.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried many products by a top nail brand...and was mostly left disappointed by little/no results or worse--</li>
            <li> having my nails dry out even further.</li>
            <li> This really keeps my natural nails hard and firm.</li>
            <li> She called two other nail techs over who did the same.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this product to be much different from other clear-coat nail polishes I have used, and I don&#x27;t think it did anything</li>
            <li> My nails were constantly dry, peeling, splitting, and cracking before I tried this.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s been nearly a year since I stopped wearing artificial nails, I still use this product as a base coat under my nail polish to help keep them healthy and strong.  </li>
            <li> They were paper thin, peeling, and would practically break if I even looked at them funny.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this again for the money I spent</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my nails, seems to thin when applied</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when you use two coats, like instructed, they seem to take forever to dry.</li>
            <li> I received this today and when I opened the package, half the bottle was empty because it had spilled in the box.  </li>
            <li> Seriously gave me my nails back!</li>
            <li> I tried this because my nails were pretty thin and weak from an at-home gel manicure.</li>
            <li> I wish I was exaggerating when I say you have to wait at least an hour for it to dry if you put on two coats and then try to follow with a nail polish.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> After artificial nail ruined my natural nails, this did bring them back slowly</li>
            <li> I may update this review later but disappointed so far.</li>
            <li> My nails are still weak and peeling, and it takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> I hard worn atrifical nails for years and my nails were a mess .</li>
            <li> There was very little pay-off (actually none) for an inconvenient product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as thick as what I purchased in the store</li>
            <li> I got my first bottle after a bad infection from artificial nails.</li>
            <li> My nails were so damaged and weak.</li>
            <li> I am trying to get through a very rough time with my fingernails, terrible peeling and such.</li>
            <li> I have thin weak nails.</li>
            <li> .After months of applying &amp;#34;S.O.A.A.&amp;#34; my nails were still very weak and rubbery .....not to mention they were growing out very slowly.</li>
            <li> Given that, if you want a clear, fast-drying nail polish, this isn&#x27;t all that terrible.</li>
            <li> Then I go get fake nails to stop myself.</li>
            <li> Then they look like even worse HELL!</li>
            <li> I knew my nails would be shot after I took the fake ones off, but this did make a difference.</li>
            <li> After a year of having shellac, it made my nails very thin and brittle.</li>
            <li> Brittle, peeling, breaking and plain ugly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had artificial nails but try telling that to my fingernails!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had gel nails for over a year now, took them off 3 weeks ago and they were horrible.</li>

            <li> Pretty good product - but after going through the entire bottle - I can&#x27;t say that i works any better that a product I purchased at WalMart for half the price. It DOES work however.</li>
            <li> After a year of having shellac, it made my nails very thin and brittle. So I decided to try this product. After just 2 weeks, I could tell my nails are much stronger and slowly starting to grow back. However, you must use it consistently and apply every other day as directed. I also added cuticle oil to my regimen, which seemed to help as well.</li>
            <li> I hard worn atrifical nails for years and my nails were a mess . I have been using this for three months now every day.The nurse at my dermatologist recomeneded it  and I am finally seeing strong healthy nails which makes me feel so good</li>
            <li> My nails have always chipped and split layers so I constantly try to smooth them out with my teeth and shear off the top split layer. You know what I&#x27;m talking about. Then it becomes a habit. Then I wind up nibbling on them in work meetings. Then my boss teasingly taps my hands. Then I go get fake nails to stop myself. Then I don&#x27;t have time to keep them up. Then they look like even worse HELL! Then I found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to an expensive spa today and the manicurist exclaimed how wonderful they looked.  She called two other nail techs over who did the same. They were dying to know what I did. I told them I just watch TV, grab this from my side table and paint my nails with this.</li>
            <li> I tried this because my nails were pretty thin and weak from an at-home gel manicure. I&#x27;ve almost worked my way through a whole bottle (tried to give it a fair test). I wouldn&#x27;t buy this or recommend it. My nails are still weak and peeling, and it takes forever to dry. I bought it because it was recommended by a sales associate at a beauty store chain and because it specifically says you can use it as a base/top coat. I wish I was exaggerating when I say you have to wait at least an hour for it to dry if you put on two coats and then try to follow with a nail polish. There was very little pay-off (actually none) for an inconvenient product.</li>
            <li> I knew my nails would be shot after I took the fake ones off, but this did make a difference. My only complaint is that when you use two coats, like instructed, they seem to take forever to dry.</li>
            <li> I made the decision last year to give up acrylic nails after wearing them for over 15 years.  My natural nails were a hot mess after they came off!  They were paper thin, peeling, and would practically break if I even looked at them funny.  I went to Sally Beauty Supply looking for something to strengthen them and the woman working that day recommended this product.  I&#x27;m SO glad she did!  It&#x27;s made a world of difference in my nails.  Once again they are strong and healthy.  Even though it&#x27;s been nearly a year since I stopped wearing artificial nails, I still use this product as a base coat under my nail polish to help keep them healthy and strong.  Thanks for making such a great product, Salon Sciences!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I would recommend it</li>
            <li> This went on good and smooth but it dried out my nails.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this again for the money I spent</li>
            <li> It is ok but my bottle had leaked some of the product out. I am using what was left.</li>
            <li> This helped keep my nails looking decent as they recovered from a decade of damage by acrylics.  I simply put on two coats once a week and it gives a nice bit of shine while keeping my tips from splitting as the damaged nail grew out.  I still use it once or twice each month when I don&#x27;t feel like actually having color but don&#x27;t want &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; nails or regular clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as thick as what I purchased in the store</li>
            <li> I have never been able to grow my nails out, after one months use of this product I actually do have nails.  I use it every other day faithfully and my nails are longer and stronger than they ever have been my whole life!!!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my nails, seems to thin when applied</li>
            <li> Great product.. works great</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this product to be much different from other clear-coat nail polishes I have used, and I don&#x27;t think it did anything special re rejuvenating my nails which had been damaged from lacquer applications. I find that other clear polishes work just as well while you are waiting for your nails to grow out. Given that, if you want a clear, fast-drying nail polish, this isn&#x27;t all that terrible.</li>
            <li> I love it I use it everyday.My nails are so soft and they break and crack all the time.This helps get them strong.</li>
            <li> I am trying to get through a very rough time with my fingernails, terrible peeling and such. This product is helping after trying 3 other top name brand product. I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had artificial nails but try telling that to my fingernails! My nails were constantly dry, peeling, splitting, and cracking before I tried this. I don&#x27;t get manicures, trim my cuticles, or paint my nails frequently but my nails tended to be in constant rough shape due to a combo of health issues and super frequent hand-washing. You really need to use it as directed (1-2 coats on the first application, then add on one additional coat every other day; remove and repeat after 1 week), but you&#x27;ll get amazing results. This product dries to a smooth, clear, super high-shine finish (I know some products I&#x27;ve tried previously dried to a matte finish that looked like I just had bare nails). The shine might attract some extra attention to your nails-- but they&#x27;ll look so wonderful, you&#x27;ll welcome the attention. Someone actually told me that I had beautiful, healthy nails and that she was jealous because they looked like the type of nails that I could grow out a little and get a mani and have them be picture perfect. This product will give you instant improvement since it smooths and seals any splits or cracks in the nail, and then more lasting effects because the new nail growth will be stronger and healthier. Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried many products by a top nail brand...and was mostly left disappointed by little/no results or worse-- having my nails dry out even further. This product is a great value, it&#x27;s easy to use, it&#x27;s Toluene free and has an extra-gentle formula. I&#x27;ve never tried anything else by this brand, but I&#x27;d definitely suggest trying this product out if you are unsatisfied with the look of your nails.</li>
            <li> starting over again on my natural nails.  hope it continues to work.</li>
            <li> After artificial nail ruined my natural nails, this did bring them back slowly</li>
            <li> I received this today and when I opened the package, half the bottle was empty because it had spilled in the box.  I may update this review later but disappointed so far.</li>
            <li> I have brittle nails that do not grow. I started using this product and now my nails don&#x27;t break and they are strong and long. I have and will continue to recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have thin weak nails. They constantly tear and I was a chronic nail biter because of that. I wore acrylics for 6 months to break the habit. This really keeps my natural nails hard and firm. It&#x27;s really helping!</li>
            <li> I got my first bottle after a bad infection from artificial nails. My nails were so damaged and weak. A friend suggested Starting Over and I have been using it since periodically just to keep my nails healthy and strong.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me.  My nails split and peeled even more when using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since I took my acrylic nails off 5 months ago.  My nail tech recommended a product that her salon sold, but I had already ordered this product.....so I continued using &amp;#34;STARTING OVER AFTER ARTIFICALS!&amp;#34;  I thought all of these products were basically the same, so I never purchased the product that I was advised to do.  .After months of applying &amp;#34;S.O.A.A.&amp;#34; my nails were still very weak and rubbery .....not to mention they were growing out very slowly. I finally switched to the product that I was recommend to use and my nails are finally growing out strong and much quicker!</li>
            <li> Seriously gave me my nails back! Had taken off acrylics a couple months ago and my nails were not growing out as quick as before and ends just looked peeled. Once I started using this I felt them definitely stronger. I end up packing on layers(sometimes more than 3coats on 1 day instead of adding every other day) then add the color polish but hey they have yet to break! So happy about this polish. Would continue to buy even for just maintenance.</li>
            <li> Works well, but peels after multiple coats are applied. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with damaged nails from acrylics.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I&#x27;ve had gel nails for over a year now, took them off 3 weeks ago and they were horrible. Brittle, peeling, breaking and plain ugly! I purchased this product and it has done wonders! I&#x27;ve been using it for 1 week now and my nails are already stronger, not peeling and growing!

            <li> I had acrylic nails for over 20 years because my own nails had always been so paper thin and would never grow.  I used it after taking my acrylics off and saw mimprovement, but what  amazes me is how my new nails are now strong and grow, I cannot believe my own eyes when I look at my nails now...for the firt time in my life I have long nails of my own!!!</li>
