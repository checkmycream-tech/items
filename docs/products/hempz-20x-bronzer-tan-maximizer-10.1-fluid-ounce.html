            <li>Now all my clients are loving this lotion as well.</li>
            <li>I wish it had a nice scent</li>
            <li>The price was good and I love hemp body lotion</li>
            <li>I also liked the fact that it is organic.</li>
            <li>AND it gives me a nice glow to boot.  </li>
            <li>, just kind of &#x27;stuck&#x27; on.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave me looking orange and all, but it does give me a nice tan.</li>
            <li>It smells like peaches which is delightful lol and after about a week im definitely darker than i was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Hempz products and have always been satisfied.</li>
            <li>really works, the smell is awesome :)</li>
            <li>Perfect for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe I would have liked one with more bronzer in it</li>
            <li>I prefer a higher bronzes level but switching lotions from time to time is always recommended when tanning and this one is great.</li>
            <li>Seems to work okay.</li>
            <li>Mango fruity smell. :)</li>
            <li>I love this bronzer for the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>I think the smell is ok.</li>
            <li>I love Hempz body lotion</li>
            <li>Overall a great product!</li>
            <li>Also with not as many bronzers</li>
            <li>I stay a a tanish brown whereas tanning lotions with more bronzor tend to turn me orange</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, great service.</li>
            <li>It smells divine and brings out a lovely color in my skin.  </li>
            <li>got me up to 5 shades darker In a week and lasted most of the summer.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different indoor tanning lotions over the years and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be better  ...</li>
            <li>The smell going on was ok ,but after...</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS STUFF..</li>
            <li>and it don&#x27;t take a lot :)</li>
            <li>I usually love Hempz products but this missed the mark for me.</li>
            <li>Works ok...</li>
            <li>I can get most AG bottles for $25 or less,and with much better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the smell too.</li>
            <li>but this is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>It works ok,</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best prices for lotion and I am very thankful to have gotten it within a week of ordering     Thanks &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>tan.(I have red hair and very fair skin)</li>
            <li>I tan easily</li>
            <li>so I tan easily.</li>
            <li>so I could apply it evenly and easily.</li>
            <li>easily 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor and is Vegan.</li>
            <li>It works fine for the money</li>
            <li>Smells good and leaves skin very soft</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Got a great tan last summer from it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe people with really light skin tone,can get some results from this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>great if you want to use if for a wedding and don&#x27;t want to get a real tan, cause it goes on like as if you got a real tan</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>I love the Alterna line for many different reasons and now I have one more.</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed by the quality of this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love that its 93% natural so its good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but probably won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin even though I tan easily, but most lotions make me breakout in hives</li>
            <li>A lot of other reviews stated the lotion worked great for them, and that might be true.</li>
            <li>but I honestly had expected more from it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this lotion and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of fruity but not fruity enough for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of gross.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it for the skin care alone.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>This product is not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>and I think it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>The seller shipped it right away.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend ordering it from beautybrandsforless.com because you will get 15% off your refill and a free sample of self tanner.</li>
            <li>However if you are a beginner tanner and tan harder like I do I would suggest something with more bronzers in it!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really hard for me to find a lotion that gives me a great</li>
            <li>Just love it, I cannot believe how tan I am in so short of time!!</li>
            <li>However, for me and my skin type it is unfortunately not for me.</li>
            <li>It was goin for more than 60.00 on a regular tanning site.</li>
            <li>Love the product definitely recommend for anyone that has the tendency to peel after 3 tans.</li>
            <li>unfortunately not when you want it to).</li>
            <li>many people into tanning,i love a deep and rich dark tan,it didn&#x27;t do any of this for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one gets absorbed by the skin much faster than AG (maybe this a positive thing,</li>
            <li>I tried to be positive about the smell....</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this product at my local tanning salon where I go for occasional light therapy.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my tan.</li>
            <li>Nice and dark in no time even if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I have a nice dark tan now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read some reviews,and this lotion came as a good alternative,&lt;br /&gt;specially for me because it was supposed to be for people who already had a \\&quot;natural dark tan\\&quot;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My biggest complaint is the bottle because the lid is a flip top that opens much too easily (</li>
            <li>Smells alright, fast shipping, had an allergic reaction to it though, my legs broke out in a rash, so have to find something else.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also VERY greasy.</li>
            <li>I had to go straight home and take a shower.</li>
            <li>I can tan and go straight to work with no worries.</li>
            <li>Absolutely DISGUSTING!.Wouldn&#x27;t buy again or even use if someone gave it to me</li>
            <li>Expected more from it.</li>
            <li>Also, after I am finished tanning, the lotion leaves my skin feeling real greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very soupy liquid</li>
            <li>but when I applied it, it didn&#x27;t rub very well into my skin</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I read that this happens with the lotions with too much DHA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>The bronzer is okay, not orange but also not very strong.</li>
            <li>Not only did I get a sexy deep tan</li>
            <li>I constantly switch lotions trying to find better than the last</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a few others from Amazon and this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>On to trying a new lotion.</li>
            <li>Enough to not get glares &amp; looks when I go to school because people think I don&#x27;t shower (haha)!</li>
            <li>This is so much cheaper than at the local salons and is the exact same product.</li>
            <li>I tried my first Australian Gold (AG) lotion over a year ago and loved it, bought a few different bottles over the time,all with different results.&lt;br /&gt;Decided to try a different brand this time.</li>
            <li>Before I bought this lotion I had bought Designer Skin Obsidian warming lotion...turns out my skin was far to sensitive for it</li>
            <li>100% natural.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is a natural product without harmful chemicals is also a plus.  </li>
            <li>I ended up combining a natural indoor tanning lotion with this</li>
            <li>I was pretty skeptical about all the positive reviews that this had as I&#x27;m a big tannaholic, but when I used it for the first time, I was pretty amazed.</li>
            <li>After tanning can&#x27;t tell much difference between it and other products.</li>
            <li>It did a good job but was thick and came out of the bottle thick.</li>
            <li>They have very fast shipping as well, mine arrived within a few days of placing the order.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that I have only been tanning a week and a half</li>

            <li> got me up to 5 shades darker In a week and lasted most of the summer.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different indoor tanning lotions over the years and this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be better  ...</li>
            <li> The smell going on was ok ,but after...</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS STUFF..</li>
            <li> and it don&#x27;t take a lot :)</li>
            <li> I usually love Hempz products but this missed the mark for me.</li>
            <li> Works ok...</li>
            <li> I can get most AG bottles for $25 or less,and with much better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the smell too.</li>
            <li> but this is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> It works ok,</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best prices for lotion and I am very thankful to have gotten it within a week of ordering     Thanks &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> tan.(I have red hair and very fair skin)</li>
            <li> I tan easily</li>
            <li> so I tan easily.</li>
            <li> so I could apply it evenly and easily.</li>
            <li> easily 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor and is Vegan.</li>
            <li> It works fine for the money</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves skin very soft</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Got a great tan last summer from it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe people with really light skin tone,can get some results from this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> great if you want to use if for a wedding and don&#x27;t want to get a real tan, cause it goes on like as if you got a real tan</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I love the Alterna line for many different reasons and now I have one more.</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed by the quality of this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love that its 93% natural so its good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but probably won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin even though I tan easily, but most lotions make me breakout in hives</li>
            <li> A lot of other reviews stated the lotion worked great for them, and that might be true.</li>
            <li> but I honestly had expected more from it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of fruity but not fruity enough for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of gross.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it for the skin care alone.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> This product is not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> and I think it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> The seller shipped it right away.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend ordering it from beautybrandsforless.com because you will get 15% off your refill and a free sample of self tanner.</li>
            <li> However if you are a beginner tanner and tan harder like I do I would suggest something with more bronzers in it!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really hard for me to find a lotion that gives me a great</li>
            <li> Just love it, I cannot believe how tan I am in so short of time!!</li>
            <li> However, for me and my skin type it is unfortunately not for me.</li>
            <li> It was goin for more than 60.00 on a regular tanning site.</li>
            <li> Love the product definitely recommend for anyone that has the tendency to peel after 3 tans.</li>
            <li> unfortunately not when you want it to).</li>
            <li> many people into tanning,i love a deep and rich dark tan,it didn&#x27;t do any of this for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one gets absorbed by the skin much faster than AG (maybe this a positive thing,</li>
            <li> I tried to be positive about the smell....</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product at my local tanning salon where I go for occasional light therapy.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my tan.</li>
            <li> Nice and dark in no time even if you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have a nice dark tan now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some reviews,and this lotion came as a good alternative,&lt;br /&gt;specially for me because it was supposed to be for people who already had a \\&quot;natural dark tan\\&quot;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is the bottle because the lid is a flip top that opens much too easily (</li>
            <li> Smells alright, fast shipping, had an allergic reaction to it though, my legs broke out in a rash, so have to find something else.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also VERY greasy.</li>
            <li> I had to go straight home and take a shower.</li>
            <li> I can tan and go straight to work with no worries.</li>
            <li> Absolutely DISGUSTING!.Wouldn&#x27;t buy again or even use if someone gave it to me</li>
            <li> Expected more from it.</li>
            <li> Also, after I am finished tanning, the lotion leaves my skin feeling real greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very soupy liquid</li>
            <li> but when I applied it, it didn&#x27;t rub very well into my skin</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I read that this happens with the lotions with too much DHA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> The bronzer is okay, not orange but also not very strong.</li>
            <li> Not only did I get a sexy deep tan</li>
            <li> I constantly switch lotions trying to find better than the last</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few others from Amazon and this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> On to trying a new lotion.</li>
            <li> Enough to not get glares &amp; looks when I go to school because people think I don&#x27;t shower (haha)!</li>
            <li> This is so much cheaper than at the local salons and is the exact same product.</li>
            <li> I tried my first Australian Gold (AG) lotion over a year ago and loved it, bought a few different bottles over the time,all with different results.&lt;br /&gt;Decided to try a different brand this time.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this lotion I had bought Designer Skin Obsidian warming lotion...turns out my skin was far to sensitive for it</li>
            <li> 100% natural.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is a natural product without harmful chemicals is also a plus.  </li>
            <li> I ended up combining a natural indoor tanning lotion with this</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about all the positive reviews that this had as I&#x27;m a big tannaholic, but when I used it for the first time, I was pretty amazed.</li>
            <li> After tanning can&#x27;t tell much difference between it and other products.</li>
            <li> It did a good job but was thick and came out of the bottle thick.</li>
            <li> They have very fast shipping as well, mine arrived within a few days of placing the order.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that I have only been tanning a week and a half</li>
            <li> The color is very deep, dark and very natural.</li>
            <li> (kind of like a bad floral smell)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not completely sold.  </li>
            <li> My tan last way longer then with any other products I have used before.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry and crinkley.</li>
            <li> Rapaid results for that deep dark tropical tan from the beach</li>
            <li> It only gets me slightly tan.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give my review since I just have a little left of this bottle...</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a terrible smell, but it wasn&#x27;t great either.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m soaking wet while tanning.</li>
            <li> Also the thick consistency makes my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Please before you go for any other lotion try this.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find I tanned any darker than other cheaper bottles that I have used.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed since it should have been sealed better.</li>
            <li> (I am not even that dark)</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the smell changes after you tan</li>
            <li> and this product doesn&#x27;t make me too dark which is an issue I sometimes run into</li>
            <li> I need really dark tan, so it&#x27;s not what I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Works well, no greasy mess, doesn&#x27;t stain like some other maximizers..</li>
            <li> I try wiping myself down with a towel after I am finished</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get very dark with the other ones.  </li>
            <li> As I continued using it I got a slight color</li>
            <li> It also has an odd smell - like gym and pina coladas.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as the black label.</li>
            <li> and it is a little to extream of a color for me.</li>
            <li> It will not let you down!</li>
            <li> this is the first time i used a lotion that has an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have blotches, streaks or uneven areas at all.</li>
            <li> Get in tanning bed everyday</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years now</li>
            <li> This product when applied before getting into a tanning bed will definately make you a few shades darker in one tanning session.  </li>
            <li> The bronzer was a little too thick for me.</li>
            <li> I wish I used this lotion in the past, but now I know.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because it says it has 20x bronzers and DHA, which is what I usually look for in a lotion in order to get some color.</li>
            <li> One of my friends recommended me this Tanning Lotion, was not sure if this will work for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced that with any other accelerator.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say I am at least 2-3 shades darker after one use.</li>
            <li> Has the typical tanning bed smell to it unfortunately</li>
            <li> If you do not currently have a base tan, I would not recommend this.  </li>
            <li> Lotion is thin and gives no results.  </li>
            <li> I get some color but nothing dramatic.  </li>
            <li> but sadly I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> i got was a weird orange glow.</li>
            <li> just hate the citrus smell never been a fan but get past that</li>
            <li> That lingering tanning smell isn&#x27;t so bad with this.</li>
            <li> It stunk and didn&#x27;t seem to make my tan any darker. :(</li>
            <li> Was using supre smoke before this to build base tan.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this to anyone for the ones who hate waiting for results this one tans quicker and would buy again</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worthless</li>
            <li> and I was terribly burnt.</li>

            <li> I used a different hempz tanning product and decided to try this one. It works fine for the money</li>
            <li> Seems to work okay. Doesn&#x27;t smell good tho.</li>
            <li> So far so good I&#x27;m loving my tan..</li>
            <li> Smells alright, fast shipping, had an allergic reaction to it though, my legs broke out in a rash, so have to find something else.</li>
            <li> This lotion is absolutely amazing!!!! One use and i already noticed a bronze color to my skin. I am completely impressed with this product! Before I bought this lotion I had bought Designer Skin Obsidian warming lotion...turns out my skin was far to sensitive for it and I was terribly burnt. After about a week my burn went away and my salon lady recommended Hempz. 100% natural. Perfect for anyone with sensitive skin. Also perfect for anyone who is fair skinned. I&#x27;d say I am at least 2-3 shades darker after one use. I highly recommend ordering it from beautybrandsforless.com because you will get 15% off your refill and a free sample of self tanner. Wnderful purchase. I would recommend this to anyone!! Please before you go for any other lotion try this. It will not let you down! Plus the smell is amazing. Mango fruity smell. :)</li>
            <li> Nice lotion. Could improve the scent but Good lotion.</li>
            <li> Love! Smells amazing. Was using supre smoke before this to build base tan. That lingering tanning smell isn&#x27;t so bad with this. Nice mango smell. Love it!</li>
            <li> This lotion is AMAZING! It goes on smooth and is not greasy at all. I love that its 93% natural so its good for sensitive skin. My tan last way longer then with any other products I have used before. I work in a salon and always get compliments about how good my color is. (I am not even that dark) Now all my clients are loving this lotion as well. The smell is even good when  you get out of the bed. You dont have that burnt smell most lotions leave you with!</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer for the tanning bed. I have been using it for a week and already have a beautiful tan. I will keep using it, till I go on a cruise. I will purchase again. Just love it, I cannot believe how tan I am in so short of time!!</li>
            <li> I think the smell is ok. It&#x27;s kind of fruity but not fruity enough for me. It&#x27;s also VERY greasy. I put it on and go into the tanning bed and I&#x27;m soaking wet while tanning. It&#x27;s kind of gross. When I get out I need a towel to take all the moisture off my skin. I bought this because of the reputation of the brand but sadly I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing!!! They have very fast shipping as well, mine arrived within a few days of placing the order. I love Hempz body lotion so I decided to try their tanning lotion and I love it! Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever bought. It feels like a regular lotion and I don&#x27;t mind keeping it on after I tan.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a nice scent and it is a little to extream of a color for me.</li>
            <li> Amazing tanning lotion. It provides good bronzers and amazing skin care. My skin felt wonderful and moisturized! My only complaint is that the smell changes after you tan but it&#x27;s worth it for the skin care alone. It smells brilliant when you first apply it but not so brilliant after you tan. If you&#x27;re looking to pamper you skin and want bronzers this lotion is the way to go.</li>
            <li> great if you want to use if for a wedding and don&#x27;t want to get a real tan, cause it goes on like as if you got a real tan</li>
            <li> The price was good and I love hemp body lotion but I&#x27;m not completely sold.  It&#x27;s not greasy, smells good,  and I&#x27;m getting color but I&#x27;m getting a bronze color in between my fingers like I&#x27;ve been in a sunless booth. I guess I&#x27;ll make site to wipe out of my hands before I tan.  I&#x27;ve never experienced that with any other accelerator.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing lotion! It keeps my tab maintained and looking great! If you are wanting to maintain your tan this is the product for you!! However if you are a beginner tanner and tan harder like I do I would suggest something with more bronzers in it! Overall a great product! Also with not as many bronzers I stay a a tanish brown whereas tanning lotions with more bronzor tend to turn me orange</li>
            <li> Works great and non-greasy.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor and is Vegan.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great service. Will order again. Product works we&#x27;ll. I tan easily and this product doesn&#x27;t make me too dark which is an issue I sometimes run into</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skin, never can keep a tan. This product works wonders!! And it smells great! Promotes tan skin and helps keep it tan!!</li>
            <li> love it !!! just hate the citrus smell never been a fan but get past that and you will have an awsome tan !</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product at my local tanning salon where I go for occasional light therapy.  It smells divine and brings out a lovely color in my skin.  The fact that it is a natural product without harmful chemicals is also a plus.  I love the Alterna line for many different reasons and now I have one more.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t blend well</li>
            <li> Is great if you are tanning.</li>
            <li> Got a great tan last summer from it only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the smell. I love that it&#x27;s natural got me up to 5 shades darker In a week and lasted most of the summer.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful and works gre</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different indoor tanning lotions over the years and this is the best I&#x27;ve found. All the others left me so stinky I had to go straight home and take a shower. I can tan and go straight to work with no worries. Also the thick consistency makes my skin soft and moisturized. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry and crinkley. I have a lot of Italian in me so I tan easily. The color is very deep, dark and very natural. I don&#x27;t have blotches, streaks or uneven areas at all. I really like the fact that I have only been tanning a week and a half and it looks like I have been going for months. Plus, I don&#x27;t have to go every day to keep my color. I LOVE this lotion and highly recommend it. If I had to pick one con, it would be that it will discolor your finger nails and palms if you don&#x27;t wash them after each use. But I do and have no problems.</li>
            <li> It stunk and didn&#x27;t seem to make my tan any darker. :( I was expecting it to be better  ... Maybe I would have liked one with more bronzer in it</li>
            <li> The bronzer was a little too thick for me. It did a good job but was thick and came out of the bottle thick. Would probably never buy this again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find I tanned any darker than other cheaper bottles that I have used.The smell going on was ok ,but after...Absolutely DISGUSTING!.Wouldn&#x27;t buy again or even use if someone gave it to me</li>
            <li> This product is not as good as I expected. Like the smell. Feels good. After tanning can&#x27;t tell much difference between it and other products. Expected more from it. Not bad, but probably won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about all the positive reviews that this had as I&#x27;m a big tannaholic, but when I used it for the first time, I was pretty amazed. Not only did I get a sexy deep tan, I wasn&#x27;t sticky, nor did I have that terribly&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;tanning\\&quot; smell!! I put on my after lotion &amp; I smelled good! Enough to not get glares &amp; looks when I go to school because people think I don&#x27;t shower (haha)! I wish I used this lotion in the past, but now I know. (&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell could be more fruitier for my liking, but with the results I get, who cares!!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I&#x27;m about 80% Irish and it&#x27;s really hard for me to find a lotion that gives me a great tan.(I have red hair and very fair skin) I bought this lotion because it says it has 20x bronzers and DHA, which is what I usually look for in a lotion in order to get some color. I also liked the fact that it is organic. When the lotion arrived in the mail, I opened the box and lotion was everywhere. I was disappointed since it should have been sealed better. The first time I used it I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my tan. As I continued using it I got a slight color but I honestly had expected more from it. Another deal breaker for me was the smell. It wasn&#x27;t a terrible smell, but it wasn&#x27;t great either. (kind of like a bad floral smell) Also, after I am finished tanning, the lotion leaves my skin feeling real greasy. I try wiping myself down with a towel after I am finished and I still find my skin feeling greasy. A lot of other reviews stated the lotion worked great for them, and that might be true. However, for me and my skin type it is unfortunately not for me.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time! Perfect for indoor tanning beds.  Rapaid results for that deep dark tropical tan from the beach</li>
            <li> This lotion was written as one of the best tanning lotions to get. It was goin for more than 60.00 on a regular tanning site. Amazon has the best prices for lotion and I am very thankful to have gotten it within a week of ordering     Thanks &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS STUFF..I recommend this to every one that tans in a tanning bed ... It works well and it don&#x27;t take a lot :)</li>
            <li> There are those lotions that make you smell like burnt fruit as your day progresses after a tanning session ... and then there is Hempz!  I get compliments from my coworkers when they catch a whiff of this AND it gives me a nice glow to boot.  Non-greasy, soaks in easily, great scent ... Winner in my book.</li>
            <li> This is really good you get. Nice and dark in no time even if you don&#x27;t. Get in tanning bed everyday I would recomend this to anyone for the ones who hate waiting for results this one tans quicker and would buy again</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give my review since I just have a little left of this bottle... I tried to be positive about the smell.... The truth is it doesn&#x27;t smell good at all. It&#x27;s a very soupy liquid but when I applied it, it didn&#x27;t rub very well into my skin, just kind of &#x27;stuck&#x27; on. After tanning I saw red marks from globs of the lotion... I ended up combining a natural indoor tanning lotion with this so I could apply it evenly and easily.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years now and I really like it. It doesn&#x27;t leave me looking orange and all, but it does give me a nice tan.</li>
            <li> I need tanning lotion for dance comps. It only gets me slightly tan. I need really dark tan, so it&#x27;s not what I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I usually love Hempz products but this missed the mark for me. It wasn&#x27;t worthless but I didn&#x27;t even finish the bottle before I upgraded.</li>
            <li> I love the smell! Works great.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It works great. I can get in the tanning bed 2 or 3 times and look like I&#x27;ve been tanning for weeks. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered! Love the product definitely recommend for anyone that has the tendency to peel after 3 tans. I do not have that problem with this</li>
            <li> Works ok... Has the typical tanning bed smell to it unfortunately</li>
            <li> I tried my first Australian Gold (AG) lotion over a year ago and loved it, bought a few different bottles over the time,all with different results.&lt;br /&gt;Decided to try a different brand this time. I&#x27;ve read some reviews,and this lotion came as a good alternative,&lt;br /&gt;specially for me because it was supposed to be for people who already had a \\&quot;natural dark tan\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;After 3 usages (once a week) i can say it didnt work for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;All i got was a weird orange glow. I read that this happens with the lotions with too much DHA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this is the first time i used a lotion that has an unpleasant smell. smells like grease and it takes a bigger amount of product than AG&#x27;s lotions each time i use it.This one gets absorbed by the skin much faster than AG (maybe this a positive thing,i dunno).&lt;br /&gt;Like many people into tanning,i love a deep and rich dark tan,it didn&#x27;t do any of this for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe people with really light skin tone,can get some results from this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I used this lotion in the same conditions i used AG&#x27;s lotions: same saloon,same tanning beds and same amount of time (16 to 20 mins).&lt;br /&gt;Plus this lotion is pricey $35. I can get most AG bottles for $25 or less,and with much better results.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, its back to Australian Gold for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I constantly switch lotions trying to find better than the last and i think i finally found a lotion to stay with for a while. It smells like peaches which is delightful lol and after about a week im definitely darker than i was. I am definitely reccomending this to my friends. Also, i dont think its that greasy.</li>
            <li> I used this product with a Level 4 bed (stand up) and wasn&#x27;t greatly impressed. I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in my skin while using the lotion. It also has an odd smell - like gym and pina coladas.</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of HEMPZ products, lotions, tanning lotions, ect.  This product when applied before getting into a tanning bed will definately make you a few shades darker in one tanning session.  If you do not currently have a base tan, I would not recommend this.  This is a great product for those that alread have a base tan and want a darker glow.  Smells great too!</li>
            <li> BRONZER will turn you a bronze color. this has 20 times the amount or bronzer in it. not tan, BRONZE. like an oompa loompa. so, keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> One of my friends recommended me this Tanning Lotion, was not sure if this will work for me but now i can say that im really happy :)&lt;br /&gt;It really works, the smell is awesome :)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Love this product! Provides a great tan and smells great!</li>
            <li> easily 5 stars. Works well, no greasy mess, doesn&#x27;t stain like some other maximizers.. I have used this for 2 years now. No complaints</li>
            <li> This is so much cheaper than at the local salons and is the exact same product. I would purchase it again and again here.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as the black label. On to trying a new lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Hempz products and have always been satisfied. I prefer a higher bronzes level but switching lotions from time to time is always recommended when tanning and this one is great. Smells good and leaves skin very soft</li>
            <li> Great lotion and no complaints.  I don&#x27;t like to smell like a mango or a burnt grill when I get done and this stuff is perfect.  Works great and enhances the time you spend in the bed.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion.  I have tried a few others from Amazon and this one is my favorite.  I didn&#x27;t get very dark with the other ones.  I&#x27;m always getting compliments on my tan since I&#x27;ve started using this one.  It doesn&#x27;t turn you orange.  I have a nice dark tan now.  I actually bought this lotion 2x in a row because i tanned so well with it. It also has a great smell :-)  The seller shipped it right away.  i only paid $25.00 and I think it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> Love the HEMPZ line! Great bronzer! Awesome price!</li>
            <li> I like this lotion quite a bit! Hempz is an excellent brand and I was not disappointed by the quality of this lotion. The bronzer is okay, not orange but also not very strong. The moisturizing aspect of the lotion is the best part, as well as the fruity smell. I think it smells like peach or mango and does not linger after tanning. My biggest complaint is the bottle because the lid is a flip top that opens much too easily (unfortunately not when you want it to).</li>
            <li> Shipping took forever.  Lotion is thin and gives no results.  Do not order. Try snooki skinny</li>
            <li> It made me darker almost instantly! I love the smell too. I have extremely sensitive skin even though I tan easily, but most lotions make me breakout in hives, this didn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s great. AND, I selected standard shipping but it arrived in two days!</li>
            <li> I like Hempz lotions but this is not my favorite. It works ok, I get some color but nothing dramatic.  I prefer Smoke</li>
