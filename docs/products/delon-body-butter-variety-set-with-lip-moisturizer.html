            <li>I love the body butter</li>

            <li>I find the lip glosses are much more healing than any chapstick I have tried and the body butter</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>so glad I did this.</li>
            <li>I love body butter.  </li>
            <li>My children love the body butter and lip moisturizer.</li>
            <li>So glad to find these on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Your skin will love you for it.</li>
            <li>And most of what IS in there, is liquid.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>(olive surprised me by smelling so good!).  </li>
            <li>I first found it at Costco bought the multi pack and loved it</li>
            <li>Jars are full size, the kind you would pay $10-$20 each for at the bath &amp; body stores.  </li>
            <li>but when I use these he knows exactly what scent it is and always mentions how good it smells.</li>
            <li>They are, hands down, the best body butters I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The price is perfect and the body is just as good if not better than the stuff that costs 5 times as much.</li>
            <li>The Delon body butter has a wonderfully smooth consistency.</li>
            <li>The scents are light.</li>
            <li>This line of body butters and lip moisturizers is a fabulous deal.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and absorbs rapidly.</li>
            <li>This product is so soothing and smooth to put on.  </li>
            <li>- Fabulously creamy.</li>
            <li>not only keeps your skin, feet, hands moist but gives you a nice healthy shine :-)</li>
            <li>I truly enjoy using the body butter myself.</li>
            <li>I will say, and the lip moisturizers were fantastic.</li>
            <li>I first purchased these body butters at Costco, and was impressed with how well they moisturized my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This is really rich body butter, and had a light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Flat out great product.</li>
            <li>The service was great--very quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>I received it originally as a gift, but then I purchased it again for myself and a friend</li>
            <li>and she was so excited when she received hers in the mail.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a rich body butter, like a Ghirardelli chocolate bar.  </li>
            <li>Upon opening this today, I was excited to have plenty of butters.</li>
            <li>It comes in various scents all are pleasant and not over powering.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s indicated she tried several others but none as good at moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>These are full size body butters made with ingredients that you are NOT scared to google search.</li>
            <li>It sinks into the skin with a light fragrance, my favorite being the coconut; my hubby always mentions how nice it smells.  </li>
            <li>I loved it and realized this was going to be a must-have as my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This year they did not have so lucky to find on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have mild eczema but don&#x27;t even notice it when I use these after each shower.</li>
            <li>It soaks into my skin quickly and lasts over 24 hrs.  </li>
            <li>They are also super moisturizing, absorb quickly into your skin, and don&#x27;t leave you with that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>received my package quickly.  </li>
            <li>but this is a very good deal and worth the trouble!</li>
            <li>The scents are light and not overwhelming but still smell great.</li>
            <li>It smells really good and it helps moisturising my dry skin.</li>
            <li>so know product is fresh.  </li>
            <li>Better than bath and body works by far.</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled they had the same package on amazon.</li>
            <li>It is yummy, with such a nice gentle smell and a rich, creamy feel.</li>
            <li>But if you do not plan on using the lip balm right when you get the product you should be warned that it does not shelve well at all.</li>
            <li>It is dry in Vegas and this stuff keeps my skin feeling amazing.</li>
            <li>When you shower at the end of the day, you are aware of the smoothness on your skin from the appliction of these body butters.</li>
            <li>A real winner!</li>
            <li>My favorite is the Coconut and white chocolate.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this the first time at CostCo for the wife.  </li>
            <li>Soft, not greasy, light scents.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Delon Body Butter especially the coconut and vanila.  </li>
            <li>A D FAST SHIPPING!  </li>
            <li>I have used about 6 different scents and love them all.</li>
            <li>I first bought it at Costco in Canada and now order through Amazon in the U.S.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted to say what a pretty gift it makes.</li>
            <li>It is on a really big card with lovely pictures of flowers and fruit.</li>
            <li>and it smells exactly like another brand that I buy</li>
            <li>As a mom who is constantly trying to fight the \\&quot;ash\\&quot; :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve finally found a fragrant alternative!!</li>
            <li>and I even when back to Costco to buy more and</li>
            <li>Makes my skin smooth and soft all day.</li>
            <li>It looks like the same size container that you pay much more for in the store in the malls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Delon before, I actually ordered this because I&#x27;m in love with the coconut scent</li>
            <li>Sadly, that was the best part of this.</li>
            <li>I found this at costco first.</li>
            <li>These body butters are very rich and smell divine, they dissolve well into the skin and skin still feels hydrated the following day.  </li>
            <li>great body cream, will last a very long time!</li>
            <li>and they keep my skin feeling soft and cool.</li>
            <li>The lotion also keeps for a good long time if you do not open it.  </li>
            <li>Now I use only this cream, I prefer Olive Cream because it doesn&#x27;t smell to strong.</li>
            <li>and I gave him several bottles and jars that I had in my cabinet and he returned them all but the Delon vanilla scented body butter commenting the others were either too greasy feeling or too strongly scented.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion, it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever used that actually shows long-term results and moisturizes my skin adequately.</li>
            <li>Every smell actually smells real and super yummy!  </li>
            <li>THE ORDER ARRIVED VERY TIMELY</li>
            <li>I order it all the time and go through the body butter much faster than the lip balm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lip balm is a real bonus.  </li>
            <li>I can really feel the difference before</li>
            <li>Thanks for offering this product.</li>
            <li>We gave each other facials with them and everyone took home their favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>The little lip balms that come with the multi pack are great to carry in your purse for dry lips better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ingredients of the back of my coconut container say that it is dermatologist tested, quick absorbing and non greasy (yes, it is), long-lasting moisture</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and the variety pack lets you enjoy a number of scents.  </li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable (half the cost of some of the others) and the results are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and highly reccommend it, but this time it just was not what we are used to from this manufacturer.</li>
            <li>These are high quality lotions.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for a high quality lotion that will keep us all moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>Only, please, NOT the toilet tissue (grin -- :)</li>
            <li>Ive tried the inexpensive brands and the very expensive brands and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>I buy this product normally at the beginning of winter and it lasts all winter.</li>
            <li>Have been using the Delon body butter for a number of years everyday and love it.  </li>
            <li>The scents are lovely, long lasting and soft.</li>
            <li>so very soft skin are the results.  </li>
            <li>It also contains 2 small lip butters in mango and vanilla, which are a nice extra, especially with winter right around the corner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so soft...</li>
            <li>It means it was made with natural ingredients and did not have preservatives in it.  </li>
            <li>the old delon cream in the orange tube is discontinued</li>
            <li>Nearly all body butters I&#x27;ve tried stink.</li>
            <li>The vanilla smells a little &#x27;older&#x27; but the the rest of the scents are young and fresh.</li>
            <li>No down side.</li>
            <li>was unbelievable and shipped free.  </li>
            <li>TO ONLY HAVE HALF OF THE ORIGINAL AMOUNTS</li>
            <li>At this price, the value is absolutely unheard of for such a solid product.</li>
            <li>If it was cheaper, it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal, but seeing as the containers had pretty much nothing, not worth it!</li>
            <li>I decided to give it a try and needless to say, I love these body butters!</li>
            <li>the  cans only seem half full and on one side of the can.  </li>
            <li>Your body and lips will be soft to the touch with daily use of your succulent butters.  </li>
            <li>We first found this item at Costco last fall, but as you know specialty items like this don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>, so they last a while, even with frequent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Sorry, but if the containers were full, it would be worth the money.</li>
            <li>The lip balms are smoothe and give your lips a natural long lasting shine and keep your lips moist not \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Smell good to me also.</li>
            <li> Never sticky, leaves a nice sheen on the skin, and smells great.</li>
            <li> That is a good thing in a way.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a good buy and</li>
            <li> But, I do enjoy the lip butter perfectly.</li>
            <li> Such an excellent price and excellent quality.  </li>
            <li> I love the product and was happy to find it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> the variety of scents gives you options from odorless olive to fresh mango to tropical coconut to delightful vanilla.</li>
            <li> Love the creamy feel and smells great.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous product!!</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> My favorite moisturerizer!</li>
            <li> , my mom loved them are say that are the best cream she ever tried, these are canadian and even the fact that I live in canada, they are way more cheaper in amazon foir the us!</li>
            <li> I have bought this as a gift for my mom, sister, daughter and best friends and all of them text to tell me how much they love the stuff!</li>
            <li> This body butter variety pack is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky and goes real smoothly.  </li>
            <li> liked body butter too.  </li>
            <li> nice fragrance&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The lip moisturizers are a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> They match nicely with a couple of the body butters.</li>
            <li> This 4 pack contains 4 nice size containers of body</li>
            <li> They are all nice, and for this price, you can keep your favorite(s) and use the others for gifts.</li>
            <li> Since then I have been buying them on Amazon, which has even better deals, and I still LOVE the product!  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft and it lasts for about 7-8 hours, perfect for a work day.</li>
            <li> I make my own body butter with shea butter and a variety of oils and fragrances yet the Delon Body Butter has better fragrances than I can produce.  </li>
            <li> and I ran out, and figured it would be interesting to see different scents as well seeing as Delon is a wonderful company and produces amazing moisturizing body</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t get a better deal on the price.  </li>
            <li> I love all the smells</li>
            <li> The quality of the butters is top notch and</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t love the mango smell.</li>
            <li> I love the body butter</li>
            <li> Love the combo of body butter and lip moisturizer -</li>
            <li> The scents are superb and last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich and emollient; love all the &#x27;flavors&#x27;!  </li>
            <li> I wish they would fill the containers more</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> love that</li>
            <li> and after I saw it I&#x27;m ordering more for gifts.</li>
            <li> I find the lip glosses are much more healing than any chapstick I have tried and the body butter</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> so glad I did this.</li>
            <li> I love body butter.  </li>
            <li> My children love the body butter and lip moisturizer.</li>
            <li> So glad to find these on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Your skin will love you for it.</li>
            <li> And most of what IS in there, is liquid.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> (olive surprised me by smelling so good!).  </li>
            <li> I first found it at Costco bought the multi pack and loved it</li>
            <li> Jars are full size, the kind you would pay $10-$20 each for at the bath &amp; body stores.  </li>
            <li> but when I use these he knows exactly what scent it is and always mentions how good it smells.</li>
            <li> They are, hands down, the best body butters I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The price is perfect and the body is just as good if not better than the stuff that costs 5 times as much.</li>
            <li> The Delon body butter has a wonderfully smooth consistency.</li>
            <li> The scents are light.</li>
            <li> This line of body butters and lip moisturizers is a fabulous deal.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and absorbs rapidly.</li>
            <li> This product is so soothing and smooth to put on.  </li>
            <li> - Fabulously creamy.</li>
            <li> not only keeps your skin, feet, hands moist but gives you a nice healthy shine :-)</li>
            <li> I truly enjoy using the body butter myself.</li>
            <li> I will say, and the lip moisturizers were fantastic.</li>
            <li> I first purchased these body butters at Costco, and was impressed with how well they moisturized my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This is really rich body butter, and had a light fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Flat out great product.</li>
            <li> The service was great--very quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> I received it originally as a gift, but then I purchased it again for myself and a friend</li>
            <li> and she was so excited when she received hers in the mail.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a rich body butter, like a Ghirardelli chocolate bar.  </li>
            <li> Upon opening this today, I was excited to have plenty of butters.</li>
            <li> It comes in various scents all are pleasant and not over powering.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s indicated she tried several others but none as good at moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> These are full size body butters made with ingredients that you are NOT scared to google search.</li>
            <li> It sinks into the skin with a light fragrance, my favorite being the coconut; my hubby always mentions how nice it smells.  </li>
            <li> I loved it and realized this was going to be a must-have as my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This year they did not have so lucky to find on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I have mild eczema but don&#x27;t even notice it when I use these after each shower.</li>
            <li> It soaks into my skin quickly and lasts over 24 hrs.  </li>
            <li> They are also super moisturizing, absorb quickly into your skin, and don&#x27;t leave you with that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> received my package quickly.  </li>
            <li> but this is a very good deal and worth the trouble!</li>
            <li> The scents are light and not overwhelming but still smell great.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and it helps moisturising my dry skin.</li>
            <li> so know product is fresh.  </li>
            <li> Better than bath and body works by far.</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled they had the same package on amazon.</li>
            <li> It is yummy, with such a nice gentle smell and a rich, creamy feel.</li>
            <li> But if you do not plan on using the lip balm right when you get the product you should be warned that it does not shelve well at all.</li>
            <li> It is dry in Vegas and this stuff keeps my skin feeling amazing.</li>
            <li> When you shower at the end of the day, you are aware of the smoothness on your skin from the appliction of these body butters.</li>
            <li> A real winner!</li>
            <li> My favorite is the Coconut and white chocolate.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this the first time at CostCo for the wife.  </li>
            <li> Soft, not greasy, light scents.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Delon Body Butter especially the coconut and vanila.  </li>
            <li> A D FAST SHIPPING!  </li>
            <li> I have used about 6 different scents and love them all.</li>
            <li> I first bought it at Costco in Canada and now order through Amazon in the U.S.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted to say what a pretty gift it makes.</li>
            <li> It is on a really big card with lovely pictures of flowers and fruit.</li>
            <li> and it smells exactly like another brand that I buy</li>
            <li> As a mom who is constantly trying to fight the \\&quot;ash\\&quot; :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve finally found a fragrant alternative!!</li>
            <li> and I even when back to Costco to buy more and</li>
            <li> Makes my skin smooth and soft all day.</li>
            <li> It looks like the same size container that you pay much more for in the store in the malls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Delon before, I actually ordered this because I&#x27;m in love with the coconut scent</li>
            <li> Sadly, that was the best part of this.</li>
            <li> I found this at costco first.</li>
            <li> These body butters are very rich and smell divine, they dissolve well into the skin and skin still feels hydrated the following day.  </li>
            <li> great body cream, will last a very long time!</li>
            <li> and they keep my skin feeling soft and cool.</li>
            <li> The lotion also keeps for a good long time if you do not open it.  </li>
            <li> Now I use only this cream, I prefer Olive Cream because it doesn&#x27;t smell to strong.</li>
            <li> and I gave him several bottles and jars that I had in my cabinet and he returned them all but the Delon vanilla scented body butter commenting the others were either too greasy feeling or too strongly scented.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever used that actually shows long-term results and moisturizes my skin adequately.</li>
            <li> Every smell actually smells real and super yummy!  </li>
            <li> THE ORDER ARRIVED VERY TIMELY</li>
            <li> I order it all the time and go through the body butter much faster than the lip balm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lip balm is a real bonus.  </li>
            <li> I can really feel the difference before</li>
            <li> Thanks for offering this product.</li>
            <li> We gave each other facials with them and everyone took home their favorite scent.  </li>
            <li> The little lip balms that come with the multi pack are great to carry in your purse for dry lips better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients of the back of my coconut container say that it is dermatologist tested, quick absorbing and non greasy (yes, it is), long-lasting moisture</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and the variety pack lets you enjoy a number of scents.  </li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable (half the cost of some of the others) and the results are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and highly reccommend it, but this time it just was not what we are used to from this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> These are high quality lotions.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a high quality lotion that will keep us all moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> Only, please, NOT the toilet tissue (grin -- :)</li>
            <li> Ive tried the inexpensive brands and the very expensive brands and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li> I buy this product normally at the beginning of winter and it lasts all winter.</li>
            <li> Have been using the Delon body butter for a number of years everyday and love it.  </li>
            <li> The scents are lovely, long lasting and soft.</li>
            <li> so very soft skin are the results.  </li>
            <li> It also contains 2 small lip butters in mango and vanilla, which are a nice extra, especially with winter right around the corner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so soft...</li>
            <li> It means it was made with natural ingredients and did not have preservatives in it.  </li>
            <li> the old delon cream in the orange tube is discontinued</li>
            <li> Nearly all body butters I&#x27;ve tried stink.</li>
            <li> The vanilla smells a little &#x27;older&#x27; but the the rest of the scents are young and fresh.</li>
            <li> No down side.</li>
            <li> was unbelievable and shipped free.  </li>
            <li> TO ONLY HAVE HALF OF THE ORIGINAL AMOUNTS</li>
            <li> At this price, the value is absolutely unheard of for such a solid product.</li>
            <li> If it was cheaper, it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal, but seeing as the containers had pretty much nothing, not worth it!</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try and needless to say, I love these body butters!</li>
            <li> the  cans only seem half full and on one side of the can.  </li>
            <li> Your body and lips will be soft to the touch with daily use of your succulent butters.  </li>
            <li> We first found this item at Costco last fall, but as you know specialty items like this don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> , so they last a while, even with frequent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Sorry, but if the containers were full, it would be worth the money.</li>
            <li> The lip balms are smoothe and give your lips a natural long lasting shine and keep your lips moist not \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The body butter absorbs well and seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> but then I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere for awhile after moving to the extra dry climate in Arizona.  </li>
            <li> Even the coconut body butter is very subtle and sweet not oily like some coconut scented products tend to be.  </li>
            <li> The scents are not overwhelming and come in mature scents such as coconut and olive</li>
            <li> During the dry winter months my skin would get dry and itchy and irritated.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Amazon always delivers sooner than the expected delivery time.  </li>
            <li> Every container is 3/4 empty..</li>
            <li> Some other brands are greasy and just \\&quot;sit\\&quot; on the skin, but Delon soaks in and makes my skin feel \\&quot;young\\&quot; again.  </li>
            <li> My only small issue is that it&#x27;s so hard to open the packaging --</li>
            <li> I have had some eczema problems for the last 2 years and it has been under control lately.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not worth 26</li>
            <li> This Body buuter did not live up to my usual expectations.</li>
            <li> I use it year round</li>
            <li> There were cracks in 3 of the containers so when we opened them the butter was all dried out.</li>
            <li> We usually use shea butter, but that is heavy for the warmer months and sometimes a bit stinky.</li>
            <li> (A little gift bag, a sheet of tissue paper, voila!)  </li>
            <li> I usually buy this body butter at Costco but when they don&#x27;t have it, I buy it online.  </li>
            <li> This was the least expensive site on EBAY as I have purchased this product several times.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> too bad Costco only brings these around during Christmastime</li>
            <li> The lip butter was a 5 star, but the body butter was awful and isn&#x27;t even worth 1 star.</li>
            <li> I had a very hard time sharing this variety pack with my daughter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from Victoria&#x27;s Secret, Bath and Body, The Body Shop, and even the pricier Hempz lotions, but none of them were satisfactory to me.</li>
            <li> I was desperate and went on line looking for this butter body.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the lip moisture thou, it dries my lips :(</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried handfuls of body moisturizers and ditched each one because I hate that \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feeling you get from them.</li>
            <li> AS ON ONE SIDE OF THE CONTAINER IS VIRTUALLY EMPTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells so good, and makes my skin feel silky. I am going through it like water.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the money. This was the least expensive site on EBAY as I have purchased this product several times.</li>
            <li> I have tried many skin moisturizers over the years but the Delcon Body Butter has been the best. I first found it at Costco bought the multi pack and loved it but when it ran out Costco didn&#x27;t carry it anymore. Lo and behold I found it on Amazon!  I put it on head to toe after my shower every day. During the dry winter months my skin would get dry and itchy and irritated. Delcon has ended this for me. I use it year round and my skin has never looked better. The little lip balms that come with the multi pack are great to carry in your purse for dry lips better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting great skin. It comes in various scents all are pleasant and not over powering. Fabulous product!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  You just can&#x27;t get a better deal on the price.  This is really rich body butter, and had a light fragrance.  It&#x27;s not too &amp;#34;froo froo&amp;#34;, because even my husband uses it!</li>
            <li> I love the product and was happy to find it through Amazon.  The service was great--very quick and easy.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THIS PACKAGE THAT CONTAINS  4 BODY BUTTERS AND 2 LIP MOISTURIZERS, RECEIVING TODAY. THE ORDER ARRIVED VERY TIMELY BUT THE CONTENTS ARE A RIP OFF! I OPENED THE BODY BUTTERS AND EACH APPEARS TO ONLY HAVE HALF OF THE ORIGINAL AMOUNTS AS ON ONE SIDE OF THE CONTAINER IS VIRTUALLY EMPTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS PRODUCT WAS FROM J &amp; P TRADING COMPANY.</li>
            <li> This body butter variety pack is amazing. They glide on your skin like...well, BUTTER! The scents are lovely, long lasting and soft. Even the coconut body butter is very subtle and sweet not oily like some coconut scented products tend to be.  When you shower at the end of the day, you are aware of the smoothness on your skin from the appliction of these body butters. The lip balms are smoothe and give your lips a natural long lasting shine and keep your lips moist not \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;. I had a very hard time sharing this variety pack with my daughter.</li>
            <li> I love this body butter! Ive tried the inexpensive brands and the very expensive brands and this is by far the best! The price is perfect and the body is just as good if not better than the stuff that costs 5 times as much. I love all the smells and i always get compliments on how good i smell. When i run out i buy more and even order it for my friends! absolutely love this stuff!</li>
            <li> The Delon body butter has a wonderfully smooth consistency. The scents are light. The matching lip balms make this a wonderful gift.</li>
            <li> This is the best in the world - great product.  I would never buy another brand of body butter. There is no comparison,</li>
            <li> Delon makes the BEST moisturizing body butter I have found! I especially like it on the driest areas, such as the bottoms of my feet, elbows, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only butter butter that deeply moisturizes your skin. Not only does it smell divine...but it feels so good to the touch~&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Delon!!!!</li>
            <li> Gifts ....great product.  Everyone loves this.  Lip balm a fav but all liked body butter too.  Would buy again for self and friends</li>
            <li> This line of body butters and lip moisturizers is a fabulous deal. The quality of the butters is top notch and the variety of scents gives you options from odorless olive to fresh mango to tropical coconut to delightful vanilla. Your body and lips will be soft to the touch with daily use of your succulent butters.  Or buy the package and break it up for gift giving or party favors! A real winner!</li>
            <li> Love the creamy feel and smells great.  My favorite is the Coconut and white chocolate.  Don&#x27;t love the mango smell.</li>
            <li> I buy this product normally at the beginning of winter and it lasts all winter. Keeps my skin soft and it lasts for about 7-8 hours, perfect for a work day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this the first time at CostCo for the wife.  She&#x27;s indicated she tried several others but none as good at moisturizing.  Seems to like the scents as well.  Smell good to me also.</li>
            <li> I will buy this product again.  It is the BEST lotion/cream for my skin.  It smells delicious every time I  put in on.  Love this product will buy again and again and again and agaiin!!!</li>
            <li> Have been buying for years at Costco.  This year they did not have so lucky to find on Amazon.  This is a great moisturizer and I like to have the cans on hand for emergency gifts.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  I absolutely love it! And for the price I gave 2 away and kept 2 for me! Soft, not greasy, light scents.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Delon Body Butter especially the coconut and vanila.  It keeps my skin moist especially in the winter.  It is the best!</li>
            <li> I buy only Delon...so soft...nice fragrance&#x27;s that are not overpowering.  I have very dry skin and they keep my skin feeling soft and cool.</li>
            <li> I love the body butter but the lip balm seems to chap my lips so I do not use it.  The body butter absorbs well and seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Never sticky, leaves a nice sheen on the skin, and smells great. I order it all the time and go through the body butter much faster than the lip balm. My only small issue is that it&#x27;s so hard to open the packaging -- but this is a very good deal and worth the trouble!</li>
            <li> The lotion is excellent at moisturizing.  It does have a greasy afterfeel but I actually like that.  The lotion also keeps for a good long time if you do not open it.  Not so the lip balm.  Today I just opened one of the lip balms that I actually purchased over six months ago and it was rancid.  That is a good thing in a way.  It means it was made with natural ingredients and did not have preservatives in it.  But if you do not plan on using the lip balm right when you get the product you should be warned that it does not shelve well at all.</li>
            <li> I actually received this as a gift last year and gave it as a gift this year!  Love the combo of body butter and lip moisturizer - the coconut is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Flat out great product. The moisturizer is thick and creamy. It goes on smoothly and absorbs rapidly. The scents are superb and last throughout the day. I have had multiple compliments and tell everyone about this product. The lip moisturizers are a nice bonus. They match nicely with a couple of the body butters.</li>
            <li> This is the only after-shower body cream I&#x27;ll use.  It&#x27;s rich and emollient; love all the &#x27;flavors&#x27;!  My son has eczema and also uses it to soothe his itchy skin after a shower.</li>
            <li> Have been using the Delon body butter for a number of years everyday and love it.  Have used as gifts and friends have asked me to order for them.  GRAET PRICE WITH THIS SELLER A D FAST SHIPPING!  Expiration dates were 2015 so know product is fresh.  I mix with vitamin E lotion so very soft skin are the results.  I have used about 6 different scents and love them all.</li>
            <li> the old delon cream in the orange tube is discontinued so i got these as a gift, my mom loved them are say that are the best cream she ever tried, these are canadian and even the fact that I live in canada, they are way more cheaper in amazon foir the us! buy them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several packages of this body butter over the years. It&#x27;s not sticky and goes real smoothly.  Definitely a good buy and the favors smell very nice.</li>
            <li> I wish they would fill the containers more but the product is absolutely wonderful.  I first bought it at Costco in Canada and now order through Amazon in the U.S.  Plus - a great price!</li>
            <li> A friend introduced me to Delon Body Butter and I love it.  It lasts a long time and the variety pack lets you enjoy a number of scents.  Buying the variety pack is also a very good value.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fantastically happy I purchased this.  These are full size body butters made with ingredients that you are NOT scared to google search. The scents are not overwhelming and come in mature scents such as coconut and olive (olive surprised me by smelling so good!).  At this price, the value is absolutely unheard of for such a solid product.</li>
            <li> We love Delon Body Butter!  It soaks into skin and protects from dryness!  It isn&#x27;t greasy! Recommend it for every season!</li>
            <li> I found out this cream last year for Christmas and it&#x27;s  a very, very good cream. Now I use only this cream, I prefer Olive Cream because it doesn&#x27;t smell to strong.</li>
            <li> This product is so soothing and smooth to put on.  It&#x27;s lip balm is a real bonus.  I use both items with confidence that my skin and lips will stay hydrated all day  .</li>
            <li> I love it - Fabulously creamy. I received it originally as a gift, but then I purchased it again for myself and a friend</li>
            <li> the delon body butter is a great buy.  the  cans only seem half full and on one side of the can.  is this the way it is supposed to be?&lt;br /&gt;price was unbelievable and shipped free.  love that</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift, so I can&#x27;t review the quality of the product (there are plenty of those anyway). I just wanted to say what a pretty gift it makes. It is on a really big card with lovely pictures of flowers and fruit.The card and the jars are bigger than they look in the picture. There are scratch and sniff patches for each scent (they were very nice). I got it for my mother-in-law&#x27;s Mother&#x27;s Day gift and after I saw it I&#x27;m ordering more for gifts. Very nice!</li>
            <li> This Body buuter did not live up to my usual expectations. Packedged in a horrable plastic  ??? Took forever to open. ( always got them in a box never wrapped in plastic. There were cracks in 3 of the containers so when we opened them the butter was all dried out. I have used this product for years and highly reccommend it, but this time it just was not what we are used to from this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I used to get them at Costco for around $14. for four butters and two lip glosses but then I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere for awhile after moving to the extra dry climate in Arizona.  I did find it for sale for $16. and $18. for one body butter but wanted to stock up so went to Amazon.  I bought the four-pack with two lip glosses for a bargain rate at Amazon and use them every day.  I find the lip glosses are much more healing than any chapstick I have tried and the body butter not only keeps your skin, feet, hands moist but gives you a nice healthy shine :-)</li>
            <li> I have tried a variety of body butters on the market and in my opinion, Delon stacks up as one of the best.  The price is very reasonable (half the cost of some of the others) and the results are fantastic.  Some other brands are greasy and just \\&quot;sit\\&quot; on the skin, but Delon soaks in and makes my skin feel \\&quot;young\\&quot; again.  I especially like the \\&quot;vanilla\\&quot; scent and it smells exactly like another brand that I buy that is twice the price.</li>
            <li> Delon Body Butter Variety Pack. It was a gift for my daughter. I let her use some of mine and she was so excited when she received hers in the mail. It is an excellent, silky smooth and smells delicious</li>
            <li> These are high quality lotions. Better than bath and body works by far. I bought for myself and then ordered for my sister as a gift. The vanilla smells a little &#x27;older&#x27; but the the rest of the scents are young and fresh.</li>
            <li> I buy this every year.  It is a requested gift from the women in my family.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve ever used that actually shows long-term results and moisturizes my skin adequately. This pack is also a great deal for what you get. Also it&#x27;s cruelty-free and dermatologist tested!</li>
            <li> We first found this item at Costco last fall, but as you know specialty items like this don&#x27;t last long. As a mom who is constantly trying to fight the \\&quot;ash\\&quot; :-) I am always looking for a high quality lotion that will keep us all moisturized all day. We usually use shea butter, but that is heavy for the warmer months and sometimes a bit stinky. I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve finally found a fragrant alternative!! Love it!</li>
            <li> this product is wonderful.  I love it and I even when back to Costco to buy more and it was gone.  I was desperate and went on line looking for this butter body.  so glad I did this. I don&#x27;t like the lip moisture thou, it dries my lips :(</li>
            <li> I love body butter.  I really only wanted the coconut body butter but I had to order the 3 pack.  I think the product is excellent.  Amazon always delivers sooner than the expected delivery time.  I like the lip moisterizer also.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and it helps moisturising my dry skin. I can really feel the difference before and after I use this product.</li>
            <li> My children love the body butter and lip moisturizer. I truly enjoy using the body butter myself. Recommend the variety set.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this body butter at Costco but when they don&#x27;t have it, I buy it online.  This is an amazing product!  Makes my skin smooth and soft all day.</li>
            <li> I first purchased these body butters at Costco, and was impressed with how well they moisturized my dry skin.  Since then I have been buying them on Amazon, which has even better deals, and I still LOVE the product!  The lip gloss that comes with them is wonderful too!</li>
            <li> Jars are full size, the kind you would pay $10-$20 each for at the bath &amp; body stores.  Such an excellent price and excellent quality.  It sounds like a weird &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;, but the olive is my favorite.  On my second jar, and use the others for gifts.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome.  No down side.</li>
            <li> I got this set as gifts for my family that stayed with us for a week.  We gave each other facials with them and everyone took home their favorite scent.  It sinks into the skin with a light fragrance, my favorite being the coconut; my hubby always mentions how nice it smells.  He asked me if I had any moisturizer a while back and I gave him several bottles and jars that I had in my cabinet and he returned them all but the Delon vanilla scented body butter commenting the others were either too greasy feeling or too strongly scented.  The set is a great value.</li>
            <li> I make my own body butter with shea butter and a variety of oils and fragrances yet the Delon Body Butter has better fragrances than I can produce.  My skin absorbs all of the Delon Body Butter immediately whereas my homemade body butter takes longer to absorb.  Delon Body Butter is a product I will continue to purchase through Amazon as their prices match/beat the price I pay even at warehouses for it.  Thanks for offering this product.</li>
            <li> These body butters are very rich and smell divine, they dissolve well into the skin and skin still feels hydrated the following day.  So glad to find these on Amazon.</li>
            <li> What a nice treat for ME!  I have had some eczema problems for the last 2 years and it has been under control lately.  One of the things I do to keep it under control is to try to keep my skin moist (and pray).  This product (twice a day--once before work in the morning and once in the evening before bed) does a great job at keeping my skin moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a rich body butter, like a Ghirardelli chocolate bar.  It is yummy, with such a nice gentle smell and a rich, creamy feel. I just rubbed some on while I was talking to you. This 4 pack contains 4 nice size containers of body butter(6.9 fl oz each)(vanilla, coconut, olive, and mango). It looks like the same size container that you pay much more for in the store in the malls. It also contains 2 small lip butters in mango and vanilla, which are a nice extra, especially with winter right around the corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients of the back of my coconut container say that it is dermatologist tested, quick absorbing and non greasy (yes, it is), long-lasting moisture (yes, it is), and not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, my favorites are mango and coconut.  They are all nice, and for this price, you can keep your favorite(s) and use the others for gifts. (A little gift bag, a sheet of tissue paper, voila!)  Only, please, NOT the toilet tissue (grin -- :)</li>
            <li> Nearly all body butters I&#x27;ve tried stink. The vanilla doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla and so on. Then they feel sticky or simply don&#x27;t moisturize. This body butter is completely different. Every smell actually smells real and super yummy!  My husband hates scented stuff but when I use these he knows exactly what scent it is and always mentions how good it smells. These body butters are turning into my signature scents LoL!  I have mild eczema but don&#x27;t even notice it when I use these after each shower. It soaks into my skin quickly and lasts over 24 hrs.  My skin is moist and I don&#x27;t stink!  What else could you ask for with a body butter?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried handfuls of body moisturizers and ditched each one because I hate that \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; feeling you get from them. You know, that feeling when it just sits on your skin and doesn&#x27;t absorb? I&#x27;ve tried everything from Victoria&#x27;s Secret, Bath and Body, The Body Shop, and even the pricier Hempz lotions, but none of them were satisfactory to me. I saw this Delon body butter variety pack at Costco; it was the same package but only $10. I decided to give it a try and needless to say, I love these body butters! They are, hands down, the best body butters I&#x27;ve ever used. The scents are light and not overwhelming but still smell great. They are also super moisturizing, absorb quickly into your skin, and don&#x27;t leave you with that greasy feeling. I gave one of the body butters away and still have three left. Each one is 6.9 fl. oz, so they last a while, even with frequent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad Costco only brings these around during Christmastime but I am grateful that I can still find them on Amazon at an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy these! Your skin will love you for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Delon before, I actually ordered this because I&#x27;m in love with the coconut scent and I ran out, and figured it would be interesting to see different scents as well seeing as Delon is a wonderful company and produces amazing moisturizing body butter.&lt;br /&gt;The scents all smell wonderful I will say, and the lip moisturizers were fantastic. Sadly, that was the best part of this. Upon opening this today, I was excited to have plenty of butters. Every container is 3/4 empty.. ugh? And most of what IS in there, is liquid. The lip butter was a 5 star, but the body butter was awful and isn&#x27;t even worth 1 star. But, I do enjoy the lip butter perfectly. So, I rated this product with 2 stars. Sorry, but if the containers were full, it would be worth the money. It&#x27;s certainly not worth 26$ maybe about 10. If it was cheaper, it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal, but seeing as the containers had pretty much nothing, not worth it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful variety of fragrances and lip gloss! My favorite moisturerizer! I have purchased this for gifts twice and the set has been deemed &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is the best body butter I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I received my package quickly.  Very happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> great body cream, will last a very long time!</li>
            <li> I found this at costco first. I loved it and realized this was going to be a must-have as my daily moisturizer. I am so thrilled they had the same package on amazon. It is dry in Vegas and this stuff keeps my skin feeling amazing. I have bought this as a gift for my mom, sister, daughter and best friends and all of them text to tell me how much they love the stuff!</li>
            <li> What can I say.. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. And the value and scents are great. Will order again.</li>
