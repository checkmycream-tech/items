            <li>but hopefully even better ones.</li>

            <li>Appropriate heat was used under a bonnet dryer for the recommended amount of time.</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li>so I will be able to get many uses out of just this one bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>I hope over time I seem better results.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more...</li>
            <li>What else more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>Sebastian Cellophanes are great for making your natural color pop with shine.</li>
            <li>I loved it, but I had no idea how much it would damage my hair.  </li>
            <li>At all; not even dear darling hubby and he didn&#x27;t get \\&quot;Cellophaned\\&quot;-sounds kinda cool when you whisper it, huh? \\&quot;Cellophaned\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>It revives the color nicely and leaves hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Helps to keep hair strong and shiny for about 30 days.</li>
            <li>and it has worked just fine</li>
            <li>We have all been using Clairol&#x27;s Shine Happy (now called Herbal Essences All That Shine) for the last 5 years</li>
            <li>have used this in my salon for 25 years, safe, dependable and keeps fine hair in great condition, adds body strength and shine, apply to clean damp (towel dried)</li>
            <li>only do cellophanes provide excellent gloss, they also leave your hair so soft and feathery</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly easy to apply and added the right amount of shine.  </li>
            <li>Darling hubby and I just celebrated our 25th anniversary (yay!)so</li>
            <li>Darling hubby and I just celebrated our 25th anniversary (yay!)so</li>
            <li>I mixed this with the coffee bean by Sebastian and got a really good shine.  </li>
            <li>Especially good after a chemical, color or on African American hair.  </li>
            <li>also provides good coverage for my unruly grey hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my hair is also super fine and straight, if that makes a difference.</li>
            <li>I really Like it and recomend it!!</li>
            <li>buy the Coffee bean and Golden brunette.</li>
            <li>I apply diligently on dry hair, making sure I didn&#x27;t miss a spot, and this time I boiled the packs in my heat cap to make sure the heat was pretty hot.  </li>
            <li>The directions say to then shampoo and condition again, but I just apply some conditioner and then rinse it out right away.  </li>
            <li>My curly hair looks very shiny and really reflects light.  </li>
            <li>If I REALLY looked closely, the top (virgin) part of my hair could pass off as a little more shiny, but it could be from my bumble and bumble hairdresser invisible oil</li>
            <li>we \\&quot;Leroyed\\&quot; and tried Cellophanes exactly as directed and it was not under-applied nor over-applied.</li>
            <li>we \\&quot;Leroyed\\&quot; and tried Cellophanes exactly as directed and it was not under-applied nor over-applied.</li>
            <li>Doing it again the first week of March.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as described</li>
            <li>but I think with the 2nd I will be able to determine</li>
            <li>The treatment left by hair feeling fuller and more bouncy.</li>
            <li>The first time I did it, I didn&#x27;t use heat.  </li>
            <li>Because I took forever the second time making sure</li>
            <li>( if you flat iron) you wont be able to keep you fingers out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have anything positive to say about this.</li>
            <li>works as usual, add shine and bright and gloss to ur hair</li>
            <li>Would purchase this again and highly recommend for anyone with damaged, dull hair or just a great conditioning product with lots of shine.</li>
            <li>my hair is type 3 , naturally wavy , baby fine and soft.</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>If you follow the directions on the package it works really well.</li>
            <li>I got the clear one, and used it over freshly redyed hair.</li>
            <li>Also my hair looks brittle and really frizzy.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions, washing my hair before and after, and following with a light conditioner.</li>
            <li>My wife used this to prolong her hair color add shine &amp; condition her hair, all of which it did very well.  </li>
            <li>process under dry for thirty minutes, cool, and finish with your regular conditioner, then rinse and LOVE your new hair!</li>
            <li>did that better than other frizz fighters I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe I did not get my hair clean enough so the product did not hold...</li>
            <li>My hair  is really fine and dry  </li>
            <li>applied product for first time 2 weeks ago &amp; assuming that a 2nd application will get any spots I missed or that didn&#x27;t get as much the first time.  </li>
            <li>When I buy this, I can do more than one treatment for much less than one visit to the hairdresser.</li>
            <li>Clairol left the hair feeling smooth and not weighed down; cooperative even for fine sometimes irritable hair.</li>
            <li>Clairol left the hair feeling smooth and not weighed down; cooperative even for fine sometimes irritable hair.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to order it make sure it is CLEAR and not any other color.</li>
            <li>I can only assume that proves the importance of adding heat to the process.</li>
            <li>The Clairol allowed fully normal styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Clairol allowed fully normal styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time, I followed the directions exactly (Shampoo hair, towel dry 75%, apply to hair liberally, apply heat, and wash out normally).  </li>
            <li>I have an ombre in my hair already, the top of my head my natural jet black hair, the bottom as a chestnut brown color.  </li>
            <li>I am an african american female with natural hair (no straightening chemicals used), and I used this hoping it would give my hair a nice gloss.</li>
            <li>Being a salon product, we felt that Cellophanes would be better quality than the cheap OTC Clairol (sorry, Clairol)and</li>
            <li>That is great if you want subtle lightening every single time.</li>
            <li>This is a review from 3 women in the same household with two different hair types (myself and my 2 adult daughters) and my outnumbered darling hubby who happily served in his usual capacity as the official peanut gallery:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I used CLEAR cellophane!</li>
            <li>My hair is exactly the same not better not worst.</li>
            <li>On both hair types we had the same results: no shine other than that of naturally healthy non shine-treated hair.</li>
            <li>On both hair types we had the same results: no shine other than that of naturally healthy non shine-treated hair.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell that big of a difference with the first application</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Usually I will mix clear with the others to get more of a glossy shine.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>I will purchase this product again, but the tube is so large I believe it will last me quite a while.</li>
            <li>If anything, it might actually look a little duller, though the tube says it&#x27;s safe to use on colored hair.</li>
            <li>the Clairol can and will lift a bit of color while depositing the clear shiny wonderfulness that we all desire.</li>
            <li>The Cellophanes Clear did not deliver on our hair like the Clairol in any relatable way.</li>
            <li>This product was described as clear but it had an amber tint in the container.  </li>
            <li>I got the clear.</li>
            <li>Bought this in clear to &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34; my pre-existing hair color</li>
            <li>I got the clear one</li>
            <li>I used clear</li>
            <li>I got the clear version.  </li>
            <li>It did leave my hair soft and glossy but I won&#x27;t use it again as it spoils the color.</li>
            <li>Made my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still going to experiment a bit with it, but so far I do not notice any damage at all.</li>
            <li>My hair feels smoother and it has a natural shine.  </li>
            <li>So far I have ordered 2 of these</li>
            <li>left my hair shiney and very manageable.</li>
            <li>I had each strand coated, the first strands I applied it to got dry from the product</li>
            <li>Actually, getting rid of frizz is my main problem &amp; Clear Cellophanes</li>
            <li>I could see how shiny it was after blow drying it, but when I flat ironed it, I was really blown away.</li>
            <li>My first at home treatment with Soft &#x27;N Style Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer System only showed minor improvement.  </li>
            <li>The Cellophanes left a slightly limp texture-even on the easy care hair and style did not hold as well.</li>
            <li>The Cellophanes left a slightly limp texture-even on the easy care hair and style did not hold as well.</li>
            <li>Last summer I had my dyed red hair bleached and dyed a light pink.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Clear and it makes my hair feel soft and adds so much shine to it especially after I flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li>I have African-American hair but with a slightly finer texture but this product is definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Does exactly as promised, and it&#x27;s long lasting.  </li>
            <li>The treatment left my hair feeling a little dry so make sure to condition with a moisturizing conditioner  </li>
            <li>My poor curly hair wouldn&#x27;t curl any more and after every blow out</li>
            <li>Okay back to why I&#x27;m dissing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair types that this product was used on:&lt;br /&gt;Daughter one has thick but finely textured naturally colored long hair that fights every style and product and needs volume.&lt;br /&gt;Daughter two and myself have thick, naturally wavy, naturally colored long hair (no grey on me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those people who never writes reviews, good or bad.  </li>

            <li> Also my hair looks brittle and really frizzy.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions, washing my hair before and after, and following with a light conditioner.</li>
            <li> My wife used this to prolong her hair color add shine &amp; condition her hair, all of which it did very well.  </li>
            <li> process under dry for thirty minutes, cool, and finish with your regular conditioner, then rinse and LOVE your new hair!</li>
            <li> did that better than other frizz fighters I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe I did not get my hair clean enough so the product did not hold...</li>
            <li> My hair  is really fine and dry  </li>
            <li> applied product for first time 2 weeks ago &amp; assuming that a 2nd application will get any spots I missed or that didn&#x27;t get as much the first time.  </li>
            <li> When I buy this, I can do more than one treatment for much less than one visit to the hairdresser.</li>
            <li> Clairol left the hair feeling smooth and not weighed down; cooperative even for fine sometimes irritable hair.</li>

            <li> I had high hopes for this product based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to order it make sure it is CLEAR and not any other color.</li>
            <li> I can only assume that proves the importance of adding heat to the process.</li>
            <li> The Clairol allowed fully normal styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Clairol allowed fully normal styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time, I followed the directions exactly (Shampoo hair, towel dry 75%, apply to hair liberally, apply heat, and wash out normally).  </li>
            <li> I have an ombre in my hair already, the top of my head my natural jet black hair, the bottom as a chestnut brown color.  </li>
            <li> I am an african american female with natural hair (no straightening chemicals used), and I used this hoping it would give my hair a nice gloss.</li>
            <li> Being a salon product, we felt that Cellophanes would be better quality than the cheap OTC Clairol (sorry, Clairol)and</li>
            <li> That is great if you want subtle lightening every single time.</li>
            <li> This is a review from 3 women in the same household with two different hair types (myself and my 2 adult daughters) and my outnumbered darling hubby who happily served in his usual capacity as the official peanut gallery:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I used CLEAR cellophane!</li>
            <li> My hair is exactly the same not better not worst.</li>
            <li> On both hair types we had the same results: no shine other than that of naturally healthy non shine-treated hair.</li>

            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell that big of a difference with the first application</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Usually I will mix clear with the others to get more of a glossy shine.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> I will purchase this product again, but the tube is so large I believe it will last me quite a while.</li>
            <li> If anything, it might actually look a little duller, though the tube says it&#x27;s safe to use on colored hair.</li>
            <li> the Clairol can and will lift a bit of color while depositing the clear shiny wonderfulness that we all desire.</li>
            <li> The Cellophanes Clear did not deliver on our hair like the Clairol in any relatable way.</li>
            <li> This product was described as clear but it had an amber tint in the container.  </li>
            <li> I got the clear.</li>
            <li> Bought this in clear to &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34; my pre-existing hair color</li>
            <li> I got the clear one</li>
            <li> I used clear</li>
            <li> I got the clear version.  </li>
            <li> It did leave my hair soft and glossy but I won&#x27;t use it again as it spoils the color.</li>
            <li> Made my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still going to experiment a bit with it, but so far I do not notice any damage at all.</li>
            <li> My hair feels smoother and it has a natural shine.  </li>
            <li> So far I have ordered 2 of these</li>
            <li> left my hair shiney and very manageable.</li>
            <li> I had each strand coated, the first strands I applied it to got dry from the product</li>
            <li> Actually, getting rid of frizz is my main problem &amp; Clear Cellophanes</li>
            <li> I could see how shiny it was after blow drying it, but when I flat ironed it, I was really blown away.</li>
            <li> My first at home treatment with Soft &#x27;N Style Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer System only showed minor improvement.  </li>
            <li> The Cellophanes left a slightly limp texture-even on the easy care hair and style did not hold as well.</li>
            <li> The Cellophanes left a slightly limp texture-even on the easy care hair and style did not hold as well.</li>
            <li> Last summer I had my dyed red hair bleached and dyed a light pink.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Clear and it makes my hair feel soft and adds so much shine to it especially after I flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> I have African-American hair but with a slightly finer texture but this product is definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as promised, and it&#x27;s long lasting.  </li>
            <li> The treatment left my hair feeling a little dry so make sure to condition with a moisturizing conditioner  </li>
            <li> My poor curly hair wouldn&#x27;t curl any more and after every blow out</li>
            <li> Okay back to why I&#x27;m dissing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair types that this product was used on:&lt;br /&gt;Daughter one has thick but finely textured naturally colored long hair that fights every style and product and needs volume.&lt;br /&gt;Daughter two and myself have thick, naturally wavy, naturally colored long hair (no grey on me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who never writes reviews, good or bad.  </li>
            <li> I am also one of those people that were regrettably born with SUPER dry/non-shiny wavy hair, the type where every hairdresser you encounter comments on how dry and thick it is.  </li>
            <li> Left it on a little while longer and washed it out,  using redken&#x27;s all soft shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> As long as they don&#x27;t change their pricing, I&#x27;ll keep buying this forever.</li>
            <li> and it seems to add body and shine to my hair which is gradually turning grey!</li>
            <li> It takes a long time and my arms were sore afterwards!</li>
            <li> You shampoo your hair then towel dry your hair and apply the product.</li>
            <li> my ends were extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I rinse the conditioner off and towel dry my hair so that it is damp, not dripping.  </li>
            <li> to dry hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;We wanted an alternative to our usual shine treatment after it started to become more difficult to locate and we wanted a no-lift, deposit-only type of product.</li>
            <li> can I say?&lt;br /&gt;I left it on my hair as recommended and all it did was to stain my hands black when washing my hair and did not cover even a bit of the gray hair.  </li>
            <li> Due to all the coloring I have done to my hair, it began to look dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> This clear Cellophane made my hair go from dull to shiny, silky and fuller.</li>
            <li> can be mixed with other colors from this line, to make less intence color or maybe ligher.....</li>
            <li> so I am not sure how long it would last otherwise.</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing what I expected.</li>
            <li> Instead it seemed a little &amp;#34;brassier&amp;#34; and my color turned flat, one-dimensional.</li>
            <li> This was a really huge disappointment for all of us because we were expecting at least similar results</li>
            <li> This was a really huge disappointment for all of us because we were expecting at least similar results</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> Sadly the results do not last very long, only one or two washes.</li>
            <li> had turned a dull yellow.  </li>
            <li> Left my hair really dull, whatever shine I had before application is gone.</li>
            <li> When it was all rinsed out and my hair was dried and styled my carefully colored platinum hair</li>
            <li> I have tried other products and this ONE IS THE ONE for me!  </li>
            <li> #34;mirror-like shine!&amp;#34;  Guess I&#x27;ll go find other ways to achieve my shiny lock dreams!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that my hair looked exactly the same...</li>
            <li> but I wanted a little &#x27;umph&#x27;...</li>
            <li> My hair feels a little softer and smoother and is a little bit shiny.  </li>
            <li> but it did seem to help a little bit</li>
            <li> but you can also chose one of the tinted ones which deposits a little bit of color to your hair.</li>
            <li> I did trim my ends a little and began using this product.</li>
            <li> Use it a few days after coloring hair but before washing.</li>
            <li> No shine and dried out my hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Waaah, I&#x27;m sad, especially since other reviewers said they got &amp;</li>
            <li> The bottom half (chestnut brown part) was dull and non-shiny as hair</li>
            <li> After about 15 minutes of heat, you re-shampoo and then condition and style as usual.</li>
            <li> but maybe if used in salons, you need to apply a lot of heat to the scalp after you apply this product to your hair, so not sure how this can be done it home.  </li>
            <li> For months my hair was dull and breaking.  </li>
            <li> It still looked dull, however, so someone recommended I try this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair is curly and thick.</li>
            <li> This product provides a transparent glossy color coverage that I have been unable to obtain with any other semi permanent coloring systems.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m part of the 11% that not only am giving it a 1 star but also am actively seeking to write a review because of how disappointed I am!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No good effect, anyway...my hair was not shinier at all.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I tried this out covering it with a shower cap and using a hairdryer on it for heat for a few minutes until I got bored with it.  </li>
            <li> that cooperates fully with every style and product; we have loads of volume.&lt;br /&gt;Daughter one is insanely jealous but has learned to live with it and blames her father fully.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Sebastian</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall we are very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product it helped with my end a lot and made my hair so shiny. i would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> I use this Cellophane in between hair coloring appointments. It revives the color nicely and leaves hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Best hair cellophane I have ever used. In my home country the hairdresser charges $700 plus for one hair cellophane treatment. When I buy this, I can do more than one treatment for much less than one visit to the hairdresser.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product based on the reviews. My hair is curly and thick.Followed the instructions with no results. My hair is exactly the same not better not worst.</li>
            <li> I had used Sebastian Laminates in my own studio for years and love the product and it&#x27;s many uses.  I&#x27;m always pleased with the product and hope they never eliminate the product from their line.</li>
            <li> Love this product ! I purchased the Clear and it makes my hair feel soft and adds so much shine to it especially after I flat iron my hair. I have African-American hair but with a slightly finer texture but this product is definitely worth the purchase. I re-apply the rinse every six weeks and sit under the dryer for approx 25 mins. Will buy again !</li>
            <li> great product. fast shipping</li>
            <li> Great product! Helps to keep hair strong and shiny for about 30 days.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews that said all you need to do is put a plastic shower cap on your head for a while if you don&#x27;t have a hair dryer.  I did this, but to NO effect.  No good effect, anyway...my hair was not shinier at all.  Instead it seemed a little &amp;#34;brassier&amp;#34; and my color turned flat, one-dimensional. And I used CLEAR cellophane! I can only assume that proves the importance of adding heat to the process.</li>
            <li> Use it a few days after coloring hair but before washing. Helps keep color</li>
            <li> This is a review from 3 women in the same household with two different hair types (myself and my 2 adult daughters) and my outnumbered darling hubby who happily served in his usual capacity as the official peanut gallery:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We wanted an alternative to our usual shine treatment after it started to become more difficult to locate and we wanted a no-lift, deposit-only type of product. We have all been using Clairol&#x27;s Shine Happy (now called Herbal Essences All That Shine) for the last 5 years and it has worked just fine but I bought this product because it was no lift and the Clairol can and will lift a bit of color while depositing the clear shiny wonderfulness that we all desire. That is great if you want subtle lightening every single time. Being a salon product, we felt that Cellophanes would be better quality than the cheap OTC Clairol (sorry, Clairol)and it probably is but it didn&#x27;t work for any of us. At all; not even dear darling hubby and he didn&#x27;t get \\&quot;Cellophaned\\&quot;-sounds kinda cool when you whisper it, huh? \\&quot;Cellophaned\\&quot;! Okay back to why I&#x27;m dissing this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair types that this product was used on:&lt;br /&gt;Daughter one has thick but finely textured naturally colored long hair that fights every style and product and needs volume.&lt;br /&gt;Daughter two and myself have thick, naturally wavy, naturally colored long hair (no grey on me! darling hubby is another story; can&#x27;t imagine why...) that cooperates fully with every style and product; we have loads of volume.&lt;br /&gt;Daughter one is insanely jealous but has learned to live with it and blames her father fully. Father looks permanently sheepish as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all have used the Clairol Shine Happy (and the newer All That Shine) with great results. It shines just like hair color and reduces frizz which is especially great in the winter. We get strangers asking us what we use on our hair so we know that others notice it working, too. The Cellophanes Clear did not deliver on our hair like the Clairol in any relatable way. This was a really huge disappointment for all of us because we were expecting at least similar results but hopefully even better ones. Nope, Chuck Testa! On both hair types we had the same results: no shine other than that of naturally healthy non shine-treated hair. None. Reduced frizz (from humidity) was noted but styling was not as good as after the Clairol. Clairol left the hair feeling smooth and not weighed down; cooperative even for fine sometimes irritable hair. The Cellophanes left a slightly limp texture-even on the easy care hair and style did not hold as well. The Clairol allowed fully normal styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we \\&quot;Leroyed\\&quot; and tried Cellophanes exactly as directed and it was not under-applied nor over-applied. Appropriate heat was used under a bonnet dryer for the recommended amount of time. The family formed an observation circle when all was said and done and pronounced that there was no change on anybody&#x27;s hair; hubby&#x27;s included. The mirror agreed fully and blamed it squarely on the Evil Queen, Regina. We were not amused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall we are very disappointed. Darling hubby and I just celebrated our 25th anniversary (yay!)so I did an emergency \\&quot;All That Shine\\&quot; before our fine dining date and Bam! shiny locks of loveliness in 10 minutes and no dryer needed. That hair even shone in the candlelit restaurant. Soooo,  I am back to researching a no-lift product once again. If anyone has any suggestions; please leave a comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are very happy for those who do like this product but it just didn&#x27;t do anything for us regardless of hair type and the following of label directions.

            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to change my haircolor but I wanted a little &#x27;umph&#x27;...this product did the trick.  It&#x27;s fairly easy to apply and added the right amount of shine.  Made my hair look healthier without adding color.</li>
            <li> This product was described as clear but it had an amber tint in the container.  When it was all rinsed out and my hair was dried and styled my carefully colored platinum hair had turned a dull yellow.  It did leave my hair soft and glossy but I won&#x27;t use it again as it spoils the color.</li>
            <li> Maybe I did not get my hair clean enough so the product did not hold...I don&#x27;t know. I will try again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic seller!!!</li>
            <li> Tried it once and it seems to add body and shine to my hair which is gradually turning grey! Doing it again the first week of March.</li>
            <li> I got the clear. If you follow the directions on the package it works really well. Made my hair shiny and soft. It seems to be lasting too.  I wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing what I expected.</li>
            <li> Very good product!!!!</li>
            <li> Superir rich color, shiny, healthy looking hair are the results I have consistently experienced in 20 years of  use.</li>
            <li> I mixed this with the coffee bean by Sebastian and got a really good shine.  I&#x27;m still going to experiment a bit with it, but so far I do not notice any damage at all.</li>
            <li> My hair  is really fine and dry  but now is shine, soft and beautiful! I really Like it and recomend it!!</li>
            <li> I got the clear one, and used it over freshly redyed hair. my hair is as damaged as it gets. overly bleached, split ends, etc.  my hair is also super fine and straight, if that makes a difference. Anyway, I tried this out covering it with a shower cap and using a hairdryer on it for heat for a few minutes until I got bored with it.  Left it on a little while longer and washed it out,  using redken&#x27;s all soft shampoo and conditioner.  My hair feels a little softer and smoother and is a little bit shiny.  I wouldn&#x27;t call this product a miracle worker or anything,  but it did seem to help a little bit and I am satisfied.  I will use it again.  I like that the bottle has a generous amount of product so I will be able to get many uses out of just this one bottle.</li>
            <li> Would purchase this again and highly recommend for anyone with damaged, dull hair or just a great conditioning product with lots of shine.</li>
            <li> Bought this in clear to &amp;#34;gloss&amp;#34; my pre-existing hair color and it works great! Makes my hair look and feel stronger.</li>
            <li> good for any tipe of hair any color! can be mixed with other colors from this line, to make less intence color or maybe ligher.....works as usual, add shine and bright and gloss to ur hair</li>
            <li> Todo conforme y muy bien empaquetado. gracias</li>
            <li> No shine and dried out my hair</li>
            <li> Shine by the mile!  Gorgeous product.  Works exactly as described</li>
            <li> Sebastian Cellophanes are great for making your natural color pop with shine. This product provides a transparent glossy color coverage that I have been unable to obtain with any other semi permanent coloring systems.&lt;br /&gt;This also provides good coverage for my unruly grey hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy the Coffee bean and Golden brunette. Usually I will mix clear with the others to get more of a glossy shine.&lt;br /&gt;Not only do cellophanes provide excellent gloss, they also leave your hair so soft and feathery ( if you flat iron) you wont be able to keep you fingers out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts about six weeks for me, I am AA and I am transistioning to texlaxed. I wash my 4ab hair about 2-3x/week.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell that big of a difference with the first application but I think with the 2nd I will be able to determine</li>
            <li> This product is a cellophane hair gloss. I got the clear one but you can also chose one of the tinted ones which deposits a little bit of color to your hair. You shampoo your hair then towel dry your hair and apply the product. You then apply heat to melt the cellophane so it coats your hair. I covered my hair with a processing cap and used the a blow dryer to heat it. It takes a long time and my arms were sore afterwards! This product works best if you have the kind of hair dryer you sit under at a beauty salon. After about 15 minutes of heat, you re-shampoo and then condition and style as usual. The treatment left my hair feeling a little dry so make sure to condition with a moisturizing conditioner  The treatment left by hair feeling fuller and more bouncy. There was a noticeable shine and I got compliments on how nice my hair was looking. It is by far the best gloss treatment I have used. Sadly the results do not last very long, only one or two washes. This might be because I did it at home with a blow dryer though so I am not sure how long it would last otherwise.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Sebastian</li>
            <li> I followed the directions closely and my hair doesn&#x27;t look any shinier. If anything, it might actually look a little duller, though the tube says it&#x27;s safe to use on colored hair.</li>
            <li> Left my hair really dull, whatever shine I had before application is gone. Also my hair looks brittle and really frizzy. I don&#x27;t have anything positive to say about this. Did not work for me</li>
            <li> Due to all the coloring I have done to my hair, it began to look dry and brittle. My poor curly hair wouldn&#x27;t curl any more and after every blow out my ends were extremely dry. I did trim my ends a little and began using this product. I have seen the texture of my hair has changed. My hair feels smoother and it has a natural shine.  Shampoo, and condition your hair, after you remove the conditioner apply this product, comb your hair thoroughly to spread the product on each strand.  and leave in your hair for a  minimum 15 mins. Because this adds protein to your hair you can leave it in hair for hours if you like.</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference in my hair. Followed directions to a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> Wow! This clear Cellophane made my hair go from dull to shiny, silky and fuller. I followed the directions, washing my hair before and after, and following with a light conditioner. I left it in 15 minutes, covered my hair with a plastic grocery bag, and covered it with a heat cap. I&#x27;m sure if I had this treatment in a salon, it would cost a fortune. I plan to try the tinted Cellophane next.</li>
            <li> My first at home treatment with Soft &#x27;N Style Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer System only showed minor improvement.  I hope over time I seem better results.</li>
            <li> Although this product didn&#x27;t add alot of shine, it did help to reduce frizz &amp; made my hair softer.  Actually, getting rid of frizz is my main problem &amp; Clear Cellophanes did that better than other frizz fighters I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just applied product for first time 2 weeks ago &amp; assuming that a 2nd application will get any spots I missed or that didn&#x27;t get as much the first time.  Will re-evaluate as the summer goes on since July &amp; Aug. are the worst hair months for me.</li>
            <li> What else can I say?&lt;br /&gt;I left it on my hair as recommended and all it did was to stain my hands black when washing my hair and did not cover even a bit of the gray hair.  What a wast of money!</li>
            <li> My hair felt silky and had great shine. I used clear so I cant speak on color.</li>
            <li> My wife used this to prolong her hair color add shine &amp; condition her hair, all of which it did very well.  She said it was easy to use and price was great for the size.</li>
            <li> I am an african american female with natural hair (no straightening chemicals used), and I used this hoping it would give my hair a nice gloss. Boy was I right!!! I was simply amazed. I could see how shiny it was after blow drying it, but when I flat ironed it, I was really blown away. so shiny, so glossy... im very pleased with this product and will be buying it again!</li>
            <li> So far I have ordered 2 of these and I am very pleased how it leaves my hair.  I have tried other products and this ONE IS THE ONE for me!  If you&#x27;re going to order it make sure it is CLEAR and not any other color.</li>
            <li> I got the clear version.  The first time I did it, I didn&#x27;t use heat.  No results...  Second time, I used heat and wrapped the hair in plastic. It&#x27;s baically like a conditioning treatment.  My hair doesn&#x27;t look glossy at all.  I was expecting more...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this product is great but maybe if used in salons, you need to apply a lot of heat to the scalp after you apply this product to your hair, so not sure how this can be done it home.  Overall, made no difference to my hair.  Would not recommend</li>
            <li> Last summer I had my dyed red hair bleached and dyed a light pink.  I loved it, but I had no idea how much it would damage my hair.  For months my hair was dull and breaking.  I started doing weekly deep conditioning treatments which helped repair it and stopped the breakage.  It still looked dull, however, so someone recommended I try this product.  I now use it weekly after my deep conditioning treatment.  I rinse the conditioner off and towel dry my hair so that it is damp, not dripping.  I then apply the product generously and clip my hair up under a disposable shower cap.  I sit under my salon style dryer for 15 minutes before rinsing it out.  The directions say to then shampoo and condition again, but I just apply some conditioner and then rinse it out right away.  My curly hair looks very shiny and really reflects light.  I will purchase this product again, but the tube is so large I believe it will last me quite a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who never writes reviews, good or bad.  I am also one of those people that were regrettably born with SUPER dry/non-shiny wavy hair, the type where every hairdresser you encounter comments on how dry and thick it is.  Because I&#x27;ve had this hair all my life, I&#x27;ve always admired glossy hair (ie. Sammi Gioncola hair, for example).  I stumbled upon this and saw the rave reviews and hoped I would be in the 66% that would give it 5 stars.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;m part of the 11% that not only am giving it a 1 star but also am actively seeking to write a review because of how disappointed I am!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this twice.  The first time, I followed the directions exactly (Shampoo hair, towel dry 75%, apply to hair liberally, apply heat, and wash out normally).  I was disappointed that my hair looked exactly the same... and maybe it was my imagination, but it looked even duller!  Then I saw another reviewer&#x27;s comment saying &amp;#34;apply to dry hair if your hair is color resistant.&amp;#34;  Hmm, I thought... my hair IS color resistant!  I apply diligently on dry hair, making sure I didn&#x27;t miss a spot, and this time I boiled the packs in my heat cap to make sure the heat was pretty hot.  I even kept it on longer than 20 minutes, and my hair STILL looked the same/duller!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had skepticism when I squeezed the product into my hand... it felt and looked like water-based gel!  Because I took forever the second time making sure I had each strand coated, the first strands I applied it to got dry from the product evaporating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last comment - I have an ombre in my hair already, the top of my head my natural jet black hair, the bottom as a chestnut brown color.  If I REALLY looked closely, the top (virgin) part of my hair could pass off as a little more shiny, but it could be from my bumble and bumble hairdresser invisible oil I applied after I straightened my hair.  The bottom half (chestnut brown part) was dull and non-shiny as hair canbe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waaah, I&#x27;m sad, especially since other reviewers said they got &amp;#34;mirror-like shine!&amp;#34;  Guess I&#x27;ll go find other ways to achieve my shiny lock dreams!</li>
            <li> have used this in my salon for 25 years, safe, dependable and keeps fine hair in great condition, adds body strength and shine, apply to clean damp (towel dried) hair comb thru and cap, process under dry for thirty minutes, cool, and finish with your regular conditioner, then rinse and LOVE your new hair!</li>
            <li> left my hair shiney and very manageable. Great product . I will purchase again . my hair is type 3 , naturally wavy , baby fine and soft.</li>
            <li> Does exactly as promised, and it&#x27;s long lasting.  What else more can you ask for? As long as they don&#x27;t change their pricing, I&#x27;ll keep buying this forever.</li>
            <li> Good product.good shipping!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and have been using for over 30 years!  Especially good after a chemical, color or on African American hair.  Just abfab!</li>
