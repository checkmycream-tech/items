            <li>I love the rose water facial toner.</li>
            <li>Great toner, gentle on my sensitive skin</li>

            <li>The texture is very soft and cleans my face pretty good.</li>
            <li>Pure and free from chemicals!</li>
            <li>I am huge fan of rose water in general, so I was really excited to see how this toner would perform.</li>
            <li>Its not too strong of a rose scent but its trong enough to leave your face feeling so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>rose water makes me soft and moisture  </li>
            <li>so good, only thing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>Nice toner, it doesn&#x27;t sting or leave that dry feeling afterwards like so many toners can.  </li>
            <li>The bottle looks beautiful and tiny but it last more than it looks.</li>
            <li>Smell is subtle but perfect.</li>
            <li>No oily residue just fresh, clean well-hydrated skin.</li>
            <li>Its super affordable for the amount you get (4 fl oz)</li>
            <li>and it seems to be going quickly</li>
            <li>I love using Pure Rose Water Facial Toner by You</li>
            <li>I love the pure rose water facial toner!</li>
            <li>I Just received my product a few days ago and I absolutely love love love it.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and hydrates my skin better than other products.  </li>
            <li>Really love this new toner.</li>
            <li>I really like its scent, which is not too strong and reminds me roses.</li>
            <li>Loved the smell and how it didnt dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it daily for about a week and have noticed that my skin is softer and has a healthy glow!  </li>
            <li>It also makes my skin feel very hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>The Rose Water was cool and soothing and took away the redness faster than normal and it hydrated my skin leaving it feeling soft even before I applied moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The only issue I have with this rose water product is that it does contain alcohol, in the form of Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li>Its aroma is absolutely real and natural, and it is just smell of rose pedal.</li>
            <li>I gave Ella Grace Rose water as a gift and this was the comment I received back.......</li>
            <li>I have a lot of allergies to a lot of natural or organic products and so far so good, about a week using it, nothing has happened.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen rose waters for double and triple the amount.</li>
            <li>All in all I really really love the results that I&#x27;ve gotten so far with this product.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of this rose water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth trying</li>
            <li>It is gentle and effective, leaving my face feeling soft and balanced.  </li>
            <li>Used it for a while and had to repurchase, because it&#x27;s better than my old one.</li>
            <li>It really makes my face feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I just love what it does to  my skin, making it so soft and supple.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face so fresh</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural and organic, includes vitamins and is PH Balanced.  </li>
            <li>but i have only used Rose water that i have purchased at the inidian stores.</li>
            <li>It smells like fresh rose petals, but the scent is not strong or overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I hope the manufacturer to improve on is to make dispensing more steady with a either a spray or a smaller outlet on the top.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product who are in love with the real roses .&lt;br</li>
            <li>and after I wash my face, I spray the toner right on my face and massage with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>I was glowing right after using even though I was wearing makeup.</li>
            <li>The price is right too.</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars because it&#x27;s much more than I usually spend on rose water.</li>
            <li>I actually won a bottle of Ella Grace Organics Rose Water Hydrating Toner  in a contest so although this is my first official order</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, oily skin that breaks out easily.</li>
            <li>mmmmmmm I am sorry but the moroccan rose water is much stronger and more effective and comes in a brown bottle.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much that I filled my portable facial mist nanometer with it.</li>
            <li>Gentle and sweet.</li>
            <li>I really like the water, very pure, fragrant!</li>
            <li>The Pure Rose Water Facial Toner has no post apply drying.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a toner that wouldn&#x27;t dry my Sahara Desert-like/sensitive skin out, and this stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Feels lovely &amp; leaves my skin soft &amp; ready for moisturizer &amp; makeup.</li>
            <li>The Rose Water Facial product was recommended to my wife by a friend and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>This is really good especially for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>I could tell Pure Rose Water Facial Toner was making a difference from the first use.</li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>So on the days you do use it, you may want to try following with a very light moisturizer or even foregoing moisturizer at night to see how that works for you.</li>
            <li>I love the subtle rose fragrance as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this 2 days in a row, but i love it.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is the first toner I&#x27;ve used...</li>
            <li>After two  weeks, I&#x27;m almost completely blemish free.  </li>
            <li>I have never used a toner before and was looking for something to use first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>This product is one of many I purchased to see if adding it to my daily routine would in fact improve my skin.</li>
            <li>The fragrance brings back lovely memories and</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not my  first time using the toner.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>...thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase again. :)</li>
            <li>I have tried other rose water before and they have irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>I enjoy cleaning my face with natural water roses thanks for your service.</li>
            <li>and this is the first toner I&#x27;ve found to be so gentle, yet cleansing.</li>
            <li>One thing to be aware of is it truly is very hydrating.</li>
            <li>It is a pure luxury.  </li>
            <li>I am at the age where I still have to worry about the occasional break-out as well as fine lines creeping their way in.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant about  trying Pure Rose Water Facial Toner due to my mild rosacea and combination skin.</li>
            <li>the price is a little more but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting this toner!</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Putting it on a cotton ball would use it up too fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It looks brighter and really refines my pores.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m a very heavy-handed user either.</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend !</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It has made my skin so much softer and hydrated, all while clearing up any acne that has popped up.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Lots of toners make this claim, however they don&#x27;t really make a difference in your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping is fast too.</li>
            <li>upload another picture in a well to show how much progress has been made.</li>
            <li>Really like this product, my skin seems clearer</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and works very well.  </li>
            <li>and it gets used up to fast.</li>
            <li>, I really like the smell and how it feels on my face.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent and after one use my skin felt smoother and toned.</li>
            <li>I always do a spot test to see if there is any discomfort before applying anything over my whole face.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating</li>
            <li>I would like to see it in a spray bottle, but maybe I&#x27;d go through it too fast in a spray because I&#x27;d probably spray it on my whole body.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this daily on my face.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Very hydrating, does not have a stingy, drying feel.</li>
            <li>and my wife absolutely loves the toner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for gentle ways to hydrate my face and this I believe is the answer.</li>
            <li>I get worried I&#x27;ll use it way too fast.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, you can really pour too much at one time.</li>
            <li>But I imagine that I will love it even more during the dry, harsh winter months.</li>
            <li>Nothing harsh its just right!!!</li>
            <li>Very gentle, light, delicate, sweet smelling toner.  </li>
            <li>I was searching for just a rose water or rose water/glycerin fluid and failed to read the product specs.  </li>
            <li>and it seems pretty natural -</li>
            <li>Live!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling refreshed, smooth and toned rather than dry and tingly.  </li>
            <li>I would really like to see a spray top option as i think a lot of product is wasted when using cotton balls to apply.</li>
            <li>My skin looks vibrant and healthy and my pores look less oily.  </li>
            <li>My face is much smoother, it has a glow, &amp; it got rid of a red/dry scaly patch on my cheek that I&#x27;ve been struggling with for nearly 10 years!</li>
            <li>since I started using the Pure Rose Water Facial toner the breakouts have been less.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toner.</li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it to family and friends.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly</li>
            <li>I had heard about the product from a friend who highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>This has been great for the summer - as my A/C has been blasting for the past month and the air is very dry in my house.  </li>
            <li>It smells absolutely divine and it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>and (I know this really doesn&#x27;t matter as far</li>
            <li>So far seems to be working really well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t normally even pay attention to these types of things, but since she&#x27;s been raving about it</li>
            <li>Aroma is not overpowering (which I love - too much perfume smell is not appealing).  </li>
            <li>Have tried quite a few and this one is up there at the top of list.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still fighting with the whiteheads hopefully after a few more weeks those will go away as well.</li>
            <li>I love that there are no strong chemicals</li>
            <li>Have only used it for a few days but very pleased so far.</li>
            <li>so this is new and i have to try it for a couple weeks before i can say anything</li>
            <li>This toner is simple and it leaves my skin soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer is very clear about this, but I missed it.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>Very natural, no alcohol.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone that has sensitive skin and/or rosacea.</li>
            <li>Just a small amount will do the magic.</li>
            <li>I love using this everyday!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that I would use it to put in the bath (I would love to, but I think you might need to use a lot of product and it would be cost-prohibitive).  </li>
            <li>My only issue with it is that it is kind of small for my liking.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and smooth yet my pores have tightened and are cleaner &amp; less pronounced.  </li>
            <li>The rose sent is very delicate.</li>
            <li>Sufferer of adult acne, haven&#x27;t had a break out since 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>The bonus is the soft scent of roses...</li>
            <li>But so far I like the way my skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li>Also after patting this toner on my face, I feel my skin is soft and well relaxed.</li>
            <li>I wanted to find one that was natural as well.</li>
            <li>my skin is sensitive .</li>
            <li>The only thing is am I really going to spend $20 for another bottle?</li>
            <li>use it on a daily basis, in the morning and at night to remove gently my make</li>
            <li>My skin is much softer and the pores are getting smaller.  </li>
            <li>I have acne-prone oily sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It really cleans residue from my face and neck and preps my skin for the next step, serum or moisturizer.</li>
            <li>With the witch hazel ingredient there is some healing properties to my skin and leaves it feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I frequently get breakouts on my face around my chin and jawline,</li>
            <li>My skin looks brighter and feels soft not dried out from the acne products I have been using.</li>
            <li>This leaves my skin soft &amp; hydrated after cleansing.</li>
            <li>After reading that face washing twice a day for mature skin can be &amp;</li>
            <li>So far no problems.  </li>
            <li>how my face feels so soft after using it.  </li>
            <li>I like it so much that I ended up purchasing a second bottle.</li>
            <li>After only a few days I have noticed that my skin looks and feel more moisturized and healthier as well.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical because I&#x27;d tried another rose  water toner and didn&#x27;t really notice any change to my skin</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t make my skin oily or dry, it was a nice inbetween, especially since I typically have oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it particularly if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for all types of skin, especially if you have sensitive acne-prone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a natural, alcohol-free toner for my combination skin.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to add that my skin is very dry and sensitive and this toner does NOT dry me out like so many other toners have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time user with very dry skin</li>
            <li>In the past few years, it seems skin regimens have been missing this essential step, but with this toner it is a great pre-step to all the other very important products we put on our face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hydrating, so much that I forget to use my serum &amp; moisturizer half the time.  </li>
            <li>However, I was surprised :-O</li>
            <li>The true test takes a few weeks.</li>
            <li>This toner helps calm things down.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey for my budget, so I&#x27;m using it sparingly and carefully. :)</li>
            <li>Only been using it a few days and it is certainly more gentle than other toners I&#x27;ve used, does not dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I usually pad with cottons in the morning, I&#x27;m not sure it cleans the residue on the face.&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>So many toners that I&#x27;ve used in the past have stripped my skin and made it so dry.  </li>
            <li>My wife has dry skin and this toner does not dry her skin even more like some toners that she has purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>My skin barely feels like it needs moisturizer after using this toner.</li>
            <li>I actually like the way it made my skin feel, soft to the touch</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it worked so well to remove makeup, since it is not a soap-like cleanser, and it left my face feeling dewy.  </li>
            <li>Really evens skin tone and does not have any dryness like other toners.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out your face at all.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t irritating to sensitive skin, but makes your face feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I decided to look for a toner after I realize my pores were really noticeable and also as a way to get rid of Whitehead&#x27;s and seldom black heads.</li>

            <li> I just love what it does to  my skin, making it so soft and supple.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face so fresh</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural and organic, includes vitamins and is PH Balanced.  </li>
            <li> but i have only used Rose water that i have purchased at the inidian stores.</li>
            <li> It smells like fresh rose petals, but the scent is not strong or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I hope the manufacturer to improve on is to make dispensing more steady with a either a spray or a smaller outlet on the top.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product who are in love with the real roses .&lt;br</li>
            <li> and after I wash my face, I spray the toner right on my face and massage with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> I was glowing right after using even though I was wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> The price is right too.</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because it&#x27;s much more than I usually spend on rose water.</li>
            <li> I actually won a bottle of Ella Grace Organics Rose Water Hydrating Toner  in a contest so although this is my first official order</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, oily skin that breaks out easily.</li>
            <li> mmmmmmm I am sorry but the moroccan rose water is much stronger and more effective and comes in a brown bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much that I filled my portable facial mist nanometer with it.</li>
            <li> Gentle and sweet.</li>
            <li> I really like the water, very pure, fragrant!</li>
            <li> The Pure Rose Water Facial Toner has no post apply drying.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a toner that wouldn&#x27;t dry my Sahara Desert-like/sensitive skin out, and this stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Feels lovely &amp; leaves my skin soft &amp; ready for moisturizer &amp; makeup.</li>
            <li> The Rose Water Facial product was recommended to my wife by a friend and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> This is really good especially for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> I could tell Pure Rose Water Facial Toner was making a difference from the first use.</li>
            <li> Very gentle.</li>
            <li> So on the days you do use it, you may want to try following with a very light moisturizer or even foregoing moisturizer at night to see how that works for you.</li>
            <li> I love the subtle rose fragrance as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this 2 days in a row, but i love it.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the first toner I&#x27;ve used...</li>
            <li> After two  weeks, I&#x27;m almost completely blemish free.  </li>
            <li> I have never used a toner before and was looking for something to use first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> This product is one of many I purchased to see if adding it to my daily routine would in fact improve my skin.</li>
            <li> The fragrance brings back lovely memories and</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not my  first time using the toner.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> ...thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase again. :)</li>
            <li> I have tried other rose water before and they have irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I enjoy cleaning my face with natural water roses thanks for your service.</li>
            <li> and this is the first toner I&#x27;ve found to be so gentle, yet cleansing.</li>
            <li> One thing to be aware of is it truly is very hydrating.</li>
            <li> It is a pure luxury.  </li>
            <li> I am at the age where I still have to worry about the occasional break-out as well as fine lines creeping their way in.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about  trying Pure Rose Water Facial Toner due to my mild rosacea and combination skin.</li>
            <li> the price is a little more but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting this toner!</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Putting it on a cotton ball would use it up too fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It looks brighter and really refines my pores.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m a very heavy-handed user either.</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend !</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It has made my skin so much softer and hydrated, all while clearing up any acne that has popped up.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Lots of toners make this claim, however they don&#x27;t really make a difference in your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping is fast too.</li>
            <li> upload another picture in a well to show how much progress has been made.</li>
            <li> Really like this product, my skin seems clearer</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and works very well.  </li>
            <li> and it gets used up to fast.</li>
            <li> , I really like the smell and how it feels on my face.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent and after one use my skin felt smoother and toned.</li>
            <li> I always do a spot test to see if there is any discomfort before applying anything over my whole face.</li>
            <li> It is very hydrating</li>
            <li> I would like to see it in a spray bottle, but maybe I&#x27;d go through it too fast in a spray because I&#x27;d probably spray it on my whole body.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this daily on my face.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Very hydrating, does not have a stingy, drying feel.</li>
            <li> and my wife absolutely loves the toner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for gentle ways to hydrate my face and this I believe is the answer.</li>
            <li> I get worried I&#x27;ll use it way too fast.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, you can really pour too much at one time.</li>
            <li> But I imagine that I will love it even more during the dry, harsh winter months.</li>
            <li> Nothing harsh its just right!!!</li>
            <li> Very gentle, light, delicate, sweet smelling toner.  </li>
            <li> I was searching for just a rose water or rose water/glycerin fluid and failed to read the product specs.  </li>
            <li> and it seems pretty natural -</li>
            <li> Live!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling refreshed, smooth and toned rather than dry and tingly.  </li>
            <li> I would really like to see a spray top option as i think a lot of product is wasted when using cotton balls to apply.</li>
            <li> My skin looks vibrant and healthy and my pores look less oily.  </li>
            <li> My face is much smoother, it has a glow, &amp; it got rid of a red/dry scaly patch on my cheek that I&#x27;ve been struggling with for nearly 10 years!</li>
            <li> since I started using the Pure Rose Water Facial toner the breakouts have been less.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toner.</li>
            <li> highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Recommend highly</li>
            <li> I had heard about the product from a friend who highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> This has been great for the summer - as my A/C has been blasting for the past month and the air is very dry in my house.  </li>
            <li> It smells absolutely divine and it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> and (I know this really doesn&#x27;t matter as far</li>
            <li> So far seems to be working really well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t normally even pay attention to these types of things, but since she&#x27;s been raving about it</li>
            <li> Aroma is not overpowering (which I love - too much perfume smell is not appealing).  </li>
            <li> Have tried quite a few and this one is up there at the top of list.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still fighting with the whiteheads hopefully after a few more weeks those will go away as well.</li>
            <li> I love that there are no strong chemicals</li>
            <li> Have only used it for a few days but very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> so this is new and i have to try it for a couple weeks before i can say anything</li>
            <li> This toner is simple and it leaves my skin soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer is very clear about this, but I missed it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> Very natural, no alcohol.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone that has sensitive skin and/or rosacea.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount will do the magic.</li>
            <li> I love using this everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I would use it to put in the bath (I would love to, but I think you might need to use a lot of product and it would be cost-prohibitive).  </li>
            <li> My only issue with it is that it is kind of small for my liking.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and smooth yet my pores have tightened and are cleaner &amp; less pronounced.  </li>
            <li> The rose sent is very delicate.</li>
            <li> Sufferer of adult acne, haven&#x27;t had a break out since 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> The bonus is the soft scent of roses...</li>
            <li> But so far I like the way my skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li> Also after patting this toner on my face, I feel my skin is soft and well relaxed.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find one that was natural as well.</li>
            <li> my skin is sensitive .</li>
            <li> The only thing is am I really going to spend $20 for another bottle?</li>
            <li> use it on a daily basis, in the morning and at night to remove gently my make</li>
            <li> My skin is much softer and the pores are getting smaller.  </li>
            <li> I have acne-prone oily sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It really cleans residue from my face and neck and preps my skin for the next step, serum or moisturizer.</li>
            <li> With the witch hazel ingredient there is some healing properties to my skin and leaves it feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I frequently get breakouts on my face around my chin and jawline,</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter and feels soft not dried out from the acne products I have been using.</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin soft &amp; hydrated after cleansing.</li>
            <li> After reading that face washing twice a day for mature skin can be &amp;</li>
            <li> So far no problems.  </li>
            <li> how my face feels so soft after using it.  </li>
            <li> I like it so much that I ended up purchasing a second bottle.</li>
            <li> After only a few days I have noticed that my skin looks and feel more moisturized and healthier as well.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I&#x27;d tried another rose  water toner and didn&#x27;t really notice any change to my skin</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t make my skin oily or dry, it was a nice inbetween, especially since I typically have oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it particularly if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for all types of skin, especially if you have sensitive acne-prone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a natural, alcohol-free toner for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to add that my skin is very dry and sensitive and this toner does NOT dry me out like so many other toners have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time user with very dry skin</li>
            <li> In the past few years, it seems skin regimens have been missing this essential step, but with this toner it is a great pre-step to all the other very important products we put on our face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hydrating, so much that I forget to use my serum &amp; moisturizer half the time.  </li>
            <li> However, I was surprised :-O</li>
            <li> The true test takes a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This toner helps calm things down.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey for my budget, so I&#x27;m using it sparingly and carefully. :)</li>
            <li> Only been using it a few days and it is certainly more gentle than other toners I&#x27;ve used, does not dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I usually pad with cottons in the morning, I&#x27;m not sure it cleans the residue on the face.&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> So many toners that I&#x27;ve used in the past have stripped my skin and made it so dry.  </li>
            <li> My wife has dry skin and this toner does not dry her skin even more like some toners that she has purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> My skin barely feels like it needs moisturizer after using this toner.</li>
            <li> I actually like the way it made my skin feel, soft to the touch</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it worked so well to remove makeup, since it is not a soap-like cleanser, and it left my face feeling dewy.  </li>
            <li> Really evens skin tone and does not have any dryness like other toners.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out your face at all.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t irritating to sensitive skin, but makes your face feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I decided to look for a toner after I realize my pores were really noticeable and also as a way to get rid of Whitehead&#x27;s and seldom black heads.</li>
            <li> A lot of rose water toners are so expensive but they work so well that I had been searching and searching for one that was affordable!</li>
            <li> Really clears up problematic skin, especially due to hormonal imbalance.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a non-alcohol based toner because they tend to dry me out especially in the cheek area.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about trying this product, because me face is sensitive to just about anything that touches it.</li>
            <li> at how small the bottle was for the price, so I will definitely try a less expensive rose water toner when this one runs out (which won&#x27;t be long)!  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I am very careful about selecting facial products.</li>
            <li> I have really dry sin</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out</li>
            <li> I use it every single day</li>
            <li> I bought the Thayers at the same time which was half the price.  </li>
            <li> With this toner, I found I almost don&#x27;t need moisturizer after using it and I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not nearly as drying as other toners.  </li>
            <li> I am on week 2 of using this for the first time &amp; have noticed a dramatic change in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure I have been using it long enough to see any results yet.  </li>
            <li> I am a lifelong customer.</li>
            <li> After only a few days of using it my skin improved and I had a glow.</li>
            <li> So far no more black heads</li>
            <li> it removes every single trace of makeup that gets left behind deep within my pores.  </li>
            <li> My breaks outs have been so minimal since using this and its a god send in the summer!</li>
            <li> you have any other organic products ?</li>
            <li> Itâ€™s not like any other toner I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weird because when I first started using it my thought was this is not going to work this</li>
            <li> but this one helps tone it down and helps with the rosacea bumps too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and a half now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already used half a bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on getting a spray bottle and putting the contents in it so that I can do a little spritz on my face everyday and hopefully preserve it longer.</li>
            <li> After you use for a few days you see some visible results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey for everyday use but could be added to whitch hazel to economize.</li>
            <li> I wrote prior that the seal was broken, however after finishing the bottle, the results haven&#x27;t changed.</li>
            <li> I have used this toner a few times.</li>
            <li> I can use it everyday</li>
            <li> She has told a few friends about it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with breakouts for the past couple of months--within two days of use my skin was noticeably clearer.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not better.</li>
            <li> Other toners I&#x27;ve tried makes my rosacea worse</li>
            <li> seriously?</li>
            <li> I just wish it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> Eould have given it 5 stars if it were less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have  hypo thyroid and noticed my skin had started to look very dull.</li>
            <li> over the past year or so when I found out that they test on animals. :(</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I decided that I needed to ditch all of their products.</li>
            <li> but after I  started using the EGO toner, I became obsessed.</li>
            <li> Needless to say there was none.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t use base this morning</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Amazing product really does make you glow and has the loveliest rose smell not too strong really feels like an organic product. Nothing harsh its just right!!!</li>
            <li> Love love love this toner!! I&#x27;m a make up artist and am always on the hunt for great skincare products.. This rose water toner exceeded my expectations!!</li>
            <li> Love this toner! I&#x27;m a first time user with very dry skin and this is the first toner I&#x27;ve found to be so gentle, yet cleansing. It is a little pricey for my budget, so I&#x27;m using it sparingly and carefully. :)</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It smells absolutely divine and it makes my skin feel so soft. I highly recommend it particularly if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Feels good, smells good. I love having good organic choices for my skin care!</li>
            <li> Really love this new toner. It is gentle on the skin and I put it on before bed. It isn&#x27;t irritating to sensitive skin, but makes your face feel clean and refreshed. It smells wonderful too!</li>
            <li> Great product! I use twice a day after cleansing. Smell is subtle but perfect. Really clears up problematic skin, especially due to hormonal imbalance. Sufferer of adult acne, haven&#x27;t had a break out since 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good rose water toner FOREVER! A lot of rose water toners are so expensive but they work so well that I had been searching and searching for one that was affordable! I FINALLY found it! This toner smells so good! Its not too strong of a rose scent but its trong enough to leave your face feeling so clean and refreshed. I use this after I have cleansed my face and it just feels so good to apply! There is no burning, no itching, and no reactions. This makes me look forward to doing my skin care routine and i never want to go without it now! Its super affordable for the amount you get (4 fl oz) and I am just beyond happy I found this! It is now a staple in my skincare collection! I highly recommend getting this toner! My breaks outs have been so minimal since using this and its a god send in the summer! ** I got this product free to review in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife on a whim and she absolutely loves it. Don&#x27;t normally even pay attention to these types of things, but since she&#x27;s been raving about it I figured it earned a review. Good work on making the wifey happy!</li>
            <li> I liked the smell of this product and  is really hydrating where i couldn&#x27;t find in any rose water . I highly recommend this product who are in love with the real roses .&lt;br /&gt;Do you have any other organic products ?</li>
            <li> The Pure Rose Water Facial Toner has no post apply drying.  The product is quite lovely!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about  trying Pure Rose Water Facial Toner due to my mild rosacea and combination skin. Washing my face irritates my skin and  causes mottling and red spots.  The Rose Water was cool and soothing and took away the redness faster than normal and it hydrated my skin leaving it feeling soft even before I applied moisturizer.  The bonus is the soft scent of roses...it will make you feel relaxed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had your product for 3 days or so. But so far I like the way my skin feels and looks. The true test takes a few weeks. Thank you for your promptness in the delivery!!</li>
            <li> mmmmmmm I am sorry but the moroccan rose water is much stronger and more effective and comes in a brown bottle. I feel that quality standards were cut on this product. I have used 3 different rose waters and moroccan has been the best. Yes! the price is a little more but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> The product arrived well packaged. The only issue I have with this rose water product is that it does contain alcohol, in the form of Witch Hazel. The manufacturer is very clear about this, but I missed it. I was searching for just a rose water or rose water/glycerin fluid and failed to read the product specs.  I don&#x27;t use anything with Witch Hazel, and will not use this product. That said, the bottle is lovely, and the rose water is very high quality and fragrant. The vendor contacts you via email to ensure you are happy, which is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> This facial toner smells fantastic, goes on my skin easily, and feels great on my skin. I have very sensitive skin. The smell of the rose water on my face is also very calming. Love the smell. This is an excellent quality product that works very well for me and I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love! This rosewater by Ella Grace Organics has me hooked. I use it for so many things! I spray this on my face as a toner and hair (just because). I love the way it softens and brightens my skin, not to mention the fabulous scent. seriously? Who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like a rose!?! I also pour a bit of this in my bathwater. It is amazing! Very soothing and relaxing. This rosewater is 97% organic, made in the USA and not tested on animals. The packaging is very nice. It come in a nice frosted bottle with a secure lid. I highly recommend it! *sample provided to review</li>
            <li> This toner makes my skin feel great! Love it!</li>
            <li> This Pure Rose Water Facial Toner is excellent. Just a small amount will do the magic. Its aroma is absolutely real and natural, and it is just smell of rose pedal. This is the best I love this toner. Also after patting this toner on my face, I feel my skin is soft and well relaxed. I highly recommend this toner.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:6b92ed6979d5f69d6a50a873a3354fc3]]Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  Does the job of removing any dirt leftover after cleanser and pores tighten up.  The sweet rose scent is just right!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  Heavenly scented rose water and great company.</li>
            <li> Have only used it for a few days but very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> I love this water roses is light and smell delicious. I enjoy cleaning my face with natural water roses thanks for your service. The bottle looks beautiful and tiny but it last more than it looks.</li>
            <li> I gave Ella Grace Rose water as a gift and this was the comment I received back.......I received Ella Grace Rose Water hydrating toner as a gift and absolutely love it.  One of the things that  impressed me the most is the fact that it is 97% organic.  The benefits of rose water has been well known for years so I am happy to see a product that is organic as I tend to have sensitive skin.  This stuff is amazing!  I put it on after I cleanse my skin with a cotton ball and it not only soothes and refreshes my skin it removes every single trace of makeup that gets left behind deep within my pores.  Itâ€™s not like any other toner I have ever used.  It leaves my skin feeling refreshed, smooth and toned rather than dry and tingly.  I love the subtle rose fragrance as well.  The glass bottle makes me feel like I am indulging in a product from a fine spa somewhere on vacation. Great product.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I have been using it long enough to see any results yet.  I have a lot of allergies to a lot of natural or organic products and so far so good, about a week using it, nothing has happened.  That is a good thing!</li>
            <li> I am huge fan of rose water in general, so I was really excited to see how this toner would perform. I have to say, it left my skin glowing almost instantaneously and it has such a cooling feeling. I think it is perfect for the warmer days ahead, and I feel so refreshed after using this product. Lovely product!</li>
            <li> Love the product! The customer service and follow up is great!</li>
            <li> Very good rose water! As a tonic working very well..cleaning, moisturizing, skin looking fresh after rose water toner</li>
            <li> Great toner!&lt;br /&gt;I bought a spray glass bottle and after I wash my face, I spray the toner right on my face and massage with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Then I let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels and smells great after I use it.</li>
            <li> Product was received on time and as advertised.  Being a man, I don&#x27;t have a daily routine for skin care. But I do find that my skin feels quite refreshed when I do remember to use it.</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because it&#x27;s much more than I usually spend on rose water. Feels lovely &amp; leaves my skin soft &amp; ready for moisturizer &amp; makeup. I bought a spray bottle so that I can mist it onto my face. Putting it on a cotton ball would use it up too fast.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a toner in years but it was recommended I use one. I wanted to find one that was natural as well. After only a few days I have noticed that my skin looks and feel more moisturized and healthier as well. Quick delivery, excellent customer service and beautiful packaging as well. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I Love the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> It smells so good. My skin feels refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li> Pure Rose Water it so refreshing on my skin</li>
            <li> I just started using this product.  It seems to be what I was looking for.  Very gentle.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and smooth yet my pores have tightened and are cleaner &amp; less pronounced.  Aroma is not overpowering (which I love - too much perfume smell is not appealing).  I have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all.  I can&#x27;t wait to share it with my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Have always loved rose water for the skin. Have tried quite a few and this one is up there at the top of list. After you use for a few days you see some visible results. My face just seems more dewy and just looks better. Price point is also very good. I&#x27;ve seen rose waters for double and triple the amount.</li>
            <li> This is awsome .  I will buy it again for me and my friends and family my skin is sensitive . rose water makes me soft and moisture  the scent is best Thank you for making such a good cosmetic product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this 2 days in a row, but i love it. it smells soooo good and makes my skin, even lips, look glowy and plump. highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love this toner! It makes my skin feel really soft and smooth. It looks brighter and really refines my pores. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and a half now. It&#x27;s weird because when I first started using it my thought was this is not going to work this feels like water. It says it has witch hazel and it but It literally just feels like water. It smells really nice it has a light Rose fragrance and it does make you feel refreshed after using it. I use it twice a day after I wash my face. Prior to this toner I was not using a toner and I hadn&#x27;t been using a toner for years. I decided to look for a toner after I realize my pores were really noticeable and also as a way to get rid of Whitehead&#x27;s and seldom black heads. So far no more black heads but I&#x27;m still fighting with the whiteheads hopefully after a few more weeks those will go away as well. All in all I really really love the results that I&#x27;ve gotten so far with this product. The only thing is am I really going to spend $20 for another bottle? I don&#x27;t know about that. I&#x27;ve already used half a bottle and I&#x27;ve only had it for about 10 days.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m a very heavy-handed user either. We will see it is an awesome product. I just wish it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely but not overpowering. Really evens skin tone and does not have any dryness like other toners. Plus I love that a woman owns this business - she had been in touch to see if I am pleased with the product!! Talk about customer care!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this rose water. The smell is light and plaisant.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on a daily basis, in the morning and at night to remove gently my make up.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend !</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, oily skin that breaks out easily. That&#x27;s why I am very careful about selecting facial products. I have tried other rose water before and they have irritated my skin. This product smells great!  The lovely light scent won&#x27;t make you want to sneeze.  I have used this rose water for a couple of weeks and have noticed a difference.  My skin is much softer and the pores are getting smaller.  This product doesn&#x27;t sting when applied to the face.  I love the fact that it did not cause any irritations to my skin! I love this product so much that I filled my portable facial mist nanometer with it. This way I can use this product anytime I am away from home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other rose water and this is by far the best in my opinion.  Hopefully the company will make a bigger bottle in the future.</li>
            <li> This is the first toner I&#x27;ve used...my skin is pretty sensitive and picky but it looks amazing! Will definitely be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner for around 2 weeks now and absolutely love it!  It&#x27;s great for sensitive skin and smells heavenly!  I love that it cleans but also hydrates.  So many toners that I&#x27;ve used in the past have stripped my skin and made it so dry.  This has been great for the summer - as my A/C has been blasting for the past month and the air is very dry in my house.  But I imagine that I will love it even more during the dry, harsh winter months. It&#x27;s easy to use - you don&#x27;t need a ton - and it&#x27;s great for morning and bedtime use.  I love that there are no strong chemicals and it seems pretty natural - I follow up with some moringa oil at night.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love using Pure Rose Water Facial Toner by You Are Beautiful Ltd. It helps to clean my pores of dirt, oil and make-out completely. It helps my skin looks smooth and dewy. My make-up also goes on smoothly. I have acne-prone oily sensitive skin. My skin is cursed by the hormonal imbalance I have been dealing with for years. This toner helps calm things down. I highly recommend this for all types of skin, especially if you have sensitive acne-prone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner for a few weeks now and I like it. Didn&#x27;t notice any big difference yet, but I&#x27;m planning on using it for another month. I really like its scent, which is not too strong and reminds me roses. The texture is very soft and cleans my face pretty good. It&#x27;s worth trying</li>
            <li> I love this toner! I&#x27;ve been struggling with breakouts for the past couple of months--within two days of use my skin was noticeably clearer. After two  weeks, I&#x27;m almost completely blemish free.  On top of that, I love the way it smells and the way it makes me skin feel. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, and I love applying it on my face.</li>
            <li> Product is as shown. Arrived nicely packaged. I have been using for about 5 days now and all redness is gone from my face with no drying or irritation! Great product! Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited about two weeks to write about this toner because I&#x27;ve recently switched up ALL of my skin care products and didn&#x27;t want to judge before my skin adjusted. I was using Kiehl&#x27;s (with lots of success!) over the past year or so when I found out that they test on animals. :( Needless to say, I decided that I needed to ditch all of their products. I was looking for a toner that wouldn&#x27;t dry my Sahara Desert-like/sensitive skin out, and this stuff is AMAZING. It has made my skin so much softer and hydrated, all while clearing up any acne that has popped up. My skin barely feels like it needs moisturizer after using this toner. I will definitely be purchasing again in the future!</li>
            <li> Very gentle, light, delicate, sweet smelling toner.  Does not dry out your face at all.  Excellent shipping and follow up on product once shipped. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product.  Fantastic aroma and my skin is already feeling refreshed, brighter and clearer.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toner every morning as the &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34; substance for my menopausal skin.  It is gentle and effective, leaving my face feeling soft and balanced.  Lovely product.</li>
            <li> Great product and great gift idea for valentine&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li> This toner is so gentle, which is great for sensitive skin. It really cleans residue from my face and neck and preps my skin for the next step, serum or moisturizer. With the witch hazel ingredient there is some healing properties to my skin and leaves it feeling soft and hydrated. In the past few years, it seems skin regimens have been missing this essential step, but with this toner it is a great pre-step to all the other very important products we put on our face. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It is a pure luxury.  The rose scent reminds me of the village in Turkey where rose water is made.  This toner would make a lovely gift.  It is a bit pricey for everyday use but could be added to whitch hazel to economize.</li>
            <li> I actually like the way it made my skin feel, soft to the touch</li>
            <li> Live! Love it! Love it! It feels refreshing and soothing on your face making skin feel nice and soft. I was impressed so much that I bought another one for my sister and now she can&#x27;t leave without this product ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great customer service and a fabulous skin care product leaving the skin clean, dewy and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with a rose water toner, and I chose this one because of the rave reviews.  However, I was surprised :-O at how small the bottle was for the price, so I will definitely try a less expensive rose water toner when this one runs out (which won&#x27;t be long)!  I haven&#x27;t noticed any remarkable differences in my skin (I use it at night and in the morning), but perhaps it may just be too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> The Rose Water Facial product was recommended to my wife by a friend and she absolutely loves it. It smells great and makes her skin feel fresh and beautiful. I would recommend this product to anyone that hasn&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li> Great product!! One thing to be aware of is it truly is very hydrating. Lots of toners make this claim, however they don&#x27;t really make a difference in your skin. With this toner, I found I almost don&#x27;t need moisturizer after using it and I have very dry skin. The effect was immediate. So on the days you do use it, you may want to try following with a very light moisturizer or even foregoing moisturizer at night to see how that works for you.</li>
            <li> A very gentle yet effective product.  This toner cleans and moisturizes the skin creating an excellent foundation for my morning/night cream.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this toner and will purchase again! The rose sent is very delicate. This toner is gentle on my skin,  cleanses and hydrates beautifully.  I have been using it daily for about a week and have noticed that my skin is softer and has a healthy glow!  I have never used a toner before and was looking for something to use first thing in the morning. This is perfect! Even my teenage daughter loved it!</li>
            <li> This is a great toner! Great for minimizing pores and hydrates for anti-aging!!! I will continue buying this toner. Works better or just as good as the $42.00 toner I was buying!!!</li>
            <li> Used it for a while and had to repurchase, because it&#x27;s better than my old one.</li>
            <li> very soft and clean feel,it is refreshing,pure and feels great on skin as a toner or hydrating mist.</li>
            <li> I have made a change to my daily skin care regimen, so I had to add a toner. I have seen many women recommend rosewater as a great way to balance the pH in your skin. This product is one of many I purchased to see if adding it to my daily routine would in fact improve my skin. It appears, after only 2 weeks, the changes I&#x27;ve made has improved my skin. I would recommend this brand because of the light scent and the benefits of having a good toner.  I can only give 4 stars since I have only been using it for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is a very wonderful item.  The rosey scent is something I look forward to daily.  The only downside is the cost, a bit pricey for a toner I feel.</li>
            <li> Smells beautiful and is so gentle on my sensitive skin. I frequently get breakouts on my face around my chin and jawline, since I started using the Pure Rose Water Facial toner the breakouts have been less. My skin looks brighter and feels soft not dried out from the acne products I have been using. I love using this all over my face and my neck and chest.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Rose water toner, it does not irritate my skin since it does not contain alcohol, it leaves my skin soft and moisturized. Also it smells like pure roses!!! It is awesome and organic. I definitely recommend this product. My skin is very sensitive so I can&#x27;t use any toner around in the market, this one is perfect for sensitive skin. TRY IT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Loved the smell and how it didnt dry my skin out.  It is pricey though.  I bought the Thayers at the same time which was half the price.  Did almost the same thing.  Eould have given it 5 stars if it were less expensive.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It smells great, it does exactly what a toner is supposed to do and (I know this really doesn&#x27;t matter as far the product itself goes but...) I love the packaging. LOL. If I had to give a critique of it, then this would be it. For the money you&#x27;re paying, I wish the size was a tad bigger...maybe 8oz instead of 4oz. It&#x27;s still a great product, though, and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very natural, no alcohol. Good for sensitive skin. I really like its rose smell. :)&lt;br /&gt;Shipping is fast too.</li>
            <li> Update:&lt;br /&gt;7/8/16 my face has cleared up significantly. I wrote prior that the seal was broken, however after finishing the bottle, the results haven&#x27;t changed. My skin is clearer and I don&#x27;t break out anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this toner for two days now and I already see my marks fading.&lt;br /&gt;Will upload another picture in a well to show how much progress has been made.</li>
            <li> I love the rose water facial toner. The smell is great. I love the smell of roses and it makes my skin feel clean</li>
            <li> A great toner with a wonderful rose scent.  Light, clean, and leaves your face feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Its fragrance is good like real rose :-)&lt;br /&gt;Because I usually pad with cottons in the morning, I&#x27;m not sure it cleans the residue on the face.&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Really like this product, my skin seems clearer and it&#x27;s not nearly as drying as other toners.  I have combination skin, and I use this every morning and night.  I follow it with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Good addition to my skin care routine.  Excellent cleansing, but very gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My mother used rose water thirty years ago. The fragrance brings back lovely memories and the refreshing feeling is lovely too. Thank you for both!</li>
            <li> Thr Rose Water is just lovely.  It arrived on time and works very well.  It has the best rose fragrance.  Gentle and sweet.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this. It really makes my face feel nice and soft. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is its 4fl oz and it gets used up to fast. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just starting using it but so far so good, I really like the smell and how it feels on my face.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic toner!!!  I received it in Sunday but I was so excited to try it so I even put it over the makeup. The skin is absolutely smooth and radiant!! It worked even over the makeup!! I was glowing right after using even though I was wearing makeup. I will use it for rest of my life!!!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this product!  The toner leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft, and it has a beautiful scent.</li>
            <li> I actually won a bottle of Ella Grace Organics Rose Water Hydrating Toner  in a contest so although this is my first official order, it&#x27;s not my  first time using the toner. I was skeptical because I&#x27;d tried another rose  water toner and didn&#x27;t really notice any change to my skin but after I  started using the EGO toner, I became obsessed. I just love what it does to  my skin, making it so soft and supple. I use it every single day so when I  started to run low, of course I had to order another bottle. Love it.  *Updated 11-17-15* I just wanted to add that my skin is very dry and sensitive and this toner does NOT dry me out like so many other toners have. It actually seems to increase moisture in my skin. I&#x27;ve repurchased this twice now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just received this product but have used it several times and it&#x27;s wonderful.  It seems to cleanse without stripping.  Much better than rose water alone.  I love that it&#x27;s mostly organic.  Will order again and recommend my friends and family to buy.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product made me break out after each time I used it.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great. So far seems to be working really well. I have really dry sin so it was important for me to find a toner that did not have any alcohol or anything too astringent. The Pure Rose Water Facial Toner has been helping to keep my skin nice and moisturized and smooth. The only things i wish were that i could buy it in bigger quantities (ive only had it for about 2 weeks and it seems to be going quickly I would really like to see a spray top option as i think a lot of product is wasted when using cotton balls to apply. Overall a great product, and i&#x27;m sure i will be ordering another bottle soon!</li>
            <li> Very Good Product, it filled my expectations</li>
            <li> My skin looks vibrant and healthy and my pores look less oily.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Great astringent after I wash my face. Pure and free from chemicals! Nice smell too</li>
            <li> I really like the scent and after one use my skin felt smoother and toned.</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin soft &amp; hydrated after cleansing.</li>
            <li> This toner is simple and it leaves my skin soft and fresh. I especially love the scent of it and that give me a lift in the morning.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about trying this product, because me face is sensitive to just about anything that touches it. However, this toner is very nice. I always do a spot test to see if there is any discomfort before applying anything over my whole face. Needless to say there was none. This toner is very gentle, it smells nice and it gets the job done. I use the clarisonic brush on my face (twice) and this toner still picks up the extra dirt that was missed. Yes, I gave it five stars because my skin has a mind of its own and anything that helps and doesn&#x27;t hinder me in any way is a plus.</li>
            <li> I really like the water, very pure, fragrant! Great!</li>
            <li> This is really good especially for sensitive skin like mine. I&#x27;ve always had pimples all my life since I have oily skin. I also have enlarge pores. This is the only one that works miracles for me.&lt;br /&gt;I always get compliments for my skin now. Also great for dis colorations from pimple scars.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely order this again!</li>
            <li> I love it!! So moisturizing and feels so good on your face.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toner after it was recommended by my Barber. I use it after I shave and before I apply my after shave lotion. I use it in a spray bottle and pump a couple sprays all over my face and neck.  Shaving always leaves my face dry, so I&#x27;ve been using this Rose water toner every day and it has felt great. It leaves my face and neck feeling hydrated and refreshed.  I don&#x27;t know about helping with wrinkles, there still there, but I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a month.  I think wrinkles add character anyway.  Would recommend this product for men.</li>
            <li> Such an amazing product! It is very hydrating and I would highly recommend it to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I have used this toner a few times. I think it works great. It makes my skin glow. I will have to assess it more but so far so good</li>
            <li> Amazing toner very light and airy smelled really natural with nice subtle rose scents, def purchasing again! Recommend highly</li>
            <li> I have only used it a short time. It feels great and I didn&#x27;t use base this morning so my skin must appear more even to me. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.  I would like to see it in a spray bottle, but maybe I&#x27;d go through it too fast in a spray because I&#x27;d probably spray it on my whole body.</li>
            <li> mositure skin, its a good product with light rose smell</li>
            <li> Love this product. Fast delivery. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Only been using it a few days and it is certainly more gentle than other toners I&#x27;ve used, does not dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Great toner, gentle on my sensitive skin and it smells wonderful. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> My skin has been doing wonderfully with this toner!  Just love it!</li>
            <li> This rose water has a lovely scent and it is very soothing on my skin.  I enjoy using it every morning and night.</li>
            <li> This is a awesome product. I really enjoy using this daily on my face. I can use it everyday it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and I can see my skin lighten up already.</li>
            <li> No difference just as good as anyone of the ones on the website. I feel like I got cheated everything that says organic and better isn&#x27;t true and this is not a matter of opinion this is a fact. It&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s not better.</li>
            <li> I am on week 2 of using this for the first time &amp; have noticed a dramatic change in my skin.  My face is much smoother, it has a glow, &amp; it got rid of a red/dry scaly patch on my cheek that I&#x27;ve been struggling with for nearly 10 years! The rose scent is amazing &amp; calming, not overpowering at all.  It leaves a fresh scent on my face that I love.  It&#x27;s very hydrating, so much that I forget to use my serum &amp; moisturizer half the time.  I use it once in the morning &amp; once before bedtime. I am a lifelong customer.</li>
            <li> you would not believe how wonderful this simple cruelty free product makes your skin feel and smell wonderful! i have used it for about a week now and I can already tell a difference in the feel of my skin. Just an amaziing product i will continue to use for years to come!!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice toner, it doesn&#x27;t sting or leave that dry feeling afterwards like so many toners can.  It also didn&#x27;t make my skin oily or dry, it was a nice inbetween, especially since I typically have oily skin.  I would recommend it to a friend</li>
            <li> The scent is relaxing and the way your skin feels after is smooth as a baby. I love using this everyday!</li>
            <li> This is my go-to toner. I use it twice a day, every day as part of my skin care regimen. I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a natural, alcohol-free toner for my combination skin. I am at the age where I still have to worry about the occasional break-out as well as fine lines creeping their way in. After about a month of using this toner, I realized that my skin was noticeably softer and smoother all over. It smells like fresh rose petals, but the scent is not strong or overwhelming. This product is organic and not tested on animals; a good product that you can feel good about using.</li>
            <li> I Just received my product a few days ago and I absolutely love love love it. It leaves my face so fresh and I see a glow.  I will definitely keep buying it.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase. I sent my review in for the 1st purchase.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a non-alcohol based toner because they tend to dry me out especially in the cheek area. I really like this product. It is a lovely product. Feels nice going on-refreshing. Smells nice. I really like it! Will reorder.</li>
            <li> Great product. I love it</li>
            <li> Amazing! Literally makes my skin glow after I put it on.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to get this product!  I love that it is all natural and organic, includes vitamins and is PH Balanced.  Good job making a quality product and at a great price!</li>
            <li> I love this toner! I have been in search of a mild, organic toner that is easy on the skin and I&#x27;m so glad I found this one! Other toners I&#x27;ve tried makes my rosacea worse but this one helps tone it down and helps with the rosacea bumps too. I highly recommend this product to anyone that has sensitive skin and/or rosacea. It also does an awesome job at removing make up without over drying. I use it after I wash my face at night sometimes instead of my moisturizer. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> Love the product but would love for it to come with an optional spray bottle cap!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Gentle and effective.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my skin and my step daughter&#x27;s skin that needs hydration.  The smell is nice and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and used it last night.  I used some on a cotton pad as a makeup remover and facial cleanser. I was surprised that it worked so well to remove makeup, since it is not a soap-like cleanser, and it left my face feeling dewy.  I did not use it as an eye-makeup remover (I don&#x27;t know if that would be a good idea).  It has a light, pleasant rose scent.  I really like this product.  Since it is rose &amp;#34;water,&amp;#34; you have to use it as a spray, or soak a pad with it.  I will definitely buy it again.  I&#x27;m not sure that I would use it to put in the bath (I would love to, but I think you might need to use a lot of product and it would be cost-prohibitive).  But using it as an after-bath spritz would be pleasant.  Would love to find a spray attachment for the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love the pure rose water facial toner! Very hydrating, does not have a stingy, drying feel. Does not contain alcohol and leaves the skin feeling moist and clean. No oily residue just fresh, clean well-hydrated skin. I&#x27;m a very happy customer!</li>
            <li> Loving this product! Exactly what I wanted. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!!  Not only is the fragrance heavenly but, it gives my skin an all-over smoothness and glow.  I have been very pleased and will definitely being purchasing more of this product!!</li>
            <li> I love this toner! It feels wonderful, is very moisturizing! The customer service is great! They emailed to make sure I received the toner and was happy with it : )</li>
            <li> I love this rose water! It refreshes my skin after I shower and before applying rose moisturizer. It&#x27;s my morning facial that I look forward to when I get up. My skin feels good and the fragrance is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, LoveðŸ˜€. After reading that face washing twice a day for mature skin can be &amp;#34;too much of a good thing&amp;#34; I wondered what I could do for my morning routine instead. After researching and finding Ella&#x27;s line, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and hydrates my skin better than other products.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a week, so I still need to use longer to see any changes.  So far no problems.  I like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and refreshing on your skin - packaging is amazing</li>
            <li> I have just started using this and I think that my skin is already starting to look healthier. I have  hypo thyroid and noticed my skin had started to look very dull. This toner seems to be brightening it up. Also-it smells great!</li>
            <li> I purchased the toner for my wife as a gift. I had heard about the product from a friend who highly recommended it. It has been almost a week now and my wife absolutely loves the toner. It has a very pleasant smell to it. My wife has dry skin and this toner does not dry her skin even more like some toners that she has purchased in the past. The price is right too. Some toners sell for much more just because of their name. She has told a few friends about it so she definitely recommends it.</li>
            <li> I like it but i have only used Rose water that i have purchased at the inidian stores. so this is new and i have to try it for a couple weeks before i can say anything</li>
            <li> i mixed this 1 part to 2 parts witch hazel and have been using it twice a day. it smells amazing and i like the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! I will be re ordering when done! I LOVE rose scented products...thank you so much!</li>
            <li> smell very good doll..I think it&#x27;s good stuff ..Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬Ã°Å¸Ëœâ‚¬</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> Lovely, pampering product. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Super happy with this toner - light and fresh scent and good packaging.  Feels great.  Arrived wrapped in bubble to protect the glass.</li>
            <li> Wonderful toner!  Loved the delicate rose scent and the results!  Will definitely purchase again. :)</li>
            <li> This to we was OUTSTANDING!!  I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Very lovely product. Would definitely purchase again.  Would have liked it to have a spray top so I could use it as a spray to finish my makeup.</li>
            <li> I love it, It smells great, just like fresh roses. It also makes my skin feel very hydrated and smooth. I am looking forward to watching the the viedo on how to get the most out of my product. Thank you for sharing that also. I like that fact also that you are in the great &amp;#34;USA&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> The best toner I&#x27;ve ever used.  Suffering from Rosacea I&#x27;m always looking for gentle ways to hydrate my face and this I believe is the answer. Thanks so much for making this awesome product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I could tell Pure Rose Water Facial Toner was making a difference from the first use. It smells great and makes my face and neck feel so fresh!</li>
            <li> Just started using it so my results are still in the making.  I love the scent and how my face feels so soft after using it.  I&#x27;m just giving four stars pending blemishes results.</li>
            <li> This toner is very refreshing. After only a few days of using it my skin improved and I had a glow. It also smells wonderful. My only issue with it is that it is kind of small for my liking. I get worried I&#x27;ll use it way too fast. I&#x27;m planning on getting a spray bottle and putting the contents in it so that I can do a little spritz on my face everyday and hopefully preserve it longer. Hope that solves the problem. All in all a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!!!!!</li>
            <li> It smells so good, only thing I hope the manufacturer to improve on is to make dispensing more steady with a either a spray or a smaller outlet on the top. Sometimes, you can really pour too much at one time.</li>
            <li> Great toner that works well &amp; has a very pure rose scent. I like it so much that I ended up purchasing a second bottle. Great small company that has wonderful customer service touches.</li>
