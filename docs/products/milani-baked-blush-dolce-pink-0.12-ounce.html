            <li>Beautifully pigmented and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It is very beautiful and flare that has make the skin look very healthy</li>
            <li>Very pleased!</li>
            <li>The pigmentation is also not that great</li>
            <li>This blush is great.</li>
            <li>The seller is very nice.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see how it will look on my skin during the summer when I have a nice tan!</li>
            <li>however the Luminoso one is every good.</li>
            <li>Almost a good dupe though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still pick up some of this brands products because, they are ok for the price and great for buying colors</li>
            <li>Of course, luxury is usually more deluxe, but if you&#x27;re like me &amp; are frugal or broke-ish, then this is a great sub for a glow that looks good on everyone.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite blushes!</li>
            <li>Love the color and price!</li>
            <li>and I love the packaging!</li>
            <li>I love this blush!</li>
            <li>I also have the Milani blush in Luminoso and that color is amazing.</li>
            <li>This blush is amazing.</li>
            <li>Brightens the complexion nicely.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, shimmery blush</li>
            <li>It does well on its own for a &amp;#</li>
            <li>This blush has really nice color payoff</li>
            <li>Milani also makes matte baked blushes and their rose embossed blushes are matte too.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, great product.</li>
            <li>beautiful natural color for fair to medium skin...</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and beautiful color</li>
            <li>You can layer it for more pop or do one brush for a very light tone.</li>
            <li>Love this blush.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>On my skin, it looks more like a bronzer than it does, a blush.</li>
            <li>Milani blushes are now my fav :)</li>
            <li>but, it&#x27;s no MAC, which is what I mostly use.</li>
            <li>if you build up the product it will look more noticeable.</li>
            <li>Okay I don&#x27;t get the hype about this blush.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite powder blush out if all drugstore and department store blushes.</li>
            <li>but it has more glitter in it than I prefer.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this blusher.  </li>
            <li>Perfect pink for my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Gorgeous color and very pigmented.</li>
            <li>The color is perfect for layering with other blushes though.</li>
            <li>Just enough sparkle and the color is beautiful.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and smoothly and adds a glow to my already applied blush.</li>
            <li>It appears to be a true pink color which is perfect for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Great product, especially the price!</li>
            <li>Too light?</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also fantastic if shimmer isn&#x27;t your thing.</li>
            <li>Dolce Pink is one of the most gorgeous looking blushes from Milani&#x27;s baked line.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re getting a brush full of sparkle and a hint of the color each time.</li>
            <li>Nice colour, but arrived completely shattered.</li>
            <li>When you layer it heavily you are then covered with shimmer on the apples of your cheeks (not my ideal place to enhance with shimmer).  </li>
            <li>Dolce de pink is a gorgeous vibrant rose color with shimmer.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, well packaged....</li>
            <li>I use this product daily and am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I like to use this product on top of a cheek stain to give it the soft and shimmery effect.</li>
            <li>The sparkles in it are very, very tiny, so this way it gives your face a nice glow.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous glowy pink.</li>
            <li>Adds just the right amount of luminous sparkle.</li>
            <li>is really cheaply made and not too easy to open.  </li>
            <li>I regret buying this now because I have a neutral style and this is only suitable for night time events...</li>
            <li>It is more of a peach tone, not pink</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used fade away, and by the end of the day it looks like I never even put anything on in the first place - but not this one.</li>
            <li>I also apply a light dusting of translucent powder over top of it, which will tone down the shimmer a bit.</li>
            <li>Looks so beautiful but poor pigmentation for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many others in the past, but this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Nice color, a little too shimmery for my taste.</li>
            <li>So much that you&#x27;ll look like a disco ball after you apply it.</li>
            <li>The color was lighter, more translucent than I expected.</li>
            <li>VERY sparkly/shimmery.</li>
            <li>Literally, the color really stays on for hours and hours without me reapplying it.</li>
            <li>You are getting more sparkle than color, tapping the brush does help but not much.</li>
            <li>But this color has too much glitter for my taste.</li>
            <li>But I got a muted pink with some sparkle in it, and I really love it.</li>
            <li>It is a nice shade of pink with a soft shimmer factor.  </li>
            <li>My skin tends to get quite pale and dull-looking during the winter months, and I find that this blush livens it up nicely.</li>
            <li>When used in conjunction with other products it is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Apply your favorite Bronze and Illuminating Powder/Highlight to tone down and give you that dewy look.  </li>
            <li>I got my blush quickly and it was packaged in such a way that it would not break (which it did not).</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended</li>
            <li>I didn’t find the blush particularly long-wearing, but it’s such a pretty color.</li>
            <li>It gives off nice color and adds to the overall dewy look I go for when using an illuminating powder but, doesn&#x27;t really last as long as brands I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>Same quality as a much higher-priced brand!</li>
            <li>They must update frequently!</li>
            <li>Applying One layer creates the natural look.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a long lasting, drug store equivalent blush, I&#x27;d really consider giving this a try.</li>
            <li>All the shades are very pigmented and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Blush barely shows up on my skin</li>
            <li>Great, less expensive version similar to NARS Orgasm blush that everyone is talking about.  </li>
            <li>Dolce Pink is a really shimmery baby pink that looks natural after one layer.</li>

            <li> Love this blush. Adds just the right amount of luminous sparkle. Brightens the complexion nicely.</li>
            <li> Just the color I needed. Thank you</li>
            <li> Awesome color.... I love it</li>
            <li> Dolce Pink is one of the most gorgeous looking blushes from Milani&#x27;s baked line. It is a bright pink blush with a plum base. However, this blush is loaded with sparkles! So much that you&#x27;ll look like a disco ball after you apply it. Some people say that tapping your brush will get rid of the sparkles but it didn&#x27;t work for me the sparkles are still there. The pigmentation is also not that great so you&#x27;re getting a brush full of sparkle and a hint of the color each time. I regret buying this now because I have a neutral style and this is only suitable for night time events...however the Luminoso one is every good.</li>
            <li> Great product, especially the price! Same quality as a much higher-priced brand! Will definitely keep this on the go-to list.</li>
            <li> I got my blush quickly and it was packaged in such a way that it would not break (which it did not). Very pleased!</li>
            <li> beautiful natural color for fair to medium skin...this is my go to everyday blush now</li>
            <li> I am a dark skin girl and this blush does not work for me. On my skin, it looks more like a bronzer than it does, a blush.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color and very pigmented. Milani blushes are now my fav :)</li>
            <li> This is a nice, shimmery blush but, it&#x27;s no MAC, which is what I mostly use. It gives off nice color and adds to the overall dewy look I go for when using an illuminating powder but, doesn&#x27;t really last as long as brands I&#x27;m used to. I&#x27;ll still pick up some of this brands products because, they are ok for the price and great for buying colors you&#x27;re not going to use as your &#x27;everyday look.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Nice colour, but arrived completely shattered. Colour quality,  solid. Product shopping or stability,  not solid at all.</li>
            <li> The color was lighter, more translucent than I expected. The color is perfect for layering with other blushes though. It goes on easily and smoothly and adds a glow to my already applied blush. It does well on its own for a &amp;#34;no makeup&amp;#34; look. I use this product daily and am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Ran out of my NARS organsm blush and searched online and found that this was a dupe. Looks so beautiful but poor pigmentation for my skin tone. Blush barely shows up on my skin</li>
            <li> Nice color, a little too shimmery for my taste. Almost a good dupe though</li>
            <li> It is a nice shade of pink with a soft shimmer factor.  The staying power is not there and it must be heavily layered for the color to be apparent.  When you layer it heavily you are then covered with shimmer on the apples of your cheeks (not my ideal place to enhance with shimmer).  I like to use this product on top of a cheek stain to give it the soft and shimmery effect. When used in conjunction with other products it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and beautiful color</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, great product.</li>
            <li> Applying One layer creates the natural look.  Too light? Build up th product.  Run with it!!! Apply your favorite Bronze and Illuminating Powder/Highlight to tone down and give you that dewy look.  Highly Recommended</li>
            <li> VERY sparkly/shimmery. One of my favorite blushes! however the brush it came with really sucks... it doesn&#x27;t even pick up color.</li>
            <li> Love the color and price! This is a great blush!!!</li>
            <li> This blush has really nice color payoff and I love the packaging! Dolce Pink is a really shimmery baby pink that looks natural after one layer. if you build up the product it will look more noticeable. Would recommend for anyone!</li>
            <li> Add a little glow or give a night look if applied heavier, I get a lot of compliments whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li> This blush is great. I&#x27;ve used many others in the past, but this is by far my favorite. It lasts throughout the entire day, no matter what. I&#x27;ve always found that other blushes I&#x27;ve used fade away, and by the end of the day it looks like I never even put anything on in the first place - but not this one. It&#x27;s also shimmery, yet doesn&#x27;t look fake. The sparkles in it are very, very tiny, so this way it gives your face a nice glow. My skin tends to get quite pale and dull-looking during the winter months, and I find that this blush livens it up nicely. I can&#x27;t wait to see how it will look on my skin during the summer when I have a nice tan!</li>
            <li> This blush stays on my extremely pale skin longer than my $30 Tarte blush. Literally, the color really stays on for hours and hours without me reapplying it. I guess I don&#x27;t mind the shimmer the blush has like the other reviewers stated, it makes my skin look luminous. I also apply a light dusting of translucent powder over top of it, which will tone down the shimmer a bit. If you&#x27;re looking for a long lasting, drug store equivalent blush, I&#x27;d really consider giving this a try.</li>
            <li> Okay I don&#x27;t get the hype about this blush. You are getting more sparkle than color, tapping the brush does help but not much. I also have the Milani blush in Luminoso and that color is amazing. But this color has too much glitter for my taste. However the packaging is durable and comes with a mirror.</li>
            <li> This blush is amazing. Just enough sparkle and the color is beautiful. It appears to be a true pink color which is perfect for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite powder blush out if all drugstore and department store blushes. All the shades are very pigmented and long lasting. Dolce de pink is a gorgeous vibrant rose color with shimmer.</li>
            <li> I like it ....but it has more glitter in it than I prefer. Quick shipping, well packaged....</li>
            <li> I love this blush! I got a color from the baked collection, which again, I’m not seeing on their website – the color, not the collection. They must update frequently! But I got a muted pink with some sparkle in it, and I really love it. I’ve been hearing that Luminoso is a must-have for your collection, and I have my eye on it! I think that will be my next purchase, along with a Bella eye shadow. I didn’t find the blush particularly long-wearing, but it’s such a pretty color. One to pop in your bag on a night out!</li>
            <li> It is more of a peach tone, not pink</li>
            <li> It is very beautiful and flare that has make the skin look very healthy</li>
            <li> Great, less expensive version similar to NARS Orgasm blush that everyone is talking about.  Of course, luxury is usually more deluxe, but if you&#x27;re like me &amp; are frugal or broke-ish, then this is a great sub for a glow that looks good on everyone.</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful. You can layer it for more pop or do one brush for a very light tone. The seller is very nice. I buy all my blush from him and I will not buy for anyone else.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this blusher.  Perfect pink for my skin tone.  I would have given it 5 stars but the the case it&#x27;s in is really cheaply made and not too easy to open.  Nonetheless, I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This is the PERFECT blush color!!!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous glowy pink. Beautifully pigmented and lasts all day. I also use this with matte bronzer on my eyes. Milani also makes matte baked blushes and their rose embossed blushes are matte too. They&#x27;re also fantastic if shimmer isn&#x27;t your thing.</li>
