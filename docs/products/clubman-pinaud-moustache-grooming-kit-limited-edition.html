            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>Very pleased!!</li>
            <li>One of the best mustache &#x27;waxes&#x27; out there.</li>
            <li>Great comb and the wax is very good.  </li>
            <li>The moustache comb is great addition to my beard kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then i place the great paste in to keep it erect.</li>
            <li>I will use the comb and the case, this is very nice.</li>
            <li>Good quality on components.  </li>
            <li>The kit itself if good.</li>
            <li>i bought it for my boyfriend and he loved it.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is a good starter</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a nice gift kit.</li>
            <li>Nice kit.  </li>
            <li>Handy case.</li>
            <li>The scissor were just what I needed and the wax was good would have liked better if I had a choice on color of wax in the kit</li>
            <li>It was okay for the price and handy for travel in some ways.</li>
            <li>but i need to find a better comb.</li>
            <li>i love the kit bag; i love the brush/applier and the comb.  </li>
            <li>better  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t yet give a review of the items included because I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try them and unless I can figure out how to work a zipper without a pull-tab, I might not be able to.</li>
            <li>but it was ok.</li>
            <li>it is one of his favorite brands.</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift for my brother-in-law, and he seems to like it ok.</li>
            <li>Works for me though I haven&#x27;t tried many others.</li>
            <li>Any more and your Greaser mustache will belong on West Side Story.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li>So it must be OK.</li>
            <li>This is nice but the comb broke the first time using it.</li>
            <li>the scissors were pretty nice</li>
            <li>the product is fine.</li>
            <li>but my wife wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the wax&#x27;s smell.</li>
            <li>He was excited to get it.</li>
            <li>Used it twice and both times I had to clean it off.</li>
            <li>he loved everything in the packet especially the wax</li>
            <li>I can agree it is different, almost lemony, but better than smelling like chemicals!</li>
            <li>Great little kit.</li>
            <li>but it was worth the price anyway.</li>
            <li>Another Panaud success.  </li>
            <li>The scissors worked great and the wax worked to keep my moustache neat without being overly stiff.  </li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>It was a small but very useable kit; it came with a mustache comb, mustache brush, wax, and a pair of trimming scissors, which made a very good travel kit which is what I wanted it for; everything fit nicely into the small bag it came with.  </li>
            <li>First of all the packaging and product was what was explained by the seller.</li>
            <li>so this gives him a nice little manpurse to put it all in.  </li>
            <li>He still really likes the wax and the case</li>
            <li>i guess I expected more...</li>
            <li>and he really enjoys it.  </li>
            <li>It was very tacky, sticky, and it discolored my beard.</li>
            <li>no matter how much I combed it out.</li>
            <li>After a bit, it soaks in and then the real shaping begins.</li>
            <li>Fun and useful at same time.</li>
            <li>Decent grooming kit for the price.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Clubman Pinaud Moustache Grooming Kit</li>
            <li>I love this little set up.</li>
            <li>but other than that i enjoy the product.</li>
            <li>so I had to find another option and buy and new brush to apply the product.</li>
            <li>Not a bad mustache wax but be careful when applying.</li>
            <li>Great small little case.</li>
            <li>Items in it are OK; the mustache brush is not real sturdy, and the mustache wax is quite sticky with a little too much fragrance for me.</li>
            <li>I would easily use this as a backup but as for an everyday use, I will be going back to a different brand</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really need the other items</li>
            <li>I have used other Pinaud products and I really like the brand</li>

            <li> I have used other Pinaud products and I really like the brand</li>
            <li> The ship time seemed to take too long</li>
            <li> It only takes alittle less than the size of a pea to style the stache.</li>
            <li> Wax works as expected.</li>
            <li> There is still enough of the oversize zipper to use it without much trouble.  </li>
            <li> there are other waxes i like</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using Clubman for years and swears by it, though I&#x27;ve bought other brands for him he always uses Clubman.</li>
            <li> This product comes with small comb, a smaller combination comb/brush for applying the wax, a pair of trimming Scissors, and a tube of wax.  </li>
            <li> The zipper is of such poor quality that the first time I tried to use it, the zipper pull has completely broken off, in two pieces.</li>
            <li> The wax on the other hand was not very good.</li>
            <li> everyday use  --  nah.</li>
            <li> Not a very good value.</li>
            <li> The comb is a little weak</li>
            <li> but it was a little expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> The combo brush/comb was broken and useless for me.</li>
            <li> so I was a little disappointed in this mustache wax.</li>
            <li> But still disappointing.</li>

            <li> Excellent product. The comb is a little weak but overall it&#x27;s a five for the managability.</li>
            <li> This is nice but the comb broke the first time using it. He still really likes the wax and the case but i need to find a better comb.</li>
            <li> i guess I expected more...the scissors were pretty nice but it was a little expensive for what you get. Not a very good value.</li>
            <li> It was a present for my College Grandson at Christmas and he really enjoys it.  He was excited to get it.</li>
            <li> the product is fine. what i didnt know was that the wax was gonna leave me with a white moustache. but other than that i enjoy the product.</li>
            <li> i love the kit bag; i love the brush/applier and the comb.  there are other waxes i like better  --  they&#x27;re firmer and longer-lasting.  so, for travel days and occasional use  --  aces.  everyday use  --  nah.</li>
            <li> Great comb and the wax is very good.  Didn&#x27;t really need the other items but it was worth the price anyway.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a nice gift kit. Fun and useful at same time. I would highly recommend Clubman Pinaud Moustache Grooming Kit</li>
            <li> The application brush broke before I was finished with the wax so I had to find another option and buy and new brush to apply the product. The product itself, the wax. works well.</li>
            <li> Received expeditiously. Very pleased!!</li>
            <li> First of all the packaging and product was what was explained by the seller. I did like the bag, the scissors, and how convenient this item makes caring a comb and wax with you for grooming touch up&#x27;s. The wax on the other hand was not very good. It was very tacky, sticky, and it discolored my beard. I have red beard, and blond hair. this wax made my beard look like it had a white powder on it, no matter how much I combed it out. I will use the comb and the case, this is very nice. I have used other Pinaud products and I really like the brand so I was a little disappointed in this mustache wax.</li>
            <li> Another Panaud success.  Nice kit.  Good quality on components.  One of the best mustache &#x27;waxes&#x27; out there.</li>
            <li> Handy case. Wax works as expected. Scissors are useable and so is comb. The combo brush/comb was broken and useless for me.It was okay for the price and handy for travel in some ways. I would probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> Items in it are OK; the mustache brush is not real sturdy, and the mustache wax is quite sticky with a little too much fragrance for me.</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s always leaving his mustache combs and stuff out so this gives him a nice little manpurse to put it all in.  He&#x27;s been using Clubman for years and swears by it, though I&#x27;ve bought other brands for him he always uses Clubman. One reason I think is because it doesn&#x27;t have a scent.</li>
            <li> The zipper is of such poor quality that the first time I tried to use it, the zipper pull has completely broken off, in two pieces. I can&#x27;t yet give a review of the items included because I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try them and unless I can figure out how to work a zipper without a pull-tab, I might not be able to.</li>
            <li> The kit itself if good. As for the wax, I prefer a stiffer all day hold</li>
            <li> The scissor were just what I needed and the wax was good would have liked better if I had a choice on color of wax in the kit but it was ok.</li>
            <li> It was a small but very useable kit; it came with a mustache comb, mustache brush, wax, and a pair of trimming scissors, which made a very good travel kit which is what I wanted it for; everything fit nicely into the small bag it came with.  The price was right and I would purchase this kit again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> i bought it for my boyfriend and he loved it. he is a snob about everything about his personal style especially his handlebar mustache. he loved everything in the packet especially the wax it is one of his favorite brands.</li>
            <li> Great little kit. The comb won&#x27;t work well on a curly beard like mine but i already had a comb for that anyway. The moustache comb is great addition to my beard kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars but my wife wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the wax&#x27;s smell. I can agree it is different, almost lemony, but better than smelling like chemicals!</li>
            <li> I love this little set up. When I want to set up my handle bar, I just get out my brush and comb and style it. Then i place the great paste in to keep it erect. Great small little case.</li>
            <li> Decent grooming kit for the price.  Bought as a gift for my brother-in-law, and he seems to like it ok.</li>
            <li> Works for me though I haven&#x27;t tried many others.</li>
            <li> Not a bad mustache wax but be careful when applying. It only takes alittle less than the size of a pea to style the stache. Any more and your Greaser mustache will belong on West Side Story. After a bit, it soaks in and then the real shaping begins. This is when the wax is at its best.&lt;br /&gt; Otherwise, it is a good starter but I&#x27;ve had better. I wanted to try to see how it worked. I would easily use this as a backup but as for an everyday use, I will be going back to a different brand</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it five stars is that the tab for the zipper broke off.  There is still enough of the oversize zipper to use it without much trouble.  But still disappointing.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t do it for me. It&#x27;s too sticky. Makes my mustache look like it has gray hair which it doesn&#x27;t. I wouldn&#x27;t bother with this. Used it twice and both times I had to clean it off.</li>
            <li> This product comes with small comb, a smaller combination comb/brush for applying the wax, a pair of trimming Scissors, and a tube of wax.  The scissors worked great and the wax worked to keep my moustache neat without being overly stiff.  I&#x27;d purchase this again.  The ship time seemed to take too long but I&#x27;d still buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> I gave it as a gag gift and I haven&#x27;t heard any negatives from the recipient. So it must be OK.</li>
