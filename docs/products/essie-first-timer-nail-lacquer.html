            <li>Great for every skin tone.</li>
            <li>Well-no more!!</li>
            <li>It is like a bright spearmint color.</li>
            <li>so I got this polish because it looked bright</li>
            <li>Not too bright and its a spring/summer color.  </li>
            <li>It was purchased as a gift and the person loved the color and the way it came out. . .</li>
            <li>Not too bright, good spring and summer color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d be good for summer, spring, or winter.</li>
            <li>When I saw this online, I didn&#x27;t find it very appealing.</li>
            <li>But this has a much better formula!</li>
            <li>Amazing product and customer service.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more bright than a muted spring color.</li>
            <li>I love this brand and the color it gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I am wearing this color now and its so vibrant and beautiful!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful, fun summer color.&lt;br /&gt;Price</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful and really stands out in the crowd.</li>
            <li>This polish was just ok.</li>
            <li>If you use a top coat</li>
            <li>(: Will use this for years, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>Love the formula, as always with Essie polish.</li>
            <li>However tech armor has amazing customer service and sent me a replacement ASAP free of charge.</li>
            <li>The size is from a set of the resort colors so it is NOT one that was supposed to be purchased individually I am relatively sure.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I have bought a lot of my polish from Amazon when I either can not find it in the store or am looking for a better price.  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed and will definitely use them again.</li>
            <li>This was by far the quickest shipping that I have experienced with any of the sellers on the site.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful, springy, bright green!</li>
            <li>The color is much more vivid and eye catching in person.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect shade of mint green.</li>
            <li>Tried this green polish and LOVED IT!!!</li>
            <li>Since trying this one,I have bought several other bright polishes and Essie is the best!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this one despite how similar the online picture is to Turquoise &amp; Caicos because once it dries, they are quite distinct!</li>
            <li>The color turned out to be bright green when applied with a top coat on my toe nails.  </li>
            <li>very pretty color,.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price, I recommend this</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to spend very much though, sinful colors make a polish called mint tropics that is the Exact dupe for this!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re naturally tan, and or have olive skin/dark skin this color will really pop on you, I&#x27;m a light skin African American and its beautiful on me!</li>
            <li>was very reasonable too.  </li>
            <li>This color was very mint green when you get it and chips but has a very nice color and texture when you put it on.</li>
            <li>This color is a very pretty dark mint green color &amp; I am more than happy that I decided to purchase this color.</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing Essie brand nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>I really, really like the shade!</li>
            <li>I used my opi base and top coats with this nail color and it worked out great!</li>
            <li>Most other polishes have a blue undertone but this is a beautiful green.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the way mint polish looks on me</li>
            <li>Is really a must have polish for me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It s a pretty color of mint green if you don&#x27;t put a top coat on.</li>
            <li>This is such a gorgeous green</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Close to mint candy apple but much more green.</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s such a good deal for Essie nail polish, that usually cost $8.50 in stores.</li>
            <li>Other than that everything was fine.</li>
            <li>As an older woman I have always used light and pale polishes.</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and arrived sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t the soft, summery color I was hoping for</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a greenish blue but more green.</li>
            <li>First Timer is definitely more green once applied (2 coats) and it dries - almost a pastel/mint green.</li>
            <li>This nail lacquer goes on very well and is a good base coat for glittery polishes (that is what I bought it for) as well as by itself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a mint green polish, and I notice a lot of them have more blue than green in them.</li>
            <li>First Timer has a green undertone whereas Turquoise &amp; Caicos has a blue undertone.</li>

            <li> Nice fresh green color, crème base.</li>
            <li> w change the color to a loud green which is not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The polish also seemed thick like it was getting old.</li>
            <li> It did come a day before it&#x27;s ETA, but I think a week a half is quite a long time.</li>
            <li> so kind of noticeable and a little annoying.</li>
            <li> It was about half the size of a dime</li>
            <li> The polish was also a little thick like it was getting old which  made it hard to apply.</li>
            <li> However, it took this polish a little over a week to get to my house.</li>
            <li> Green is a little darker when applied.  </li>
            <li> This color is probably the closest I could find to Mint green polish.  </li>
            <li> I had been looking for a minty green color and came across this one....</li>
            <li> Sort of hard to describe unfortunately.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think I will ever wear it again, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> If you buy this you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> so I am not too disappointed.</li>
            <li> (use base coat)</li>

            <li> This polish was just ok. It s a pretty color of mint green if you don&#x27;t put a top coat on. If you use a top coat it w change the color to a loud green which is not what I wanted. The polish was also a little thick like it was getting old which  made it hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Green is a little darker when applied.  It&#x27;s a beautiful, fun summer color.&lt;br /&gt;Price was very reasonable too.  Recommend it.</li>

            <li> I loved this nail polish! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the some of the bristle brush are sticking out. Other than that everything was fine.</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing Essie brand nail polish.  I am very happy with this purchase.  It was shipped quickly and arrived sooner than expected.  This color is probably the closest I could find to Mint green polish.  Most other polishes have a blue undertone but this is a beautiful green.  Just what I was looking for in a Spring nail polish color.</li>
            <li> It was purchased as a gift and the person loved the color and the way it came out. . .</li>
            <li> Omg! I am wearing this color now and its so vibrant and beautiful! I used my opi base and top coats with this nail color and it worked out great! If you&#x27;re naturally tan, and or have olive skin/dark skin this color will really pop on you, I&#x27;m a light skin African American and its beautiful on me!</li>

            <li> Beautiful, springy, bright green! (: Will use this for years, I&#x27;m sure. Love the formula, as always with Essie polish.</li>
            <li> Amazing product and customer service. It received a solid 4 star because I followed the installation videos, guides, instructions, and even did it in a steamy bathroom but the bottom left corner just would not stick. It was about half the size of a dime so kind of noticeable and a little annoying. However tech armor has amazing customer service and sent me a replacement ASAP free of charge. I will be installing that one as soon as I get home from business. I would recommend!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product. The color is beautiful and really stands out in the crowd. A great color for any occasion and season!</li>
            <li> Shades of Mojito Madness, which is since out of production. A perfect color for a summer pedi and a good complement to [[ASIN:B002UEF3OM Essie Nail Lacquer, Mint Candy Apple, 0.5 Fluid Ounce]] for accent color styles.</li>
            <li> This nail lacquer goes on very well and is a good base coat for glittery polishes (that is what I bought it for) as well as by itself.</li>
            <li> Nice fresh green color, crème base. Not too bright, good spring and summer color. Color does stain nail bed. (use base coat)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a mint green polish, and I notice a lot of them have more blue than green in them. This is the perfect shade of mint green. If you buy this you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> The size is from a set of the resort colors so it is NOT one that was supposed to be purchased individually I am relatively sure. But it was still around the same price so I am not too disappointed.</li>
            <li> Close to mint candy apple but much more green. i say it would be close to mermaid tears by opi</li>
            <li> I love this brand and the color it gorgeous. I love it. It is well worth the price, I recommend this</li>
            <li> When I saw this online, I didn&#x27;t find it very appealing. The color is much more vivid and eye catching in person.  I definitely recommend for summer. It&#x27;s more bright than a muted spring color. Sort of hard to describe unfortunately.</li>
            <li> As an older woman I have always used light and pale polishes.Well-no more!! Tried this green polish and LOVED IT!!! Since trying this one,I have bought several other bright polishes and Essie is the best!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color!! Glad I added this to my growing Essie collection. Great for every skin tone. It&#x27;s a greenish blue but more green. This color pops on my medium/tan skin!!! A must have!!!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a minty green color and came across this one....I loved it!  Exactly what I was looking for.  Not too bright and its a spring/summer color.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> very pretty color,. exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> This is such a gorgeous green and I LOVE it so much! If you don&#x27;t want to spend very much though, sinful colors make a polish called mint tropics that is the Exact dupe for this! But this has a much better formula!</li>

            <li> Despite owning Turquoise &amp; Caicos, I ordered this polish anyway. First Timer has a green undertone whereas Turquoise &amp; Caicos has a blue undertone. First Timer is definitely more green once applied (2 coats) and it dries - almost a pastel/mint green. I really, really like the shade! It&#x27;d be good for summer, spring, or winter. I&#x27;m very glad I purchased this one despite how similar the online picture is to Turquoise &amp; Caicos because once it dries, they are quite distinct!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to decide whether or not I would purchase this nail polish for over a month.  I have bought a lot of my polish from Amazon when I either can not find it in the store or am looking for a better price.  This was by far the quickest shipping that I have experienced with any of the sellers on the site.  I am very impressed and will definitely use them again.</li>
