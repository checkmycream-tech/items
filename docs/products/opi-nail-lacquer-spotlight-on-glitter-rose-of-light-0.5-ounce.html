            <li>Looks good as a top coat &amp; stays on well, but removes easier than most glitters.</li>
            <li>I like it way better.</li>
            <li>I love this glitter.</li>
            <li>Looks great when painted on straight as well as on top of nail polish.</li>
            <li>but if you do that add a top coat if you&#x27;ll be in the water because it can come off ...</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s that fabulous !</li>
            <li>which is a favorite look of mine</li>
            <li>The sparkle is elegant and not tacky.  </li>

            <li>This just adds so much more sparkle.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful rose gold glitter that is very shiny and pretty.</li>
            <li>Love love love these colorful glittery sparkles!</li>
            <li>/&gt;You do need OPI&#x27;s glitter remover to take them off easily otherwise you will end up rubbing for some time to remove all the glitter.</li>
            <li>This is very light and pretty.</li>
            <li>It has such a holographic look to it and it look amazing!</li>
            <li>The picture can&#x27;t begin to capture how much it really glitters when you put it on top of a nail polish that already has glitter in it.  </li>
            <li>it chips pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>Subtle sparkly, glittery polish makes a perfect topcoat.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment</li>
            <li>This is so gorgeous over light or dark polish.  </li>
            <li>goregeous - use this all the time because it dries so fast and goes on so easily</li>
            <li>The rose gold is very pretty and not as garish as silver or yellow gold.</li>
            <li>This polish is a great option if you are clumsy like me.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I did not like how large the glitter pieces are and</li>
            <li>Very flattering shade of glitter polish.</li>
            <li>This polish really lasts.</li>
            <li>It clumped and came off extremely fast.</li>
            <li>; classy yet fun.</li>
            <li>I used three coats over OPI&#x27;s glitter off and it made it so much easier to remove.</li>
            <li>Now I go to salon only for special occasions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is kind of tough to remove but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look tacky or childish, like so many glitters tend to do.</li>
            <li>This glitter makes your nails look very classy &amp; feminine.</li>
            <li>You can wear this glitter to work over a neutral color like OPI&#x27;s Tickle My France-y &amp; look very polished &amp; professional, or take that same look to dinner without looking out of place.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this simple polish!</li>
            <li>Holographic squares perfectly intertwine with mini radiant glitters in a clear base, so that&#x27;s what makes it stand out from the rest !</li>
            <li>This polish has a clear base with large holographic square shape glitter and rose gold micro glitter.</li>
            <li>Its kinda like &amp;#34;Comet in the Sky&amp;#34; but without the black flecks and large pieces.  </li>
            <li>Problem for me is I have sensitive dry skin, and while sleeping I sometimes scratch.</li>

            <li> This is very light and pretty. I also tried it over a soft pink polish by OPI. Simply beautiful.</li>
            <li> Very flattering shade of glitter polish. Looks good as a top coat &amp; stays on well, but removes easier than most glitters. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is so gorgeous over light or dark polish.  Its kinda like &amp;#34;Comet in the Sky&amp;#34; but without the black flecks and large pieces.  I like it way better.</li>

            <li> Subtle sparkly, glittery polish makes a perfect topcoat. This polish really lasts. The rose gold is very pretty and not as garish as silver or yellow gold. It will be a great color for bridal parties. The micro glitter is embellished with tiny hologram pieces for extra spark.</li>
            <li> Love how sparkly this nail polish is!</li>
            <li> Absolutely STUNNING rose gold!!! so gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Nice sparkle without looking too tacky. I have used this on my hands and feet on different occasions. Stays on very good. Looks great when painted on straight as well as on top of nail polish. This polish is a great option if you are clumsy like me. I always get chips or finger prints on my polish. Before getting this nail lacquer I was spending $30 at a time for salon applied gel polish. These glitters hide the finger prints, and I think it doesn&#x27;t chip at all. Now I go to salon only for special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need OPI&#x27;s glitter remover to take them off easily otherwise you will end up rubbing for some time to remove all the glitter.</li>
            <li> The best glitter polish I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> goregeous - use this all the time because it dries so fast and goes on so easily</li>
            <li> I purchased two colors of this glitter lacquer.  I have used OPI products before and I have liked them.  The glitter lacquer was very thick and the glitter did not spread well.  It clumped and came off extremely fast.</li>
            <li> GLITTERY.  Quite Nice!</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish! It has the perfect amount of sparkle!</li>
            <li> Nice color; classy yet fun. Problem for me is I have sensitive dry skin, and while sleeping I sometimes scratch. The rough edges of the glitter would cause me to cut my skin badly, so I stopped using this product!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have to ever remove ... can just keep layering over ... but if you do that add a top coat if you&#x27;ll be in the water because it can come off ...</li>
            <li> This glitter makes your nails look very classy &amp; feminine. I call this a glitter for grown women. It doesn&#x27;t look tacky or childish, like so many glitters tend to do. You can wear this glitter to work over a neutral color like OPI&#x27;s Tickle My France-y &amp; look very polished &amp; professional, or take that same look to dinner without looking out of place. You can even wear this on it&#x27;s own in 3 coats to a party &amp; outshine the lights. Yes, it&#x27;s that fabulous ! I&#x27;ve also worn this over Essie&#x27;s Ladylike which is a favorite look of mine &amp; I always receive compliments nonstop. Holographic squares perfectly intertwine with mini radiant glitters in a clear base, so that&#x27;s what makes it stand out from the rest !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments on this polish than I can count!  2 coats and you are sparkling away!  The sparkle is elegant and not tacky.  If you like sparkly nail polish make this a part of your polish wardrobe TODAY!</li>
            <li> This glitter polish is gorgeous! Exactly what I was looking for. This polish has a clear base with large holographic square shape glitter and rose gold micro glitter. So many stunning glitter looks you can accomplish with this polish. Another win by OPI.</li>
            <li> Love love love these colorful glittery sparkles!</li>
            <li> Very delicate and feminine color. I love this one. I will use it a lot around the holidays, I can tell! It is also great for painting over a darker polish. Stays on well with an OPI topcoat and comes off easier than other glitter polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this simple polish!</li>
            <li> It has such a holographic look to it and it look amazing! I used three coats over OPI&#x27;s glitter off and it made it so much easier to remove.</li>
            <li> Beautiful rose gold glitter that is very shiny and pretty. This has a great formula and the glitter goes evenly on the nail. This is a must have polish.</li>
            <li> Spotlight was on my nails when I wore this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink and perky!  This is like &amp;#34;Chasing Rainbows&amp;#34; but with a hint of pink--still has tons of glitter!  The picture can&#x27;t begin to capture how much it really glitters when you put it on top of a nail polish that already has glitter in it.  This just adds so much more sparkle.  Both are must haves!</li>
            <li> Great price. Quick shipment</li>
            <li> I did not like how large the glitter pieces are and it chips pretty easily.  Maybe I used it incorrectly??</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, nice and shiny, wears well.  Makes a great addition to anyone&#x27;s polish collection!</li>
