            <li>This primers are amazing ..</li>
            <li>It also has some amazing staying power too.  </li>
            <li>patted a warm wash rag on eyes to get rid of access as there was a line in the crease of eyelid.</li>
            <li>I will probably use it again, but it would be nice to try the silver color.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not noticing much of a difference, but for the price, I&#x27;m happy with two whites!</li>
            <li>Thanks for an excellent product!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the pearl one yet, but I am sure I will love it too!  </li>
            <li>I am a fan of the light colors as they make you look bright eyed.  </li>
            <li>This works nicely and looks lovely.</li>
            <li>an cheap colours look good.</li>
            <li>The natural color is the best for cover up.  </li>
            <li>These are pretty good but not as good as my Rimmel primer</li>
            <li>Great shipping time and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Each go on very smoothly and work better than anticipated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Not opened and not ruined! :)</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the products.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite primer.</li>
            <li>Ive used tube primers before, but my makeup stays on  much better when I can use my brush with these.</li>
            <li>I love all of the Nxy products that I have tried...</li>
            <li>this being way more affordable.</li>
            <li>but when I got this awsome item I was in aw love this</li>
            <li>I will buy again for sure and had even given these out as part of my makeup gift package .</li>
            <li>I purchased this product when my favorite primer went on backorder.</li>
            <li>My favorite primer comes in tube</li>
            <li>I love getting all three in one go.</li>
            <li>I love them all and use them every day.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re ok if you want to put it over a better primer to even out your skin tone maybe.</li>
            <li>Probably has more to do with my 55</li>
            <li>Pretty good have used better.</li>
            <li>This item got to me very quickly  And packaged very neatly, I use   Them all the time they work amazingly!  </li>
            <li>I don´t know how I could live without it!&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; color is perfect for all types or skin (I´m a medium type and it works VERY well)</li>
            <li>If you love doing fun things with eyeshadow, these products are a must!</li>
            <li>Lasts all day and goes on easy.</li>
            <li>I received the products very quickly from the seller.</li>
            <li>so i cut down the amount i was using and BAM perfect after that.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for the price considering your getting three different colors.  </li>
            <li>White is great for colors and I use the beige for brown shadows.</li>
            <li>My eyeshadow looks great and it last all day...</li>
            <li>I am not a heavy user of make-up, so this is perfect, because I don&#x27;t like to reapply during the day and it helps it to last longer.  </li>
            <li>It really helps the eyeshadow color pop more, and stay on longer.</li>
            <li>I both agreed its just as good as Urban Decay primer</li>
            <li>This is a good product for someone who is just starting as an MUA.</li>
            <li>Very much I recommend to get!</li>
            <li>This is an easy product to use and it seems to work very well in preventing your eye shadow from dreading.</li>
            <li>They took the time to pack it nicely and list it as fragile which guaranteed it arrived in one piece as a opposed to shards of glass.</li>
            <li>you can do so much with this item like line your lower eyes and put on your favorite shadows on like a super model you should just buy this and then go on UTube to learn the proper way to use this item buy buy buy trust me</li>
            <li>I love how it doesn&#x27;t make my eye shadow crease and it makes the colors pop and they last all day!</li>
            <li>I love makeup, especially eyeshadow and was always frusterated that the eyeshadow would never stay on how I applaied</li>
            <li>Overall, I guess I&#x27;m satisfied and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>After using it for the first time I fell in love&amp;lt;3</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally did!</li>
            <li>I really recomended!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love the option of having the different colors.  </li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>It really keeps your shadow on!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set of primers to anyone who wants to say &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; with their eyes!!</li>
            <li>I doesn&#x27;t last all day, but it is better than just straight eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Normally i use MACs  eyeshadow stick as a eyeshadow primer, but this stuff does the trick just as good for less.</li>
            <li>Firstly, this is a reasonable price for NYX primer and the fact that you get all 3 colors is a plus.</li>
            <li>I really like this product it came in a timely matter</li>
            <li>and it really makes my eyeshadow pop~</li>
            <li>I would use to prime for one of my cheap eyeliners so it can last throughout the day on my eye lid n using neutral eyeshadow colors.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Thanks AMAZON &amp;lt;3.~</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to apply much.</li>
            <li>I wear the pearlized and whiter version for dressier occasions and it really perks up my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Really does make even the chalkiest colours</li>
            <li>Again, as much which means I still had some creasing.</li>
            <li>The price and quality at high level!</li>
            <li>too much applied</li>
            <li>They really help my make up stay on throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I like being able to switch it up and use the different colors for different eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>This is nice, received on time but hard to use.</li>
            <li>okay, the skin color is dried out ... not creamy like whites.</li>
            <li>I tried vasoline, foundation, and pretty much anything you can imagine to keep my eyeshadow art intact for more than a few hours, but with little success.    </li>
            <li>white eyeshadow primer is useful for dramatic looks with bright colors,cat eyes, or e.t.c.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I am cosmetology student, once I started getting into eyeshadow,I knew I had to buy a eye shadow primer,but being new to it</li>
            <li>to give an idea on how to use&#x27;em for those who are new to makeup</li>
            <li>On the third attempt, I used more and immediately with my eye still closed, I applied my shadow.</li>
            <li>I have read where some girls are experiencing an oily smear later on, when i first began using this product i also had this problem</li>
            <li>When I use my favorite primer, I apply it to both eyes and when I decide (usually within 2-3 minutes) on the colors (I use three colors each time I shade my lids), I apply the shadow.</li>
            <li>The order arrived fast and the product lasts you a long time, you dont need to apply much.</li>
            <li>I do applaud NYX for providing a very decent primer for people who are either starting out in the world of eye shadow, have drier lids or just need something for the moment.  </li>
            <li>The primer is creamy and takes a little pressure on the eyelid to blend it smoothly.  </li>
            <li>white one REALLY POP-UP the colors of your shadows</li>
            <li>+ year old eye lids and not the product.  </li>
            <li>The other colors are too light and sheer for my taste.  </li>
            <li>The white and the glossy white pretty much look the same to me though</li>
            <li>The product itself is definitely much different than what I normally use.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the sparkle white use mostly the darker shade or plain white.</li>
            <li>I want something smooth to go on the lid since it&#x27;s so sensitive (the skin is delicate here)</li>
            <li>Each pot is labeled for the fuction it performs such as brightening, vivid, etc.</li>
            <li>On the second attempt, I used a little more, again, found the creases appearing about four to five hours later with the same end of day look.</li>
            <li>I recommend this primer if you are in a serious pinch like myself and need to wait for your favorite primer to come back in stock.</li>
            <li>Also realized how s***ty the first eye shadow primer I bought was, 12 bucks down the drain.</li>
            <li>This time, I found that if I kept my eye closed prior to shadowing, the primer doesn&#x27;t crease, therefore, the eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t crease as much.</li>
            <li>Next purchase will only be the natural color.</li>
            <li>By the time I left work, I barely had any shadow left on my lids.</li>
            <li>This is definitely not a long wear primer nor is it waterproof which is necessary sometimes.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I used very little thinking</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I really like this product it came in a timely matter</li>
            <li> and it really makes my eyeshadow pop~</li>
            <li> I would use to prime for one of my cheap eyeliners so it can last throughout the day on my eye lid n using neutral eyeshadow colors.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Thanks AMAZON &amp;lt;3.~</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to apply much.</li>
            <li> I wear the pearlized and whiter version for dressier occasions and it really perks up my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Really does make even the chalkiest colours</li>
            <li> Again, as much which means I still had some creasing.</li>
            <li> The price and quality at high level!</li>
            <li> too much applied</li>
            <li> They really help my make up stay on throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I like being able to switch it up and use the different colors for different eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> This is nice, received on time but hard to use.</li>
            <li> okay, the skin color is dried out ... not creamy like whites.</li>
            <li> I tried vasoline, foundation, and pretty much anything you can imagine to keep my eyeshadow art intact for more than a few hours, but with little success.    </li>
            <li> white eyeshadow primer is useful for dramatic looks with bright colors,cat eyes, or e.t.c.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I am cosmetology student, once I started getting into eyeshadow,I knew I had to buy a eye shadow primer,but being new to it</li>
            <li> to give an idea on how to use&#x27;em for those who are new to makeup</li>
            <li> On the third attempt, I used more and immediately with my eye still closed, I applied my shadow.</li>
            <li> I have read where some girls are experiencing an oily smear later on, when i first began using this product i also had this problem</li>
            <li> When I use my favorite primer, I apply it to both eyes and when I decide (usually within 2-3 minutes) on the colors (I use three colors each time I shade my lids), I apply the shadow.</li>
            <li> The order arrived fast and the product lasts you a long time, you dont need to apply much.</li>
            <li> I do applaud NYX for providing a very decent primer for people who are either starting out in the world of eye shadow, have drier lids or just need something for the moment.  </li>
            <li> The primer is creamy and takes a little pressure on the eyelid to blend it smoothly.  </li>
            <li> white one REALLY POP-UP the colors of your shadows</li>
            <li> + year old eye lids and not the product.  </li>
            <li> The other colors are too light and sheer for my taste.  </li>
            <li> The white and the glossy white pretty much look the same to me though</li>
            <li> The product itself is definitely much different than what I normally use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the sparkle white use mostly the darker shade or plain white.</li>
            <li> I want something smooth to go on the lid since it&#x27;s so sensitive (the skin is delicate here)</li>
            <li> Each pot is labeled for the fuction it performs such as brightening, vivid, etc.</li>
            <li> On the second attempt, I used a little more, again, found the creases appearing about four to five hours later with the same end of day look.</li>
            <li> I recommend this primer if you are in a serious pinch like myself and need to wait for your favorite primer to come back in stock.</li>
            <li> Also realized how s***ty the first eye shadow primer I bought was, 12 bucks down the drain.</li>
            <li> This time, I found that if I kept my eye closed prior to shadowing, the primer doesn&#x27;t crease, therefore, the eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t crease as much.</li>
            <li> Next purchase will only be the natural color.</li>
            <li> By the time I left work, I barely had any shadow left on my lids.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not a long wear primer nor is it waterproof which is necessary sometimes.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, I used very little thinking</li>
            <li> It had such a good reviews I&#x60;m disappointed</li>
            <li> The con to this is if you have somewhat long fingernails, you have to use the opposite side of your nail or else you will get it under your nail.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the nude and the plain white so far.</li>
            <li> Due to the mixed reviews, I was on the fence for a bit prior to making the actual purchase.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t crease, my eyeshadows stay , I did my make up for Valentins day and it lasted me all night long</li>
            <li> It makes my eyeshadow pop in color and it lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I wear the natural color everyday, and I think my shadow and eyeliner stay fresher longer.  </li>
            <li> If you have oily lids (like I do), your shadow will not last unless you plan on being out only for a FEW hours.</li>
            <li> Dont spend a lot of money in consealers that are too wet, this is dry and make the job!</li>
            <li> I usually use only MAC eye makeup, but from funds being low iv had to make due with what i can.</li>
            <li> I love the option of three different base products.  </li>
            <li> I personally use the skin tone one frequently i only put a VERY small amount over each eye lid and then apply a earthen tone eyeshadow and or powder.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way!</li>
            <li> I repeated this process for my other eye.</li>
            <li> I used both colors under brows and lower lids, it goes on thick with a brush (I used a tiny amount).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I saw the price lowered down I knew it was my calling~&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race for featuring Nyx cosmetics!!  </li>
            <li> I usually put it on and then let it dry a bit</li>
            <li> buy one get one half off of NYX makeup.</li>
            <li> I had bought this item almost a week and a half ago</li>
            <li> I need to use less shadow.  </li>
            <li> these come in little \\&quot;pots\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> you can go wrong and every women will think a professional makeup artist did your makeup</li>
            <li> They are my everyday go to primers.</li>
            <li> and my eyeshadow looked dull approximately three to four hours later.</li>
            <li> Also, they also tend to crease a bit which can be frustrating when applying loose powder shadow.  </li>
            <li> but it´s a little hard to blend.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> I had no more smear on my crease line.</li>
            <li> First time to use an eyeshadow base</li>
            <li> They tend to go on thick and pasty and it takes a bit of blending to get them to even out.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other base ever.</li>
            <li> Just a tip: be wary on how my primer you use since it can crease.</li>
            <li> I was so sad when I lost them while moving</li>
            <li> and I still havent recieved it deff not a happy customer!!!!</li>
            <li> These eye shadow base primers are not very effective.</li>
            <li> Each base will change the look of your eyes and shadow.  </li>
            <li> As a MUA I don&#x27;t find NYX base eye shadow primer to work the way I thought they would.</li>
            <li> I had already had a primer base</li>
            <li> I found that I had creases (which I HATE with a passion)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really love this product! I don´t know how I could live without it!&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; color is perfect for all types or skin (I´m a medium type and it works VERY well) (I wish have a 3-package of this)&lt;br /&gt;The white one REALLY POP-UP the colors of your shadows but it´s a little hard to blend.&lt;br /&gt;And the shimmery one... I haven´t used it yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I like the idea of getting three colors to experiment with.  Each base will change the look of your eyes and shadow.  The primer is creamy and takes a little pressure on the eyelid to blend it smoothly.  I am a fan of the light colors as they make you look bright eyed.  Great for work.  And they work as well as any primer I have used.</li>
            <li> I love how it doesn&#x27;t make my eye shadow crease and it makes the colors pop and they last all day!</li>
            <li> Works great cheaper then buying seperate</li>
            <li> I usually use only MAC eye makeup, but from funds being low iv had to make due with what i can. Normally i use MACs  eyeshadow stick as a eyeshadow primer, but this stuff does the trick just as good for less. Iv only used it once and used the white pearl and even with the cheaper eye-shadows, enhances the color and by the end of the day still looks like i just put it on.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great shipping time and exactly as described. Not opened and not ruined! :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price considering your getting three different colors.  Im so glad I found this product because it can also be used as a primer which is great for me because I don&#x27;t know about you but my eyeshadow would always come off before the end of the work day nlow I don&#x27;t have to worry about that problem.</li>
            <li> The best primer, the bes!</li>
            <li> This primers are amazing .. They don&#x27;t crease, my eyeshadows stay , I did my make up for Valentins day and it lasted me all night long I was suprised and amazed , I totally recommend this product ...this was a great deal ...</li>
            <li> I ordered the set of three primers two months ago as a trial to see if they would keep my eyeshadow intact.  I love makeup, especially eyeshadow and was always frusterated that the eyeshadow would never stay on how I applaied it- I would go to work with a smokey eye style and two hours into my shift, I would have a foggy shadow look that would be all around my eye.  I tried vasoline, foundation, and pretty much anything you can imagine to keep my eyeshadow art intact for more than a few hours, but with little success.    After using these, my makeup stays on for hours!  I get several compliments on my makeup now since I started using this primer than all the years I have been wearing makeup combined. If you love doing fun things with eyeshadow, these products are a must!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the products. I have been wanting to by all three of these bases and now that I have them I will never use any other base ever. My eyeshadow last all day. LOVE!! LOVE!! LOVE!!</li>
            <li> This item got to me very quickly  And packaged very neatly, I use   Them all the time they work amazingly!  Love  these products!</li>
            <li> Firstly, this is a reasonable price for NYX primer and the fact that you get all 3 colors is a plus. It took a while to get the product, but it came in great condition. Overall, I guess I&#x27;m satisfied and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite primer. I have it in white and the beige. White is great for colors and I use the beige for brown shadows. I put it on with a \\&quot;smudge\\&quot; brush--which works out perfectly. Ive used tube primers before, but my makeup stays on  much better when I can use my brush with these.</li>
            <li> All three colors did not arrive, I received 2 whites and 1 skin color. The whites are moist and work okay, the skin color is dried out ... not creamy like whites. I used both colors under brows and lower lids, it goes on thick with a brush (I used a tiny amount).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I patted a warm wash rag on eyes to get rid of access as there was a line in the crease of eyelid. It has good staying power. I will probably use it again, but it would be nice to try the silver color.</li>
            <li> This works good. I like being able to switch it up and use the different colors for different eyeshadows. It really helps the eyeshadow color pop more, and stay on longer. I doesn&#x27;t last all day, but it is better than just straight eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I really like this product it came in a timely matter and it really makes my eyeshadow pop~ I read some of the reviews and I almost didn&#x27;t purchase the product.  I am very impressed!! My eyeshadow looks great and it last all day...I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  When you use the white the colors of your eyeshadow just POP!  It also has some amazing staying power too.  I haven&#x27;t tried the pearl one yet, but I am sure I will love it too!  Thank you RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race for featuring Nyx cosmetics!!  Do you remember they gave a lifetime supply to the Queen who won...Wish it had been me!  I love all of the Nxy products that I have tried...I highly recommend this set of primers to anyone who wants to say &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; with their eyes!!</li>
            <li> Eyeshadow stays on all day without smudging! Just a tip: be wary on how my primer you use since it can crease. I usually put it on and then let it dry a bit so I can work out any creases.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the nude and the plain white so far. The white and the glossy white pretty much look the same to me though, I&#x27;m not noticing much of a difference, but for the price, I&#x27;m happy with two whites! Good deal.</li>
            <li> This arrived on schedule with time to spear. Each go on very smoothly and work better than anticipated. I recommend this product to makeup lover who is looking for a good quality product to help keep their eye shadow on. I would definitely buy from this buyer again.</li>
            <li> As a MUA I don&#x27;t find NYX base eye shadow primer to work the way I thought they would. They tend to go on thick and pasty and it takes a bit of blending to get them to even out. Also, they also tend to crease a bit which can be frustrating when applying loose powder shadow.  When applying a primer I want something smooth to go on the lid since it&#x27;s so sensitive (the skin is delicate here) and I don&#x27;t want to have to rub, or pull a product on the lid. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase these again.</li>
            <li> I am cosmetology student, once I started getting into eyeshadow,I knew I had to buy a eye shadow primer,but being new to it I was clueless as to which one to buy.I bought a 12 dollar eye shadow primer at Sally&#x27;s, so I thought it was good until one of my classmates recommended me NYX eye shadow primer so I went to go buy it at Ulta since they had a sale at the time buy one get one half off of NYX makeup. After using it for the first time I fell in love&amp;lt;3 Also realized how s***ty the first eye shadow primer I bought was, 12 bucks down the drain. My classmate n I both agreed its just as good as Urban Decay primer PLUS this being way more affordable. When I saw the price lowered down I knew it was my calling~&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking for a good eyeshadow primer I&#x27;d recommend this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The white eyeshadow primer is useful for dramatic looks with bright colors,cat eyes, or e.t.c.&lt;br /&gt;The neutral color eyeshadow primer I would use to prime for one of my cheap eyeliners so it can last throughout the day on my eye lid n using neutral eyeshadow colors.&lt;br /&gt;Just to give an idea on how to use&#x27;em for those who are new to makeup industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping too! Thanks AMAZON &amp;lt;3.~</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. The order arrived fast and the product lasts you a long time, you dont need to apply much.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. I&#x27;ve been wanting to by these for a while but just never had the time. I&#x27;m glad I finally did! I use them all the time. It makes my eyeshadow pop in color and it lasts all day long. You don&#x27;t need to apply much. A little does go a long way! I&#x27;m buying again in the future!</li>
            <li> This is the best primer I&#x27;ve ever bought! A must!</li>
            <li> This is nice, received on time but hard to use. They should send applicator</li>
            <li> I had already had a primer base but when I got this awsome item I was in aw love this you can do so much with this item like line your lower eyes and put on your favorite shadows on like a super model you should just buy this and then go on UTube to learn the proper way to use this item buy buy buy trust me you can go wrong and every women will think a professional makeup artist did your makeup I promise you that!!!</li>
            <li> These are pretty good but not as good as my Rimmel primer but it&#x27;s a great price for all three</li>
            <li> I personally use the skin tone one frequently i only put a VERY small amount over each eye lid and then apply a earthen tone eyeshadow and or powder. This works nicely and looks lovely. I have read where some girls are experiencing an oily smear later on, when i first began using this product i also had this problem so i cut down the amount i was using and BAM perfect after that. I had no more smear on my crease line. As for the hold up of eyeshadow it stays on perfectly all day until i wash it off. I love this product it keeps my eyeshadow looking flawless all day and night. This will be a continued part of my eye beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these! They went on so well. I was so sad when I lost them while moving but it was great. I took a star off because I remember it drying up a bit in its container</li>
            <li> This is a great set of primer.  Lasts all day and goes on easy.</li>
            <li> Dont spend a lot of money in consealers that are too wet, this is dry and make the job! I really recomended!</li>
            <li> I had bought this item almost a week and a half ago and I still havent recieved it deff not a happy customer!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the option of three different base products.  I wear the natural color everyday, and I think my shadow and eyeliner stay fresher longer.  I wear the pearlized and whiter version for dressier occasions and it really perks up my eyes.  I need to use less shadow.  I am not a heavy user of make-up, so this is perfect, because I don&#x27;t like to reapply during the day and it helps it to last longer.  It also gives the shadow a smoother look.</li>
            <li> Really does make even the chalkiest colours an cheap colours look good. Will always use it for the shoots I do</li>
            <li> WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVERY TRIED IT DONE NOTHING TO KEEP MY EYE SHOWDO ON MY EYES AND I HAVE THE OILIEST EYES OUT THERE</li>
            <li> Makes eye shadow pop and make it last all nite . I will buy again for sure and had even given these out as part of my makeup gift package . Really good buy</li>
            <li> I purchased this product when my favorite primer went on backorder. Due to the mixed reviews, I was on the fence for a bit prior to making the actual purchase.  I received the products very quickly from the seller. The seller definitely made an impression because it was not just shoved in some envelope. They took the time to pack it nicely and list it as fragile which guaranteed it arrived in one piece as a opposed to shards of glass. As promised there were three separate functioning primers in my package.  The product itself is definitely much different than what I normally use. My favorite primer comes in tube these come in little \\&quot;pots\\&quot;. My primer is a waterproof creamy consistency this one is sort of the same except it dries into a powder-like finish. Each pot is labeled for the fuction it performs such as brightening, vivid, etc. The con to this is if you have somewhat long fingernails, you have to use the opposite side of your nail or else you will get it under your nail.   The first time I tried it, I used very little thinking it was all that I needed. I found that I had creases (which I HATE with a passion) and my eyeshadow looked dull approximately three to four hours later. By the time I left work, I barely had any shadow left on my lids. On the second attempt, I used a little more, again, found the creases appearing about four to five hours later with the same end of day look. On the third attempt, I used more and immediately with my eye still closed, I applied my shadow. I repeated this process for my other eye. This time, I found that if I kept my eye closed prior to shadowing, the primer doesn&#x27;t crease, therefore, the eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t crease as much. Again, as much which means I still had some creasing. When I use my favorite primer, I apply it to both eyes and when I decide (usually within 2-3 minutes) on the colors (I use three colors each time I shade my lids), I apply the shadow. You can&#x27;t use NYX in this manner because the moment you open your eyes, you will see there are creases which appear even after you shadow your lids.  If you have oily lids (like I do), your shadow will not last unless you plan on being out only for a FEW hours. This is definitely not a long wear primer nor is it waterproof which is necessary sometimes. I do applaud NYX for providing a very decent primer for people who are either starting out in the world of eye shadow, have drier lids or just need something for the moment.  I recommend this primer if you are in a serious pinch like myself and need to wait for your favorite primer to come back in stock. As a permanent staple in my beauty kit...probably not.</li>
            <li> Came on time and works great! Good price I was very happy with the whole thing! I love getting all three in one go. I love them all and use them every day. It lasts forever. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks for an excellent product! Very much I recommend to get! Excellent thing! The price and quality at high level! To use very simply!</li>
            <li> This is a good product for someone who is just starting as an MUA. I tested it out and seems to last through outside conditions including sweat. Keeps shadow from smearing or fading. Only issue is the application process...too much applied and it becomes cakey and can leave creases.</li>
            <li> These eye shadow base primers are not very effective. I noticed creasing and fading by the end of the day. My Urban Decay primer does not do that. My shadow stays put until I take it off. They&#x27;re ok if you want to put it over a better primer to even out your skin tone maybe. Otherwise don&#x27;t bother with these. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love the option of having the different colors.  They really help my make up stay on throughout the day.</li>
            <li> They crease; pearl shines as hell and does not hold at all. It had such a good reviews I&#x60;m disappointed</li>
            <li> First time to use an eyeshadow base and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It really works! And affordable as well! Buy it!</li>
            <li> This is an easy product to use and it seems to work very well in preventing your eye shadow from dreading.</li>
            <li> The natural color is the best for cover up.  The other colors are too light and sheer for my taste.  Probably has more to do with my 55+ year old eye lids and not the product.  Next purchase will only be the natural color.</li>
            <li> El paquete llego en el tiempo indicado, y en perfectas condiciones, el producto es de calidad. Recomiendo a este vendedor!.</li>
            <li> These are the best and the cheapest you will find them! I am so glad I went ahead and got these! They are my everyday go to primers.</li>
            <li> i was told it a great product they loved it. it arrived on time packaging was very good will shop again</li>
            <li> One of the best primers I have used. It really keeps your shadow on!</li>
            <li> Pretty good have used better. Don&#x27;t like the sparkle white use mostly the darker shade or plain white.</li>
