            <li>AWESOME LOVE</li>
            <li>After being impressed with this product i bought a couple more from Oz naturals.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find an effective product for my eye area, and this product didn&#x27;t make the bottom of the list of tried products, so there&#x27;s that!</li>
            <li>excellent product i love it</li>
            <li>Awesome result,  more than expectations.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this purchase and will buy more.</li>
            <li>It is so sticky - after I put it on, and smiled - my under-eyes crinkled (you know, like all eyes do when you smile)....and the crinkles just....stayed there!</li>
            <li>bought for the great price and good reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many eye creams and undeniably, this eye cream is the best!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my own!</li>
            <li>I will be recommending this product to all of my friends &amp; family who want an effective eye treatment that is cruelty-free!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s cooling and has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>What a pleasant surprise.</li>

            <li>It just makes me glow a bit more and that is amazing!!</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t sticky, are easy to apply and priced really great!</li>
            <li>bottle is extremely easy to use with a pump that dispenses the perfect amount.</li>
            <li>And the cream (I&#x27;d call it more of a gel) does the best job of tightening out of all the (MANY!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best eye gel that I have use so far, and the best part is</li>

            <li>Thanks for a great product that works!</li>
            <li>My yoga instructor is gorgeous and has the most amazing skin</li>
            <li>My wife started using the Best Eye Gel Eye Cream for her eyes and the product has really helped her.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what is in the product, but it really works great!</li>
            <li>It in no way affects my ability  to review things honestly.  </li>
            <li>After using it for over two weeks , I can honestly say that it works.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice</li>
            <li>She said again that its nice</li>
            <li>it is the nice way it makes my skin feel like it&#x27;s tightening</li>
            <li>This really is the BEST eye gel I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li>I use the gel as the serum for my eye area / between the brow area and around the mouth area - I am absolutely loving the product.</li>
            <li>The gel feels nice</li>
            <li>but I noticed that it would kind of cake up around the corner of my eye which I do not like.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, this stuff could be used as an all-over the face anti-aging product.  </li>
            <li>I use it morning and night and keeps my eyes nice and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Im gonna order my own ASAP</li>
            <li>Honestly I still need some work on my bags</li>
            <li>NICE, COOLING FEELING -</li>
            <li>I was given the product to give my honest opinion and here it is.</li>
            <li>I really liked the texture and slip of the product plus lack of oiliness.</li>
            <li>Nice eye cream.</li>
            <li>Smells and feels nice.</li>
            <li>Feels very soothing, ingredient list is impressive.</li>
            <li>I liked this product a lot.</li>
            <li>and I have been seeing even more good results.</li>
            <li>The Vitamin C serum is my absolute favorite!!!!!  </li>
            <li>It felt really nice on my skin and istantly made a difference.</li>
            <li>So great that I want to apply more and more.</li>
            <li>but now as always my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I just bought the cleanser and Vitamin C serum since these products are so effective.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just that I don&#x27;t think my skin liked it around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I gave this product to my aunt and she is thrilled</li>
            <li>I also use coconut oil all over my face and Vitamin E and Rose Hip Seed oil under my eyes for night time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If there are none coming, that&#x27;s OK; this product just makes things feel really good.</li>
            <li>I am loving this to wear it under doing makeup.</li>
            <li>So that is kind of an added perk!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The oil also tended to wear off any kind of eyeliner I used.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt and I liked the way the gel felt</li>
            <li>Nice products</li>
            <li>They are ok - nothing great, just ok.</li>
            <li>so I have to be safe when choosing a product that will be good for me.</li>
            <li>am very happy that the formula is made from real plants and has no chemical junk in it.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>I liked seeing the amount</li>
            <li>(I purchased with my own money)</li>
            <li>Honestly, I can already see a difference.</li>
            <li>All opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product at an excellent price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how some of these products get so many good reviews</li>
            <li>It feels nice going on and moisturizes to some extent, though.</li>
            <li>I keep it in the refrigerator for a cooling sensation after a warm shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also liked the pump because I didn&#x27;t have to put my fingers in the product and get bacteria in it.</li>
            <li>It is a nice lotion in a pump, which I am now using on the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li>The serum adds a nice amount of moisture to my eyes and forehead</li>
            <li>This product feels nice going on.</li>
            <li>I liked before I got this, that the seller emailed me how to use it</li>
            <li>Nice bottle pump.</li>
            <li>solely my own</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not as spectacular as the advertising says.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice eye gel.</li>
            <li>But there were so many good reviews here, I had to try</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s really nothing to lose in trying for yourself and it happens to be the best selling eye gel on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I liked the product a lot.</li>
            <li>Regardless, everything that I say is my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>best eye gel ever had1 thanks</li>
            <li>This is nice on the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I continue to buy it because it is effective.</li>
            <li>but still hoping, although I&#x27;m thrilled with anything.</li>
            <li>I love the feel, I almost feel like my under eyes are tightened in a good feeling way.</li>
            <li>However ALL opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li>The smell is soooo good, it&#x27;s like melon, I love it.</li>
            <li>I feels nice</li>
            <li>Adding OZ Naturals Superior Youth Eye Gel to your beauty routine whether it be before bed, after your morning shower, or under your makeup, you’ll have more radiant and youthful looking</li>
            <li>it smells good and doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily still hoping to see more results</li>
            <li>Nice product, like the coolness when applied.</li>
            <li>how nice it</li>
            <li>Reasonable price for an excellent product as well.</li>
            <li>A Honest Review for Trying products...  </li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.  </li>
            <li>Great eye cream its gentle but works great.</li>
            <li>have received this product in return of my HONEST review.</li>
            <li>Kind of sticky once it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>My opinions and comfy eyes are my own.</li>
            <li>I suggest taking a photo of yourself for a before and after to compare because I honestly can not tell the difference.</li>
            <li>Quite honestly, I have not seen a difference yet</li>
            <li>But for now I can say that I do like the product and am hopeful for some nice results.</li>
            <li>This has a nice consistency and moisturizers quite well.</li>
            <li>However all thoughts and opinions expressed are solely my own.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to get the opportunity to try this product for quality and testing purposes.</li>
            <li>It effectively helps to reduce the discoloring and plump up that area.</li>
            <li>It smells like cucumbers, though, which is nice.</li>
            <li>a side note, I’ve found it best to use it during the night, right before sleeping, as that gives the eye cream plenty of time to work its magic.</li>
            <li>This eye gel feels very nice and is light in texture which is what I prefer.</li>

            <li>Love this product, going on around the eyes very easily.</li>
            <li>Great product and very reasonable price</li>
            <li>For the first 3 times, nothing happened and I was quite happy.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this because of the great reviews and because it is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>This worked great from the first time I used it</li>
            <li>I experienced a stinging feeling the first time I applied it, but I kept using it.  </li>
            <li>Felt cool and tingly to they eye which can be a good thing.</li>
            <li>It helps with fine lines for sure, and lessens wrinkles as well!</li>
            <li>The product is also very light and non greasy.</li>
            <li>It looks very smooth where I apply this eye gel.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly</li>
            <li>You will notice that this is a very light textured gel.</li>
            <li>Very light weight.</li>
            <li>There is a very light scent.  </li>
            <li>It is very light and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>like Aloe (a great first ingredient,) Matrixyl 3000 along with peptides,  plant stem cells, vegetable glycerin and much more.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Super Youth Eye Gel for a couple of months now and am happy to report that my fine lines are diminishing.</li>
            <li>I found that using the Oz Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel my eyes felt good throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance and easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It felt so good the very first time I applied it.  </li>
            <li>The eye gel is amazing and has diminished the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>fine lines around eyes amazingly well.</li>
            <li>Because I was so impressed with how well this worked, I purchased other Oz Naturals products and have been very pleased with them as well.  </li>
            <li>So far I have found this eye cream to be very good at smoothing out crow&#x27;s feet.  </li>
            <li>Has a gel type consistency and the packaging is very good- allows for complete emptying of container.  </li>
            <li>The price is very good and being natural is truly what you should be using.</li>
            <li>So far very good.</li>
            <li>(I ran out of it, and wasn&#x27;t able to get around to reordering it for about 2 weeks.)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>or you&#x27;ll release more gel than needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never had a product you could use on your eye lids safely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous products and this has been the best.</li>
            <li>Better than estee lauder.</li>
            <li>after one week you can see result.:)</li>
            <li>This product caused more damage to my skin than help.</li>
            <li>Need to use more often.</li>
            <li>It was just okay.  </li>
            <li>just okay</li>
            <li>think I&#x27;ll try something else to get better results.</li>
            <li>can see how some people could love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My under eyes have never been better.</li>
            <li>but now that I use this cream it helped so much more with the darkness and eye puffiness.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t, be sure to contact the company, because results are not forthcoming.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>and I love the price.</li>
            <li>Excellent, this is my second bottle.</li>

            <li>and I am able to wear under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I apply under both eyes top of both eyes side of both eyes on the bridge of my nose also my forehead and around my lips</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Can Be Used As An All-Over Face Treatment For A Brighter More Radiant Complexion</li>

            <li>I love that I can trust this product to use anywhere on my face... not just on my eyes... and that it contains no parabens, sulfates, or alcohol.  </li>

            <li>Great, I thought - and bought the WHOLE LINE.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Always hoping for magic in a jar, I ordered this by description &amp; reviews alone.</li>
            <li>I sold cosmetics and skincare for many years.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Although it smells yummily like cucumbers, It feels as if it sits on top of my skin and does not penetrate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the way this feels when I put it on.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product after reading so many favorable reviews, however after testing the product myself</li>
            <li>I have used department store brands, designer cosmetic store top sellers, and top line drug store products, and none can compare to the results of these 3 products.  </li>
            <li>I did notice it give my skin a better tone and gave a brighter appearance over all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>okay: notice no changes yet....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe most of the reviewers on this</li>
            <li>Thank you so much love the products and the prices.</li>
            <li>mother love it.  </li>
            <li>I, like many before me, have used many products that claim youthful eyes.  </li>
            <li>Or just got better</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Kind of a scam if you read all the testimonials on people who got this for FREE.  </li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>The fact that it helps and is also not going to break the bank is fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>:) Defiently recommend it to anyone and already did to a couple of my friends.</li>

            <li>Most of the reviews are paid on here.</li>
            <li>I am not so in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>did receive this product for free to try, but I would consider purchasing it on my own.</li>
            <li>My eye area looks so much better since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I was expecting more.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have more lines than before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to use it any more.</li>
            <li>GReat product that really seems to do the trick :)</li>
            <li>I received free product to give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>The eye gel was ok.</li>
            <li>Will keep using this and hope to improve even more</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 3 months now and must say that is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>It surely does what it promises and</li>
            <li>has helped puffy eyes more than anything I have tried</li>
            <li>and I love the results.  </li>
            <li>as well so when I sleep it can work its magic.  </li>

            <li>and I feel as though I have a more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE:</li>
            <li>Jon, My Love Rest in Paradise...</li>
            <li>Fast shipment and great product</li>
            <li>It works - Most of my wrinkles are gone - have been using it for two months.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product until I find a better eye gel.</li>
            <li>I love this gel, it tightened my under eye skin and</li>
            <li>love the way it feels.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this eye gel, it did everything it said it would.  </li>
            <li>Basically if feels and smells like cucumbers which is mostly just water.</li>
            <li>Save your money &amp; go with a better brand</li>
            <li>This gel is cooling and I have noticed a change in the smoothness of my eye lids which at 66 years of age makes the eye shadow look better.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks my mom said my eyes look better</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I think my Neutrogena face cream works a lot better than this stuff.</li>
            <li>but this is better.</li>
            <li>and I think most people would also love this.</li>
            <li>This product is okay.</li>
            <li>I have started to ramp up my anti-aging skincare routine more for prevention than for correction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not interfere with the application of my makeup afterwards which I LOVE.</li>
            <li>Puffiness is reduced immediately, and after just a week I am noticing that the skin around my eyes is smoother and more hydrated even after washing it off.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are among the finest, for sure: plant stem cells, hyaluronic acid and Vitamin E.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was given to me for review, and I am glad it was!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will surely re-order.  </li>
            <li>This product is just ok for me.</li>
            <li>I love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>Some questions people thought because since there were so many 5 stars it was a marketing campaign.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say I love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Ok, but I&#x27;v seen better.</li>
            <li>Where I have applied it, my skin does have a brighter, more healthier look to it.</li>
            <li>This was a desperation purchase, and I&#x27;m glad I got this stuff.</li>
            <li>The blackness went away after I put another cream on top of the eye gel.</li>
            <li>Just okay.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>But then I noticed more detail to the lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>but they are much better.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, if I was able to give this NO stars, I would have done it.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my favorite eye cream.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this eye gel.</li>
            <li>Love the way this works</li>
            <li>This was not my favorite product.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure this product is making all the difference, as I have made dietary changes as well.</li>
            <li>You will see results but be patient as they get better with time.  </li>
            <li>and I cannot even tell you how many compliments I get on my skin even from the esthetician that does microdermabrasion treatments on my face.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE TEXTURE AND SMELL</li>
            <li>I’m not so sure about the puffiness/black circles, but I assume it does well for</li>
            <li>I believe OZ is coming out with a better eye gel soon.  </li>
            <li>my face looks better and smoother.</li>
            <li>I love it and use it all the time.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Great product , very moisturizing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to start taking better care of my skin, specifically preventative care.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products.  </li>
            <li>Try it, you will love it.  </li>
            <li>I feel the product was more hype than help.</li>
            <li>in fact it tends to make my eyes look more puffy</li>
            <li>but I had already been using this product - I requested to review because I LOVE this eye cream.</li>
            <li>and you get much more.</li>
            <li>I have used many products costing hundreds of dollars that never worked.</li>
            <li>also love the emails the company is sending with beauty tips.  </li>
            <li>It feels good, is easily absorbed and is cooling.</li>
            <li>There are much better eye creams/gels on the market.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My under eyes don&#x27;t have as many wrinkles as they used to.</li>
            <li>This was ok, but there&#x27;s not a lot in the container</li>
            <li>I LOVE this eye gel...</li>
            <li>My forehead is completely smooth!</li>
            <li>and then I am set :)</li>
            <li>Didnt love it.</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have been impressed with all of OZ Naturals Products, I have tried a lot of eye creams and nothing actually did what it claimed to do.</li>
            <li>and I love the the feeling of tightening of the skin around the eyes when I apply it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products that did not do what they claimed.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>so i love it.</li>
            <li>hopefully it will work my under eyes:)</li>
            <li>Also, I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>OMG I Love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cream is light and absorbs nicely into skin.</li>
            <li>I love OZ Naturals packaging.</li>
            <li>I do like this product because it made my eyes look better and feel better.</li>
            <li>and I love that is</li>

            <li>Thumbs up on this one for sure.</li>
            <li>circles seem to be more reduced, just a bit, but not significant.&lt;br /&gt;I seem to be noticing more lines underneath by eye with this product, which makes me wonder...</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received this free in order to give my honest feedback.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it works for many but not so for me.</li>
            <li>I started using this product in May and after using everything else over the counter at I am really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream and recommend it to anyone needing hydration under your eyes.</li>
            <li>I have tried many OZ products and the eye gel is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>As I would with most OZ Naturals products.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would see any results - I&#x27;ve tried so many things for around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It does feel refreshing, but had hoped to find something to help with the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It makes my makeup look better because it keeps it from getting into the grooves around the eye.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this.  </li>
            <li>Just give it a try:)-- all that you have to do.</li>
            <li>It is surely 100% guaranteed as claimed by seller.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this product would make me look more &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34; but it didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>and when I&#x27;m putting on makeup the puffy eyes are so much better.</li>
            <li>Some what costly, but cheaper is not always better.</li>
            <li>It made me feel and look better.  </li>
            <li>Love all health and beauty from oz naturals</li>
            <li>While the darkness of the puffy circles under my eyes is slightly alleviated, the puffiness hasn&#x27;t been budged at all.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li>This eye gel has transformed my eyes from sleepy &amp; baggy looking, back to looking great!</li>
            <li>My eyes didn&#x27;t look any better, but the skin around my mouth was noticeably improved.</li>
            <li>This product smells like cucumber to me and I love that smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this under eye serum.  </li>
            <li>The results get better after prolonged use.  </li>
            <li>I have to say, I&#x27;ve tried many....</li>
            <li>many....</li>
            <li>I have tried many and often don&#x27;t finish them because I don&#x27;t get results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also more affordable than any department store brand.</li>
            <li>but my opinion is my own and genuine.</li>
            <li>I also love their retinol moisturizer (it doesn&#x27;t break me out).</li>
            <li>I will buy this product once I&#x27;m finished with my tester. :)</li>
            <li>I looked much more awake and youthful with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with this product that I told some of my co-workers about it</li>
            <li>What more can you say?</li>

            <li>What I like about this gel, is that it has  creamy feel to it, goes on nice and smooth, and has NO odor.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with this product overall.</li>
            <li>There have been warnings about this kind; insinuating that Dr. Oz is advertizing products that sound like he is endorsing that product</li>

            <li>This didn&#x27;t cause stinging and actually felt great!  </li>

            <li>I love all the ingredients that nourish my skin, but I love the hyaluronic acid which is so important for hydrating and plumping the skin.</li>
            <li>This is a really wonderful eye gel and it really works fast</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t say enough great things about the Eye Gel.</li>

            <li>Plus it smells fresh and healthy!</li>

            <li>I have a fine line across the top of my nose, and it relaxes that too.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s moisturizing and soothing...not sure about reducing fine lines though.</li>

            <li>My makeup goes on fine on top of it</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t feel more fresh than this! :)</li>
            <li>This is good but not as great as other OZ products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this as an all over facial mosturiser, and its been very good.</li>
            <li>This eye gel is very cool and soothing going on and works well under makeup.</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural, and is great for wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>I was an esthetician for over 4 years and have used my fair share of high end products (innovative skincare, skin ceuticals, pca, etc.).  </li>

            <li>I was able to find this product through snagshout.com and got it free.</li>

            <li>don&#x27;t know how so many people got the product for free</li>

            <li>Happy with this product so far.</li>
            <li>What I enjoy the most is the cooling feeling I get after putting the cream on my eyes</li>
            <li>Shortly after applying the gel, the darkness tends to fade, resulting in a more attractive and energetic appearance.</li>
            <li>You will notice that most of them received free product in order to review.</li>
            <li>Hyper pigmentation around my eyes is becoming lighter.  </li>
            <li>As if the skin around my eyes was IMMEDIATELY moisturized and on top of that, it felt comfortable all day.</li>
            <li>The gel is on the viscous side (Aloe is the primary ingredient) and is mostly odorless.</li>
            <li>and I love the creamy smooth texture of the gel.  </li>
            <li>Even though the product itself is the critical thing, I love the company logo with a beautiful tree - it is calming.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on really smooth, feels refreshing to the eye once applied.</li>
            <li>(15 ml) bottle is opaque to protect the contents from light and it has a convenient pump top that dispenses just a drop as well as a protective cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is soothing, non-irritating, and most important, reduces under-eye bagginess and the appearance of lines around the eye area.</li>
            <li>So far I am happy with this product..</li>
            <li>Love this soothing light weight eye gel.  </li>

            <li>Most eye products charge a fortune and really don&#x27;t do much, but I look forward to seeing the results after more usage!</li>

            <li>Feels cool, refreshing and makes eye area skin feel firmer</li>
            <li>Would not rate this the best, just average.  </li>
            <li>Puffiness, bags, and dark circles don&#x27;t show us at our best.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m a young 53-year-old and in my 20s worked in a cosmetic department and been blessed to try many products and this is by far the best</li>
            <li>Love the cool feel of the eye gel.  </li>
            <li>This has been awesome for my dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over a year and in my opinion, it&#x27;s the best eye gel on the market for dark undereye circles and puffy eyes.</li>
            <li>The gel is also awesome for brightening dark circles.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several popular brands of eye gel and so far this is the best!</li>
            <li>Why is this the best eye gel cream for puffiness and dark circles?</li>
            <li>It felt cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Its very easy to use and gives you just the right amount of product needed for each use.</li>
            <li>Literally within minutes of applying the eye serum, I felt my skin tightening, and within days, my fine lines and even my dark circles greatly diminished!</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best eye cream I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li>I have tried several eye creams/gel over the years and was very happy with one that was made by genesis pharmaceuticals that was very reasonable in price, but they discontinued it.  </li>
            <li>I discontinued use and in a couple days was fine.</li>
            <li>I do have the fine lines</li>
            <li>light and easy to absorb, keep your eyes shining in the morning</li>
            <li>I can feel a tightening of the fine wrinkles each and every time.  </li>
            <li>This product does everything it says: reduces puffiness, decreases appearance of fine lines, and brightens.  </li>
            <li>Smell is fine but doesn&#x27;t leave skin around your eye feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 55 and have found the OZ Naturals Eye Gel  helps reduce morning time under eye puffiness and fine lines.</li>
            <li>Did not see much fine line or wrinkle improvement.</li>
            <li>However it did not seem to do anything for my fine lines</li>
            <li>It has reduced the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Also used it in my fine lines on forehead.</li>
            <li>It seem to be woking on the fine lines on my forehead and has made it smoother.</li>
            <li>The packaging is impressive like my previous eye creams.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t suffer from fine lines or wrinkles yet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine to use at night.</li>
            <li>I feel like the packaging could be a bit nicer but for this price point it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Puffiness is lessened as are fine lines.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m hoping that with continued use it will help prevent some fine lines from coming out as I age.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I even use it around my lip area and have seen the fine lines there diminish as well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find this product that miraculous, but it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy and smooth around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Half bottle gone now, great value!</li>
            <li>( I use it on my fine lines there too).</li>
            <li>It works fine for me.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on just fine over it which is a plus.</li>
            <li>It does reduce puffiness and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Noticeable reduction of fine lines and morning swelling.  </li>
            <li>Smooths out the fine lines.</li>
            <li>It works fine with make up also.</li>
            <li>I have seen some improvement in fine lines around the eye area.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed some fine lines around my eyes now that I am in my 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Falling in love with this product is super EZ.  </li>

            <li>But its a good price, fast shipping and exactly as described, so will buy from seller again!</li>
            <li>I notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Also, another reviewer&#x27;s comment about liquid cucumbers is accurate.</li>
            <li>But this gel is very lightweight and feels nice and smooth on the skin</li>
            <li>but they even if they assist with the wrinkles I wake up with huge bags around my eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Its been a huge confidence booster when I take my glasses off.</li>
            <li>I generally like most eye creams I get, and am very pleased with OZ Naturals.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my face, but there has been some improvement.</li>
            <li>also started to wear sunscreen every day and have noticed a huge change in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noti a huge change in his skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see huge changes, but</li>
            <li>So after trying Bioelements eye cream with no results I looked for something comparable in price, that wasn&#x27;t from the drugstore and filled with cheap ingredients.</li>
            <li>There were so many 5 star reviews that I thought this was worth a try.</li>
            <li>Really light eye gel, rubs in effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>He is light skintoned.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Bright, Wild Crafted Reishi, Organic Gotu Kola, Vitamin E. Ingredients are 75% natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have used several products from Oz Naturals and have gotten great results from each product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They look even toned and smooth without puffiness.</li>

            <li>, it&#x27;s light and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>I paid for mine, close to 20 dollars, and was never offered a free product.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t keep using it even if it were free.</li>
            <li>It honestly has helped my eyes look so much fresher</li>
            <li>I buy Oz naturals, not only are they really great</li>
            <li>and it does seem to smooth out her eyes.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how bright the under eye area looked.  </li>

            <li>It wears really smoothly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kicking myself because now we&#x27;re spending a lot more on skin care, but for us, it&#x27;s worth every penny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did receive this item free to try for the purpose of my review.  </li>

            <li>I am 29 years old, fair skinned, and have dark/purple discoloration under my eyes.</li>
            <li>But now after using it awhile, I do notice that the fine lines and bags under my eyes have been significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>Really nice product; feels cool and refreshing and doesn&#x27;t bother my very sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>I think most people must have gotten these products for Free in return to leave a positive review!</li>
            <li>But right now I love it.</li>
            <li>I am familiar with Oz Naturals and use the hyraulonic serum daily with great results.  </li>
            <li>I realllly wanted to like it, because the Retniol Moisturizer is so fabulous, but other than it smelling real nice, I haven&#x27;t noticed a thing.</li>
            <li>I bought this product after reading so many positive reviews and after using it for 30 days, I can add my own positive review.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to finally be able to write a positive review because I&#x27;m happy to have finally found something that actually works!</li>
            <li>It is not sticky, very smooth and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>The gel absorbs quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>This does nothing as implied, very disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;Feels good when you first put it on</li>
            <li>It is a very lightweight formula that smooths onto my skin very easily.</li>
            <li>Very fresh and clean smelling which I like, plus it&#x27;s not too over</li>
            <li>You can actually use this anywhere on your face, it has a light, pleasant, cucumber scent, and feels cooling on the skin.</li>
            <li>I actually received a sample of this product and it was amazing!</li>
            <li>In that two weeks that I stopped using it, I noticed a gradual but significant increase in the appearance of the wrinkles around my eyes, as well as increased dryness.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m using the gel again, I have seen a significant decrease in the appearance of the wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Dispenser - While the pump dispenser is easy, it&#x27;s probably too easy and therefore can easily dispense too much resulting</li>
            <li>look so fresh afterwards!</li>
            <li>Ummm, I&#x27;m not sure how this is a #1 best seller.  </li>
            <li>BEST product on the market and the price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Not only is this a great product for your eyes, you can use this on your whole face for a brighter, more radiant complexion.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with all the OZ Natural products and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li>In general, this product is so good that I&#x27;ve recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li>and I have yet to see any significant improvements.</li>
            <li>I have got to say I can see a significant change in the puffiness below my eyes.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>I first read about this eye cream in an article about the top products of the year.</li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sure that&#x27;s what they are hoping you&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li>On most days I wear Benefits &amp;#34;Erase Paste&amp;#34; for my darker circles, but I feel like with consistent use of this</li>
            <li>The icing on the cake is the great price and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>Okay, first of all, someone did not pay me to post a 5 star comment.</li>
            <li>I was actually really excited about trying something that would help</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very safe for my sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t burn my eyes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited about this product.</li>
            <li>It is cool and smooth.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>The gel goes on smooth and feels cool to the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super hydrating to the eye area and reduces the look of my fine lines.</li>
            <li>but I can tell the significant difference</li>
            <li>I was so excited about trying this product</li>
            <li>This is the first time I use this eye cream and since the first day I love it!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this products and the whole OZ naturals line!</li>
            <li>The gel feels light and cool.  </li>
            <li>I love this and it makes my skin so smooth and my pours are not so large anymore</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for daytime use, but I need something a little bit more moisturizing for nighttime.</li>
            <li>Nice product, still using so no significant results yet, but feels good.</li>
            <li>I love the cool gel feel and that it does not take very much to cover the eye area.</li>
            <li>the more natural the cucumber ingredient is, the more sever my face reacts.</li>
            <li>clean, moisturizing and affordable</li>
            <li>Light weight and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Been using different types of eye products by far this one is the best</li>
            <li>Love this gel works for me far better than cream</li>
            <li>I like that the ingredients are clean.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few weeks and this multi-tasker is a welcome and potent addition to my skin care arsenal.</li>
            <li>eye gel goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>My eyes look much brighter and feel more smooth around them.</li>
            <li>Its only been 3 days, but so far I am impressed!</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and feels super moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Amazing ingredients which, after only a couple days, seem to make my skin under my eyes look better.</li>
            <li>Even though I love the soft feeling this gel leaves around my eye area, I won&#x27;t be able to keep using it.  </li>
            <li>SO far I have been more than satisfied.</li>
            <li>I started looking for made in america products that were clean.</li>
            <li>The Oz Eye Gel is goes on smooth and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I used it on my clean eyes every morning and every night.</li>
            <li>eye product is an almost clear, medium-textured gel which disappears into my skin after a very short massage, leaving a perfect basis for make-up.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and dries quickly leaving no residue.</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing, like a very soft floral fragrance.</li>
            <li>I do not generally write reviews, but this eye serum is amazing!</li>
            <li>Its absolutely amazing to me, my eyes are nice and smooth with no puffiness or dark circles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will continue to use Oz Natural products as they are top quality, affordable and they work!</li>
            <li>Hopefully all my eye puffiness and dark circles will be gone for good!</li>
            <li>i think its a great product does what it says it does no strong steanky smell or anything love this product</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to choose the right product.</li>
            <li>and maybe a quick afternoon touch up if necessary to get you looking nice and healthy through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get very dark circles under my eyes and am very fair skinned, so concealer is a must.</li>
            <li>nothing special to report.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about the gel.</li>
            <li>No matter how much sleep I got, drank gallons of water, eat clean healthy food ... couldn&#x27;t get rid of under eye bags.</li>
            <li>Very light - i have used this product for a few weeks and so far best eye cream i have used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 33 and was just starting to see fine lines and seems to have smoothed out,  I will keep using that&#x27;s for sure and love the price</li>
            <li>It feels cooling when applied, absorbs quickly and the pump dispenser keeps the product fresh!</li>
            <li>It gives just t he right amount of moisture and minimizes fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Its super gentle and has a very light and silky texture.  </li>
            <li>Great product, makes my skin feel so smooth and diminishes dark circles.</li>
            <li>My experience with OZ natural eye gel has been amazing.</li>
            <li>Not only does it make my eyes bright, it will not break the bank.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of this product is amazing, a soft cucumber / aloe smell.</li>
            <li>It feels nice and cooling going on, but then, so does pretty much any moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I bought this eye gel recently and this is a few days that I&#x27;m using it, this gel is wonderful and absolutely works for me, I have tried many of eye creams and none of them worked, but this one is really kind of miracle.</li>
            <li>The results so far are amazing.  </li>
            <li>I had bright eyes after about ten minutes.</li>
            <li>Overall good product for this price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool.  </li>
            <li>After receiving the trial with cool on the eyes，Effect is uncertain</li>
            <li>Since then, I just can&#x27;t find another one that is as good let alone for a similar price.  </li>
            <li>its quite light and easily absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>Like most promising eye creams, this doesn&#x27;t do the job at all.</li>
            <li>For what they charge (it is a good deal, I have to admit), but they need to come in BIGGER BOTTLES.</li>
            <li>It feels so good to find something that actually works!</li>
            <li>I cannot say whether or not I would buy this product again for myself since I have not used it enough to give it a fair opinion, but I could see my husband wanting this again.</li>
            <li>I needed to use a lot to get any effect and moisturizing and the effects were not as good as my prior eye gel.</li>
            <li>I love this line so much ...</li>
            <li>I wonder how many are real).  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a cool, tingly feeling, it&#x27;s soothing.  </li>
            <li>I only put it at night and wake up with good results.</li>
            <li>and she said it was really soft and  nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a good several months already and no results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use it because it looks like it has good ingredients,  but only time will tell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a sudden change, just gives your eyes a well rested look, like a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>Love this produce it comes out too fast</li>
            <li>I also really like that it&#x27;s Cruelty Free!</li>
            <li>It has a light fresh scent that reminds me of melons.</li>
            <li>I paid full price for this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Nice, no reaction on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>my house is full of poison.</li>
            <li>There were so many 5 star reviews that I thought this would really work.  </li>
            <li>It feels so cool and refresh as well.</li>
            <li>The eye gel makes eyes feel cool and relaxed.</li>
            <li>I used the product for a full five months, and saw no improvement at all.  </li>
            <li>and the gel feels so cool</li>
            <li>Does only a fair job at moisturizing the skin around the eye.  </li>
            <li>Remember, this is a treatment, and must be used regularly, morning and night, if you want good results.  </li>
            <li>I really really really reallyyyyy LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>but I for one will be placing my order for more very soon.</li>
            <li>i love it,it really  work</li>
            <li>It is cool and soothing when applying.  </li>
            <li>I received  this as a gift for Christmas and love it so much I bought some for my sister and husband.</li>
            <li>It is cool and soothing and not oily.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t believe anything can turn back the hands of time, but this product is a good aid, enhancement, additive to your livelihood....</li>
            <li>Once again, I cannot say enough good about OZ Naturals skin care line.</li>
            <li>Still to soon to see true results.  </li>
            <li>The bags under my eyes have almost gone and I am sure the crows feet have really softened .</li>
            <li>and I only have good things to say.</li>
            <li>So almost 4 months of use, not bad.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 36 years old and thankfully have pretty good skin.</li>
            <li>It is not a bad product though.</li>
            <li>So I checked out the reviews for OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel, and after reading so many positive reviews I ordered OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel.</li>
            <li>After I apply it, I feel a slight cool feeling under my eyes but in my opinion it&#x27;s kind of a nice, relaxing, invigorating feeling.</li>
            <li>Very cooling which is super nice esp with hot weather coming up.</li>
            <li>I used this product religiously day and night for two months because I wanted to be fair and give it an adequate amount of time to see results.</li>
            <li>will continue to use oz products , the eye gel feels so lovely and soft and dries very quickly .&lt;br /&gt;Thanks oz</li>
            <li>I use it with a brightner cream to give that area more glow but other than that I am really satisfied :)</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and does seem to work pretty well</li>
            <li>Takes only a minute to soak in, make up goes on very smooth over the top, skin feels firmer.</li>
            <li>My friend let me try this for a few days and loved the results!</li>
            <li>I wish I was as happy as the other reviewers I read.</li>
            <li>I was extremely excited to receive this product because I love to try new things.</li>
            <li>So happy to have found OZ Naturals and am excited to try the many other products which the company offers!</li>
            <li>Immediate tightening, absorbs quick, &amp;amp; I love the new pump tube!</li>
            <li>Like the coolness when first applied, haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my bags or fine lines</li>
            <li>Do read the ingredient list and note that it&#x27;s seriously great and has a lot of active ingredients from beginning to end and not the junk you seen in a lot of brands.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I finish with the Super youth cream.</li>
            <li>too quickly:  </li>
            <li>I have been using Super Youth Eye Gel for a month now.</li>
            <li>Once you put it on your skin, it quickly absorbs with no greasy feel.</li>
            <li>When you use OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel,  you&#x27;re getting vegan, cruelty-free, paraben-free, sulfate-free, mineral oil-free, lanolin-free, gluten-free, and GMO-free anti-aging goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and thoroughly into your skin.  </li>
            <li>This is why OZ Naturals has created Super Youth Eye Gel.</li>
            <li>But lastly the next best factor about this product is the price.</li>
            <li>Lightweight gel like that absorbs quickly without leaving your skin sticky.</li>
            <li>In doing so, I hv managed to find my own fountain of youth with fabulous products such as OZ Naturals Super Eye Gel.  </li>
            <li>The OZ company quickly arranged for the Amazon codes</li>
            <li>/&gt;First I apply the Super Youth Eye Gel, then in the morning I apply the OZ Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li>one of them being the Super Youth Eye Gel.  </li>
            <li>This product helps tremendously.  </li>
            <li>Having used Super Youth Eye Gel for well over a year, I can attest to its&#x27; effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I received my Super Youth Eye Gel, took a picture of my eye,  forehead area, and the place between my eyes.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of a really powerful, all natural and almost all organic line, but from the day I started using these products</li>
            <li>The formula is super absorbent and leaves no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel, OZ Nat Hyaluronic Acid Serum, and OZ Nat Super Youth Retinol Moisturizer (daytime or night time).  </li>
            <li>I wanted to give this gel an adequate amount of time to see if it worked and thought I could since they give a 100% guarantee.  </li>
            <li>I checked after about 10 minutes and it did absorb, my eyes felt super plumped, moisturized and firmed.</li>
            <li>Suppose to see visible results quickly.  </li>
            <li>Then as I was searching on Amazon, and reading reviews, I read in a review for another product about OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel.</li>
            <li>I like the look, smell and feel of it even better than the Christian Dior Capture products I have been using for more than 20 years, and</li>
            <li>So far so good- really like the product</li>
            <li>The gel is a silky, non fragrant formula that glides on the skin and soaks in quickly...</li>
            <li>This is super concentrated and</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>This eye cream absorbs into the skin quickly allowing makeup to be applied evenly and without streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was amazed at the quick results I received.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky so you can apply makeup over it.</li>
            <li>Plus if you don&#x27;t use the product quickly, it gets &amp;#34;gummy&amp;#34; and unusable unless you keep pumping to find the gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quickly so it can be used under makeup.</li>
            <li>wash face with mild cleanser (or even just water), then apply the eye gel.</li>
            <li>It lifts and moisturizes quickly</li>
            <li>What I have noticed so far is that my eye area remains smooth most of the day</li>
            <li>And I have used many expensive department store brands and drug store brands alike looking for the one line that works best for me.    </li>
            <li>It has a cooling feel, is quickly penetrating</li>
            <li>I also use it during the day when I want a quick pick me up for my face.</li>
            <li>Arived quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild and moisture though.</li>
            <li>I was sent the Super Youth Eye Gel by Oz Naturals to review.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>or I’ve had mildly allergic reactions to them once applied.  </li>
            <li>The eye-cream did not cause any reaction, which is really important to me when picking any kind of cream, especially products I use on my face.</li>
            <li>not only did that but helped the skin all over my face, and for such a great price!</li>
            <li>my skin is super hydrated!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So lucky I came across it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels super moist on my eyes after using it.</li>
            <li>infact it is so mild that you can apply all over your face to keep it moisturized.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to get this product during promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li>so it will not absorb as quickly as lotion or serum do.</li>
            <li>I find myself gravitate towards those types of products more and more recently.</li>
            <li>It is non greasy and absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li>I chose to buy this item because it is highly rated and many people seem to have benefited from OZ Naturals&#x27; eye gel.</li>
            <li>These products do work and I highly recommend trying this line of products, they work better than some</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with every product I have tried from OZ Naturals and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many high end products over the years.</li>
            <li>I never make recommendations but this line specially the eye gel is worth five stars</li>
            <li>.. love that it is natural!!</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was that it came in a HUGE box.</li>
            <li>I got the OZ Natural for free,  I&#x27;m Soo happy it works wonders,  I will definitely continue to use this product,  </li>
            <li>I am very interested in purchasing one.</li>
            <li>Frankly, just allowing my makeup to go on more smoothly and last longer is a huge deal for me.</li>
            <li>First of all let me state that I DID NOT receive a free sample of this product...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I do love this product, and wanted to share.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s very gentle on my skin!</li>
            <li>I was convinced the very first time I tried this eye gel:  </li>
            <li>First off, I got this item Free from Snagshout to write a review for this product.</li>
            <li>great eye moisturizer..have not seen dark circles fade</li>
            <li>My eye puffiness and dark circles are greatly improved.</li>
            <li>First time using this product and so far I love it!</li>
            <li>You can feel it firming around your eyes which is great but no difference with the dark circles</li>
            <li>This eye gel is pretty much one that every woman on the planet should have!!!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product and any other OZ Naturals product, they&#x27;re effective and perfect for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I also would just like people to know that this is a 100% true review, and I have received this product for free to make sure I left a 100% true review.</li>
            <li>I found that using this first and then a small amount of the OZ Ultra Ageless Eye Creme together are a perfect combination for more mature skin.  </li>
            <li>every day.&lt;br /&gt;All natural and smells good and leaves our skin fresh, healthy and younger looking.</li>
            <li>They are a fairly new line I believe, so I hope they don&#x27;t start raising their prices once they become more known and their popularity skyrockets.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite eye</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much per application and it goes on with a smooth, cool feeling.</li>
            <li>It provides great moisture and makes my eyes look less wrinkled.</li>
            <li>(The texture goes a long way) and find it works best when you use it 2x daily for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>its very cooling and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Only good things are it is not expensive and it does not irritate skin.</li>
            <li>The OZ Naturals eye gel is exactly that, a wonderful, delicate product that works</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and seems reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>My concealer completely covered my dark circles and my makeup went on flawlessly.</li>
            <li>So far, pretty nice.</li>
            <li>This product absorbs easy and fast into my skin.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>Which certainly helps with the fine lines and wrinkles on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Everything requires certain amount of time to be healed and that&#x27;s completely fine.</li>
            <li>Very effective in reducing puffiness and lighten dark circles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s right in the middle of moisturizing and tightening, does a great job of taking care of puffiness, doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34; into my eyes, is much kinder on eyeliner, lasts a good 10 hours (for me), doesn&#x27;t make my lids (upper or lower) crinkle, but leaves them very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>and while I don&#x27;t see huge significant changes, it is a decent cream.</li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely get more bottles when the first one is finished :-)</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle and love it!</li>
            <li>In fact, it has only caused my eyes to look more puffy and wrinkled since the gel just made my eyes feel like all of the moisture was being sucked out of them!</li>
            <li>Thanks, Oz!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>So what better to treat my problem WITH something natural?!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!!</li>
            <li>So happy with eye product, my new go-to essential</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think to do them because the first product I had, the Retniol Moisturizer was so fabulous I just posted my five star review right away.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting such quick results so Iam thrilled.</li>
            <li>product really helps with puffiness and fine lines under my eyes</li>
            <li>Absolutely softened the appearance of fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have the beginnings of fine lines around my eyes and this product really does the trick with helping to minimize them.</li>
            <li>Most of the creams I have used do not have what I call &#x27;a cucumber action or feeling&#x27; to them, so this certainly is one of the most positive elements of the cream.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>great product, helps with wrinkles, dark circles and puffiness!</li>
            <li>I love how it has a nice faint cucumber scent to it, it is cooling and feels so refreshing when you put it on!</li>
            <li>A lovely gel that is definitely reducing the appearance of my fine lines and puffiness.  </li>
            <li>I have also been applying this on the fine lines above my top lip and noticed that there is improvement there too.</li>
            <li>Most definitely no changes in fine lines or anything else.</li>
            <li>Experience the most effective eye treatment designed to eliminate dark circles, puffiness and wrinkles!</li>
            <li>Nothing significant, but I&#x27;m seeing that my skin around the eyes is very soft and looks smooth.  </li>
            <li>It works great, doesn&#x27;t have a ugly smell, feels great.</li>
            <li>I primarily purchased this product to help with puffiness, and it really does appear to work.</li>
            <li>Great eye product if creams are too heavy for your skin.</li>
            <li>smells like real plants, goes on smooth, the consistency is watery.</li>
            <li>great product for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy and works great under concealer.</li>
            <li>I know this because I challenged Oz Naturals on this very thing, and they sent me the detailed information from the lab</li>
            <li>It has a gel consistency and seemed to light a texture to do much.  </li>
            <li>The Most Effective Anti Aging Eye Cream Available!]]I am a firm believer in OZNaturals</li>
            <li>But it does appear that my laugh lines are reduced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s feels refreshing when it&#x27;s on your skin, nearly like fresh cucumber.</li>
            <li>you only need one pump for both eyes as the dispenser gives you a nice size when you pump.</li>
            <li>product has a light scent of cucumber and is a clear, light gel.</li>
            <li>and I would say it&#x27;s probably worth the cost and worth a try.</li>
            <li>Moisture eyes and feels fresh</li>
            <li>I also love how it is made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I usually love OZ natural products, but this didnt work or change anything around my eyes at all.</li>
            <li>I am already seeing results with decreasing visibility of crow&#x27;s feet, smile lines, and brow lines.  </li>
            <li>this is worth the money because it delivers what it claims to do for your skin.</li>
            <li>so I would purchase these products complimentary.</li>
            <li>So far it works OK</li>
            <li>I am going to continue using KIEHLS products because they are far, far superior to this garbage.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I see a noticeable difference on my left eye.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I am pleased and will continue with these Oz Natural products.  </li>
            <li>I see clearly why it has such great reviews!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got a discount on my honest feed back of this, the above reflects my own thoughts, opinion, and use from my purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>worth buying.</li>
            <li>Love the all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It can also be used all over the face to diminish smile lines around the mouth and wrinkles on the forehead.</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>:Just learned today that the sodium benzoate added as a preservative to many foods (including soft drinks and club soda) is carcinogenic.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, immediate-firming feel and depending on one&#x27;s skin, can be enough to moisturize as well.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an effective eye gel.</li>
            <li>love that this is an all natural formula</li>
            <li>and there are no results to make it worth it.</li>
            <li>rarely write reviews</li>
            <li>They gave OZ Natural&#x27;s eye gel a top grade, and as I said, they weren&#x27;t kidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The gel is very refreshing and goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>It went on creamy, but absorbed well.</li>
            <li>I did not expect such a nice quality eye gel.  </li>
            <li>I used my Oz Natural products last night and they felt great.</li>
            <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li>That alone is worth using this eye gel.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t contain chemicals considered hazardous or unhealthful on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep database</li>
            <li>and I know its been absorbed.    </li>
            <li>Well worth the money to</li>
            <li>This gel is easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>Love its vegan formula, 100% natural &amp; 75% organic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fresh on your face and is blended well.</li>
            <li>Love it so far.</li>
            <li>It is almost instantly absorbed when applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish it had a bit more moisture for a mature aging eye.  </li>
            <li>They are all wins for me thus far. :)</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s my favorite eye cream out of the 5 I have ordered already this year.</li>
            <li>I look fresh.</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about this eye gel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a complimentary product to facilitate this review.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s made to be used all over the eye area including the lids because I have sensitive eyes and do not appreciate the burn.</li>
            <li>I put it around my eyes and decided to also put it on a crease line I developed between my eyebrows from squinting over many years.</li>
            <li>OZ Naturals has not done this to me and in fact makes my skin look and feel so soft and healthy,</li>
            <li>If applied at night also you awake with a fresh look and no puffiness.  </li>
            <li>Also love it is a natural skin product.  </li>
            <li>not such an effective product</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural</li>
            <li>It is a nice addition to my daily skin care regime.</li>
            <li>Love all oz natural products</li>
            <li>I also use this on my smile lines and have noticed a difference on those as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to discover a product like this that actually works.</li>
            <li>That, in itself, is rare in my experience.  </li>
            <li>I am now in my early 20&#x27;s, I almost always get 9 hours of sleep, drink a lot of water, and eat somewhat healthy</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try all of the products that OZ Naturals offers :)</li>
            <li>My eyes look brighter and more alive when I use this.</li>
            <li>and that makes the investment well worth it.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh aloe smell but that&#x27;s it</li>
            <li>This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product from a customer’s standpoint.</li>
            <li>For eye area I use another product with peptides that has more of a cream consistency; however, I feel like the other product in combination with this gel gives me much better results.&lt;br /&gt;Between</li>
            <li>I have fewer fine lines, which was my main concern.</li>
            <li>Feel free to give this a try if you’ve used other products with those ingredients and have found them to be effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try the other best selling eye cream to how it works before coming back to this one.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited too that I also ordered several more items from the skin care line.</li>
            <li>It makes you know the products you are putting on your face are safe and have followed every USA and FDA guideline so there are no hidden ingredients.</li>
            <li>First I apply the Super Youth Eye Gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually pretty lucky in the genetics department, but when it rains, it pours.</li>
            <li>The gel goes on easily and smoothly and soaks right in, and seems as good as any other general eye cream/moisturizer, but it just didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Ok this is probably my favorite purchase (and I&#x27;ve bought pretty much the entire line of OZ Naturals)</li>
            <li>I came across this product looking for some help with the dark circles and to get started on a good, anti-aging/wrinkle preventing regime that would not cause more acne or aggravate my sensitive</li>
            <li>It feels good under ur eyes, and since it&#x27;s stem cells you can also put it on other places you want to speed up the healing on your face.</li>
            <li>I ran out and after a couple of weeks, I could tell that the area around my eyes was looking a little drab, so I quickly bought another bottle and the area around my eyes are looking much better :).</li>
            <li>As far as eye creams go, it&#x27;s the best specific product I have ever tried and absolutely gentle and non-irritating in this very sensitive area.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as eye creams go, it&#x27;s the best specific product I have ever tried and absolutely gentle and non-irritating in this very sensitive area.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received my cream and noticed a change right away.  </li>
            <li>(well it&#x27;s my right eye</li>
            <li>My skin accepted it right away.  </li>
            <li>(A girl can hope, right?).</li>
            <li>I felt it working to reduce wrinkles right away.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>(A girl can hope, right?).</li>
            <li>so I just dabbed it on right away</li>
            <li>RIGHT</li>
            <li>Right now I am looking to see if they make a face cream.</li>
            <li>( can&#x27;t find the right word here) on the eye cream.</li>
            <li>Now, I use it with another cream (any probably) because it is a gel and soaks right in</li>
            <li>Switched back to a tried and true line (I&#x27;ve learned my lesson) and my skin is already looking better after 1 night, and on the road to recovery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Allure, and in my opinion, they&#x27;re pretty honest with their claims.</li>
            <li>I also use this gel on the very top of my cleavage, another area which is sensitive to many of the other creams on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My makeup applies flawlessly over top of this eye cream, which is something that I&#x27;ve had an issue with in the past with other eye creams.</li>
            <li>Her skin is very sensitive, so I was a little worried that she would not like this product, but I am happy to report that she did not experience any irritation and the bags under her eyes are reduced significantly.</li>
            <li>I saw nothing special and found it very sticky.</li>
            <li>This worked great and really reduced the swelling and black circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have given it 4 stars as maybe it needs a little more time to work on my fine lines!</li>
            <li>Also my eyelids are firmer and less puffy and I like the fact that I can apply this gel to the top of my eye, most products are not recommended for the eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The gel is light and clear and absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li>recently received three OZ Naturals products for trial, and I&#x27;m pretty happy with all three, based on the criteria above: this Vitamin C serum, the Super Youth Eye Gel, and the Hyaluronic</li>
            <li>They do look slightly better since the skin is more taut but the color is really nearly the same.  </li>
            <li>great product, I have seen small changes in the suppleness around my eyes and have bee  using for 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li>What I can say is that the ingredients in this product are top notch with proven benefits, and they are potent enough that I have complete faith the product will continue to improve my skin over time.  </li>
            <li>However, Oz Natural is the best and the physical results are obvious.</li>
            <li>but I would probably try a different kind next time just to see if there&#x27;s something better.</li>
            <li>the gel always seems to feel cool and very soothing.</li>
            <li>I have tried some of the most expensive eye creams on the market for undereye circles and lines, and this is by far THE BEST.</li>
            <li>Immediately my eyes are puffier and wrinkles more apparent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product for over a month, I noticed that my dark eyes started to brighten up, and it smells really good when I apply it under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>The dark circles were still there, but I wanted to give it a good test, so I kept using it.</li>
            <li>The container makes it easy to dispense the right amount, but if more comes out I just use it on my lips or other area that may need attention.</li>
            <li>I love the texture as it goes on very smoothly without feeling heavy.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and you can tell a difference with fine lines after only a week!</li>
            <li>Really GREAT product, really eliminates the dark circles and puffiness!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands of eye gels that claim to reduce dark circles and puffiness and I have found that for me I get the best overall results with OZNaturals products.</li>
            <li>when you first out it on you feel it working right away.</li>
            <li>Worth the price, helps me feel younger and more</li>
            <li>and I am so happy she is starting to use these products at a much younger age than I!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a non scented gel, it does not irritate my sensitive eyes, easy application.  </li>
            <li>So use lightly so that you don&#x27;t waste this amazing eye</li>
            <li>Have been trying out a few Eye gel recently &amp; find this to be excellent.  </li>
            <li>I finally found a product that works and is good for my skin, even the uber sensitive under eye area.</li>
            <li>I just got this, it came super fast.</li>
            <li>In this case, I&#x27;m happy to say I was wrong... and LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It sinks into the skin with no residue and is a lovely light gel.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t know how well it works until I&#x27;ve been able to use it a few more times.</li>
            <li>It feels really cooling on my eyes and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and concealer holds to it very well.</li>
            <li>not as good as previous reviews said.</li>
            <li>but it feels nice around my eyes esp during allergy season and dry winters.</li>
            <li>The eye area is a very sensitive and important part of our face, and we tend to reject it.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and plan to purchase other items from their line.</li>
            <li>I have spent so much more on!  </li>
            <li>The seller describes it as &amp;#34; The Best Eye Gel&amp;#34; Spend a little more go to the drugstore and you will be much happier than if you waste your money on this product and the shipping costs.</li>
            <li>(Small and handy, easy to carry around even when travelling.)</li>
            <li>I can definitely see the fine lines around my eyes fading away!</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for 2 1/2 weeks, but can see some improvement in fine lines around my eyes and some puffiness!</li>
            <li>Definitely helped with fine lines!</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping....</li>
            <li>The gel glides on very smoothly, however, I actually think it makes my eyes puffer.</li>
            <li>I like this eye gel very much.</li>
            <li>VERY FAST TRIED IT</li>
            <li>, I would not recommend these products although I am very much hoping they work for some people.</li>
            <li>Like this product very much.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I noticed that it  brightened the areas around my eyes &amp; very much reduces the puffiness.</li>
            <li>I am very much into skin care.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product works great - helped with the dark rings under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>tried for the last 2 days, most lotions make my skin red and sore so far no irritation feels good</li>
            <li>The texture is very creamy and rich, the scent is very</li>
            <li>In the past month or so have notice more fine lines and expression lines forming!</li>
            <li>After spending way too much money, time and hope on products I found this eye gel by Oz Naturals and it Really works!!</li>
            <li>This is a good product for the night time as it might leave a little sticky film feeling, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend to use it before make up.</li>
            <li>This is seriously the most amazing eye cream I have ever used, It makes a visible difference</li>
            <li>but if you only need a moisturizing eye cream it&#x27;s a nice product for a decent price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very adamant about using only all natural/holistic and cruelty free skincare and makeup, and have tried many many different brands.</li>
            <li>This is a very good cream for your eyes and it is non irritating.</li>
            <li>I am surprised so many people rated it so high.</li>
            <li>Smooth, only takes a little and no sting or irritation experienced.</li>
            <li>Her appearance as a professional is of paramount importance; thus, she has an incentive to accurately review this product.</li>
            <li>oz bottle, which was dismaying to me at first.  </li>
            <li>Also love that I can use over the entire eye.</li>
            <li>This gel relieved puffiness, first.</li>
            <li>I look forward to what it will accomplish by the end of the first month.</li>
            <li>I believe I can get better results for same or lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li>this will really work for you!</li>
            <li>Not expensive, anyway.</li>
            <li>it actually lifts the skin under the eye area to give a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>I like that it is free of parabens and has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>My goal is to eliminate toxins so that I am as healthy as possible.</li>
            <li>The first 10 ingredients are all actives and are either kosher or organic or  a cosmeceutical.&lt;br /&gt;Top</li>
            <li>I first wash my face, apply Vit. C serum, moisturizer and then the eye gel.  </li>
            <li>and I used it on my whole face sometimes!</li>
            <li>At age 45, this is the first product that I can say</li>
            <li>It leaves the bags of the eyes smooth and soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I was contacted by this company asking if I would be willing to try three of their products and give a review.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s always a first time for everything as this is my first time writing a review</li>
            <li>Maybe I would have better results if I used it daily?</li>
            <li>I could feel and see a difference from the first use.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li>It actually makes my bags under my eyes MORE noticeable.</li>
            <li>You can smell a hint of cucumber in it and it has some light deflecting action that minimizes the look of the bags.</li>
            <li>More power to the people for whom this actually works.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m light skinned, so the dark circles are really prominent on my face.</li>
            <li>She said that this gel is different to creams, and might work better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Slap this stuff on when I first wake up and then run from the mirror.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to use anything on my skin especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li>and, sure enough . . .</li>
            <li>It has now been exactly three months.</li>
            <li>and it looks exactly like the picture shown.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice a big difference,it is ok</li>
            <li>and I love this product as it&#x27;s my 2nd time to order it</li>
            <li>This was the first time I ever bought Eye Gel</li>
            <li>I received this sample and gave it a try for the first time</li>
            <li>This is all within the first week of use.....</li>
            <li>First time trying it</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>At first use I could feel the skin tightening around my eyes.</li>
            <li>give an additional revue after my first month.</li>
            <li>This eye cream does absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>This is the first eye gel that has reduced the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands over the years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it daily for more than 2 months now.</li>
            <li>You can even use it on your whole face!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it now for 2 years with my skin care regimen and it diminishes the wrinkles around my eyes and they appear younger looking and healthy.</li>
            <li>After 30 days of daily use, the darkness and bags are just as prominent as they were when I started.</li>
            <li>Works very well!  </li>
            <li>That said, it hasn&#x27;t magically filled in the natural hollows</li>
            <li>After two weeks of using this magic potion in a bottle, I walked by the mirror and had to do a double take.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>It seems to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>It really does not work!</li>
            <li>Love this eye gel I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>Seems to work as well as the much higher priced eye cream I had been using.  </li>
            <li>Then it says you can use on your forehead and other areas of the face that may be wrinkled or concerning, and it works outstandingly!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any big changes, so I will give it an OK.....</li>
            <li>This really works and I can see!</li>
            <li>I have been extremely pleased with my recent discovery of OZ Naturals products.  </li>
            <li>This puts in the moisture that really gives a fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>The only way to know for sure is to try it.</li>
            <li>I tried so many different products.</li>
            <li>have order twice I haven&#x27;t specific progress but feel that it is safe for my eyes.</li>
            <li>You will be amazed by the noticeable results and it only gets better with ongoing use.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says on the tin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am going to let my sister so the testing on this product, since her wrinkles are pretty</li>
            <li>This product used consistently continues to give results.</li>
            <li>but this really deserves one !</li>
            <li>The first time I put this on I knew I would be coming back for more.  </li>
            <li>As a licensed EstheticIan this us my first choice for my skin care</li>
            <li>I saw results the first day.  </li>
            <li>It is economical and a product that really works.  </li>
            <li>I did have to get used to the egg gel at first.  </li>
            <li>The area around my eyes appears brighter and more open.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that works.</li>
            <li>I love it because I can actually feel the tightness around the eyes.</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price and the results are real!</li>
            <li>After the first of the year, I started noticing that my eyes were puffy when I got up in the morning.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t wake up with puffy eyes, and the skin around my eyes has smooth out considerably</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;ve tried this I felt that the overall appearance of my skin just seemed healthier and more dewy.</li>
            <li>and I actually felt like my makeup stayed on better all day.</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue using this product :-)</li>
            <li>First time use</li>
            <li>I am on the second bottle of the oz naturals and I love that also.  </li>
            <li>Finished the whole bottle but see no difference at all!</li>
            <li>I only wish there were more in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Love It and have ordered it a second time.</li>
            <li>My first purchase was the combo of Vit C and HA serums.</li>
            <li>I was truly a skeptic after trying many different eye and face creams, even concealers.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll be using more of this product in the future.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It contains mostly botanical and organic ingredients that moisturize, soften, and protect the outer layer of the skin, such as aloe, glycerin and jojoba oil, plus ingredients like hyaluronic acid and vitamin E that penetrate it to support skin health and structure on a cellular level.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and continue to use - big difference!</li>
            <li>I feel safe using it on my upper lids, but the puffiness is not gone from under my eyes yet after 4 weeks</li>
            <li>because it doesn&#x27;t sit on top of the skin it actually soaks in.</li>
            <li>Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li>After one week, I was even able to see a change in here overall appearance.</li>
            <li>This is the only eye gel I&#x27;ve bought more than once.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;m really glad that Oz Naturals made the effort to demonstrate that the product actually is vegan</li>
            <li>Absolutely!</li>
            <li>I get red and rashy around the sides of my mouth and also on my cheeks from many brands.</li>
            <li>I most definitely see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more</li>
            <li>I found if I used my moisturizer FIRST then apply oz eye gel</li>
            <li>Also, smells very earthy and natural...almost like cucumbers!</li>
            <li>First, I wasn&#x27;t paid to write this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better results with simple Walmart brand/Equate brand items.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference, but all Dr. Oz products are great.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye gel!</li>
            <li>This works exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>, this eye gel is 97.4% natural and all of their products are cruelty free.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I love my big brown eyes</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but this product had no sting, light texture, and I saw a difference in two weeks.</li>
            <li>Thanks OZ Naturals!</li>
            <li>I think that young looking skin, and eyes are important.  </li>
            <li>I love actually being about the recommend a brand!</li>
            <li>I was a bit dubious at first.  </li>
            <li>This was the first item that gave me any difficulties.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>put it on in the evening and on the first day, it made my eyes look funny.</li>
            <li>I really do recommend this!</li>
            <li>It is not greasy or runny so its not uncomfortable to apply and sleep overnight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbed into my skin very well.</li>
            <li>I have read we shouldn&#x27;t put heavy oils around the eyes so an eye gel is a good solution.</li>
            <li>It does feel good on-- not too heavy and seems to make the skin under my eyes brighter.</li>
            <li>But I can say that its moisturizing capability is very good, and does seem to make wrinkles around the eyes slightly less deep.</li>
            <li>It feels light and a little slippery going on and absorbs quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>I have less puffiness and a more even smooth eye area.</li>
            <li>I like OZ Naturals products because they are mostly organic, and they don&#x27;t have harsh chemicals, or strong fragrances that irritate my allergies.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>On a huge positive note, it doesn&#x27;t burn my highly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, especially when reading a good amount of reviews saying its great, but it really is.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t understand what the other reviewers are talking about..</li>
            <li>This brand is both effective and cost-friendly when compared to other drug store brands.</li>
            <li>The maker suggests that full results can be seen after 60 days of regular use, so I am hopeful for even more, but so far (after three weeks)</li>
            <li>I quickly remedied and was able to reapply foundation without the raccoon-eye look that some other gels produce.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I quickly remedied and was able to reapply foundation without the raccoon-eye look that some other gels produce.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s more natural and less chemical</li>
            <li>I barely had noticeable crow lines and this was creating fine lines under my eyes</li>
            <li>I tried this eye cream on with makeup and for once my fine lines weren&#x27;t apparent.</li>
            <li>Provides a perfect base for makeup application while delivering outstanding moisturizing capabilities.</li>
            <li>I do love that the product won&#x27;t be sticky or heavy on your eyes, and does leave a smooth touch after applying.</li>
            <li>The package is nice and secure with thick bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>Still I would recomend this to anyone who wants to look like they have gotten more sleep than they actually have.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and eyes, but this is soothing, non-irritating, and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>This works great around the eyes and usually there is more to spread around to other areas needing the attention of a moisturizing serum.</li>
            <li>I ended up using it on my whole face since it suggests the it is very gentle that  it can even be used all over your face....</li>
            <li>Almost $20 for a half oz of product that is mostly aloe!..</li>
            <li>And it is light enough to use right before eye liner.</li>
            <li>When a complete stranger gave me a complement yesterday, I knew I&#x27;d found the right product!  </li>
            <li>I have to admit I bought this product after reading all of your positive reviews</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed any positive results at this time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, and I don&#x27;t see any positive effects at all.  </li>
            <li>and I m still seeing positive results.  </li>
            <li>There was already a perceptible positive difference.</li>
            <li>Positive notes:</li>
            <li>/&gt;One positive note I can say is ot smells.good</li>
            <li>However, I do not have to give a positive review</li>
            <li>like to keep my diet and skin treatments fairly natural if possible, and this company specialises in that.&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied with product for review, and have been using it daily for four weeks and would be happy to continue with it.</li>
            <li>It made it look better but not completely.  </li>
            <li>It is a very clumpy gel when you first pump it out</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for letting me try your eye gel!</li>
            <li>I was intrigued by the clearly scientific approach, the full disclosure of ingredients and the cruelty-free statement.  </li>
            <li>I give 4 stars because they are not completely gone, but are noticeably better.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know if this has made a difference with the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I used Obagi eye cream in the past and I never got the good results I have gotten with this eye gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for two days now and can honestly see a difference already in my dark circles.  </li>
            <li>I am prone to dark circles and puffiness under my eyes and this product is really effective.</li>
            <li>This eye gel treatment is not to be underestimated as it&#x27;s highly effective at reducing dark circles, puffiness and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>and it reduce the puffiness and faded the dark circles nicely.  </li>
            <li>It is truly effective in delivering results for dark circles and that sunken look under my eyes.</li>
            <li>This might be good for hyper pigmentation (can&#x27;t tell yet), but I can tell the skin around my eyes feels more dry than usual (which is what causes wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, smells pleasant and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very reasonably priced for such a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I have used many eye creams ( high end and low end brands) and nothing compares to this eye gel.refreshed after .</li>
            <li>Super excited about the long term results.</li>
            <li>Just starting using this eye gel; but love it so far!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60, have dry skin, and absolutely love the results I&#x27;m seeing.</li>
            <li>Only been using for a short time, but have found eye gel very refreshing</li>
            <li>However, because of the favorable reviews, the natural ingredients, and the price, I decided to give the Super Youth Eye Gel a try.  </li>
            <li>This gel made my eyes more dry.</li>
            <li>Not sure what the results will be yet but so far its great</li>
            <li>though I had dry areas on top of my eyelid</li>
            <li>I think using this product makes a difference and is easy to add to my daily skincare regimen.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or allergies, so my eyes adjusted to this gel quickly.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin  </li>
            <li>but since a dab will do it seems like it will last awhile) which I prefer as it allows me to easily carry it around throughout the day should the need arise.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply above and below the eye.</li>
            <li>: I prefer to dilute the gel&#x27;s action by mildly wetting the skin area before applying the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and although with 78-year-old eyelids, I still have my share of wrinkles and bags, using the Super Youth Eye Gel, they seem minimized and my lids feel soft.</li>
            <li>OZ Naturals offers a Super Youth Eye Gel.  </li>
            <li>While the difference is not dramatic I do see an improvement in the bags.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to notice a difference in my appearance, but it does not irritate or burn my eyes, so that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>Smells good, goes on light and helps reduce puffiness and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>but at a certain level yes, there is.</li>
            <li>I almost did not purchase this one because I was certain that it would not work, and I would be throwing money away yet again.</li>
            <li>I get puffiness from my allergies and this certainly does eliminate that for me.  </li>
            <li>I can certainly see it...</li>
            <li>This product absorbs easily and quickly, and it doesn&#x27;t make my eye makeup smudge as other eye products do.</li>
            <li>So here I am, I&#x27;m a REAL person and in no way obligated to write a positive review and will not gain a penny or additional products for my opinions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Live the results!!</li>
            <li>i have a weak eye, it has done amazingly great for the overhang, just ordered for my mother Day before yesterday</li>
            <li>I have tried several products in the past but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Also the gel absorbs very quickly which I really like as my regime sometimes consists of applying several products, and I always want to speed up the in between &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I much prefer Smart Fix Smart Eye for myself.</li>
            <li>I am in my mid 30s and with fine lines start to develop around the under eyes.</li>
            <li>I am 41 and starting to see fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Regular use will help improve the appearance of fine wrinkles caused by age and damage from sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have also noticed the fine lines are smother and I am so tempted to put this in my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;Happy customer.</li>
            <li>The fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes are starting to diminish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for about a week, and my fine lines(not</li>
            <li>I have what is politely referred to as &amp;#34;mature skin&amp;#34; - I just call it &#x27;older!&#x27;</li>
            <li>I have even used very high end products and nothing work.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that his dark circles are clearing up!</li>
            <li>Smells nice, feels calming/cool when applied, but truly has little effect otherwise.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited to finally find something that really works ; )</li>
            <li>It started showing results with the first use, not like some other brands where they tell you it takes a couple of months or more before you see any real change.</li>
            <li>so it fills in the little crepey lines under my eyes, crow&#x27;s feet, and gives a nice, supple appearance to the eye area.</li>
            <li>A really gentle serum that definitely helps with reducing puffiness and filling out fine lines.  </li>
            <li>, this is not the first time a highly rated item was all BS.  </li>
            <li>Why  does all the manufactures of face serum, eye creams make them so expensive  for people like me to buy them, but this is a very good eye cream and you can believe I have tried just about everything that is out in the market place.  </li>
            <li>Within just a few days, I saw fine lines diminish and my eye areas was smooth and indeed, VERY youthful looking.</li>
            <li>I know its hard to find a good eye cream.</li>
            <li>do better with plain old NOW coconut oil for adding moisture to the eye area and reducing fine lines.</li>
            <li>Is only 2 weeks since I tried this gel its amazing after only one week everybody noted difference and gave me a complement ..</li>
            <li>It is great for early mornings after a late night at work.</li>
            <li>Thanks goodness</li>
            <li>I did not use it very often, because of this stinging sensation and some redness after application of gel.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the gel consistency.</li>
            <li>No hydration whatsoever and is very gooey</li>
            <li>and I really had to make an effort to change that,</li>
            <li>It makes my eye lids feel very refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I feel it as soon as I apply and it really works well.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using this - it&#x27;s very soothing -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very diligent about using hydrating eye creams.  </li>
            <li>I really like this eye gel.</li>
            <li>Very mall quantity and haven&#x27;t seen any difference,</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready ro</li>
            <li>I really do like this eye gel.</li>
            <li>Really works unlike anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have been using for three days and see very noticeable results.  </li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for my eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced it really works as people say it does, have to see???</li>
            <li>- It really didn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this eye gel from Oz when I called recently to inquire about their products.</li>
            <li>and she really likes that.  </li>
            <li>i feel it much lighter and smoother.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all-natural product is designed to give you real results.</li>
            <li>Probably have sampled every brand at Whole Foods alone.</li>
            <li>It dries fast</li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t say if it works miracles however I really do like the gel.  </li>
            <li>so I was always looking for products that are paraben and sulfate free and as natural/organic as possible while still getting the results</li>
            <li>and it really has diminished them.  </li>
            <li>It smells like cucumber and has a very silky texture.  </li>
            <li>really does what it claims.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>I adhere to a very well structured beauty routine.  </li>
            <li>Does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>As much as they say they received the product for an &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; review...</li>
            <li>and me too.&lt;br /&gt;These costs are not irritating to eyes moist</li>
            <li>It was as if it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Took almost 2 weeks to notice much of a difference, but my girlfriend noticed.</li>
            <li>approve of OZ Naturals&#x27; vegan philosophy and all in all this product has really worked for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t often write reviews but Oz Naturals wants to know how the products work and if I am satisfy with</li>
            <li>Thanks for recommending it.</li>
            <li>I feel my face really puts these products to the test and know at my age one cannot expect miracles.</li>
            <li>I like this product lots, it does seem to help and it is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know yet, ask me in about a month</li>
            <li>It really does work and does dramatically reduce the puffiness from lack of sleep or aging.</li>
            <li>this product really works on your eyes</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I have used 2 bottles of this and it has really helped reduce the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really see those movies anymore.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li>dries and soaks in to the skin fast and does not feel sticky.</li>
            <li>I really was hoping that this product would be what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>my puffy eyes really getting much better...tku</li>
            <li>Thanks oznaturals</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen it address much darkness, but I&#x27;ll post an update if I do.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s really working</li>
            <li>I expected more since I do like their products.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s a gel and not a cream it wears very well under makeup and</li>
            <li>This stuff really works and is gentle</li>
            <li>I really like this product a lot.</li>
            <li>and I really do like it.</li>
            <li>bottle is pump-styled, so it&#x27;s very convenient and hygienic (no messes or dipping your fingers into the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been ace my bags have gone and skin is so much firmer .</li>
            <li>When applied to the eye area, it has a very soothing feel and does soften the crows feet I have around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely working on my puffy eyes.</li>
            <li>I have really noticed a difference in my under eye circles.</li>
            <li>If you use too much it can leave a sticky residue, so apply sparingly to avoid that</li>
            <li>It really has not done anything for my bags and that is why I bought it</li>
            <li>but it seemed to go so fast.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any real difference with lines or bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it for it to work.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye cream/gel.  </li>
            <li>Although you don&#x27;t need much for your eyes</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care for it much..</li>
            <li>I had many deep wrinkles from crying so many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>Seems to work on bags under the eyes, and not so much for darkness.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>It really really works.</li>
            <li>This is not a cover-up or light diffusing  topical.</li>
            <li>and it does it fast.</li>
            <li>Very refreshin and clears the eye ares</li>
            <li>Its very sticky and not seeing the intended results.  </li>
            <li>I have this product as a gift, I really like the style</li>
            <li>and it really helps so</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would do much.</li>
            <li>now I don&#x27;t see much difference</li>
            <li>This tells me real changes are happening in my skin</li>
            <li>Seems to really work.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>I apply it on my eyes, upper and lower, my mouth area and smooth any leftover into my face.</li>
            <li>It is not really a cream; it&#x27;s more of a gel.  </li>
            <li>It was also sticky and did not work with my concealer very well.  </li>
            <li>gel like I said is very lightweight.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t like  this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a year now and really like it.</li>
            <li>Some will still need to use retinal along with this product, but using retinal alone will not deliver as much as using it in conjunction with this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like the silky texture of this eye gel.</li>
            <li>Really liking this product.  </li>
            <li>I use this for my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li>I have to smooth regular moisturizer over it to get rid of the stickiness.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to leave a real review for anyone looking to purchase.</li>
            <li>They are ok, not very foaming</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has reduced puffiness around my eyes, and the area feels much smoother.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t seen much improvement</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li>and I really like this one.</li>
            <li>I used the whole thing and at the end of it.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it really does much, but it seems to moisturize.</li>
            <li>Not irritating at all.</li>
            <li>I used it on my whole face until I&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I see much difference in that after using this gel.</li>
            <li>So - so, don&#x27;t really see a difference in my 60 yr.</li>
            <li>The eye gel did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>Just gone through the whole bottle....</li>
            <li>It really works like advertised.</li>
            <li>therefore I could see how much of the product was in there.</li>
            <li>The bottle aside, the product itself really works.</li>
            <li>and I can see much improvements.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like the dispenser bottle.</li>
            <li>You can regulate quite well how much you want.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>and I really do like it.  </li>
            <li>so I was very disapointed with that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 32, so wrinkles aren&#x27;t as much of a concern.</li>
            <li>Sadly I really didn&#x27;t notice anything after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s cost is very comprehensive...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I use it on my whole face.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely recommend this Eye Gel....</li>
            <li>OZ Naturals products are the real thing.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much smoother.</li>
            <li>but it has not been very effictive after almost 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>It also says in the bottle that you can use it on your whole face</li>
            <li>but I really like it.  </li>
            <li>as I don&#x27;t feele there is a real difference on me.</li>
            <li>It really helped all my areas.</li>
            <li>and then so much makeup remover and elbow grease to get it off.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
            <li>especially using this Peptide on the hollows of my cheeks where light expression lines are appearing and around my mouth.  </li>
            <li>This eye gel works very well</li>
            <li>(Btw, I also got a Sisley Gentle Face and Neck Exfoliating brush to use with the cleanser</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t believe it worked that fast.</li>
            <li>You really gotta try to believe it.</li>
            <li>This may be the only time I review a beauty product which my wife (31 yrs old) orders for herself, but there&#x27;s a good reason for my review - because I actually noticed a real difference from a beauty product she had</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will continue to use this product!  </li>
            <li>I really like this eye gel.</li>
            <li>she is all ready using arrived this morning,  </li>
            <li>and it truly really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really notice any reduction in puffiness</li>
            <li>Not of much help in removing the bags under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>After I put on this eye cream, my skin feel very soothed and cooling....</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It really brightens my eyes.</li>
            <li>I expected more.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I&#x27;m just expecting too much</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really like gold.</li>
            <li>As I do not have much  puffiness in the eyes</li>
            <li>However, been using it about 2-3 weeks and don&#x27;t really see all that change.</li>
            <li>and I am very picky</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>very nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, and I feel that it is softening the lines</li>
            <li>Really can&#x27;t see the difference</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed that much improvement.</li>
            <li>The pump always dispenses too much.</li>
            <li>how well I eat or how much I sleep.</li>
            <li>This really works to reduce puffiness around your eyes.  </li>
            <li>;, this product really is vegan.  </li>
            <li>like it&#x27;s really working.</li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t rate that part of the product.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely amazed at what it did.</li>
            <li>I have never seen anything work that fast.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I feel this eye gel is fabulous and looking forward in purchasing it next week</li>
            <li>I dont really like the smell &amp;</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>This one really works to tighten the skin.</li>
            <li>You really should try this one</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it did a whole lot of difference to my eye area just yet.</li>
            <li>This really is the &amp;#34;Best</li>
            <li>and I really think it has made a difference with the skin around my eye.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t looking much.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye gel.  </li>
            <li>I really like your eye gel.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear too much undereye make up</li>
            <li>I really like the results I get from the Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li>It is very cooling and soothing when you use it.  </li>
            <li>I use the whole range of Oz products.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t notice much difference</li>
            <li>Fast forward 2.5 months.</li>
            <li>I really like how gentle and soothing it is around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>It has also really helped with the puffiness in my eyes.</li>
            <li>and I really really like them all.</li>
            <li>Has done absolutely nothing to reduce swelling under the eye.  </li>
            <li>I am noticing a difference but not as much as i had hoped</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to all my friends and family!</li>
            <li>USed whole container and no results</li>
            <li>It really takes away puffiness and makes my eyes appear brighter and tighter.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of the effect, like getting off my eye bags.</li>
            <li>I guess I can&#x27;t ask too much...</li>
            <li>I noticed a big change in the area under my eyes within a week - skin smooth and</li>
            <li>It seems to be moisturizing really well.</li>
            <li>Very soothing eye gel - don&#x27;t see much change in wrinkles or reduced puffiness</li>
            <li>However, what I really don&#x27;t like about it is that it dries to a sticky finish -</li>
            <li>but I found it really helped with my under eye issues.</li>
            <li>I also really like the fact that their products are made in the USA</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>This product really seemed to keep the puffiness at bay.</li>
            <li>THANKS its a life saver, HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li>Really &amp;#34;wakes up&amp;#34; my eyes in the morning.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>It does not seem to do much for me, time will tell, but I have been using for 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li>Either way, it does dissipate very quickly, so it&#x27;s really a non issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I</li>
            <li>This really does make a difference in the puffiness...</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t care for it much</li>
            <li>much gel does it take?</li>
            <li>I used it morning and night until the whole bottle was gone.</li>
            <li>So much so that neither I or my husband could tell a difference.</li>
            <li>Really don&#x27;t like the gel texture.</li>
            <li>and I notice I am much brighter around the eyes and lines</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the products for a month with my Clarisonic and really do see that my skin has brightened.  </li>
            <li>When I run out is when I really know.  </li>
            <li>It really works efficiently.</li>
            <li>It is for real.</li>
            <li>Another important thing is you should take enough sleep so see noticeable change in your eyes.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye gel.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful pumping it out as it will squirt out much more than you need.  </li>
            <li>I really like this eye gel.</li>
            <li>You do not need much at all.</li>
            <li>I just gently patted the gel around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I do not notice any scent and it feels gentle.</li>
            <li>It is a pump dispenser, which I really like.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for over a month straight now</li>
            <li>- so much so that I have put this product on my monthly subscription list</li>
            <li>Really saw no difference after use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very slimy and very wet-looking.</li>
            <li>I got the same results from every eye cream I&#x27;ve used (many of which are cheaper by far)...</li>
            <li>It feels good, but hasn&#x27;t helped my dark circles at all - not sure if anything will though :)</li>
            <li>I love that it contains herbal instead of chemical ingredients especially since it is applied so near to my eyes.</li>
            <li>I am on my third bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Helps with puffy eyes better than anything I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>I imbibe a fair amount of caffeine, have a lot of stress and don&#x27;t get nearly enough sleep, so I have some pretty defined dark circles.</li>
            <li>I am 51 years old and have tried many different brands of eye cream.  </li>
            <li>As with any Oz Natural product, you will begin seeing results within the first week with consistent use.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural makes a far better eye gel for the same price.</li>
            <li>I like it so far and will continue using, would love to see it in a larger size though.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time but you will love it so much that like me, you get super nervous when it gets low and reorder fast.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this and was EXTREMELY pleased with it being so natural!</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this cream as read all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>There are several other organic plant ingredients: periwinkle, licorice, eye bright, reishi, frankincense and gotu kola which anyone can research on-line to see what benefits they provide.</li>
            <li>: when you apply the product around your eyes, you notice the area extremely hydrated and puffed up in a good way instantly.</li>
            <li>One co-worker was so excited she went home that very night and ordered several items from the OZ Naturals skin care line.</li>
            <li>This product turned the very fine lines under my eyes black.</li>
            <li>guess I&#x27;ve been spoiled for so many years with my other (eye) moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The eye gel has a great texture, and little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I do not think it does anything other than make more wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>For me, it is the ONLY product that successfully obliterated a wrinkle on my upper left eyelid--GONE!  </li>
            <li>My eyes are definitely brighter and lines are significantly diminished.  </li>
            <li>The eye gel works on me and I have tried many other eye products.</li>
            <li>Like so many other body products that claim to be the miracle cure, this like all the others did not fulfill my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Also interesting that those reviews are all on the same day and some say the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes looked more supple and there was a major difference in the texture and overall appearance.  </li>
            <li>It does not irritate my eyes like so many other eye creams.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t irritated my eyes at all like so many other eye treatments.</li>
            <li>you will love it and please try the other products....</li>
            <li>I have three of their products and each is in a unique container with a different colored label.</li>
            <li>It did not work any better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t my favorite for forehead or other areas like it suggests on the label-</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t see much more results that I did from other eye creams/gels</li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes appears firmer and my crows feet have diminished significantly after only one week of use!</li>
            <li>I have paid a lot more for other products that don&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li>I am familiar with the effects of hyaluronic acid, which is included in two facial skin care products I have used.</li>
            <li>&amp; I have used religiously night &amp; morning &amp; have seen a significant improvement in my eye condition .</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky AT ALL which I had the most problem with a lot of other eye gel products.</li>
            <li>Its much cheaper than many other high end products.</li>
            <li>I apply this eye gel in the mornings and at night after I clean my face with a facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but after using for just a few days I noticed how much brighter my eyes looked!</li>
            <li>This gel soaks into the skin which I love too because I live in very dry climate and need all the moisture I can get!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This does seem to be as effective so far as what I have previously used and my skin feels softer and seems to be helping.  </li>
            <li>At first the consistency of the gel felt strange but I quickly got used to it.</li>
            <li>While it seems to have a gel consistency, it feels thick and doesn&#x27;t smooth on easily.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and is very cost-effective compared to similar products, in other words: it is worth the price!</li>
            <li>Will continue to purchase it as long as it&#x27;s available.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin around my eyes and this did not sting when I applied it the first time.</li>
            <li>After 3 days use, I noticed that the dark circles under my eyes looked better.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still searching for something that will improve my dark circles more.</li>
            <li>I LOVE my skin now and my eye puffiness and dark circles are literally gone.</li>
            <li>This anti-aging eye gel is packed with potent ingredients that deliver visible results, including Haloxyl for dark circles, Matrixyl Synthe&#x27;6 to help wrinkles, skin-protecting Apple Stem Cells, Caffeine to reduce puffiness and Hyaluronic Acid to attract moisture and plump up</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have dark circles any more.</li>
            <li>My eyes have always had dark circles and I can already see them looking better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would say I need to use it longer to be able to tell 100% if this product will remove my dark circles.</li>
            <li>Also my make up seems to hide my dark circles better.  </li>
            <li>While my dark circles are mostly caused by allergies, I have found that the gel works well.</li>
            <li>feels cool then dries instantly.  </li>
            <li>Wow exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>After a full month, the puffiness was further reduced.</li>
            <li>For me this product worked ok on the puffiness side but not at all for dark circles.</li>
            <li>Usually make up product comes with some kind of protecting materials, but not this one.</li>
            <li>Removes dark circles and love this.</li>
            <li>As usual, my review reflects my own views and experience with the product and was in no way influenced by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>And they are only puffy now if I have not gotten a full nights sleep, unlike before I started using it they were puffy regardless.</li>
            <li>The texture is similar to aloe vera and the smell is decidedly plant like, which is not a bad thing.  </li>
            <li>It has a very light, non-oily texture but penetrates deeply and yields refresh look next morning.</li>
            <li>My eyes look healthy, less wrinkles under eyes and it glides on so nice that you use very little.</li>
            <li>i love other OZ naturals, but am not a fan of this one!</li>
            <li>I have lived in very sunny places for over 30 years which translates to many little wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>it goes quickly can&#x27;t live with out it!</li>
            <li>Definitely a new product in my beauty regimen!</li>
            <li>Also the active ingredients are exactly those I have so far found most effective:  hyaluronic acid, peptide complex, vitamin E and some plant-based extracts.  </li>
            <li>I actually look forward to using it because I know that the most delicate area of my face is being properly moisturized and protected by pure and effective ingredients.</li>
            <li>Plant stem cells and Matrixyl 3000 were new to me but sounded promising.  </li>
            <li>So far it goes on easy &amp; dry&#x27;s fast.</li>
            <li>I have used this three times, each time hoping it will be better, and each time I use this the same gross stickiness happens.</li>
            <li>Gonna have to switch back to a cream (as opposed to a gel) or switch back and forth to be able to get the hydration this area needs.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent size for an eye product</li>
            <li>OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel can be used multiple times per day and works it well on all skin types.</li>
            <li>and I have enough left from just one pump to apply to either my neck or the top of both hands.</li>
            <li>The serum definitely absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li>I recently received Oz Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel in order to sample the product for my review.  </li>
            <li>I had sagging skin under my eyes that made me look much older.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I made the purchase through Amazon, so I know there won&#x27;t be an issue with getting my money back.</li>
            <li>I am realistic and realize that deeper results are going to take time.  </li>
            <li>I feel this product line is top quality, and really appreciate how the company has taken such care to use natural and organic ingredients and to use them in concentrations that will actually give real results.</li>
            <li>which was the  main reason i got the product for.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that I can prevent some of the signs of aging as I get older.  </li>
            <li>I have used OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel for several weeks now without any adverse reactions.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and it feels so light and delicate.  </li>
            <li>I found OZ Naturals while doing research on all the different Natural Products available on the market.</li>
            <li>Thankfully my skin around my eyes is back to normal after three full days.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product so if you are looking for an alternative to questionable store eye creams this would be a great option.</li>
            <li>I mainly bought this eye gel because I was looking for something to help reduce my under eye circles.</li>
            <li>But the most recent batch feels very different on my skin.</li>
            <li>Finally, products that actually WORK and that benefit your skin.... :)</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and sinks into the skin fast.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product not only for dark circles and wrinkles around the eyes</li>
            <li>I have some light wrinkles on my forehead and between my eyes plus some loose skin in the jowl area.</li>
            <li>After applying Jan Marini Eye Intervention eye cream, I dab OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel under my bottom lashes where &amp;#34;luggage&amp;#34; would normally settle in, above the brow line and where crows feet SHOULD be, but, are not.  </li>
            <li>My skin feel tight and my circles have lightened :-)</li>
            <li>I came across this and it was highly rated</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this eye cooling gel.</li>
            <li>The eye gel has high quality ingredients to moisturize and soften the lines around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>Affordable for high quality ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Will recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product because I have seen change under my eye a day after I used it.  </li>
            <li>This has a drugstore price with a high end cosmetic store result.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly, a must have product.</li>
            <li>He has a high stress job and it tells.  </li>
            <li>note no changes had high hopes</li>
            <li>I have high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Like all oz products, this gel is of high quality</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>High quality product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend OZ Naturals.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this eye gel.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of products to try and get rid of the bags under my eyes, but this is the first product to actually make a positive difference.  </li>
            <li>The third time I ordered this it came in a new container that forces you to squirt out about ten times more gel than needed.</li>
            <li>the few weeks that I have used it, my eyes look more awake and my skin looks more supple and my crows feet seem to be a bit less pronounced as well.</li>
            <li>You can look at some of the other reviews to read what each ingredient actually does, but this gel is effective at combating lines &amp; wrinkles around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Because of the peptides I am experimenting with putting this product on the hollow areas of the cheek to address the fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and certain ingredients will cause me to break out or develop a rash.</li>
            <li>I love OZ Eye Cream for Dark Circles!</li>
            <li>I love that they are basically unisex and are completely natural with dermatological-grade active ingredients.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first few nights she started to see some improvement on the fine line and puffiness.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most important thing, this eye cream works as well as other much more expensive creams.</li>
            <li>This stuff really helps your eye not only feel like there not tired but look like there not tired.</li>
            <li>Well I had never found an eye cream yet that seemed to be making any difference as far as not just maintaining my skin, but having real anti-aging (meaning wrinkles</li>
            <li>The OZ Naturals cream was gentle (I have sensitive skin) and there was never any stinging when applying.</li>
            <li>With so many glowing reviews, I expected this eye gel to at least be somewhat worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>Plus, a lot of the reviews are just &amp;#34;over the top&amp;#34; bizarre - not real people.</li>
            <li>My eyes are sensitive - and my allergies are kicking up - and this eye gel has been gentle and works.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>thanks for the introduction offer, I have seen a difference from dark to light in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this product because of the great ingredient list, but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice any marked improvement-unfortunately.  </li>
            <li>, it goes on like a light weight gel and sinks in.</li>
            <li>I arranged for this product to be tried by a professional model, who is very well-acquainated with these types of products.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin type, and this eye gel really works and not giving me rash or itch feeling.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is moist and much clearer and feels soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>This eye gel is very soothing when applied and does not irritate the sensitive skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>but so far I really like it.  </li>
            <li>so do not use too much or your under eye area will become sensitive.</li>
            <li>I am almost 50 years old but you would never know it thanks to you guys.</li>
            <li>I always wondered about these dispensers and just how much product was in them and now you can see exactly how much is left.</li>
            <li>I have been using several different Oz Natural products for a while now and absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li>after seeing no results (if not negative results...)</li>
            <li>It is not like a normal eye area cream.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to most products, maybe be careful about putting it too close to your eye or near the waterline.</li>
            <li>I plan on writing another review in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>Least effective of all the creams I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I saw no improvement in my skin and the once-pleasant cooling sensation soon became a stinging sensation on my normal skin.&lt;br /&gt;Rating: 1</li>
            <li>I have had dark circles most of my life, I am 52 years young.</li>
            <li>I love it because I have a few lines under my eyes that look deeper with makeup</li>
            <li>It is one of the only products I thought I really saw a difference the first time using it.  </li>
            <li>I have no complaint about this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why it has such good reviews.  </li>
            <li>A lot of eye gels stay on top of the skin making eye makeup messy throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Hopefully within a few weeks, I will see even more progress.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, but for those who are looking for more moisture, this might not fit the bill.</li>
            <li>My issue is there isn&#x27;t enough of it in the bottle to make the expense worth it.  </li>
            <li>Love this item, works well and last a long time.</li>
            <li>, my skin is much more firm.</li>
            <li>Good for my puffy, tired eyes.</li>
            <li>You feel it penetrating and lifting, but what good does that do when it dries out the area and makes your wrinkles look WORSE?</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I see a dramatic result but sure is worth buying!</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I live in a harsh winter climate and need to use a moisturizing eye product on top of this.</li>
            <li>I love that you can use it anywhere else on your face - so if I use a bit too much I just smooth it in other areas of my face (usually around the eye area).  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the only eye treatment my sensitive skin has tolerated and that has made a visible difference so quickly.</li>
            <li>Not real dramatic . . .</li>
            <li>the three, the eye gel might my least favorite, but only because I prefer a rich emollient eye cream</li>
            <li>For me, it seems a little sticky and I don&#x27;t notice a real improvement in the hydration of my eyes or reduction in the fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I am a regular customer who researched the ingredients, read the reviews, and decided to try it after purchasing it myself right here on amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>If I wash my face, the wrinkles are right back where they were.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give this a three week trial by using it under just my left eye to see if there would be a difference from my right eye.</li>
            <li>try to put this on under your make-up right away, especially if you are putting on eye shadow.  </li>
            <li>I only applied the product around my right eye and surrounding area.</li>
            <li>I was soooo hopeful to get this product especially after reading all the positive reviews!  </li>
            <li>Plant stem cells sounds like something controversial in fact is simply an extract of plant stems and is not the other thing you might think.</li>
            <li>I love the OZ products because they are natural with all of their active ingredients 100 natural and 75% organic.</li>
            <li>so far great product i can say among all other product !!!!!!</li>
            <li>Having used some of the most luxurious and expensive eye gels in the world…To my amazement this product which is actually &amp;#34;Eye Gel&amp;#34; not &amp;#34;Eye Cream&amp;#34; as described is definitely one of the best I have EVER used….It targets multiple issues, Dark circles, Puffiness, Bags, Crows feet, Fine lines and gives an extra feature...</li>
            <li>I had hoped that, at the very least, it would be a good organic moisturizer for that sensitive eye area.  </li>
            <li>They are my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; brand.</li>
            <li>Patented peptide helps boost new collagen</li>
            <li>My neighbor&#x27;s daughter is a trainee beautician and often introduces me to new ideas.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this - I have bought twice</li>
            <li>This item came without any type of plastic cover to indicate that it is new.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to try new products for my aging acne skin.</li>
            <li>I now run out and then have to wait for a new delivery.</li>
            <li>even so, it doesn&#x27;t live up to the miraculous claims that it solves everything.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new eye cream.</li>
            <li>But, the bags appeared and aging gracefully without baggie eyes became my new goal.</li>
            <li>This gel is a new fave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say I cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li>On to something new.</li>
            <li>The pump bottle is elegant, simple and delivers a small spot of cream the right size for each eye.</li>
            <li>i can go without makeup, it works for fine lines, puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li>fine lines and dark circles did not disappear or fade.</li>
            <li>I started noticing dark circles, puffy-crapey skin and fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting immediate response to the fine lines, but the puffiness and dark circles should have been rapid, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>You can leave it on overnight to have healthy looking eyes in the morning or when you have puffy eyes from crying or allergies, it has been working in all of those situations so far for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel Is A Highly Potent Anti Aging Gel That Will Give You Dramatic Results</li>
            <li>I initially used a whole pump for both of my eyes and that was way too much.</li>
            <li>researched for a few months before I was able to find all the natural info I listed.  </li>
            <li>; this gel dries quickly and feels dry.</li>
            <li>so I am all over anything that will keep my skin soft and supple for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>I am a 31 year old woman with two kids, and one more on the way in a few months.</li>
            <li>The bottle is smaller than I expected, but the packaging is top notch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really seeing a difference, but I do like the natural ingredients and the smooth, absorbent texture.</li>
            <li>I would defnitly love to see photos of your little ones in there outift!</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, and I&#x27;ve been able to use their skin care line with zero negative effects, and lots of positive ones.</li>
            <li>It makes the puffiness go down soon after applying and fine lines reduced.</li>
            <li>Together they give my face a very soft feel.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and never used eye gel before.  </li>
            <li>and I am cause my eyes feel very soft and</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eye area</li>
            <li>Have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and this works well for me.</li>
            <li>It only takes a small amount applied under each eye one or two times a day, and it really does make things look a whole lot better.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin around my eyes, so I&#x27;m always picky about what products I will use for my under eye area.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t cause any irritation and I am usually very sensitive to eye products.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>I thought this was only for around the eyes use, but I tried it on two wrinkles on my forehead and right after I was surprised that I couldn&#x27;t notice them anymore.  </li>
            <li>I have used this eye gel for the past 3 months and find it very effective in reducing the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>love this eye gel but the bottle is too small -goes</li>
            <li>MY EYES LOOK YOUNG AGAIN!</li>
            <li>all of the OZ ingredients are either organic or natural ingredients, no chemicals!</li>
            <li>Used it the first time after a short night of 5 1/2 hours sleep.  </li>
            <li>and it was all natural!</li>
            <li>It is supposed to be ultra hydrating but does the exact opposite for me.</li>
            <li>My eyes are barely open and so swollen, they remind me of Sylvester Stalone&#x27;s after his first fight in, Rocky.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>First, it goes on like a gel substance that instantly liquefies with skin contact.  </li>
            <li>the dark circles are fading away, it has a&lt;br /&gt;very light smell of cucumber.</li>
            <li>Still &amp;#34;playing&amp;#34; with it but seems to have smoothed out some of the fine lines and my under eye appears less sunken.</li>
            <li>The bags under my eyes look 10x better after just a few uses!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I wanted to use it as a serum for my entire face.</li>
            <li>This is from many years in the sun ( not in the past 30 years) without sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I feel like I can&#x27;t wake up enough to function, but this gel really helps me wake up!</li>
            <li>Not heavy at all!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny when I am applying this I can actually hear myself going</li>
            <li>First eye cream I&#x27;ve ever bought that has actual results.</li>
            <li>(I do still have a 13 month old who refuses to sleep!)</li>
            <li>and I have noticed less fine lines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not uncomfortable at all and it only lasts a minute or so.</li>
            <li>I have no skin rashes which I usually get from most eye creams.</li>
            <li>I  have been using another Peptide Product in this area and will be interested in seeing if I get the same results.  </li>
            <li>Completely gone!</li>
            <li>I have bags under my eyes and dark circles which are primarily hereditary.  </li>
            <li>far I like it!</li>
            <li>I feel like other eye creams just sit on top of the skin and don&#x27;t actually sink in.</li>
            <li>This actually worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Feels like complete regeneration of the under eye area!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>My fine lines and wrinkles are much less visible.  </li>
            <li>It does tighten and lift and that&#x27;s what I needed most, and it stays all day unless you are in the extreme outside heat and perspire, then re apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cathy&lt;br /&gt;Las Vegas, NV</li>
            <li>The same it really works!</li>
            <li>This gel can be applied several times a day, so I used it first thing in the morning after washing my face and at night after cleansing, in combination with a serum (also by OZ Naturals) and topped by a night</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using it and update if there are any improvements, but so far, nothing!</li>
            <li>I doubt these results are psychological or a placebo effect, the results are real!</li>
            <li>This eye gel works fantastic to reduce puffiness and dark circles.  </li>
            <li>The first few nights I used it it did sort of sting, not bad, but I could tell I was a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li>It was a little to strong to use every day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I found this eye gel after trying all those top brand, expensive eye creams !!</li>
            <li>I also travel a lot and take this product with me on the planes to put it around my eyes so they look bright and lively - not sunken and dark, which was the case prior to using the product flying.</li>
            <li>This ingredients here are healthy, natural things like organic Licorice, and Reishi mixed with cutting edge effective ingredients like peptides, Matrixyl 3000, and Hyalauronic Acid and Plant Stem Cells.</li>
            <li>I jump at the chance to try any of this companies new products because every one has been a winner so far.</li>
            <li>but I must honestly admit that I see absolutely no difference in the dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a product I&#x27;ve recommended to others and never a complaint, only thanks.</li>
            <li>I most definitely recommend this product to anyone with dark circle or puffiness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products for my dark circles, love this one.</li>
            <li>so I will always have a shadow, but it is so much better without the dark blue discoloration.</li>
            <li>You only need a small amount and the pump dispenses it nicely.  </li>
            <li>For highly sensitive skin - I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I just turned 50 years old and I have always had very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product really does seem to calm down the area below my eyes--helps with pugffiness and with darkening.</li>
            <li>I thought this product was working, since it seemed as though my fine lines have reduced a little.</li>
            <li>It also helps with those little fine lines.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing but not so much where your cant easily use it under makeup with out a big ol mess.</li>
            <li>Overall though, this eye cream contains some powerful ingredients, but this does NOT mean that it would work for everyone, since everyone’s skins are different.</li>
            <li>As with the rest of the OZ products Ive used, I cant say enough positive things about this one.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get the eye gel as I have a lot of puffiness and dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Fine lines become less noticeable and the whole eye area looks younger and brighter.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because I have dark circles under my eyes and after reading the reviews of this product I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>Some of the other points in reviews are true - it&#x27;s not greasy, the gel is cooling, etc.</li>
            <li>Its&#x27; a good eye cream, but not better than some brands I&#x27;ve tried that were more expensive.  </li>
            <li>the area to the right of my right eye was very red and swollen, today it is the upper lid on my left eye (making my eye look like its swollen nearly shut).  </li>
            <li>(&amp;#34;Green Tea Classic&amp;#34; w/ caffiene -- boil 2 bags as directed with Kentwood &amp;#34;Spring Bottled Water&amp;#34;, let cool-may add more spring water to make a lil less concentrated/make it last longer.  </li>
            <li>but I suspect that this gel will end up costing less than the product I most recently used and discarded.</li>
            <li>My husband on the other hand has used this pretty much every night and day</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to any of the other claims of this product because the stickiness makes it pretty much unusable to me.</li>
            <li>Basically I look less tired and feel more confident about myself when going makeup</li>
            <li>As usual, when testing skin care, I started using this eye gel by itself, discontinuing my previous eye cream, and hoping for the best, because I do have problems with dark circles, lines and puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s made a big difference to my appearance and will certainly purchase again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently purchased eye gel...its easy to use, easy to apply and you can seriously see the results instantly!</li>
            <li>I needs only a small amount to totally cover the full eye area, applies easily and keeps the area moist and supple.  </li>
            <li>Came in a smaller bottle than I expected, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>What i love about this is that a little tiny dab is all you need.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little bit concious of  lines around my eyes (obviously laugh too much) and I always use an eye cream or serum around my eyes before I put moisturiser on.  </li>
            <li>Either way, I am glad to be using this gel as it certainly moisturizes and nourishes the under-eye area without leaving a greasy or shiny look (which a lot of eye creams do, and which I frankly find most annoying.)</li>
            <li>I am glad to be using this gel as it certainly moisturizes and nourishes the under-eye area without leaving a greasy or shiny look (which a lot of eye creams do, and which I frankly find most annoying.)</li>
            <li>I mix a little with my foundation and it really makes it go on much smoother and leaves my face very well moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Mostly it worked, but with time I have noticed two other  side effects - the under eye area became noticeably dry and wrinkled.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear gel</li>
            <li>/&gt;Almost immediately, the results were clear.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for the natural facial products!!!  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of a face mask that dries to a clear matte finish before you wash it off.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cloudy clear, well, hair-gel like substance.</li>
            <li>First eye serum that has really worked on undereye bags &amp; dark circles for me.</li>
            <li>First product I have found that really does get rid of dark circles.  </li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes looks really clear and even, which makes my eyes look brighter.</li>
            <li>After using this for months, I wasn&#x27;t completely whether if it was making a difference.</li>
            <li>So I continued to use it on and off early in the morning to get rid of the puffiness.</li>
            <li>and wow,</li>
            <li>So far, I like it and am looking forward to seeing the results over time.</li>
            <li>I have never actually written a review of a product but feel I need to because this eye gel really does help eliminate puffiness.  </li>
            <li>I am in my late 50&#x27;s and have tried so many products with no results.  </li>
            <li>For me the effects weren&#x27;t  really cumulative either, if I didn&#x27;t use it for a day both my eyes looked basically the same after about 24 hours without use.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are all natural and plant based.</li>
            <li>The area around your eyes is so sensitive and shows aging a lot sooner than the rest of your face.  </li>
            <li>Wild Crafted Eye</li>
            <li>Although product suppose to be natural I had an allergy to the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 40&#x27;s and have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin and frequently get a reaction or breakout from any anti-aging face products.</li>
            <li>skin is still soft and I didnt have any breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s it all natural.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always searched for a product that would get rid of it completely, so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to use makeup to cover it.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye gel and will continue to purchase it in the future.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate my skin in any way.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I can&#x27;t really tell you yet if the product will show any results in the future.</li>
            <li>Drying...needs moisturizing action to the mix.</li>
            <li>actually the smell goes away fast.</li>
            <li>This has by far beat the others without a doubt.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised with this eye cream.</li>
            <li>I have been using Dr Oz Naturals for one month, so far, I see no difference.</li>
            <li>I am in my 40s and have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I am 55 years old.</li>
            <li>If the the switch didn&#x27;t make it so drastically clear that the Oz Natural products were doing my skin a disservice, I may have thought, &amp;#34;Hey</li>
            <li>(at least today&#x27;s science cannot do this convincingly yet).</li>
            <li>dear seller looking forward to using the oz natural eye cream&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>OZ Naturals is a complete rip off.</li>
            <li>When applied, the gel is very cooling and there is an instant tightenting effect.</li>
            <li>and besides it will last that much longer.</li>
            <li>I think you will be pleasantly surprised how well it does for this.</li>
            <li>so far, nothing has changed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been diligently using it, too :</li>
            <li>this product fixed it.</li>
            <li>So far the puffiness has be kept at bay.</li>
            <li>I have not seen any changes thus far its been 2-3 weeks</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I really did not expect to see a difference especially so soon</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it didn&#x27;t take my under eye puffiness completely.  </li>
            <li>The manufacturers of sodium benzoate should be stopped from adding this poisin to soft drinks.</li>
            <li>but my eyes feel soft and seem brighter.</li>
            <li>This 65 year old face needs help with the wrinkles and puffiness under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>So far been using it for a few days and its doing better than my last eyes cream.</li>
            <li>Eye area is soft, eye make up goes on with ease now, no pulling or tugging.  </li>
            <li>I have very picky eyes , everything seems to make them red, peel and swollen.</li>
            <li>, I had to waste about 5 pumps of product before it came out smooth.</li>
            <li>I am getting ready to order for a second time and that&#x27;s unheard of from me.</li>
            <li>This eye gel is quite reminds me that &amp;#34;Insta natural Eye gel&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Eyes are 65+ old</li>
            <li>this product offers.  </li>
            <li>so I was surprised.</li>
            <li>a woman in her early 50&#x27;s, I&#x27;m serious!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>doctor recommended a product that is only physician sold that has really helped.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>While not expecting miracles, I was pleasantly surprised by how this product firms and tightens the under-eye skin.</li>
            <li>My skin absolutely looks younger and my eyes look</li>
            <li>skin is velvety soft , well hydrated and</li>
            <li>old eyes</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because this product is composed of 100% natural ingredients and is non-comedogenic</li>
            <li>which is a bonus for someone like me with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>did not help me---65 yrs old</li>
            <li>It also moisturizes the skin, leaving it soft.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see nearly the circles that I used to see.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, all of the &amp;#34;congestion&amp;#34; on my forehead was completely cleared by morning.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is natural.</li>
            <li>My friends have noticed I am nearly 65</li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised with this Eye Gel.  </li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>Especially for the price which is much lower than the cosmetics you get from shop.</li>
            <li>My eyes are quite sensitive and this did not make them sting at all.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for natural antiaging products.  </li>
            <li>the price is reasonable enough to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 55 years young and a skincare junkie....</li>
            <li>It makes the skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>People don&#x27;t realize I am over 55 years old.</li>
            <li>I am 46 years old and this is a miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li>The product leaves my skin soft and I will continue to use it but cannot see any changes to my skin.</li>
            <li>IT IS 100% NATURAL, BUT LABEL ON PRODUCT SAYS 75% ORGANIC.</li>
            <li>Eyes are the most delicate part of your body, they need to be treated with care and only use gentle products around them.</li>
            <li>wow...</li>
            <li>is all natural.</li>
            <li>Yes, the bags under the eyes diminished considerably and at this writing they are gone.  </li>
            <li>The puffiness goes away completely.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m 29 years old.  </li>
            <li>It has completely cleared up the wrinkles I had around my eyes.</li>
            <li>much as natural as you can get with anti-aging products&lt;</li>
            <li>So far I feel like the darkness under my eyes</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing it said it would do, after using it religiously for three weeks.</li>
            <li>My skin feels silky soft in the AM.</li>
            <li>it actually fights puffiness very nicly.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt smoothe, and soft and clear.</li>
            <li>by TallGirlJ a Frequent Contributor on PrairieWifeInHeels.com</li>
            <li>The only thing that really gets them lighter, ironically is when I don&#x27;t eat chocolate or caffeine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Natural</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I have had no issue with burning or stinging near my eyes as I do with some eye gels.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so idn if it really work&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Will definitely repurchase because this really moisturizes where it&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li>So far I like it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write reviews very often, especially for skin care products.</li>
            <li>Even, when I do get sleep, I wake up with puffy eyes and &amp;#34;bags.&amp;#34; The eye gel is all natural and 75% organic.</li>
            <li>I wish this came in a larger bottle--you can use this on your entire face and neck--but in doing so it will not last, as it is 0.5oz---need to find another product with the same ingredients --- I&#x27;ll be glad to take any and all suggestions---</li>
            <li>It completely removed the wrinkles around my eyes and lessened the circles under my eyes dramatically.</li>
            <li>A complete hoax.</li>
            <li>So far, I have used this product twice a day for 4 weeks in combination with Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream.</li>
            <li>and I find these products to be made with natural ingredients and the smell of the eye gel</li>
            <li>I spread this completely around the eye, and it seems to eliminate darker circles and puffiness  </li>
            <li>but I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>You won’t find parabens, sulfates, or alcohol in this 100% natural blend with vegan formula and 75% organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and in no way does this product irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I like how soft my eyes feel after applying this gel.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really do anything in the short time period</li>
            <li>Iam 83 years old</li>
            <li>however Oz Natural did the trick.  </li>
            <li>This gel really helps diminish these blemishes and make me feel younger and brighter.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how this feels cooling even when it is going</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for a couple of weeks religiously and cannot see much improvement.  </li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t see a marked improvement.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>I have yet to notice a change in the color under my eyes but allover my skin feels soft and radiant.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been using the product for almost 2 weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
            <li>I apply it all over the face and it leaves my skin soft and dewy.</li>
            <li>I have relatively young skin</li>
            <li>If I don’t look young, I do look younger.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>HAVE REDUCED CONSIDERABLY.</li>
            <li>After a week, I saw the circles fading, and after two, they were almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>I just turned 28 years old and have a one year old.</li>
            <li>I purchased this cream after having my 2nd child, knowing I would need something that really worked.</li>
            <li>and it turn that cooling action helps reduce puffiness.</li>
            <li>one of my adult daughters asked to try it out</li>
            <li>The product is made to be used on the sensitive skin around the eye area.  </li>
            <li>Give it 3 stars based on what I&#x27;ve seen/experienced so far.</li>
            <li>My look young, alert and</li>
            <li>Too early to tell, but am hopeful.</li>
            <li>The puffiness hasn&#x27;t gone completely</li>
            <li>I think I have noticed that the sides of my outer eyes near my cheeks is getting drier.  </li>
            <li>but I like it so far.</li>
            <li>and so far, I like it.</li>
            <li>I like that this product is all natural.</li>
            <li>only haha).  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t expect them to completely disappear.</li>
            <li>The consistency is like one of those old peel-off masks.</li>
            <li>I know everyone is different and some things work for some people and not others, but I won&#x27;t waste any more money on this product.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re someone skeptical about how effective products are, than maybe don&#x27;t put too much hope on this product.</li>
            <li>The number of these microscopic lesions was higher in treated animals than in controls, but there was no clear dose dependency for this effect.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to have the extra layer of moisture/protection around my delicate eye area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had puffiness and dark circles for most of my life - this product goes a long way towards reducing those.</li>
            <li>Really good stuff, and works as well as the expensive stuff at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has an easy to use dispenser, so you are really only using a drop each time, which means no wasted product and no mess like other tubes.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable, it spreads easily and a little amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This eye gel is not only soothing to the eyes it also combats puffiness which i suffer from, as a new user to this product I would highly recommend it.....</li>
            <li>Please bring back the old formula!!!</li>
            <li>Like I said I am a 52 year old female living right outside of PA.</li>
            <li>I really like the cooling and tightening, but since I&#x27;m still a new user I can&#x27;t speak to the long term effects of this eye cream.</li>
            <li>The directions say you can use it throughout the day, so I keep an extra bottle in my purse for those days when I am extra puffy, and apply it right over my makeup.  </li>
            <li>Someone seeing my occasionally and noticing a change right away is sign enough for me to continue this product.</li>
            <li>It seems to work quick &amp; long lasting.  </li>
            <li>Thick but absorbs pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>but the first thing I noticed after a few days was that under my eyes started to look brighter and I had pretty much no dark</li>
            <li>I can post back later if this does even more, as well as the other (5) products I purchased.</li>
            <li>and it sinks right in.</li>
            <li>Other beneficial ingredients in this product are: various amino acids which are the building blocks of proteins and therefore will assist in repairing tissue and smooth the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent a bundle trying many other eye creams and</li>
            <li>Sure, they got &amp;#34;tighter&amp;#34;, but it looked extremely unnatural as if my eyes were pinched closed.</li>
            <li>I also have pretty dry skin all around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have super dark circles</li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference in the fine lines and crows feet but nothing for my dark circles- which is why I am only giving it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>I say this with all the honesty and relief of a 31 year old woman who has been struggling to find a decent face treatment for my combo, occasional acne and blackhead-prone, splotchy face for years:</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any sign of measurable difference in the dark circles at this point, but they do look pretty decent after a tiring day at work.</li>
            <li>I can see a SIGNIFICANT difference in just a few days.</li>
            <li>Finally found a natural remedy that actually had my face and skin looking and feeling better in less than a week.</li>
            <li>Really pleased with the performance of this eye cream as it was recently put to the test when after a hard night&#x27;s worth of merriment I woke up with some serious eye baggage that required quick remedy.</li>
            <li>It did not do anything for the the puffiness under the eye -- perhaps it would help the younger woman, but it does not help an older woman.</li>
            <li>Really struggled with under eye dark circles and has really helped out</li>
            <li>If you rate low, then no more free product!  </li>
            <li>I did not notice any change in the dark spots or shadows under my eyes, but just the fact that the skin is much smoother around my eyes is really noticeable.  </li>
            <li>and I have no black circles under my eyes anymore.  </li>
            <li>wonderful results at a fraction of the cost of the expensive lines I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li>This does reduce the puffiness and dark circles and few products I&#x27;ve tried have done so as effectively as this.</li>
            <li>This eye gel is no less in its functions.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>So far each one of them has proven to be amazing compared to any other product I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Oz Naturals Eye Gel not only works wonders but it works wonderfully on my very sensitive skin without any problems!</li>
            <li>They make your eyelids a little puffy, but not ugly puffy.</li>
            <li>Really hasn&#x27;t been long enough to see any lasting results; definitely feel a tightening effect and product absorbs quickly without feeling greasy......................</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin like some other products I have used.</li>
            <li>Right now I feel like it&#x27;s any other eye product that I have tried and isn&#x27;t working...</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product &amp; used it 1 or 2 times daily for two weeks but then decided to stop.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this eye gel if you wanna try something different.</li>
            <li>I even use half a pump because a whole pump is WAY too much for just your eyes.</li>
            <li>In the morning, I let it dry for a few minutes, then apply my under eye concealer over the top.</li>
            <li>do not like getting older any more than the next person and this was the first time that I tried a product that promised to slow down the visible effects of aging.  </li>
            <li>With continued use I am noticing that it is helping to calm my dark circles too.</li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t really comment on long term benefits.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really like this gel, and I am looking forward to seeing its long term</li>
            <li>I would say it helps immediately brighten the area, but I didn&#x27;t really notice any long term effects even after having finished the bottle.</li>
            <li>It really helps with the puffiness, but not completely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another important ingredient is &amp;#34;plant stem cells&amp;#34; which are usually harvested from plants grown in labs.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to apply, either, so it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;ve any left over on my finger tips, I dab a bit within the laugh lines and above the upper lip too.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many remedy&#x27;s to reduce my bags, puffiness and dark circles from eye masks you pop in fridge, to ones you freeze to other eye creams.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>but after a few days later I started to notice it was actually making my wrinkles more deeper</li>
            <li>no dark cycles</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had nobody say anything about my Dark circles so based on what other people say, I would say its an OK product</li>
            <li>I have noticed the glow under eyes in the mornings with no dark circles and no need for concealer which I never thought would happen.</li>
            <li>I normally use two different products, so I gave it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does take a few minutes to completely absorb, it has a heavy gel feel, but when it dries, I can honestly feel the skin tightening.</li>
            <li>If you like a thick eye cream that fills in lines (like those expensive capsules) then this is a good fit for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Start reversing the eye aging process with a product from OZ Naturals – the Superior Youth Eye Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featured in Allure Magazine, you can’t go wrong giving this eye gel (not cream) that’s formulated specifically for the sensitive skin and areas around your eyes, especially the eyelids.</li>
            <li>It does have a cool feeling, but other than that i did not see any results,  I only have few fine lines, and not deep wrinkles</li>
            <li>The little bit of wrinkling I have is quickly diminishing as is the looseness of my under and over eye skin...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 21 year old female with some mild dark circles under my eyes and after reading the reviews decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>I only need a half pump of product for each eye which is good because this is a small bottle.  </li>
            <li>For me, the only potential negative aspect was the light cucumber scent when I first applied it.</li>
            <li>It is better than any other product that I have previously used for this problem.</li>
            <li>unless super miraculous product... won&#x27;t buy it for cost and other cheaper options with similar quality</li>
            <li>I simply cannot live without this Eye Gel.</li>
            <li>The new bottle is white and opaque.</li>
            <li>I am new to this line but definitely here to stay.</li>
            <li>The Hyaluronic Acid and recently the Retinol new product.</li>
            <li>I have always had dark circles and I notices improvement right away.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate and have appreciated the extra moisture.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am really happy with this product for the reason it gives me soft hydrated skin and makes me look less tired.</li>
            <li>I used so far 15 days , seems like is working well enough so far .</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need to use that much, a tiny pearl size amount is enough.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice any real difference yet but has only been a short time</li>
            <li>I had to use the OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel for a few weeks before I noticed any results.</li>
            <li>No bad reaction and it definitely reduces puffiness and seems to reduce dark circles.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the smell - it has a very strong smell initially.  </li>
            <li>skin around my eyes is very sensitive and I can only use hypoallergenic eye liners, mascara and eye creams.</li>
            <li>Honestly I have tried so many eye creams because I have bad dark eye circles.</li>
            <li>The fact we received them for free has no bearing on our review, and we have written negative reviews in the past for products we were sent for free.</li>
            <li>So I think if we want major results we have to stick to our regimen</li>
            <li>Be aware that this is only 1/2 OF AN OUNCE of actual fluid the packaging is deceiving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many eye treatment gels in the past, including some of the most expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work a little better than other products, but it&#x27;s not a miracle gel.</li>
            <li>However, no other compensation was received.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed a major difference.  </li>
            <li>No other eye cream has done this before.  </li>
            <li>I tried this first before the other products and it soothes my puffy eyes after I shower in the morning</li>
            <li>My dark circles appear to be less and my eyes just look more refreshed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After 25 days this bottle is half full, so I would say it may last 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY product that gets rid of dark circles and puffiness and it works quickly.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a long time and trying so many different products for the dark circles under my eyes, but found this stuff last spring/summer, and have been using it ever since!  </li>
            <li>I am obviously allergic to one or more of the &#x27;natural&#x27; ingredients in this product; I can&#x27;t figure out any other reason for  the mess it made of my skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are the most highly rated ingredients for an eye cream but the amount in this cream must be microscopical (if even true) as it really is one of the worst creams I have tried and I am obsessed with finding a good eye cream for my aging eyes.  </li>
            <li>The serum is fine - can&#x27;t see improvement, but then maybe it&#x27;s too late?  </li>
            <li>This eye gel goes on velvety smooth and sinks right in without irritating my sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>As usual, my review reflects my own views and experience with the product and was in no way influenced by the manufacturer.ence, especially when looking at photos taken a month ago, but I got the clearest confirmation the other day, when I happened to look at my face mid-afternoon and was dismayed to see that a hint of bags had returned under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>: The box has a clean design but the print is tiny, and the pump action bottle really not friendly for those with a visual difficulty.</li>
            <li>when I put some on it did have a strong smell but the smell isn&#x27;t a bad one and isn&#x27;t so strong it bothers me..</li>
            <li>It is not greasy on the skin and absorbs quickly and only has a slight odor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing a bottle will last a few months--so will try the entire bottle---I am optimistic that I&#x27;ll see improvement in my fine eye wrinkles, as the Oz Hyaluronic serum is working already.</li>
            <li>I do notice a reduction in the dark circles, but I will probably be looking for another eye cream or serum that hydrates a little better.</li>
            <li>I used OZ Naturals on my left eye, and the other on my right.</li>
            <li>Right after I apply this serum, my skin feels tight and needs some moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Feels smooth, but not effective.</li>
            <li>There genuinely does seem to be improvement in under eye wrinkles but not much for the dark circles.</li>
            <li>I am 69 years old and the wrinkles around my eyes plus dark and puffy eyes have really improved.  </li>
            <li>Usually eye-specific preparations are either too light and almost drying, or else they tend to leave a greasy residue which surfaces later through foundation or primer.  </li>
            <li>-)&lt;br /&gt;I am a big advocate of the natural approach and this product did it for me.</li>
            <li>; I&#x27;ve developed puffier eyes, especially in the morning.</li>
            <li>Couple days later after not using this product the puffiness is almost completely gone but</li>
            <li>My crows feet are barely noticeable now</li>
            <li>I found that it reduced my dark circles a lot just within the first use.</li>
            <li>so be careful pumping it out because you will get 3 x as much as you will need.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I am a 39 year old male</li>
            <li>It did not work.  :o</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to see that one day during my regular morning prep before work I noticed that the skin beneath my eyes looked lighter.</li>
            <li>Helps the dark circles and puffiness really well too!</li>
            <li>and I doubted that anything would help me with some wrinkles around the eyes; I acquired some of them with another eye cream which left me with blisters, redness and then skin like leather aound my eyes; guess I have a sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>So far i haven&#x27;t seen any obvious results.</li>
            <li>Apparently this was not tested on darker skin, because it does not work for me.  </li>
            <li>As a young male in his 20s</li>
            <li>Even as young as middle school</li>
            <li>But as far as daily use goes...</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t burn the candle at both ends and expect this product to fix it - but for allergy shiners and folks with dark circles under the eyes - this product for me really seems to work!  </li>
            <li>Is not a &#x27;miracle&#x27; by any stretch, but it works well enough for aging (old) skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for last 2 weeks and so far I like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay but not great.</li>
            <li>but still allows him to have a few distinguished laugh lines.  </li>
            <li>one of the main reasons being due to the fact it has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to copy and paste this review to the products I&#x27;ve listed above to avoid finding a new way to say the same thing!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t last very long and didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I like this product but cannot be completely certain of any benefits that it&#x27;s doing apart from other products that I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li>Although the packaging looks nice, it&#x27;s impossible to determine how much product remains.</li>
            <li>After just a few days I notice my eyes are not puffy in the morning and already the deeper lines seem less prominent.</li>
            <li>it comes to looking younger, women are usually the first to say that the wrinkles around their eyes make them look older than their age.</li>
            <li>I have been using OZNaturals Super Youth Eye Gel for the past five days</li>
            <li>the effect on the wrinkles is minimal as yet, although certainly noticeable, the real eye-opener has been the dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li>Firstly, it is not really a cream; it is more like a gel-cream, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>Nor did it really do anything other than keep me hoping a miracle was going to happen.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are gentle and do not cause eye irritation, which has been a problem with other products.</li>
            <li>I’ve used other eyelid moisturizers before but have had problems with them: I’ve either had to apply too much gel</li>
            <li>I suggest using this product at night as the gel is a rich and thick consistency.</li>
            <li>The skin under my eyes is smoother, less lines, the dark circles are definitely lighter and the overall look around the eye is more youthful.  </li>
            <li>The gel is wet and does not absorb into the skin,&lt;br /&gt;all of which makes it hard to apply concealer on top of it.  </li>
            <li>so if you are sensitive to natural products, be careful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a fresh vegetal smell dominated by cucumber and a translucent white color and only a slight viscosity.  </li>
            <li>yet I&#x27;ve seen significant improvement with my dark eye circles due to lack of sleep.</li>
            <li>even after being on all nite, it does not dry the eye area in any way.  </li>
            <li>I think it really helped calm my tired, puffy eyes.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it is thick and somewhat sticky and doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>A number of the eye creams that I&#x27;ve used did a good job in moisturizing the eye area and discouraging wrinkles, but some have been so heavy and greasy that I feel they&#x27;ve made the puffiness much worse.  </li>
            <li>I have been dabbing a small amount of the clear gel under my eyes before bed each night, and when I wake up the skin under my eyes looks smooth, refreshed, with no dark circles and less puffiness.  </li>
            <li>All it takes is a little dab around the eyes first thing in the morning</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok not really working well on me as I expected my dark circles are still the same .</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I actually noticed a slight difference!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My eyes are instantly less puffy and the fine lines around my eyes are visibly less noticeable.</li>
            <li>It releases exactly the amount I want, no more and no less.</li>
            <li>After using this and a few other OZ Naturals products my face is more dry than it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that at 47 years old, I am pretty sick and tired of having tried far too many products only to realize I&#x27;d wasted my money, yet again.</li>
            <li>and I am disappointed because of all the great reviews...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change in my dark circles or wrinkles</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars because I don&#x27;t really feel like it helps with dark circles (I didn&#x27;t see a difference).</li>
            <li>It really helped with my dark circles.</li>
            <li>I really think this has helped my dark spots under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing for my dark circles.</li>
            <li>It really reduces the dark circles under my eyes and tightens my skin.</li>
            <li>Really helped my dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who has dark circles and wants to improve the look of them.</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing for the wrinkles and dark bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really make any improvement on my dark circles however</li>
            <li>This gel really tightens the skin around my eyes, and I notice a decrease in puffiness and dark circles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced this does much for dark circles.</li>
            <li>The product really didnt help with puffiness or dark circles</li>
            <li>Puffy eyes are demenishing thanks to this stuff and the dark circles have improved in just two weeks..</li>
            <li>IT DID Absolutely nothing for my dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li>It really has transformed the look of my crows feet and dark circles.</li>
            <li>I use it each day, and feel much happier when I look in the mirror and do not see those dark circles.</li>
            <li>I really like that this can be used to help dark circles too.  </li>
            <li>The dark circles are so much improved, now it just takes a bit of concealor</li>
            <li>This product suppose to reduce my under eye bags, but often I feel the strange tingeing and itching with this &amp;#34;all  natural product&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Being a gel, it does plump the skin as any moisturizer would do, but I&#x27;ve noticed no long term effects.  </li>
            <li>approach to skincare is rather scattershot, perhaps because there is no solid science here, only marketing claims; I&#x27;m not willing to spend hundreds of dollars on fanciful advertising, nor am I willing to experiment with potentially toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>Just started using it, so don&#x27;t know yet what the long term will be as far as smoothing, tightening, lightening...?</li>
            <li>I have spent a lot of money on other products to reduce the sign of aging and had some success.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I ordered from OZ Naturals (now am using quite a few).</li>
            <li>The reviews did not tell the true story, or at least in my case.  </li>
            <li>Used sparingly, as is directed, this little bottle goes a long way and is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This product helped to lighten my dark circles a little nothing to fantastic.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the results I expected especially since others rated this so high.  </li>
            <li>I love researching eye creams because at the ripe old age of 28 my vanity and waning youth is starting to weigh heavily... especially on my dark circles.</li>
            <li>I give this 4 out of 5 stars because it has the potential to work like it says over time, 2 weeks or even 30 days can be hard to get the  full results of a product.&lt;br /&gt;I received these products for review purposes.</li>
            <li>bottle holds ½ fluid ounce or 15 ml of gel, and I have no idea how much there is left, but the pump dispenser works extremely well</li>
            <li>bottle holds ½ fluid ounce or 15 ml of gel, and I have no idea how much there is left, but the pump dispenser works extremely well</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as well as their other items.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne-prone and very combination skin-- think oil slick forehead and nose, barren desert</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Soon after using this I developed dry, scaly ,reddish eye lids.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also less hydrating and doesn&#x27;t do much for puffiness.</li>
            <li>such to help the dark circles (and the few fine (hopefully) lines I had under my eyes as well) and this eye gel</li>
            <li>Or, perhaps two weeks is too short a time to see any real difference in dark circles?</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t hesitate in using this as a regular remedy for baggy and dark eye-circle type issues.</li>
            <li>It definitely helps reduce puffiness and dark under the eyes, but not as much with wrinkles</li>
            <li>the  past few years I&#x27;ve noticed fine lines (crows feet) near my eyes and those dreaded &amp;#34;laugh lines&amp;#34; around my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Has made a tremendous difference in my eye area especially dark circles.  </li>
            <li>So far no new results to report.</li>
            <li>This Oz Naturals Eye Gel is a little thicker than the usual creams and goes on clear and smooth.  </li>
            <li>After trying out several other upscale brands with no visible improvements in the darkness under my eyes, I am completely satisfied with this eye gel after using it for the past four weeks!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very hard not to squirt too much out at once and easy to waste it that way.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product because it soothed the skin around my eyes and made me look a lot less tired.</li>
            <li>and I really have a tight budget</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m personally not sensitive to products, having fared alright with other intense skin products.</li>
            <li>I bought this item around Christmas, mainly to address my dark circles.</li>
            <li>You only need a tiny amount from the pump dispenser as it glides on thinly and easily.</li>
            <li>I chose this product because I trusted Oz to formulate a cream that would take care of dark circles in particular.  </li>
            <li>This eye gel has a rich, creamy texture and a very faint scent of fresh cucumber.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor and Beyond Broccoli and plenty of other books</li>
            <li>I also had new wrinkles around my eyes due to the irritation of my skin from this gel.  </li>
            <li>The pump was also less than half full of product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t suffer from dark circles regularly and it was only after several weeks&#x27; use that I realised that I had none even after a particularly sleepless night.</li>
            <li>I was having a real problem with very dark under-eye circles that I couldn&#x27;t even cover with concealor + foundation + powder.</li>
            <li>Not super excited with this product, will give in a little bit long before I make any super hard choices on keeping it or chucking it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as well as all their other products!</li>
            <li>I have noticed my eyes appear less dark but not really the wrinkles, fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t go wrong because theyre a cruelty free company , all natural and</li>

            <li> but I was too impressed with so many glowing</li>
            <li> AWESOME LOVE</li>
            <li> After being impressed with this product i bought a couple more from Oz naturals.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find an effective product for my eye area, and this product didn&#x27;t make the bottom of the list of tried products, so there&#x27;s that!</li>
            <li> excellent product i love it</li>
            <li> Awesome result,  more than expectations.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase and will buy more.</li>
            <li> It is so sticky - after I put it on, and smiled - my under-eyes crinkled (you know, like all eyes do when you smile)....and the crinkles just....stayed there!</li>
            <li> bought for the great price and good reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many eye creams and undeniably, this eye cream is the best!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my own!</li>
            <li> I will be recommending this product to all of my friends &amp; family who want an effective eye treatment that is cruelty-free!</li>
            <li> I am amazed with the results and how nice it feels on my face!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try more wonderful products from Oz Naturals.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did because this stuff great!  </li>
            <li> The biggest reason I love this product is that it is a PERFECT moisturizer for around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cooling and has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> What a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> It reminded me of cucumbers, so it could be quite pleasant to some.  </li>
            <li> It just makes me glow a bit more and that is amazing!!</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t sticky, are easy to apply and priced really great!</li>
            <li> bottle is extremely easy to use with a pump that dispenses the perfect amount.</li>
            <li> And the cream (I&#x27;d call it more of a gel) does the best job of tightening out of all the (MANY!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best eye gel that I have use so far, and the best part is</li>
            <li> (sodium L-pyrrolidone carboxylate, sodium lactate, L-arginine, L-aspartic acid, L-pyrrolidonecarboxylic acid, glycine, L-alanine, L-serine, L-valine, L-proline, L-threonine, L-isoleucine, L-histidine, L-phenylalanine), wildcrafted periwinkle, organic licorice, wildcrafted eye bright, wildcrafted reishi, organic gotu kola, frankincense, vitamin E, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, ethylhexyglycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will not order again until changes are made as product is good.</li>
            <li> It does a good job in firming up the skin around the eye.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>

            <li> i think thiss worked good for me.</li>
            <li> It feels really good around my eyes.</li>

            <li> Thanks for a great product that works!</li>
            <li> My yoga instructor is gorgeous and has the most amazing skin</li>
            <li> My wife started using the Best Eye Gel Eye Cream for her eyes and the product has really helped her.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is in the product, but it really works great!</li>
            <li> It in no way affects my ability  to review things honestly.  </li>
            <li> After using it for over two weeks , I can honestly say that it works.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice</li>
            <li> She said again that its nice</li>
            <li> it is the nice way it makes my skin feel like it&#x27;s tightening</li>
            <li> This really is the BEST eye gel I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li> I use the gel as the serum for my eye area / between the brow area and around the mouth area - I am absolutely loving the product.</li>
            <li> The gel feels nice</li>
            <li> but I noticed that it would kind of cake up around the corner of my eye which I do not like.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, this stuff could be used as an all-over the face anti-aging product.  </li>
            <li> I use it morning and night and keeps my eyes nice and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Im gonna order my own ASAP</li>
            <li> Honestly I still need some work on my bags</li>
            <li> NICE, COOLING FEELING -</li>
            <li> I was given the product to give my honest opinion and here it is.</li>
            <li> I really liked the texture and slip of the product plus lack of oiliness.</li>
            <li> Nice eye cream.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels nice.</li>
            <li> Feels very soothing, ingredient list is impressive.</li>
            <li> I liked this product a lot.</li>
            <li> and I have been seeing even more good results.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C serum is my absolute favorite!!!!!  </li>
            <li> It felt really nice on my skin and istantly made a difference.</li>
            <li> So great that I want to apply more and more.</li>
            <li> but now as always my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I just bought the cleanser and Vitamin C serum since these products are so effective.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just that I don&#x27;t think my skin liked it around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I gave this product to my aunt and she is thrilled</li>
            <li> I also use coconut oil all over my face and Vitamin E and Rose Hip Seed oil under my eyes for night time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If there are none coming, that&#x27;s OK; this product just makes things feel really good.</li>
            <li> I am loving this to wear it under doing makeup.</li>
            <li> So that is kind of an added perk!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The oil also tended to wear off any kind of eyeliner I used.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt and I liked the way the gel felt</li>
            <li> Nice products</li>
            <li> They are ok - nothing great, just ok.</li>
            <li> so I have to be safe when choosing a product that will be good for me.</li>
            <li> am very happy that the formula is made from real plants and has no chemical junk in it.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> I liked seeing the amount</li>
            <li> (I purchased with my own money)</li>
            <li> Honestly, I can already see a difference.</li>
            <li> All opinions expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product at an excellent price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how some of these products get so many good reviews</li>
            <li> It feels nice going on and moisturizes to some extent, though.</li>
            <li> I keep it in the refrigerator for a cooling sensation after a warm shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also liked the pump because I didn&#x27;t have to put my fingers in the product and get bacteria in it.</li>
            <li> It is a nice lotion in a pump, which I am now using on the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li> The serum adds a nice amount of moisture to my eyes and forehead</li>
            <li> This product feels nice going on.</li>
            <li> I liked before I got this, that the seller emailed me how to use it</li>
            <li> Nice bottle pump.</li>
            <li> solely my own</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not as spectacular as the advertising says.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice eye gel.</li>
            <li> But there were so many good reviews here, I had to try</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really nothing to lose in trying for yourself and it happens to be the best selling eye gel on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I liked the product a lot.</li>
            <li> Regardless, everything that I say is my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> best eye gel ever had1 thanks</li>
            <li> This is nice on the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I continue to buy it because it is effective.</li>
            <li> but still hoping, although I&#x27;m thrilled with anything.</li>
            <li> I love the feel, I almost feel like my under eyes are tightened in a good feeling way.</li>
            <li> However ALL opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> The smell is soooo good, it&#x27;s like melon, I love it.</li>
            <li> I feels nice</li>
            <li> Adding OZ Naturals Superior Youth Eye Gel to your beauty routine whether it be before bed, after your morning shower, or under your makeup, you’ll have more radiant and youthful looking</li>
            <li> it smells good and doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily still hoping to see more results</li>
            <li> Nice product, like the coolness when applied.</li>
            <li> how nice it</li>
            <li> Reasonable price for an excellent product as well.</li>
            <li> A Honest Review for Trying products...  </li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.  </li>
            <li> Great eye cream its gentle but works great.</li>
            <li> have received this product in return of my HONEST review.</li>
            <li> Kind of sticky once it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> My opinions and comfy eyes are my own.</li>
            <li> I suggest taking a photo of yourself for a before and after to compare because I honestly can not tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Quite honestly, I have not seen a difference yet</li>
            <li> But for now I can say that I do like the product and am hopeful for some nice results.</li>
            <li> This has a nice consistency and moisturizers quite well.</li>
            <li> However all thoughts and opinions expressed are solely my own.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to get the opportunity to try this product for quality and testing purposes.</li>
            <li> It effectively helps to reduce the discoloring and plump up that area.</li>
            <li> It smells like cucumbers, though, which is nice.</li>
            <li> a side note, I’ve found it best to use it during the night, right before sleeping, as that gives the eye cream plenty of time to work its magic.</li>
            <li> This eye gel feels very nice and is light in texture which is what I prefer.</li>
            <li> After reading the myriad great reviews I was really excited and hopeful about trying these products</li>

            <li> It is easy to apply and feels good on your skin</li>
            <li> The best part for me is having an eye product that is cruelty free and vegan but with powerful antioxidants and anti-aging ingredients.</li>
            <li> but I sure feel a lot better about my eye area!</li>
            <li> The best eye moisturer I have so far!</li>

            <li> Great, I thought - and bought the WHOLE LINE.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Always hoping for magic in a jar, I ordered this by description &amp; reviews alone.</li>
            <li> I sold cosmetics and skincare for many years.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Although it smells yummily like cucumbers, It feels as if it sits on top of my skin and does not penetrate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading so many favorable reviews, however after testing the product myself</li>
            <li> I have used department store brands, designer cosmetic store top sellers, and top line drug store products, and none can compare to the results of these 3 products.  </li>
            <li> I did notice it give my skin a better tone and gave a brighter appearance over all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> okay: notice no changes yet....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe most of the reviewers on this</li>
            <li> Thank you so much love the products and the prices.</li>
            <li> mother love it.  </li>
            <li> I, like many before me, have used many products that claim youthful eyes.  </li>
            <li> Or just got better</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Kind of a scam if you read all the testimonials on people who got this for FREE.  </li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> The fact that it helps and is also not going to break the bank is fantastic!</li>

            <li> I am not so in love with this product.  </li>
            <li> did receive this product for free to try, but I would consider purchasing it on my own.</li>
            <li> My eye area looks so much better since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was expecting more.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have more lines than before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to use it any more.</li>
            <li> GReat product that really seems to do the trick :)</li>
            <li> I received free product to give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> The eye gel was ok.</li>
            <li> Will keep using this and hope to improve even more</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 months now and must say that is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> It surely does what it promises and</li>
            <li> has helped puffy eyes more than anything I have tried</li>
            <li> and I love the results.  </li>

            <li> I LOVE:</li>
            <li> Jon, My Love Rest in Paradise...</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and great product</li>
            <li> It works - Most of my wrinkles are gone - have been using it for two months.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product until I find a better eye gel.</li>
            <li> I love this gel, it tightened my under eye skin and</li>
            <li> love the way it feels.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this eye gel, it did everything it said it would.  </li>
            <li> Basically if feels and smells like cucumbers which is mostly just water.</li>
            <li> Save your money &amp; go with a better brand</li>
            <li> This gel is cooling and I have noticed a change in the smoothness of my eye lids which at 66 years of age makes the eye shadow look better.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks my mom said my eyes look better</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I think my Neutrogena face cream works a lot better than this stuff.</li>
            <li> but this is better.</li>
            <li> and I think most people would also love this.</li>
            <li> This product is okay.</li>
            <li> I have started to ramp up my anti-aging skincare routine more for prevention than for correction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not interfere with the application of my makeup afterwards which I LOVE.</li>
            <li> Puffiness is reduced immediately, and after just a week I am noticing that the skin around my eyes is smoother and more hydrated even after washing it off.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are among the finest, for sure: plant stem cells, hyaluronic acid and Vitamin E.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was given to me for review, and I am glad it was!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will surely re-order.  </li>
            <li> This product is just ok for me.</li>
            <li> I love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> Some questions people thought because since there were so many 5 stars it was a marketing campaign.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Ok, but I&#x27;v seen better.</li>
            <li> Where I have applied it, my skin does have a brighter, more healthier look to it.</li>
            <li> This was a desperation purchase, and I&#x27;m glad I got this stuff.</li>
            <li> The blackness went away after I put another cream on top of the eye gel.</li>
            <li> Just okay.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> But then I noticed more detail to the lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> but they are much better.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, if I was able to give this NO stars, I would have done it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my favorite eye cream.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eye gel.</li>
            <li> Love the way this works</li>
            <li> This was not my favorite product.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure this product is making all the difference, as I have made dietary changes as well.</li>
            <li> You will see results but be patient as they get better with time.  </li>
            <li> and I cannot even tell you how many compliments I get on my skin even from the esthetician that does microdermabrasion treatments on my face.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE TEXTURE AND SMELL</li>
            <li> I’m not so sure about the puffiness/black circles, but I assume it does well for</li>
            <li> I believe OZ is coming out with a better eye gel soon.  </li>
            <li> my face looks better and smoother.</li>
            <li> I love it and use it all the time.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Great product , very moisturizing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to start taking better care of my skin, specifically preventative care.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many products.  </li>
            <li> Try it, you will love it.  </li>
            <li> I feel the product was more hype than help.</li>
            <li> in fact it tends to make my eyes look more puffy</li>
            <li> but I had already been using this product - I requested to review because I LOVE this eye cream.</li>
            <li> and you get much more.</li>
            <li> I have used many products costing hundreds of dollars that never worked.</li>
            <li> also love the emails the company is sending with beauty tips.  </li>
            <li> It feels good, is easily absorbed and is cooling.</li>
            <li> There are much better eye creams/gels on the market.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My under eyes don&#x27;t have as many wrinkles as they used to.</li>
            <li> This was ok, but there&#x27;s not a lot in the container</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eye gel...</li>

            <li> I have been impressed with all of OZ Naturals Products, I have tried a lot of eye creams and nothing actually did what it claimed to do.</li>
            <li> and I love the the feeling of tightening of the skin around the eyes when I apply it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products that did not do what they claimed.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> so i love it.</li>
            <li> hopefully it will work my under eyes:)</li>

            <li> I Love OZ Naturals....</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> so I use this more as a preventative measure.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-A bit drying but not terribly so.</li>
            <li> not waste your time and money!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS OZ NATURALS FOR MY DAY</li>

            <li> Thumbs up on this one for sure.</li>
            <li> circles seem to be more reduced, just a bit, but not significant.&lt;br /&gt;I seem to be noticing more lines underneath by eye with this product, which makes me wonder...</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received this free in order to give my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it works for many but not so for me.</li>
            <li> I started using this product in May and after using everything else over the counter at I am really pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream and recommend it to anyone needing hydration under your eyes.</li>
            <li> I have tried many OZ products and the eye gel is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> As I would with most OZ Naturals products.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would see any results - I&#x27;ve tried so many things for around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It does feel refreshing, but had hoped to find something to help with the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It makes my makeup look better because it keeps it from getting into the grooves around the eye.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this.  </li>
            <li> Just give it a try:)-- all that you have to do.</li>
            <li> It is surely 100% guaranteed as claimed by seller.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would make me look more &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34; but it didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> and when I&#x27;m putting on makeup the puffy eyes are so much better.</li>
            <li> Some what costly, but cheaper is not always better.</li>
            <li> It made me feel and look better.  </li>
            <li> Love all health and beauty from oz naturals</li>
            <li> While the darkness of the puffy circles under my eyes is slightly alleviated, the puffiness hasn&#x27;t been budged at all.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s not terrible.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li> This eye gel has transformed my eyes from sleepy &amp; baggy looking, back to looking great!</li>
            <li> My eyes didn&#x27;t look any better, but the skin around my mouth was noticeably improved.</li>
            <li> This product smells like cucumber to me and I love that smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this under eye serum.  </li>
            <li> The results get better after prolonged use.  </li>
            <li> I have to say, I&#x27;ve tried many....</li>
            <li> many....</li>
            <li> I have tried many and often don&#x27;t finish them because I don&#x27;t get results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also more affordable than any department store brand.</li>
            <li> but my opinion is my own and genuine.</li>
            <li> I also love their retinol moisturizer (it doesn&#x27;t break me out).</li>
            <li> I will buy this product once I&#x27;m finished with my tester. :)</li>
            <li> I looked much more awake and youthful with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>

            <li> I hope that it continues to improve the more I use it.</li>
            <li> but I still use it because it&#x27;s better than nothing</li>
            <li> More tacky and peely.</li>
            <li> What I like about this gel, is that it has  creamy feel to it, goes on nice and smooth, and has NO odor.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this product overall.</li>
            <li> There have been warnings about this kind; insinuating that Dr. Oz is advertizing products that sound like he is endorsing that product</li>
            <li> This eye gel is fantastic!</li>
            <li> was provided this eye gel free of cost for my 100% honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> This is okay.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure about this product.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t cause stinging and actually felt great!  </li>
            <li> Not gone, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle  :)</li>
            <li> Most noticeable is the the way the cream cools the skin</li>
            <li> The lines don&#x27;t appear as deep and the areas where I have applied it in addition to my eyes are looking great!</li>
            <li> Bought this based on being a top seller.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a about a week--the puffiness is definitely better.</li>

            <li> I am amazed how many people rave about this gel because it doesn&#x27;t do anything at all for me for some reason</li>
            <li> So I tried this eye gel and within a week, I looked significantly better.</li>
            <li> so I cannot say how well it works on those, but it does make my eyes look more refreshed.</li>
            <li> I tried the Oz naturals, vit.c amniotic blend hyaluronic acid, I like it and would love some free products!</li>

            <li> /&gt;It is safe for all skin types.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products, serums, eye gel etc</li>
            <li> am 100% satisfied with this eye gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using more moisturizer there to counter-balance it.</li>
            <li> I am hoping to see more benefits as I use it longer.</li>
            <li> I just love OZNaturals Eye Gel and will not be without it.</li>

            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Works great at tightening up the eyes but not so great at removing dark circles around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I waited this long before I give my review to make sure I see the result and indeed, this is the best eye gel everyone could ask for.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product that I would highly recommend.&lt;br</li>

            <li> will continue to use and will purchase more strongly recommend</li>
            <li> Love the fact that this is a gel, it is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> For the best result, let it dry before applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I used it, but it&#x27;s super nice.</li>
            <li> I can still easily apply my makeup over top of it.</li>
            <li> I love how easy the product is to use too.  </li>
            <li> It feels amazing on my skin and dries quickly so hair don&#x27;t have to worry about it rubbing off on my pillow when I go to bed at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it with OZ natural vitamin C serum and it works great :)</li>
            <li> I love all the ingredients that nourish my skin, but I love the hyaluronic acid which is so important for hydrating and plumping the skin.</li>
            <li> This is a really wonderful eye gel and it really works fast</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say enough great things about the Eye Gel.</li>
            <li> This is a great Natural Product !</li>
            <li> Plus it smells fresh and healthy!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing when it goes on, and I let it dry before I put on make up, and it works great.</li>
            <li> I have a fine line across the top of my nose, and it relaxes that too.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s moisturizing and soothing...not sure about reducing fine lines though.</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;ve been using this over a month and this cream makes my fine lines go away</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on fine on top of it</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t feel more fresh than this! :)</li>
            <li> This is good but not as great as other OZ products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as an all over facial mosturiser, and its been very good.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is very cool and soothing going on and works well under makeup.</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural, and is great for wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I was an esthetician for over 4 years and have used my fair share of high end products (innovative skincare, skin ceuticals, pca, etc.).  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and have a very light refreshing cucumber scent.</li>
            <li> Amazing product worth eery penny</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, and my eyes are looking much better.</li>
            <li> With OZ Naturals eye gel I&#x27;ve had no reaction and my skin looks more plump and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It has a great smell - you can smell the natural ingredients contained in the product</li>
            <li> I was able to find this product through snagshout.com and got it free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please look at how many of the 5 star reviews say they received the product for free for an &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; review.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how so many people got the product for free</li>
            <li> Also appreciate and love that the products are cruelty free.  </li>
            <li> best eye gel ever, gets rid of those dark circles and more</li>
            <li> The great thing to me is that it is 75% organic and mostly natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This gel is great so far.</li>
            <li> Happy with this product so far.</li>
            <li> What I enjoy the most is the cooling feeling I get after putting the cream on my eyes</li>
            <li> Shortly after applying the gel, the darkness tends to fade, resulting in a more attractive and energetic appearance.</li>
            <li> You will notice that most of them received free product in order to review.</li>
            <li> Hyper pigmentation around my eyes is becoming lighter.  </li>
            <li> As if the skin around my eyes was IMMEDIATELY moisturized and on top of that, it felt comfortable all day.</li>
            <li> The gel is on the viscous side (Aloe is the primary ingredient) and is mostly odorless.</li>
            <li> and I love the creamy smooth texture of the gel.  </li>
            <li> Even though the product itself is the critical thing, I love the company logo with a beautiful tree - it is calming.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on really smooth, feels refreshing to the eye once applied.</li>
            <li> (15 ml) bottle is opaque to protect the contents from light and it has a convenient pump top that dispenses just a drop as well as a protective cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is soothing, non-irritating, and most important, reduces under-eye bagginess and the appearance of lines around the eye area.</li>
            <li> So far I am happy with this product..</li>
            <li> Love this soothing light weight eye gel.  </li>
            <li> free to use it all over your face for a more radiant glow; it’s not just for your eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Many of the reviews here were from people who were given the product for free.</li>
            <li> It felt really light and refreshing when I applied it under my eyes.</li>
            <li> So far this gel has been a great buy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE that this eye gel is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> I have been using some very &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; and fairly pricy products from the selection at QVC.</li>
            <li> I was given the chance to try it complimentary  to give my honest and unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> I love that it goes on smooth and absorbs very quickly leaving my skin feeling hydrated and non</li>
            <li> as she says, it&#x27;s very moisturizing, soothing and the gel formula dries quickly (works great under the make-up).</li>
            <li> This product is amazing in how it helps relax aging lines beneath the eyes, at the corners of the eyes and even on the cheek right below corners of the nostrils.</li>
            <li> Most eye products charge a fortune and really don&#x27;t do much, but I look forward to seeing the results after more usage!</li>
            <li> This really helps my moisturizer soak in better- love it!</li>
            <li> So far it feels very nice.</li>
            <li> I am excited about this product and will continue to use it to see if my eye area looks even better.</li>
            <li> Ain&#x27;t I cool!    </li>
            <li> , maybe these just aren&#x27;t the best products for me.&amp;#34; However, I&#x27;ve tried other products that maybe didn&#x27;t transform my skin</li>
            <li> Its very nice to apply, and absorbs pretty fast into the skin leaving it very smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Their other stuff though is awesome.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try the product like mostly everyone else in my age group.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely awesome, but you probably already knew this from all of the other reviews.  </li>

            <li> I am happy with their serums, so am ok giving this eye gel a chance and using it for a longer period of time before I pass any final verdict on its in/effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Absorbs easily</li>

            <li> I recommend this product, and I love the clean ingredients.</li>
            <li> The tiniest amount covers both eye areas easily.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with their serums, so am ok giving this eye gel a chance and using it for a longer period of time before I pass any final verdict on its in/effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Wow, I really don&#x27;t care if the drooping and folds don&#x27;t go away, this stuff makes the eyes just feel  really good!!</li>

            <li> It works well and absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> There is no scent, it has a gel- consistency which prevents wasting and is easy to apply.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor.</li>
            <li> It forms benzene in the presence of vitamin C and E, or in an acidic environment—and benzene is a strong carcinogen.</li>
            <li> Scent too strong for me, I am hypersensitive.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Thats really strong.</li>
            <li> I really like the packaging, its easy to get the product out in the right amount and the smell, really great.</li>
            <li> It glides on my skin nice and smooth and my skin soaks it up right away.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty amazing...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65 and have been into natural skin care products most of my life, and I have to say OZ Naturals is the best so far.</li>
            <li> Feels cool, refreshing and makes eye area skin feel firmer</li>
            <li> Would not rate this the best, just average.  </li>
            <li> Puffiness, bags, and dark circles don&#x27;t show us at our best.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a young 53-year-old and in my 20s worked in a cosmetic department and been blessed to try many products and this is by far the best</li>
            <li> Love the cool feel of the eye gel.  </li>
            <li> This has been awesome for my dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and in my opinion, it&#x27;s the best eye gel on the market for dark undereye circles and puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> The gel is also awesome for brightening dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several popular brands of eye gel and so far this is the best!</li>
            <li> Why is this the best eye gel cream for puffiness and dark circles?</li>
            <li> It felt cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Its very easy to use and gives you just the right amount of product needed for each use.</li>
            <li> Literally within minutes of applying the eye serum, I felt my skin tightening, and within days, my fine lines and even my dark circles greatly diminished!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best eye cream I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li> I have tried several eye creams/gel over the years and was very happy with one that was made by genesis pharmaceuticals that was very reasonable in price, but they discontinued it.  </li>
            <li> I discontinued use and in a couple days was fine.</li>
            <li> I do have the fine lines</li>
            <li> light and easy to absorb, keep your eyes shining in the morning</li>
            <li> I can feel a tightening of the fine wrinkles each and every time.  </li>
            <li> This product does everything it says: reduces puffiness, decreases appearance of fine lines, and brightens.  </li>
            <li> Smell is fine but doesn&#x27;t leave skin around your eye feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55 and have found the OZ Naturals Eye Gel  helps reduce morning time under eye puffiness and fine lines.</li>
            <li> Did not see much fine line or wrinkle improvement.</li>
            <li> However it did not seem to do anything for my fine lines</li>
            <li> It has reduced the fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Also used it in my fine lines on forehead.</li>
            <li> It seem to be woking on the fine lines on my forehead and has made it smoother.</li>
            <li> The packaging is impressive like my previous eye creams.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suffer from fine lines or wrinkles yet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine to use at night.</li>
            <li> I feel like the packaging could be a bit nicer but for this price point it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Puffiness is lessened as are fine lines.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m hoping that with continued use it will help prevent some fine lines from coming out as I age.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even use it around my lip area and have seen the fine lines there diminish as well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find this product that miraculous, but it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easy and smooth around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Half bottle gone now, great value!</li>
            <li> ( I use it on my fine lines there too).</li>
            <li> It works fine for me.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on just fine over it which is a plus.</li>
            <li> It does reduce puffiness and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Noticeable reduction of fine lines and morning swelling.  </li>
            <li> Smooths out the fine lines.</li>
            <li> It works fine with make up also.</li>
            <li> I have seen some improvement in fine lines around the eye area.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed some fine lines around my eyes now that I am in my 30&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Falling in love with this product is super EZ.  </li>

            <li> (Yes, I know it&#x27;s not the last word on certain ingredients, but for now it&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li> But its a good price, fast shipping and exactly as described, so will buy from seller again!</li>
            <li> I notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Also, another reviewer&#x27;s comment about liquid cucumbers is accurate.</li>
            <li> But this gel is very lightweight and feels nice and smooth on the skin</li>
            <li> but they even if they assist with the wrinkles I wake up with huge bags around my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Its been a huge confidence booster when I take my glasses off.</li>
            <li> I generally like most eye creams I get, and am very pleased with OZ Naturals.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my face, but there has been some improvement.</li>
            <li> also started to wear sunscreen every day and have noticed a huge change in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noti a huge change in his skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see huge changes, but</li>
            <li> So after trying Bioelements eye cream with no results I looked for something comparable in price, that wasn&#x27;t from the drugstore and filled with cheap ingredients.</li>
            <li> There were so many 5 star reviews that I thought this was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Really light eye gel, rubs in effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> He is light skintoned.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Bright, Wild Crafted Reishi, Organic Gotu Kola, Vitamin E. Ingredients are 75% natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have used several products from Oz Naturals and have gotten great results from each product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They look even toned and smooth without puffiness.</li>

            <li> , it&#x27;s light and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> I paid for mine, close to 20 dollars, and was never offered a free product.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t keep using it even if it were free.</li>
            <li> It honestly has helped my eyes look so much fresher</li>
            <li> I buy Oz naturals, not only are they really great</li>

            <li> It is light and not greasy at all.</li>

            <li> I was sent this eye gel from &amp;#34;Oz Naturals&amp;#34; to try for free</li>
            <li> It wears really smoothly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kicking myself because now we&#x27;re spending a lot more on skin care, but for us, it&#x27;s worth every penny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did receive this item free to try for the purpose of my review.  </li>

            <li> But now after using it awhile, I do notice that the fine lines and bags under my eyes have been significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> Really nice product; feels cool and refreshing and doesn&#x27;t bother my very sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li> I think most people must have gotten these products for Free in return to leave a positive review!</li>
            <li> But right now I love it.</li>
            <li> I am familiar with Oz Naturals and use the hyraulonic serum daily with great results.  </li>
            <li> I realllly wanted to like it, because the Retniol Moisturizer is so fabulous, but other than it smelling real nice, I haven&#x27;t noticed a thing.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading so many positive reviews and after using it for 30 days, I can add my own positive review.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to finally be able to write a positive review because I&#x27;m happy to have finally found something that actually works!</li>
            <li> It is not sticky, very smooth and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> The gel absorbs quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This does nothing as implied, very disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;Feels good when you first put it on</li>
            <li> It is a very lightweight formula that smooths onto my skin very easily.</li>
            <li> Very fresh and clean smelling which I like, plus it&#x27;s not too over</li>
            <li> You can actually use this anywhere on your face, it has a light, pleasant, cucumber scent, and feels cooling on the skin.</li>
            <li> I actually received a sample of this product and it was amazing!</li>
            <li> In that two weeks that I stopped using it, I noticed a gradual but significant increase in the appearance of the wrinkles around my eyes, as well as increased dryness.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m using the gel again, I have seen a significant decrease in the appearance of the wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Dispenser - While the pump dispenser is easy, it&#x27;s probably too easy and therefore can easily dispense too much resulting</li>
            <li> look so fresh afterwards!</li>
            <li> Ummm, I&#x27;m not sure how this is a #1 best seller.  </li>
            <li> BEST product on the market and the price is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Not only is this a great product for your eyes, you can use this on your whole face for a brighter, more radiant complexion.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with all the OZ Natural products and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> In general, this product is so good that I&#x27;ve recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> and I have yet to see any significant improvements.</li>
            <li> I have got to say I can see a significant change in the puffiness below my eyes.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> I first read about this eye cream in an article about the top products of the year.</li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Pretty sure that&#x27;s what they are hoping you&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li> On most days I wear Benefits &amp;#34;Erase Paste&amp;#34; for my darker circles, but I feel like with consistent use of this</li>
            <li> The icing on the cake is the great price and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Okay, first of all, someone did not pay me to post a 5 star comment.</li>
            <li> I was actually really excited about trying something that would help</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very safe for my sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t burn my eyes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited about this product.</li>
            <li> It is cool and smooth.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> The gel goes on smooth and feels cool to the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super hydrating to the eye area and reduces the look of my fine lines.</li>
            <li> but I can tell the significant difference</li>
            <li> I was so excited about trying this product</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use this eye cream and since the first day I love it!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this products and the whole OZ naturals line!</li>
            <li> The gel feels light and cool.  </li>
            <li> I love this and it makes my skin so smooth and my pours are not so large anymore</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for daytime use, but I need something a little bit more moisturizing for nighttime.</li>
            <li> Nice product, still using so no significant results yet, but feels good.</li>
            <li> I love the cool gel feel and that it does not take very much to cover the eye area.</li>
            <li> the more natural the cucumber ingredient is, the more sever my face reacts.</li>
            <li> clean, moisturizing and affordable</li>
            <li> Light weight and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Been using different types of eye products by far this one is the best</li>
            <li> Love this gel works for me far better than cream</li>
            <li> I like that the ingredients are clean.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks and this multi-tasker is a welcome and potent addition to my skin care arsenal.</li>
            <li> eye gel goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> My eyes look much brighter and feel more smooth around them.</li>
            <li> Its only been 3 days, but so far I am impressed!</li>
            <li> It goes on so smooth and feels super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Amazing ingredients which, after only a couple days, seem to make my skin under my eyes look better.</li>
            <li> Even though I love the soft feeling this gel leaves around my eye area, I won&#x27;t be able to keep using it.  </li>
            <li> SO far I have been more than satisfied.</li>
            <li> I started looking for made in america products that were clean.</li>
            <li> The Oz Eye Gel is goes on smooth and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I used it on my clean eyes every morning and every night.</li>
            <li> eye product is an almost clear, medium-textured gel which disappears into my skin after a very short massage, leaving a perfect basis for make-up.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and dries quickly leaving no residue.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing, like a very soft floral fragrance.</li>
            <li> I do not generally write reviews, but this eye serum is amazing!</li>
            <li> Its absolutely amazing to me, my eyes are nice and smooth with no puffiness or dark circles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will continue to use Oz Natural products as they are top quality, affordable and they work!</li>
            <li> Hopefully all my eye puffiness and dark circles will be gone for good!</li>
            <li> i think its a great product does what it says it does no strong steanky smell or anything love this product</li>
            <li> It makes it easy to choose the right product.</li>
            <li> and maybe a quick afternoon touch up if necessary to get you looking nice and healthy through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get very dark circles under my eyes and am very fair skinned, so concealer is a must.</li>
            <li> nothing special to report.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about the gel.</li>
            <li> No matter how much sleep I got, drank gallons of water, eat clean healthy food ... couldn&#x27;t get rid of under eye bags.</li>
            <li> Very light - i have used this product for a few weeks and so far best eye cream i have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 and was just starting to see fine lines and seems to have smoothed out,  I will keep using that&#x27;s for sure and love the price</li>
            <li> It feels cooling when applied, absorbs quickly and the pump dispenser keeps the product fresh!</li>
            <li> It gives just t he right amount of moisture and minimizes fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Its super gentle and has a very light and silky texture.  </li>
            <li> Great product, makes my skin feel so smooth and diminishes dark circles.</li>
            <li> My experience with OZ natural eye gel has been amazing.</li>
            <li> Not only does it make my eyes bright, it will not break the bank.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of this product is amazing, a soft cucumber / aloe smell.</li>
            <li> It feels nice and cooling going on, but then, so does pretty much any moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I bought this eye gel recently and this is a few days that I&#x27;m using it, this gel is wonderful and absolutely works for me, I have tried many of eye creams and none of them worked, but this one is really kind of miracle.</li>
            <li> The results so far are amazing.  </li>
            <li> I had bright eyes after about ten minutes.</li>
            <li> Overall good product for this price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool.  </li>
            <li> After receiving the trial with cool on the eyes，Effect is uncertain</li>
            <li> Since then, I just can&#x27;t find another one that is as good let alone for a similar price.  </li>
            <li> its quite light and easily absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> Like most promising eye creams, this doesn&#x27;t do the job at all.</li>
            <li> For what they charge (it is a good deal, I have to admit), but they need to come in BIGGER BOTTLES.</li>
            <li> It feels so good to find something that actually works!</li>
            <li> I cannot say whether or not I would buy this product again for myself since I have not used it enough to give it a fair opinion, but I could see my husband wanting this again.</li>
            <li> I needed to use a lot to get any effect and moisturizing and the effects were not as good as my prior eye gel.</li>
            <li> I love this line so much ...</li>
            <li> I wonder how many are real).  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a cool, tingly feeling, it&#x27;s soothing.  </li>
            <li> I only put it at night and wake up with good results.</li>
            <li> and she said it was really soft and  nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a good several months already and no results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it because it looks like it has good ingredients,  but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a sudden change, just gives your eyes a well rested look, like a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> Love this produce it comes out too fast</li>
            <li> I also really like that it&#x27;s Cruelty Free!</li>
            <li> It has a light fresh scent that reminds me of melons.</li>
            <li> I paid full price for this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nice, no reaction on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> my house is full of poison.</li>
            <li> There were so many 5 star reviews that I thought this would really work.  </li>
            <li> It feels so cool and refresh as well.</li>
            <li> The eye gel makes eyes feel cool and relaxed.</li>
            <li> I used the product for a full five months, and saw no improvement at all.  </li>
            <li> and the gel feels so cool</li>
            <li> Does only a fair job at moisturizing the skin around the eye.  </li>
            <li> Remember, this is a treatment, and must be used regularly, morning and night, if you want good results.  </li>
            <li> I really really really reallyyyyy LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> but I for one will be placing my order for more very soon.</li>
            <li> i love it,it really  work</li>
            <li> It is cool and soothing when applying.  </li>
            <li> I received  this as a gift for Christmas and love it so much I bought some for my sister and husband.</li>
            <li> It is cool and soothing and not oily.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t believe anything can turn back the hands of time, but this product is a good aid, enhancement, additive to your livelihood....</li>
            <li> Once again, I cannot say enough good about OZ Naturals skin care line.</li>
            <li> Still to soon to see true results.  </li>
            <li> The bags under my eyes have almost gone and I am sure the crows feet have really softened .</li>
            <li> and I only have good things to say.</li>
            <li> So almost 4 months of use, not bad.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 years old and thankfully have pretty good skin.</li>
            <li> It is not a bad product though.</li>
            <li> So I checked out the reviews for OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel, and after reading so many positive reviews I ordered OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel.</li>
            <li> After I apply it, I feel a slight cool feeling under my eyes but in my opinion it&#x27;s kind of a nice, relaxing, invigorating feeling.</li>
            <li> Very cooling which is super nice esp with hot weather coming up.</li>
            <li> I used this product religiously day and night for two months because I wanted to be fair and give it an adequate amount of time to see results.</li>
            <li> will continue to use oz products , the eye gel feels so lovely and soft and dries very quickly .&lt;br /&gt;Thanks oz</li>
            <li> I use it with a brightner cream to give that area more glow but other than that I am really satisfied :)</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and does seem to work pretty well</li>
            <li> Takes only a minute to soak in, make up goes on very smooth over the top, skin feels firmer.</li>
            <li> My friend let me try this for a few days and loved the results!</li>
            <li> I wish I was as happy as the other reviewers I read.</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to receive this product because I love to try new things.</li>
            <li> So happy to have found OZ Naturals and am excited to try the many other products which the company offers!</li>
            <li> Immediate tightening, absorbs quick, &amp;amp; I love the new pump tube!</li>
            <li> Like the coolness when first applied, haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my bags or fine lines</li>
            <li> Do read the ingredient list and note that it&#x27;s seriously great and has a lot of active ingredients from beginning to end and not the junk you seen in a lot of brands.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I finish with the Super youth cream.</li>
            <li> too quickly:  </li>
            <li> I have been using Super Youth Eye Gel for a month now.</li>
            <li> Once you put it on your skin, it quickly absorbs with no greasy feel.</li>
            <li> When you use OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel,  you&#x27;re getting vegan, cruelty-free, paraben-free, sulfate-free, mineral oil-free, lanolin-free, gluten-free, and GMO-free anti-aging goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and thoroughly into your skin.  </li>
            <li> This is why OZ Naturals has created Super Youth Eye Gel.</li>
            <li> But lastly the next best factor about this product is the price.</li>
            <li> Lightweight gel like that absorbs quickly without leaving your skin sticky.</li>
            <li> In doing so, I hv managed to find my own fountain of youth with fabulous products such as OZ Naturals Super Eye Gel.  </li>
            <li> The OZ company quickly arranged for the Amazon codes</li>
            <li> /&gt;First I apply the Super Youth Eye Gel, then in the morning I apply the OZ Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li> one of them being the Super Youth Eye Gel.  </li>
            <li> This product helps tremendously.  </li>
            <li> Having used Super Youth Eye Gel for well over a year, I can attest to its&#x27; effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I received my Super Youth Eye Gel, took a picture of my eye,  forehead area, and the place between my eyes.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of a really powerful, all natural and almost all organic line, but from the day I started using these products</li>
            <li> The formula is super absorbent and leaves no greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel, OZ Nat Hyaluronic Acid Serum, and OZ Nat Super Youth Retinol Moisturizer (daytime or night time).  </li>
            <li> I wanted to give this gel an adequate amount of time to see if it worked and thought I could since they give a 100% guarantee.  </li>
            <li> I checked after about 10 minutes and it did absorb, my eyes felt super plumped, moisturized and firmed.</li>
            <li> Suppose to see visible results quickly.  </li>
            <li> Then as I was searching on Amazon, and reading reviews, I read in a review for another product about OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel.</li>
            <li> I like the look, smell and feel of it even better than the Christian Dior Capture products I have been using for more than 20 years, and</li>
            <li> So far so good- really like the product</li>
            <li> The gel is a silky, non fragrant formula that glides on the skin and soaks in quickly...</li>
            <li> This is super concentrated and</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> This eye cream absorbs into the skin quickly allowing makeup to be applied evenly and without streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was amazed at the quick results I received.  </li>
            <li> Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky so you can apply makeup over it.</li>
            <li> Plus if you don&#x27;t use the product quickly, it gets &amp;#34;gummy&amp;#34; and unusable unless you keep pumping to find the gel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quickly so it can be used under makeup.</li>
            <li> wash face with mild cleanser (or even just water), then apply the eye gel.</li>
            <li> It lifts and moisturizes quickly</li>
            <li> What I have noticed so far is that my eye area remains smooth most of the day</li>
            <li> And I have used many expensive department store brands and drug store brands alike looking for the one line that works best for me.    </li>
            <li> It has a cooling feel, is quickly penetrating</li>
            <li> I also use it during the day when I want a quick pick me up for my face.</li>
            <li> Arived quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild and moisture though.</li>
            <li> I was sent the Super Youth Eye Gel by Oz Naturals to review.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> or I’ve had mildly allergic reactions to them once applied.  </li>
            <li> The eye-cream did not cause any reaction, which is really important to me when picking any kind of cream, especially products I use on my face.</li>
            <li> not only did that but helped the skin all over my face, and for such a great price!</li>
            <li> my skin is super hydrated!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So lucky I came across it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels super moist on my eyes after using it.</li>
            <li> infact it is so mild that you can apply all over your face to keep it moisturized.</li>
            <li> I was lucky to get this product during promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> so it will not absorb as quickly as lotion or serum do.</li>
            <li> I find myself gravitate towards those types of products more and more recently.</li>
            <li> It is non greasy and absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li> I chose to buy this item because it is highly rated and many people seem to have benefited from OZ Naturals&#x27; eye gel.</li>
            <li> These products do work and I highly recommend trying this line of products, they work better than some</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with every product I have tried from OZ Naturals and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many high end products over the years.</li>
            <li> I never make recommendations but this line specially the eye gel is worth five stars</li>
            <li> .. love that it is natural!!</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was that it came in a HUGE box.</li>
            <li> I got the OZ Natural for free,  I&#x27;m Soo happy it works wonders,  I will definitely continue to use this product,  </li>
            <li> I am very interested in purchasing one.</li>
            <li> Frankly, just allowing my makeup to go on more smoothly and last longer is a huge deal for me.</li>
            <li> First of all let me state that I DID NOT receive a free sample of this product...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I do love this product, and wanted to share.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s very gentle on my skin!</li>
            <li> I was convinced the very first time I tried this eye gel:  </li>
            <li> First off, I got this item Free from Snagshout to write a review for this product.</li>
            <li> great eye moisturizer..have not seen dark circles fade</li>
            <li> My eye puffiness and dark circles are greatly improved.</li>
            <li> First time using this product and so far I love it!</li>
            <li> You can feel it firming around your eyes which is great but no difference with the dark circles</li>
            <li> This eye gel is pretty much one that every woman on the planet should have!!!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product and any other OZ Naturals product, they&#x27;re effective and perfect for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I also would just like people to know that this is a 100% true review, and I have received this product for free to make sure I left a 100% true review.</li>
            <li> I found that using this first and then a small amount of the OZ Ultra Ageless Eye Creme together are a perfect combination for more mature skin.  </li>
            <li> every day.&lt;br /&gt;All natural and smells good and leaves our skin fresh, healthy and younger looking.</li>
            <li> They are a fairly new line I believe, so I hope they don&#x27;t start raising their prices once they become more known and their popularity skyrockets.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite eye</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much per application and it goes on with a smooth, cool feeling.</li>
            <li> It provides great moisture and makes my eyes look less wrinkled.</li>
            <li> (The texture goes a long way) and find it works best when you use it 2x daily for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> its very cooling and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Only good things are it is not expensive and it does not irritate skin.</li>
            <li> The OZ Naturals eye gel is exactly that, a wonderful, delicate product that works</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and seems reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> My concealer completely covered my dark circles and my makeup went on flawlessly.</li>
            <li> So far, pretty nice.</li>
            <li> This product absorbs easy and fast into my skin.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> Which certainly helps with the fine lines and wrinkles on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Everything requires certain amount of time to be healed and that&#x27;s completely fine.</li>
            <li> Very effective in reducing puffiness and lighten dark circles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s right in the middle of moisturizing and tightening, does a great job of taking care of puffiness, doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34; into my eyes, is much kinder on eyeliner, lasts a good 10 hours (for me), doesn&#x27;t make my lids (upper or lower) crinkle, but leaves them very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> and while I don&#x27;t see huge significant changes, it is a decent cream.</li>
            <li> It really works!!</li>
            <li> I will definitely get more bottles when the first one is finished :-)</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle and love it!</li>
            <li> In fact, it has only caused my eyes to look more puffy and wrinkled since the gel just made my eyes feel like all of the moisture was being sucked out of them!</li>
            <li> Thanks, Oz!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> So what better to treat my problem WITH something natural?!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!</li>
            <li> So happy with eye product, my new go-to essential</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think to do them because the first product I had, the Retniol Moisturizer was so fabulous I just posted my five star review right away.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting such quick results so Iam thrilled.</li>
            <li> product really helps with puffiness and fine lines under my eyes</li>
            <li> Absolutely softened the appearance of fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have the beginnings of fine lines around my eyes and this product really does the trick with helping to minimize them.</li>
            <li> Most of the creams I have used do not have what I call &#x27;a cucumber action or feeling&#x27; to them, so this certainly is one of the most positive elements of the cream.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> great product, helps with wrinkles, dark circles and puffiness!</li>
            <li> I love how it has a nice faint cucumber scent to it, it is cooling and feels so refreshing when you put it on!</li>
            <li> A lovely gel that is definitely reducing the appearance of my fine lines and puffiness.  </li>
            <li> I have also been applying this on the fine lines above my top lip and noticed that there is improvement there too.</li>
            <li> Most definitely no changes in fine lines or anything else.</li>
            <li> Experience the most effective eye treatment designed to eliminate dark circles, puffiness and wrinkles!</li>
            <li> Nothing significant, but I&#x27;m seeing that my skin around the eyes is very soft and looks smooth.  </li>
            <li> It works great, doesn&#x27;t have a ugly smell, feels great.</li>
            <li> I primarily purchased this product to help with puffiness, and it really does appear to work.</li>
            <li> Great eye product if creams are too heavy for your skin.</li>
            <li> smells like real plants, goes on smooth, the consistency is watery.</li>
            <li> great product for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy and works great under concealer.</li>
            <li> I know this because I challenged Oz Naturals on this very thing, and they sent me the detailed information from the lab</li>
            <li> It has a gel consistency and seemed to light a texture to do much.  </li>
            <li> The Most Effective Anti Aging Eye Cream Available!]]I am a firm believer in OZNaturals</li>
            <li> But it does appear that my laugh lines are reduced.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feels refreshing when it&#x27;s on your skin, nearly like fresh cucumber.</li>
            <li> you only need one pump for both eyes as the dispenser gives you a nice size when you pump.</li>
            <li> product has a light scent of cucumber and is a clear, light gel.</li>
            <li> and I would say it&#x27;s probably worth the cost and worth a try.</li>
            <li> Moisture eyes and feels fresh</li>
            <li> I also love how it is made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I usually love OZ natural products, but this didnt work or change anything around my eyes at all.</li>
            <li> I am already seeing results with decreasing visibility of crow&#x27;s feet, smile lines, and brow lines.  </li>
            <li> this is worth the money because it delivers what it claims to do for your skin.</li>
            <li> so I would purchase these products complimentary.</li>
            <li> So far it works OK</li>
            <li> I am going to continue using KIEHLS products because they are far, far superior to this garbage.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I see a noticeable difference on my left eye.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased and will continue with these Oz Natural products.  </li>
            <li> I see clearly why it has such great reviews!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got a discount on my honest feed back of this, the above reflects my own thoughts, opinion, and use from my purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> worth buying.</li>
            <li> Love the all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It can also be used all over the face to diminish smile lines around the mouth and wrinkles on the forehead.</li>
            <li> Worth a try.</li>
            <li> :Just learned today that the sodium benzoate added as a preservative to many foods (including soft drinks and club soda) is carcinogenic.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, immediate-firming feel and depending on one&#x27;s skin, can be enough to moisturize as well.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an effective eye gel.</li>
            <li> love that this is an all natural formula</li>
            <li> and there are no results to make it worth it.</li>
            <li> rarely write reviews</li>
            <li> They gave OZ Natural&#x27;s eye gel a top grade, and as I said, they weren&#x27;t kidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The gel is very refreshing and goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It went on creamy, but absorbed well.</li>
            <li> I did not expect such a nice quality eye gel.  </li>
            <li> I used my Oz Natural products last night and they felt great.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> That alone is worth using this eye gel.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t contain chemicals considered hazardous or unhealthful on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep database</li>
            <li> and I know its been absorbed.    </li>
            <li> Well worth the money to</li>
            <li> This gel is easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> Love its vegan formula, 100% natural &amp; 75% organic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fresh on your face and is blended well.</li>
            <li> Love it so far.</li>
            <li> It is almost instantly absorbed when applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish it had a bit more moisture for a mature aging eye.  </li>
            <li> They are all wins for me thus far. :)</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s my favorite eye cream out of the 5 I have ordered already this year.</li>
            <li> I look fresh.</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about this eye gel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a complimentary product to facilitate this review.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s made to be used all over the eye area including the lids because I have sensitive eyes and do not appreciate the burn.</li>
            <li> I put it around my eyes and decided to also put it on a crease line I developed between my eyebrows from squinting over many years.</li>
            <li> OZ Naturals has not done this to me and in fact makes my skin look and feel so soft and healthy,</li>
            <li> If applied at night also you awake with a fresh look and no puffiness.  </li>
            <li> Also love it is a natural skin product.  </li>
            <li> not such an effective product</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural</li>
            <li> It is a nice addition to my daily skin care regime.</li>
            <li> Love all oz natural products</li>
            <li> I also use this on my smile lines and have noticed a difference on those as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to discover a product like this that actually works.</li>
            <li> That, in itself, is rare in my experience.  </li>
            <li> I am now in my early 20&#x27;s, I almost always get 9 hours of sleep, drink a lot of water, and eat somewhat healthy</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try all of the products that OZ Naturals offers :)</li>
            <li> My eyes look brighter and more alive when I use this.</li>
            <li> and that makes the investment well worth it.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh aloe smell but that&#x27;s it</li>
            <li> This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product from a customer’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> For eye area I use another product with peptides that has more of a cream consistency; however, I feel like the other product in combination with this gel gives me much better results.&lt;br /&gt;Between</li>
            <li> I have fewer fine lines, which was my main concern.</li>
            <li> Feel free to give this a try if you’ve used other products with those ingredients and have found them to be effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the other best selling eye cream to how it works before coming back to this one.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited too that I also ordered several more items from the skin care line.</li>
            <li> It makes you know the products you are putting on your face are safe and have followed every USA and FDA guideline so there are no hidden ingredients.</li>
            <li> First I apply the Super Youth Eye Gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually pretty lucky in the genetics department, but when it rains, it pours.</li>
            <li> The gel goes on easily and smoothly and soaks right in, and seems as good as any other general eye cream/moisturizer, but it just didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Ok this is probably my favorite purchase (and I&#x27;ve bought pretty much the entire line of OZ Naturals)</li>
            <li> I came across this product looking for some help with the dark circles and to get started on a good, anti-aging/wrinkle preventing regime that would not cause more acne or aggravate my sensitive</li>
            <li> It feels good under ur eyes, and since it&#x27;s stem cells you can also put it on other places you want to speed up the healing on your face.</li>
            <li> I ran out and after a couple of weeks, I could tell that the area around my eyes was looking a little drab, so I quickly bought another bottle and the area around my eyes are looking much better :).</li>
            <li> As far as eye creams go, it&#x27;s the best specific product I have ever tried and absolutely gentle and non-irritating in this very sensitive area.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as eye creams go, it&#x27;s the best specific product I have ever tried and absolutely gentle and non-irritating in this very sensitive area.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received my cream and noticed a change right away.  </li>
            <li> (well it&#x27;s my right eye</li>
            <li> My skin accepted it right away.  </li>
            <li> (A girl can hope, right?).</li>
            <li> I felt it working to reduce wrinkles right away.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> (A girl can hope, right?).</li>
            <li> so I just dabbed it on right away</li>
            <li> RIGHT</li>
            <li> Right now I am looking to see if they make a face cream.</li>
            <li> ( can&#x27;t find the right word here) on the eye cream.</li>
            <li> Now, I use it with another cream (any probably) because it is a gel and soaks right in</li>
            <li> Switched back to a tried and true line (I&#x27;ve learned my lesson) and my skin is already looking better after 1 night, and on the road to recovery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Allure, and in my opinion, they&#x27;re pretty honest with their claims.</li>
            <li> I also use this gel on the very top of my cleavage, another area which is sensitive to many of the other creams on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My makeup applies flawlessly over top of this eye cream, which is something that I&#x27;ve had an issue with in the past with other eye creams.</li>
            <li> Her skin is very sensitive, so I was a little worried that she would not like this product, but I am happy to report that she did not experience any irritation and the bags under her eyes are reduced significantly.</li>
            <li> I saw nothing special and found it very sticky.</li>
            <li> This worked great and really reduced the swelling and black circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have given it 4 stars as maybe it needs a little more time to work on my fine lines!</li>
            <li> Also my eyelids are firmer and less puffy and I like the fact that I can apply this gel to the top of my eye, most products are not recommended for the eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The gel is light and clear and absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li> recently received three OZ Naturals products for trial, and I&#x27;m pretty happy with all three, based on the criteria above: this Vitamin C serum, the Super Youth Eye Gel, and the Hyaluronic</li>
            <li> They do look slightly better since the skin is more taut but the color is really nearly the same.  </li>
            <li> great product, I have seen small changes in the suppleness around my eyes and have bee  using for 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li> What I can say is that the ingredients in this product are top notch with proven benefits, and they are potent enough that I have complete faith the product will continue to improve my skin over time.  </li>
            <li> However, Oz Natural is the best and the physical results are obvious.</li>
            <li> but I would probably try a different kind next time just to see if there&#x27;s something better.</li>
            <li> the gel always seems to feel cool and very soothing.</li>
            <li> I have tried some of the most expensive eye creams on the market for undereye circles and lines, and this is by far THE BEST.</li>
            <li> Immediately my eyes are puffier and wrinkles more apparent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for over a month, I noticed that my dark eyes started to brighten up, and it smells really good when I apply it under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> The dark circles were still there, but I wanted to give it a good test, so I kept using it.</li>
            <li> The container makes it easy to dispense the right amount, but if more comes out I just use it on my lips or other area that may need attention.</li>
            <li> I love the texture as it goes on very smoothly without feeling heavy.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and you can tell a difference with fine lines after only a week!</li>
            <li> Really GREAT product, really eliminates the dark circles and puffiness!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands of eye gels that claim to reduce dark circles and puffiness and I have found that for me I get the best overall results with OZNaturals products.</li>
            <li> when you first out it on you feel it working right away.</li>
            <li> Worth the price, helps me feel younger and more</li>
            <li> and I am so happy she is starting to use these products at a much younger age than I!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a non scented gel, it does not irritate my sensitive eyes, easy application.  </li>
            <li> So use lightly so that you don&#x27;t waste this amazing eye</li>
            <li> Have been trying out a few Eye gel recently &amp; find this to be excellent.  </li>
            <li> I finally found a product that works and is good for my skin, even the uber sensitive under eye area.</li>
            <li> I just got this, it came super fast.</li>
            <li> In this case, I&#x27;m happy to say I was wrong... and LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It sinks into the skin with no residue and is a lovely light gel.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t know how well it works until I&#x27;ve been able to use it a few more times.</li>
            <li> It feels really cooling on my eyes and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and concealer holds to it very well.</li>
            <li> not as good as previous reviews said.</li>
            <li> but it feels nice around my eyes esp during allergy season and dry winters.</li>
            <li> The eye area is a very sensitive and important part of our face, and we tend to reject it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and plan to purchase other items from their line.</li>
            <li> I have spent so much more on!  </li>
            <li> The seller describes it as &amp;#34; The Best Eye Gel&amp;#34; Spend a little more go to the drugstore and you will be much happier than if you waste your money on this product and the shipping costs.</li>
            <li> (Small and handy, easy to carry around even when travelling.)</li>
            <li> I can definitely see the fine lines around my eyes fading away!</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for 2 1/2 weeks, but can see some improvement in fine lines around my eyes and some puffiness!</li>
            <li> Definitely helped with fine lines!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping....</li>
            <li> The gel glides on very smoothly, however, I actually think it makes my eyes puffer.</li>
            <li> I like this eye gel very much.</li>
            <li> VERY FAST TRIED IT</li>
            <li> , I would not recommend these products although I am very much hoping they work for some people.</li>
            <li> Like this product very much.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it  brightened the areas around my eyes &amp; very much reduces the puffiness.</li>
            <li> I am very much into skin care.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product works great - helped with the dark rings under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> tried for the last 2 days, most lotions make my skin red and sore so far no irritation feels good</li>
            <li> The texture is very creamy and rich, the scent is very</li>
            <li> In the past month or so have notice more fine lines and expression lines forming!</li>
            <li> After spending way too much money, time and hope on products I found this eye gel by Oz Naturals and it Really works!!</li>
            <li> This is a good product for the night time as it might leave a little sticky film feeling, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend to use it before make up.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the most amazing eye cream I have ever used, It makes a visible difference</li>
            <li> but if you only need a moisturizing eye cream it&#x27;s a nice product for a decent price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very adamant about using only all natural/holistic and cruelty free skincare and makeup, and have tried many many different brands.</li>
            <li> This is a very good cream for your eyes and it is non irritating.</li>
            <li> I am surprised so many people rated it so high.</li>
            <li> Smooth, only takes a little and no sting or irritation experienced.</li>
            <li> Her appearance as a professional is of paramount importance; thus, she has an incentive to accurately review this product.</li>
            <li> oz bottle, which was dismaying to me at first.  </li>
            <li> Also love that I can use over the entire eye.</li>
            <li> This gel relieved puffiness, first.</li>
            <li> I look forward to what it will accomplish by the end of the first month.</li>
            <li> I believe I can get better results for same or lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;4.  </li>
            <li> this will really work for you!</li>
            <li> Not expensive, anyway.</li>
            <li> it actually lifts the skin under the eye area to give a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> I like that it is free of parabens and has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> My goal is to eliminate toxins so that I am as healthy as possible.</li>
            <li> The first 10 ingredients are all actives and are either kosher or organic or  a cosmeceutical.&lt;br /&gt;Top</li>
            <li> I first wash my face, apply Vit. C serum, moisturizer and then the eye gel.  </li>
            <li> and I used it on my whole face sometimes!</li>
            <li> At age 45, this is the first product that I can say</li>
            <li> It leaves the bags of the eyes smooth and soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I was contacted by this company asking if I would be willing to try three of their products and give a review.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s always a first time for everything as this is my first time writing a review</li>
            <li> Maybe I would have better results if I used it daily?</li>
            <li> I could feel and see a difference from the first use.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> It actually makes my bags under my eyes MORE noticeable.</li>
            <li> You can smell a hint of cucumber in it and it has some light deflecting action that minimizes the look of the bags.</li>
            <li> More power to the people for whom this actually works.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m light skinned, so the dark circles are really prominent on my face.</li>
            <li> She said that this gel is different to creams, and might work better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Slap this stuff on when I first wake up and then run from the mirror.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to use anything on my skin especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li> and, sure enough . . .</li>
            <li> It has now been exactly three months.</li>
            <li> and it looks exactly like the picture shown.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a big difference,it is ok</li>
            <li> and I love this product as it&#x27;s my 2nd time to order it</li>
            <li> This was the first time I ever bought Eye Gel</li>
            <li> I received this sample and gave it a try for the first time</li>
            <li> This is all within the first week of use.....</li>
            <li> First time trying it</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> At first use I could feel the skin tightening around my eyes.</li>
            <li> give an additional revue after my first month.</li>
            <li> This eye cream does absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li> This is the first eye gel that has reduced the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands over the years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily for more than 2 months now.</li>
            <li> You can even use it on your whole face!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it now for 2 years with my skin care regimen and it diminishes the wrinkles around my eyes and they appear younger looking and healthy.</li>
            <li> After 30 days of daily use, the darkness and bags are just as prominent as they were when I started.</li>
            <li> Works very well!  </li>
            <li> That said, it hasn&#x27;t magically filled in the natural hollows</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using this magic potion in a bottle, I walked by the mirror and had to do a double take.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> It seems to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> It really does not work!</li>
            <li> Love this eye gel I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> Seems to work as well as the much higher priced eye cream I had been using.  </li>
            <li> Then it says you can use on your forehead and other areas of the face that may be wrinkled or concerning, and it works outstandingly!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any big changes, so I will give it an OK.....</li>
            <li> This really works and I can see!</li>
            <li> I have been extremely pleased with my recent discovery of OZ Naturals products.  </li>
            <li> This puts in the moisture that really gives a fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> The only way to know for sure is to try it.</li>
            <li> I tried so many different products.</li>
            <li> have order twice I haven&#x27;t specific progress but feel that it is safe for my eyes.</li>
            <li> You will be amazed by the noticeable results and it only gets better with ongoing use.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says on the tin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am going to let my sister so the testing on this product, since her wrinkles are pretty</li>
            <li> This product used consistently continues to give results.</li>
            <li> but this really deserves one !</li>
            <li> The first time I put this on I knew I would be coming back for more.  </li>
            <li> As a licensed EstheticIan this us my first choice for my skin care</li>
            <li> I saw results the first day.  </li>
            <li> It is economical and a product that really works.  </li>
            <li> I did have to get used to the egg gel at first.  </li>
            <li> The area around my eyes appears brighter and more open.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that works.</li>
            <li> I love it because I can actually feel the tightness around the eyes.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price and the results are real!</li>
            <li> After the first of the year, I started noticing that my eyes were puffy when I got up in the morning.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t wake up with puffy eyes, and the skin around my eyes has smooth out considerably</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve tried this I felt that the overall appearance of my skin just seemed healthier and more dewy.</li>
            <li> and I actually felt like my makeup stayed on better all day.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue using this product :-)</li>
            <li> First time use</li>
            <li> I am on the second bottle of the oz naturals and I love that also.  </li>
            <li> Finished the whole bottle but see no difference at all!</li>
            <li> I only wish there were more in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Love It and have ordered it a second time.</li>
            <li> My first purchase was the combo of Vit C and HA serums.</li>
            <li> I was truly a skeptic after trying many different eye and face creams, even concealers.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll be using more of this product in the future.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It contains mostly botanical and organic ingredients that moisturize, soften, and protect the outer layer of the skin, such as aloe, glycerin and jojoba oil, plus ingredients like hyaluronic acid and vitamin E that penetrate it to support skin health and structure on a cellular level.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and continue to use - big difference!</li>
            <li> I feel safe using it on my upper lids, but the puffiness is not gone from under my eyes yet after 4 weeks</li>
            <li> because it doesn&#x27;t sit on top of the skin it actually soaks in.</li>
            <li> Item exactly as described.</li>
            <li> After one week, I was even able to see a change in here overall appearance.</li>
            <li> This is the only eye gel I&#x27;ve bought more than once.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;m really glad that Oz Naturals made the effort to demonstrate that the product actually is vegan</li>
            <li> Absolutely!</li>
            <li> I get red and rashy around the sides of my mouth and also on my cheeks from many brands.</li>
            <li> I most definitely see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more</li>
            <li> I found if I used my moisturizer FIRST then apply oz eye gel</li>
            <li> Also, smells very earthy and natural...almost like cucumbers!</li>
            <li> First, I wasn&#x27;t paid to write this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better results with simple Walmart brand/Equate brand items.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference, but all Dr. Oz products are great.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel!</li>
            <li> This works exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> , this eye gel is 97.4% natural and all of their products are cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I love my big brown eyes</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but this product had no sting, light texture, and I saw a difference in two weeks.</li>
            <li> Thanks OZ Naturals!</li>
            <li> I think that young looking skin, and eyes are important.  </li>
            <li> I love actually being about the recommend a brand!</li>
            <li> I was a bit dubious at first.  </li>
            <li> This was the first item that gave me any difficulties.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> put it on in the evening and on the first day, it made my eyes look funny.</li>
            <li> I really do recommend this!</li>
            <li> It is not greasy or runny so its not uncomfortable to apply and sleep overnight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbed into my skin very well.</li>
            <li> I have read we shouldn&#x27;t put heavy oils around the eyes so an eye gel is a good solution.</li>
            <li> It does feel good on-- not too heavy and seems to make the skin under my eyes brighter.</li>
            <li> But I can say that its moisturizing capability is very good, and does seem to make wrinkles around the eyes slightly less deep.</li>
            <li> It feels light and a little slippery going on and absorbs quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> I have less puffiness and a more even smooth eye area.</li>
            <li> I like OZ Naturals products because they are mostly organic, and they don&#x27;t have harsh chemicals, or strong fragrances that irritate my allergies.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> On a huge positive note, it doesn&#x27;t burn my highly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, especially when reading a good amount of reviews saying its great, but it really is.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t understand what the other reviewers are talking about..</li>
            <li> This brand is both effective and cost-friendly when compared to other drug store brands.</li>
            <li> The maker suggests that full results can be seen after 60 days of regular use, so I am hopeful for even more, but so far (after three weeks)</li>
            <li> I quickly remedied and was able to reapply foundation without the raccoon-eye look that some other gels produce.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I quickly remedied and was able to reapply foundation without the raccoon-eye look that some other gels produce.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love that it&#x27;s more natural and less chemical</li>
            <li> I barely had noticeable crow lines and this was creating fine lines under my eyes</li>
            <li> I tried this eye cream on with makeup and for once my fine lines weren&#x27;t apparent.</li>
            <li> Provides a perfect base for makeup application while delivering outstanding moisturizing capabilities.</li>
            <li> I do love that the product won&#x27;t be sticky or heavy on your eyes, and does leave a smooth touch after applying.</li>
            <li> The package is nice and secure with thick bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> Still I would recomend this to anyone who wants to look like they have gotten more sleep than they actually have.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and eyes, but this is soothing, non-irritating, and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> This works great around the eyes and usually there is more to spread around to other areas needing the attention of a moisturizing serum.</li>
            <li> I ended up using it on my whole face since it suggests the it is very gentle that  it can even be used all over your face....</li>
            <li> Almost $20 for a half oz of product that is mostly aloe!..</li>
            <li> And it is light enough to use right before eye liner.</li>
            <li> When a complete stranger gave me a complement yesterday, I knew I&#x27;d found the right product!  </li>
            <li> I have to admit I bought this product after reading all of your positive reviews</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any positive results at this time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, and I don&#x27;t see any positive effects at all.  </li>
            <li> and I m still seeing positive results.  </li>
            <li> There was already a perceptible positive difference.</li>
            <li> Positive notes:</li>
            <li> /&gt;One positive note I can say is ot smells.good</li>
            <li> However, I do not have to give a positive review</li>
            <li> like to keep my diet and skin treatments fairly natural if possible, and this company specialises in that.&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied with product for review, and have been using it daily for four weeks and would be happy to continue with it.</li>
            <li> It made it look better but not completely.  </li>
            <li> It is a very clumpy gel when you first pump it out</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for letting me try your eye gel!</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by the clearly scientific approach, the full disclosure of ingredients and the cruelty-free statement.  </li>
            <li> I give 4 stars because they are not completely gone, but are noticeably better.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know if this has made a difference with the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I used Obagi eye cream in the past and I never got the good results I have gotten with this eye gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two days now and can honestly see a difference already in my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I am prone to dark circles and puffiness under my eyes and this product is really effective.</li>
            <li> This eye gel treatment is not to be underestimated as it&#x27;s highly effective at reducing dark circles, puffiness and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> and it reduce the puffiness and faded the dark circles nicely.  </li>
            <li> It is truly effective in delivering results for dark circles and that sunken look under my eyes.</li>
            <li> This might be good for hyper pigmentation (can&#x27;t tell yet), but I can tell the skin around my eyes feels more dry than usual (which is what causes wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, smells pleasant and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very reasonably priced for such a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I have used many eye creams ( high end and low end brands) and nothing compares to this eye gel.refreshed after .</li>
            <li> Super excited about the long term results.</li>
            <li> Just starting using this eye gel; but love it so far!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60, have dry skin, and absolutely love the results I&#x27;m seeing.</li>
            <li> Only been using for a short time, but have found eye gel very refreshing</li>
            <li> However, because of the favorable reviews, the natural ingredients, and the price, I decided to give the Super Youth Eye Gel a try.  </li>
            <li> This gel made my eyes more dry.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the results will be yet but so far its great</li>
            <li> though I had dry areas on top of my eyelid</li>
            <li> I think using this product makes a difference and is easy to add to my daily skincare regimen.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or allergies, so my eyes adjusted to this gel quickly.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin  </li>
            <li> but since a dab will do it seems like it will last awhile) which I prefer as it allows me to easily carry it around throughout the day should the need arise.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply above and below the eye.</li>
            <li> : I prefer to dilute the gel&#x27;s action by mildly wetting the skin area before applying the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and although with 78-year-old eyelids, I still have my share of wrinkles and bags, using the Super Youth Eye Gel, they seem minimized and my lids feel soft.</li>
            <li> OZ Naturals offers a Super Youth Eye Gel.  </li>
            <li> While the difference is not dramatic I do see an improvement in the bags.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to notice a difference in my appearance, but it does not irritate or burn my eyes, so that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> Smells good, goes on light and helps reduce puffiness and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> but at a certain level yes, there is.</li>
            <li> I almost did not purchase this one because I was certain that it would not work, and I would be throwing money away yet again.</li>
            <li> I get puffiness from my allergies and this certainly does eliminate that for me.  </li>
            <li> I can certainly see it...</li>
            <li> This product absorbs easily and quickly, and it doesn&#x27;t make my eye makeup smudge as other eye products do.</li>
            <li> So here I am, I&#x27;m a REAL person and in no way obligated to write a positive review and will not gain a penny or additional products for my opinions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Live the results!!</li>
            <li> i have a weak eye, it has done amazingly great for the overhang, just ordered for my mother Day before yesterday</li>
            <li> I have tried several products in the past but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Also the gel absorbs very quickly which I really like as my regime sometimes consists of applying several products, and I always want to speed up the in between &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I much prefer Smart Fix Smart Eye for myself.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 30s and with fine lines start to develop around the under eyes.</li>
            <li> I am 41 and starting to see fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Regular use will help improve the appearance of fine wrinkles caused by age and damage from sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have also noticed the fine lines are smother and I am so tempted to put this in my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;Happy customer.</li>
            <li> The fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes are starting to diminish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for about a week, and my fine lines(not</li>
            <li> I have what is politely referred to as &amp;#34;mature skin&amp;#34; - I just call it &#x27;older!&#x27;</li>
            <li> I have even used very high end products and nothing work.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that his dark circles are clearing up!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, feels calming/cool when applied, but truly has little effect otherwise.  </li>
            <li> I am so excited to finally find something that really works ; )</li>
            <li> It started showing results with the first use, not like some other brands where they tell you it takes a couple of months or more before you see any real change.</li>
            <li> so it fills in the little crepey lines under my eyes, crow&#x27;s feet, and gives a nice, supple appearance to the eye area.</li>
            <li> A really gentle serum that definitely helps with reducing puffiness and filling out fine lines.  </li>
            <li> , this is not the first time a highly rated item was all BS.  </li>
            <li> Why  does all the manufactures of face serum, eye creams make them so expensive  for people like me to buy them, but this is a very good eye cream and you can believe I have tried just about everything that is out in the market place.  </li>
            <li> Within just a few days, I saw fine lines diminish and my eye areas was smooth and indeed, VERY youthful looking.</li>
            <li> I know its hard to find a good eye cream.</li>
            <li> do better with plain old NOW coconut oil for adding moisture to the eye area and reducing fine lines.</li>
            <li> Is only 2 weeks since I tried this gel its amazing after only one week everybody noted difference and gave me a complement ..</li>
            <li> It is great for early mornings after a late night at work.</li>
            <li> Thanks goodness</li>
            <li> I did not use it very often, because of this stinging sensation and some redness after application of gel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the gel consistency.</li>
            <li> No hydration whatsoever and is very gooey</li>
            <li> and I really had to make an effort to change that,</li>
            <li> It makes my eye lids feel very refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I feel it as soon as I apply and it really works well.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this - it&#x27;s very soothing -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very diligent about using hydrating eye creams.  </li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel.</li>
            <li> Very mall quantity and haven&#x27;t seen any difference,</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready ro</li>
            <li> I really do like this eye gel.</li>
            <li> Really works unlike anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have been using for three days and see very noticeable results.  </li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced it really works as people say it does, have to see???</li>
            <li> - It really didn&#x27;t do much</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this eye gel from Oz when I called recently to inquire about their products.</li>
            <li> and she really likes that.  </li>
            <li> i feel it much lighter and smoother.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all-natural product is designed to give you real results.</li>
            <li> Probably have sampled every brand at Whole Foods alone.</li>
            <li> It dries fast</li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t say if it works miracles however I really do like the gel.  </li>
            <li> so I was always looking for products that are paraben and sulfate free and as natural/organic as possible while still getting the results</li>
            <li> and it really has diminished them.  </li>
            <li> It smells like cucumber and has a very silky texture.  </li>
            <li> really does what it claims.  </li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> I adhere to a very well structured beauty routine.  </li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> As much as they say they received the product for an &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; review...</li>
            <li> and me too.&lt;br /&gt;These costs are not irritating to eyes moist</li>
            <li> It was as if it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Took almost 2 weeks to notice much of a difference, but my girlfriend noticed.</li>
            <li> approve of OZ Naturals&#x27; vegan philosophy and all in all this product has really worked for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often write reviews but Oz Naturals wants to know how the products work and if I am satisfy with</li>
            <li> Thanks for recommending it.</li>
            <li> I feel my face really puts these products to the test and know at my age one cannot expect miracles.</li>
            <li> I like this product lots, it does seem to help and it is very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know yet, ask me in about a month</li>
            <li> It really does work and does dramatically reduce the puffiness from lack of sleep or aging.</li>
            <li> this product really works on your eyes</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I have used 2 bottles of this and it has really helped reduce the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really see those movies anymore.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li> dries and soaks in to the skin fast and does not feel sticky.</li>
            <li> I really was hoping that this product would be what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> my puffy eyes really getting much better...tku</li>
            <li> Thanks oznaturals</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen it address much darkness, but I&#x27;ll post an update if I do.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s really working</li>
            <li> I expected more since I do like their products.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a gel and not a cream it wears very well under makeup and</li>
            <li> This stuff really works and is gentle</li>
            <li> I really like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> and I really do like it.</li>
            <li> bottle is pump-styled, so it&#x27;s very convenient and hygienic (no messes or dipping your fingers into the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been ace my bags have gone and skin is so much firmer .</li>
            <li> When applied to the eye area, it has a very soothing feel and does soften the crows feet I have around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely working on my puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> I have really noticed a difference in my under eye circles.</li>
            <li> If you use too much it can leave a sticky residue, so apply sparingly to avoid that</li>
            <li> It really has not done anything for my bags and that is why I bought it</li>
            <li> but it seemed to go so fast.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any real difference with lines or bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it for it to work.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye cream/gel.  </li>
            <li> Although you don&#x27;t need much for your eyes</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for it much..</li>
            <li> I had many deep wrinkles from crying so many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Seems to work on bags under the eyes, and not so much for darkness.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> It really really works.</li>
            <li> This is not a cover-up or light diffusing  topical.</li>
            <li> and it does it fast.</li>
            <li> Very refreshin and clears the eye ares</li>
            <li> Its very sticky and not seeing the intended results.  </li>
            <li> I have this product as a gift, I really like the style</li>
            <li> and it really helps so</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would do much.</li>
            <li> now I don&#x27;t see much difference</li>
            <li> This tells me real changes are happening in my skin</li>
            <li> Seems to really work.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> I apply it on my eyes, upper and lower, my mouth area and smooth any leftover into my face.</li>
            <li> It is not really a cream; it&#x27;s more of a gel.  </li>
            <li> It was also sticky and did not work with my concealer very well.  </li>
            <li> gel like I said is very lightweight.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t like  this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a year now and really like it.</li>
            <li> Some will still need to use retinal along with this product, but using retinal alone will not deliver as much as using it in conjunction with this product.  </li>
            <li> I really like the silky texture of this eye gel.</li>
            <li> Really liking this product.  </li>
            <li> I use this for my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> I have to smooth regular moisturizer over it to get rid of the stickiness.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to leave a real review for anyone looking to purchase.</li>
            <li> They are ok, not very foaming</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has reduced puffiness around my eyes, and the area feels much smoother.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen much improvement</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> and I really like this one.</li>
            <li> I used the whole thing and at the end of it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it really does much, but it seems to moisturize.</li>
            <li> Not irritating at all.</li>
            <li> I used it on my whole face until I&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I see much difference in that after using this gel.</li>
            <li> So - so, don&#x27;t really see a difference in my 60 yr.</li>
            <li> The eye gel did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> Just gone through the whole bottle....</li>
            <li> It really works like advertised.</li>
            <li> therefore I could see how much of the product was in there.</li>
            <li> The bottle aside, the product itself really works.</li>
            <li> and I can see much improvements.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like the dispenser bottle.</li>
            <li> You can regulate quite well how much you want.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> and I really do like it.  </li>
            <li> so I was very disapointed with that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32, so wrinkles aren&#x27;t as much of a concern.</li>
            <li> Sadly I really didn&#x27;t notice anything after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s cost is very comprehensive...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I use it on my whole face.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely recommend this Eye Gel....</li>
            <li> OZ Naturals products are the real thing.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much smoother.</li>
            <li> but it has not been very effictive after almost 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It also says in the bottle that you can use it on your whole face</li>
            <li> but I really like it.  </li>
            <li> as I don&#x27;t feele there is a real difference on me.</li>
            <li> It really helped all my areas.</li>
            <li> and then so much makeup remover and elbow grease to get it off.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
            <li> especially using this Peptide on the hollows of my cheeks where light expression lines are appearing and around my mouth.  </li>
            <li> This eye gel works very well</li>
            <li> (Btw, I also got a Sisley Gentle Face and Neck Exfoliating brush to use with the cleanser</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t believe it worked that fast.</li>
            <li> You really gotta try to believe it.</li>
            <li> This may be the only time I review a beauty product which my wife (31 yrs old) orders for herself, but there&#x27;s a good reason for my review - because I actually noticed a real difference from a beauty product she had</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and will continue to use this product!  </li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel.</li>
            <li> she is all ready using arrived this morning,  </li>
            <li> and it truly really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really notice any reduction in puffiness</li>
            <li> Not of much help in removing the bags under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> After I put on this eye cream, my skin feel very soothed and cooling....</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It really brightens my eyes.</li>
            <li> I expected more.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m just expecting too much</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really like gold.</li>
            <li> As I do not have much  puffiness in the eyes</li>
            <li> However, been using it about 2-3 weeks and don&#x27;t really see all that change.</li>
            <li> and I am very picky</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> very nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, and I feel that it is softening the lines</li>
            <li> Really can&#x27;t see the difference</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that much improvement.</li>
            <li> The pump always dispenses too much.</li>
            <li> how well I eat or how much I sleep.</li>
            <li> This really works to reduce puffiness around your eyes.  </li>
            <li> ;, this product really is vegan.  </li>
            <li> like it&#x27;s really working.</li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t rate that part of the product.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely amazed at what it did.</li>
            <li> I have never seen anything work that fast.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I feel this eye gel is fabulous and looking forward in purchasing it next week</li>
            <li> I dont really like the smell &amp;</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> This one really works to tighten the skin.</li>
            <li> You really should try this one</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it did a whole lot of difference to my eye area just yet.</li>
            <li> This really is the &amp;#34;Best</li>
            <li> and I really think it has made a difference with the skin around my eye.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t looking much.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel.  </li>
            <li> I really like your eye gel.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear too much undereye make up</li>
            <li> I really like the results I get from the Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li> It is very cooling and soothing when you use it.  </li>
            <li> I use the whole range of Oz products.  </li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t notice much difference</li>
            <li> Fast forward 2.5 months.</li>
            <li> I really like how gentle and soothing it is around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> It has also really helped with the puffiness in my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I really really like them all.</li>
            <li> Has done absolutely nothing to reduce swelling under the eye.  </li>
            <li> I am noticing a difference but not as much as i had hoped</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to all my friends and family!</li>
            <li> USed whole container and no results</li>
            <li> It really takes away puffiness and makes my eyes appear brighter and tighter.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of the effect, like getting off my eye bags.</li>
            <li> I guess I can&#x27;t ask too much...</li>
            <li> I noticed a big change in the area under my eyes within a week - skin smooth and</li>
            <li> It seems to be moisturizing really well.</li>
            <li> Very soothing eye gel - don&#x27;t see much change in wrinkles or reduced puffiness</li>
            <li> However, what I really don&#x27;t like about it is that it dries to a sticky finish -</li>
            <li> but I found it really helped with my under eye issues.</li>
            <li> I also really like the fact that their products are made in the USA</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> This product really seemed to keep the puffiness at bay.</li>
            <li> THANKS its a life saver, HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> Really &amp;#34;wakes up&amp;#34; my eyes in the morning.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> It does not seem to do much for me, time will tell, but I have been using for 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li> Either way, it does dissipate very quickly, so it&#x27;s really a non issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I</li>
            <li> This really does make a difference in the puffiness...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for it much</li>
            <li> much gel does it take?</li>
            <li> I used it morning and night until the whole bottle was gone.</li>
            <li> So much so that neither I or my husband could tell a difference.</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t like the gel texture.</li>
            <li> and I notice I am much brighter around the eyes and lines</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the products for a month with my Clarisonic and really do see that my skin has brightened.  </li>
            <li> When I run out is when I really know.  </li>
            <li> It really works efficiently.</li>
            <li> It is for real.</li>
            <li> Another important thing is you should take enough sleep so see noticeable change in your eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful pumping it out as it will squirt out much more than you need.  </li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel.</li>
            <li> You do not need much at all.</li>
            <li> I just gently patted the gel around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I do not notice any scent and it feels gentle.</li>
            <li> It is a pump dispenser, which I really like.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month straight now</li>
            <li> - so much so that I have put this product on my monthly subscription list</li>
            <li> Really saw no difference after use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very slimy and very wet-looking.</li>
            <li> I got the same results from every eye cream I&#x27;ve used (many of which are cheaper by far)...</li>
            <li> It feels good, but hasn&#x27;t helped my dark circles at all - not sure if anything will though :)</li>
            <li> I love that it contains herbal instead of chemical ingredients especially since it is applied so near to my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am on my third bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Helps with puffy eyes better than anything I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I imbibe a fair amount of caffeine, have a lot of stress and don&#x27;t get nearly enough sleep, so I have some pretty defined dark circles.</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and have tried many different brands of eye cream.  </li>
            <li> As with any Oz Natural product, you will begin seeing results within the first week with consistent use.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural makes a far better eye gel for the same price.</li>
            <li> I like it so far and will continue using, would love to see it in a larger size though.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time but you will love it so much that like me, you get super nervous when it gets low and reorder fast.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this and was EXTREMELY pleased with it being so natural!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this cream as read all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> There are several other organic plant ingredients: periwinkle, licorice, eye bright, reishi, frankincense and gotu kola which anyone can research on-line to see what benefits they provide.</li>
            <li> : when you apply the product around your eyes, you notice the area extremely hydrated and puffed up in a good way instantly.</li>
            <li> One co-worker was so excited she went home that very night and ordered several items from the OZ Naturals skin care line.</li>
            <li> This product turned the very fine lines under my eyes black.</li>
            <li> guess I&#x27;ve been spoiled for so many years with my other (eye) moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The eye gel has a great texture, and little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I do not think it does anything other than make more wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> For me, it is the ONLY product that successfully obliterated a wrinkle on my upper left eyelid--GONE!  </li>
            <li> My eyes are definitely brighter and lines are significantly diminished.  </li>
            <li> The eye gel works on me and I have tried many other eye products.</li>
            <li> Like so many other body products that claim to be the miracle cure, this like all the others did not fulfill my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Also interesting that those reviews are all on the same day and some say the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes looked more supple and there was a major difference in the texture and overall appearance.  </li>
            <li> It does not irritate my eyes like so many other eye creams.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t irritated my eyes at all like so many other eye treatments.</li>
            <li> you will love it and please try the other products....</li>
            <li> I have three of their products and each is in a unique container with a different colored label.</li>
            <li> It did not work any better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t my favorite for forehead or other areas like it suggests on the label-</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t see much more results that I did from other eye creams/gels</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes appears firmer and my crows feet have diminished significantly after only one week of use!</li>
            <li> I have paid a lot more for other products that don&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li> I am familiar with the effects of hyaluronic acid, which is included in two facial skin care products I have used.</li>
            <li> &amp; I have used religiously night &amp; morning &amp; have seen a significant improvement in my eye condition .</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky AT ALL which I had the most problem with a lot of other eye gel products.</li>
            <li> Its much cheaper than many other high end products.</li>
            <li> I apply this eye gel in the mornings and at night after I clean my face with a facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but after using for just a few days I noticed how much brighter my eyes looked!</li>
            <li> This gel soaks into the skin which I love too because I live in very dry climate and need all the moisture I can get!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This does seem to be as effective so far as what I have previously used and my skin feels softer and seems to be helping.  </li>
            <li> At first the consistency of the gel felt strange but I quickly got used to it.</li>
            <li> While it seems to have a gel consistency, it feels thick and doesn&#x27;t smooth on easily.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and is very cost-effective compared to similar products, in other words: it is worth the price!</li>
            <li> Will continue to purchase it as long as it&#x27;s available.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin around my eyes and this did not sting when I applied it the first time.</li>
            <li> After 3 days use, I noticed that the dark circles under my eyes looked better.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still searching for something that will improve my dark circles more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my skin now and my eye puffiness and dark circles are literally gone.</li>
            <li> This anti-aging eye gel is packed with potent ingredients that deliver visible results, including Haloxyl for dark circles, Matrixyl Synthe&#x27;6 to help wrinkles, skin-protecting Apple Stem Cells, Caffeine to reduce puffiness and Hyaluronic Acid to attract moisture and plump up</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have dark circles any more.</li>
            <li> My eyes have always had dark circles and I can already see them looking better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would say I need to use it longer to be able to tell 100% if this product will remove my dark circles.</li>
            <li> Also my make up seems to hide my dark circles better.  </li>
            <li> While my dark circles are mostly caused by allergies, I have found that the gel works well.</li>
            <li> feels cool then dries instantly.  </li>
            <li> Wow exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> After a full month, the puffiness was further reduced.</li>
            <li> For me this product worked ok on the puffiness side but not at all for dark circles.</li>
            <li> Usually make up product comes with some kind of protecting materials, but not this one.</li>
            <li> Removes dark circles and love this.</li>
            <li> As usual, my review reflects my own views and experience with the product and was in no way influenced by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> And they are only puffy now if I have not gotten a full nights sleep, unlike before I started using it they were puffy regardless.</li>
            <li> The texture is similar to aloe vera and the smell is decidedly plant like, which is not a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> It has a very light, non-oily texture but penetrates deeply and yields refresh look next morning.</li>
            <li> My eyes look healthy, less wrinkles under eyes and it glides on so nice that you use very little.</li>
            <li> i love other OZ naturals, but am not a fan of this one!</li>
            <li> I have lived in very sunny places for over 30 years which translates to many little wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> it goes quickly can&#x27;t live with out it!</li>
            <li> Definitely a new product in my beauty regimen!</li>
            <li> Also the active ingredients are exactly those I have so far found most effective:  hyaluronic acid, peptide complex, vitamin E and some plant-based extracts.  </li>
            <li> I actually look forward to using it because I know that the most delicate area of my face is being properly moisturized and protected by pure and effective ingredients.</li>
            <li> Plant stem cells and Matrixyl 3000 were new to me but sounded promising.  </li>
            <li> So far it goes on easy &amp; dry&#x27;s fast.</li>
            <li> I have used this three times, each time hoping it will be better, and each time I use this the same gross stickiness happens.</li>
            <li> Gonna have to switch back to a cream (as opposed to a gel) or switch back and forth to be able to get the hydration this area needs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent size for an eye product</li>
            <li> OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel can be used multiple times per day and works it well on all skin types.</li>
            <li> and I have enough left from just one pump to apply to either my neck or the top of both hands.</li>
            <li> The serum definitely absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li> I recently received Oz Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel in order to sample the product for my review.  </li>
            <li> I had sagging skin under my eyes that made me look much older.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I made the purchase through Amazon, so I know there won&#x27;t be an issue with getting my money back.</li>
            <li> I am realistic and realize that deeper results are going to take time.  </li>
            <li> I feel this product line is top quality, and really appreciate how the company has taken such care to use natural and organic ingredients and to use them in concentrations that will actually give real results.</li>
            <li> which was the  main reason i got the product for.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that I can prevent some of the signs of aging as I get older.  </li>
            <li> I have used OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel for several weeks now without any adverse reactions.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly and it feels so light and delicate.  </li>
            <li> I found OZ Naturals while doing research on all the different Natural Products available on the market.</li>
            <li> Thankfully my skin around my eyes is back to normal after three full days.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product so if you are looking for an alternative to questionable store eye creams this would be a great option.</li>
            <li> I mainly bought this eye gel because I was looking for something to help reduce my under eye circles.</li>
            <li> But the most recent batch feels very different on my skin.</li>
            <li> Finally, products that actually WORK and that benefit your skin.... :)</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and sinks into the skin fast.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product not only for dark circles and wrinkles around the eyes</li>
            <li> I have some light wrinkles on my forehead and between my eyes plus some loose skin in the jowl area.</li>
            <li> After applying Jan Marini Eye Intervention eye cream, I dab OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel under my bottom lashes where &amp;#34;luggage&amp;#34; would normally settle in, above the brow line and where crows feet SHOULD be, but, are not.  </li>
            <li> My skin feel tight and my circles have lightened :-)</li>
            <li> I came across this and it was highly rated</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this eye cooling gel.</li>
            <li> The eye gel has high quality ingredients to moisturize and soften the lines around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> Affordable for high quality ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Will recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product because I have seen change under my eye a day after I used it.  </li>
            <li> This has a drugstore price with a high end cosmetic store result.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly, a must have product.</li>
            <li> He has a high stress job and it tells.  </li>
            <li> note no changes had high hopes</li>
            <li> I have high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Like all oz products, this gel is of high quality</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> High quality product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend OZ Naturals.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this eye gel.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of products to try and get rid of the bags under my eyes, but this is the first product to actually make a positive difference.  </li>
            <li> The third time I ordered this it came in a new container that forces you to squirt out about ten times more gel than needed.</li>
            <li> the few weeks that I have used it, my eyes look more awake and my skin looks more supple and my crows feet seem to be a bit less pronounced as well.</li>
            <li> You can look at some of the other reviews to read what each ingredient actually does, but this gel is effective at combating lines &amp; wrinkles around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Because of the peptides I am experimenting with putting this product on the hollow areas of the cheek to address the fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and certain ingredients will cause me to break out or develop a rash.</li>
            <li> I love OZ Eye Cream for Dark Circles!</li>
            <li> I love that they are basically unisex and are completely natural with dermatological-grade active ingredients.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first few nights she started to see some improvement on the fine line and puffiness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The most important thing, this eye cream works as well as other much more expensive creams.</li>
            <li> This stuff really helps your eye not only feel like there not tired but look like there not tired.</li>
            <li> Well I had never found an eye cream yet that seemed to be making any difference as far as not just maintaining my skin, but having real anti-aging (meaning wrinkles</li>
            <li> The OZ Naturals cream was gentle (I have sensitive skin) and there was never any stinging when applying.</li>
            <li> With so many glowing reviews, I expected this eye gel to at least be somewhat worthwhile.  </li>
            <li> Plus, a lot of the reviews are just &amp;#34;over the top&amp;#34; bizarre - not real people.</li>
            <li> My eyes are sensitive - and my allergies are kicking up - and this eye gel has been gentle and works.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> thanks for the introduction offer, I have seen a difference from dark to light in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product because of the great ingredient list, but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice any marked improvement-unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> , it goes on like a light weight gel and sinks in.</li>
            <li> I arranged for this product to be tried by a professional model, who is very well-acquainated with these types of products.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin type, and this eye gel really works and not giving me rash or itch feeling.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is moist and much clearer and feels soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is very soothing when applied and does not irritate the sensitive skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> but so far I really like it.  </li>
            <li> so do not use too much or your under eye area will become sensitive.</li>
            <li> I am almost 50 years old but you would never know it thanks to you guys.</li>
            <li> I always wondered about these dispensers and just how much product was in them and now you can see exactly how much is left.</li>
            <li> I have been using several different Oz Natural products for a while now and absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li> after seeing no results (if not negative results...)</li>
            <li> It is not like a normal eye area cream.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive to most products, maybe be careful about putting it too close to your eye or near the waterline.</li>
            <li> I plan on writing another review in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> Least effective of all the creams I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I saw no improvement in my skin and the once-pleasant cooling sensation soon became a stinging sensation on my normal skin.&lt;br /&gt;Rating: 1</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles most of my life, I am 52 years young.</li>
            <li> I love it because I have a few lines under my eyes that look deeper with makeup</li>
            <li> It is one of the only products I thought I really saw a difference the first time using it.  </li>
            <li> I have no complaint about this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it has such good reviews.  </li>
            <li> A lot of eye gels stay on top of the skin making eye makeup messy throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Hopefully within a few weeks, I will see even more progress.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, but for those who are looking for more moisture, this might not fit the bill.</li>
            <li> My issue is there isn&#x27;t enough of it in the bottle to make the expense worth it.  </li>
            <li> Love this item, works well and last a long time.</li>
            <li> , my skin is much more firm.</li>
            <li> Good for my puffy, tired eyes.</li>
            <li> You feel it penetrating and lifting, but what good does that do when it dries out the area and makes your wrinkles look WORSE?</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I see a dramatic result but sure is worth buying!</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I live in a harsh winter climate and need to use a moisturizing eye product on top of this.</li>
            <li> I love that you can use it anywhere else on your face - so if I use a bit too much I just smooth it in other areas of my face (usually around the eye area).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the only eye treatment my sensitive skin has tolerated and that has made a visible difference so quickly.</li>
            <li> Not real dramatic . . .</li>
            <li> the three, the eye gel might my least favorite, but only because I prefer a rich emollient eye cream</li>
            <li> For me, it seems a little sticky and I don&#x27;t notice a real improvement in the hydration of my eyes or reduction in the fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I am a regular customer who researched the ingredients, read the reviews, and decided to try it after purchasing it myself right here on amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> If I wash my face, the wrinkles are right back where they were.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give this a three week trial by using it under just my left eye to see if there would be a difference from my right eye.</li>
            <li> try to put this on under your make-up right away, especially if you are putting on eye shadow.  </li>
            <li> I only applied the product around my right eye and surrounding area.</li>
            <li> I was soooo hopeful to get this product especially after reading all the positive reviews!  </li>
            <li> Plant stem cells sounds like something controversial in fact is simply an extract of plant stems and is not the other thing you might think.</li>
            <li> I love the OZ products because they are natural with all of their active ingredients 100 natural and 75% organic.</li>
            <li> so far great product i can say among all other product !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Having used some of the most luxurious and expensive eye gels in the world…To my amazement this product which is actually &amp;#34;Eye Gel&amp;#34; not &amp;#34;Eye Cream&amp;#34; as described is definitely one of the best I have EVER used….It targets multiple issues, Dark circles, Puffiness, Bags, Crows feet, Fine lines and gives an extra feature...</li>
            <li> I had hoped that, at the very least, it would be a good organic moisturizer for that sensitive eye area.  </li>
            <li> They are my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; brand.</li>
            <li> Patented peptide helps boost new collagen</li>
            <li> My neighbor&#x27;s daughter is a trainee beautician and often introduces me to new ideas.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this - I have bought twice</li>
            <li> This item came without any type of plastic cover to indicate that it is new.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try new products for my aging acne skin.</li>
            <li> I now run out and then have to wait for a new delivery.</li>
            <li> even so, it doesn&#x27;t live up to the miraculous claims that it solves everything.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new eye cream.</li>
            <li> But, the bags appeared and aging gracefully without baggie eyes became my new goal.</li>
            <li> This gel is a new fave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say I cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li> On to something new.</li>
            <li> The pump bottle is elegant, simple and delivers a small spot of cream the right size for each eye.</li>
            <li> i can go without makeup, it works for fine lines, puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li> fine lines and dark circles did not disappear or fade.</li>
            <li> I started noticing dark circles, puffy-crapey skin and fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting immediate response to the fine lines, but the puffiness and dark circles should have been rapid, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> You can leave it on overnight to have healthy looking eyes in the morning or when you have puffy eyes from crying or allergies, it has been working in all of those situations so far for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel Is A Highly Potent Anti Aging Gel That Will Give You Dramatic Results</li>
            <li> I initially used a whole pump for both of my eyes and that was way too much.</li>
            <li> researched for a few months before I was able to find all the natural info I listed.  </li>
            <li> ; this gel dries quickly and feels dry.</li>
            <li> so I am all over anything that will keep my skin soft and supple for more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> I am a 31 year old woman with two kids, and one more on the way in a few months.</li>
            <li> The bottle is smaller than I expected, but the packaging is top notch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really seeing a difference, but I do like the natural ingredients and the smooth, absorbent texture.</li>
            <li> I would defnitly love to see photos of your little ones in there outift!</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, and I&#x27;ve been able to use their skin care line with zero negative effects, and lots of positive ones.</li>
            <li> It makes the puffiness go down soon after applying and fine lines reduced.</li>
            <li> Together they give my face a very soft feel.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and never used eye gel before.  </li>

            <li> I have very sensitive eye area</li>
            <li> Have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and this works well for me.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount applied under each eye one or two times a day, and it really does make things look a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin around my eyes, so I&#x27;m always picky about what products I will use for my under eye area.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cause any irritation and I am usually very sensitive to eye products.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> I thought this was only for around the eyes use, but I tried it on two wrinkles on my forehead and right after I was surprised that I couldn&#x27;t notice them anymore.  </li>
            <li> I have used this eye gel for the past 3 months and find it very effective in reducing the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> love this eye gel but the bottle is too small -goes</li>
            <li> MY EYES LOOK YOUNG AGAIN!</li>
            <li> all of the OZ ingredients are either organic or natural ingredients, no chemicals!</li>
            <li> Used it the first time after a short night of 5 1/2 hours sleep.  </li>
            <li> and it was all natural!</li>
            <li> It is supposed to be ultra hydrating but does the exact opposite for me.</li>
            <li> My eyes are barely open and so swollen, they remind me of Sylvester Stalone&#x27;s after his first fight in, Rocky.  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> First, it goes on like a gel substance that instantly liquefies with skin contact.  </li>
            <li> the dark circles are fading away, it has a&lt;br /&gt;very light smell of cucumber.</li>
            <li> Still &amp;#34;playing&amp;#34; with it but seems to have smoothed out some of the fine lines and my under eye appears less sunken.</li>
            <li> The bags under my eyes look 10x better after just a few uses!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I wanted to use it as a serum for my entire face.</li>
            <li> This is from many years in the sun ( not in the past 30 years) without sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I feel like I can&#x27;t wake up enough to function, but this gel really helps me wake up!</li>
            <li> Not heavy at all!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny when I am applying this I can actually hear myself going</li>
            <li> First eye cream I&#x27;ve ever bought that has actual results.</li>
            <li> (I do still have a 13 month old who refuses to sleep!)</li>
            <li> and I have noticed less fine lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not uncomfortable at all and it only lasts a minute or so.</li>
            <li> I have no skin rashes which I usually get from most eye creams.</li>
            <li> I  have been using another Peptide Product in this area and will be interested in seeing if I get the same results.  </li>
            <li> Completely gone!</li>
            <li> I have bags under my eyes and dark circles which are primarily hereditary.  </li>
            <li> far I like it!</li>
            <li> I feel like other eye creams just sit on top of the skin and don&#x27;t actually sink in.</li>
            <li> This actually worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Feels like complete regeneration of the under eye area!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> My fine lines and wrinkles are much less visible.  </li>
            <li> It does tighten and lift and that&#x27;s what I needed most, and it stays all day unless you are in the extreme outside heat and perspire, then re apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cathy&lt;br /&gt;Las Vegas, NV</li>
            <li> The same it really works!</li>
            <li> This gel can be applied several times a day, so I used it first thing in the morning after washing my face and at night after cleansing, in combination with a serum (also by OZ Naturals) and topped by a night</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it and update if there are any improvements, but so far, nothing!</li>
            <li> I doubt these results are psychological or a placebo effect, the results are real!</li>
            <li> This eye gel works fantastic to reduce puffiness and dark circles.  </li>
            <li> The first few nights I used it it did sort of sting, not bad, but I could tell I was a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li> It was a little to strong to use every day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I found this eye gel after trying all those top brand, expensive eye creams !!</li>
            <li> I also travel a lot and take this product with me on the planes to put it around my eyes so they look bright and lively - not sunken and dark, which was the case prior to using the product flying.</li>
            <li> This ingredients here are healthy, natural things like organic Licorice, and Reishi mixed with cutting edge effective ingredients like peptides, Matrixyl 3000, and Hyalauronic Acid and Plant Stem Cells.</li>
            <li> I jump at the chance to try any of this companies new products because every one has been a winner so far.</li>
            <li> but I must honestly admit that I see absolutely no difference in the dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a product I&#x27;ve recommended to others and never a complaint, only thanks.</li>
            <li> I most definitely recommend this product to anyone with dark circle or puffiness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products for my dark circles, love this one.</li>
            <li> so I will always have a shadow, but it is so much better without the dark blue discoloration.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount and the pump dispenses it nicely.  </li>
            <li> For highly sensitive skin - I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I just turned 50 years old and I have always had very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product really does seem to calm down the area below my eyes--helps with pugffiness and with darkening.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was working, since it seemed as though my fine lines have reduced a little.</li>
            <li> It also helps with those little fine lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing but not so much where your cant easily use it under makeup with out a big ol mess.</li>
            <li> Overall though, this eye cream contains some powerful ingredients, but this does NOT mean that it would work for everyone, since everyone’s skins are different.</li>
            <li> As with the rest of the OZ products Ive used, I cant say enough positive things about this one.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get the eye gel as I have a lot of puffiness and dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Fine lines become less noticeable and the whole eye area looks younger and brighter.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have dark circles under my eyes and after reading the reviews of this product I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> Some of the other points in reviews are true - it&#x27;s not greasy, the gel is cooling, etc.</li>
            <li> Its&#x27; a good eye cream, but not better than some brands I&#x27;ve tried that were more expensive.  </li>
            <li> the area to the right of my right eye was very red and swollen, today it is the upper lid on my left eye (making my eye look like its swollen nearly shut).  </li>
            <li> (&amp;#34;Green Tea Classic&amp;#34; w/ caffiene -- boil 2 bags as directed with Kentwood &amp;#34;Spring Bottled Water&amp;#34;, let cool-may add more spring water to make a lil less concentrated/make it last longer.  </li>
            <li> but I suspect that this gel will end up costing less than the product I most recently used and discarded.</li>
            <li> My husband on the other hand has used this pretty much every night and day</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to any of the other claims of this product because the stickiness makes it pretty much unusable to me.</li>
            <li> Basically I look less tired and feel more confident about myself when going makeup</li>
            <li> As usual, when testing skin care, I started using this eye gel by itself, discontinuing my previous eye cream, and hoping for the best, because I do have problems with dark circles, lines and puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s made a big difference to my appearance and will certainly purchase again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently purchased eye gel...its easy to use, easy to apply and you can seriously see the results instantly!</li>
            <li> I needs only a small amount to totally cover the full eye area, applies easily and keeps the area moist and supple.  </li>
            <li> Came in a smaller bottle than I expected, but it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> What i love about this is that a little tiny dab is all you need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little bit concious of  lines around my eyes (obviously laugh too much) and I always use an eye cream or serum around my eyes before I put moisturiser on.  </li>
            <li> Either way, I am glad to be using this gel as it certainly moisturizes and nourishes the under-eye area without leaving a greasy or shiny look (which a lot of eye creams do, and which I frankly find most annoying.)</li>
            <li> I am glad to be using this gel as it certainly moisturizes and nourishes the under-eye area without leaving a greasy or shiny look (which a lot of eye creams do, and which I frankly find most annoying.)</li>
            <li> I mix a little with my foundation and it really makes it go on much smoother and leaves my face very well moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Mostly it worked, but with time I have noticed two other  side effects - the under eye area became noticeably dry and wrinkled.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear gel</li>
            <li> /&gt;Almost immediately, the results were clear.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for the natural facial products!!!  </li>
            <li> It reminds me of a face mask that dries to a clear matte finish before you wash it off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cloudy clear, well, hair-gel like substance.</li>
            <li> First eye serum that has really worked on undereye bags &amp; dark circles for me.</li>
            <li> First product I have found that really does get rid of dark circles.  </li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes looks really clear and even, which makes my eyes look brighter.</li>
            <li> After using this for months, I wasn&#x27;t completely whether if it was making a difference.</li>
            <li> So I continued to use it on and off early in the morning to get rid of the puffiness.</li>
            <li> and wow,</li>
            <li> So far, I like it and am looking forward to seeing the results over time.</li>
            <li> I have never actually written a review of a product but feel I need to because this eye gel really does help eliminate puffiness.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s and have tried so many products with no results.  </li>
            <li> For me the effects weren&#x27;t  really cumulative either, if I didn&#x27;t use it for a day both my eyes looked basically the same after about 24 hours without use.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are all natural and plant based.</li>
            <li> The area around your eyes is so sensitive and shows aging a lot sooner than the rest of your face.  </li>
            <li> Wild Crafted Eye</li>
            <li> Although product suppose to be natural I had an allergy to the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 40&#x27;s and have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin and frequently get a reaction or breakout from any anti-aging face products.</li>
            <li> skin is still soft and I didnt have any breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s it all natural.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always searched for a product that would get rid of it completely, so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to use makeup to cover it.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel and will continue to purchase it in the future.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate my skin in any way.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I can&#x27;t really tell you yet if the product will show any results in the future.</li>
            <li> Drying...needs moisturizing action to the mix.</li>
            <li> actually the smell goes away fast.</li>
            <li> This has by far beat the others without a doubt.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised with this eye cream.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dr Oz Naturals for one month, so far, I see no difference.</li>
            <li> I am in my 40s and have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old.</li>
            <li> If the the switch didn&#x27;t make it so drastically clear that the Oz Natural products were doing my skin a disservice, I may have thought, &amp;#34;Hey</li>
            <li> (at least today&#x27;s science cannot do this convincingly yet).</li>
            <li> dear seller looking forward to using the oz natural eye cream&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> OZ Naturals is a complete rip off.</li>
            <li> When applied, the gel is very cooling and there is an instant tightenting effect.</li>
            <li> and besides it will last that much longer.</li>
            <li> I think you will be pleasantly surprised how well it does for this.</li>
            <li> so far, nothing has changed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been diligently using it, too :</li>
            <li> this product fixed it.</li>
            <li> So far the puffiness has be kept at bay.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any changes thus far its been 2-3 weeks</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I really did not expect to see a difference especially so soon</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because it didn&#x27;t take my under eye puffiness completely.  </li>
            <li> The manufacturers of sodium benzoate should be stopped from adding this poisin to soft drinks.</li>
            <li> but my eyes feel soft and seem brighter.</li>
            <li> This 65 year old face needs help with the wrinkles and puffiness under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> So far been using it for a few days and its doing better than my last eyes cream.</li>
            <li> Eye area is soft, eye make up goes on with ease now, no pulling or tugging.  </li>
            <li> I have very picky eyes , everything seems to make them red, peel and swollen.</li>
            <li> , I had to waste about 5 pumps of product before it came out smooth.</li>
            <li> I am getting ready to order for a second time and that&#x27;s unheard of from me.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is quite reminds me that &amp;#34;Insta natural Eye gel&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Eyes are 65+ old</li>
            <li> this product offers.  </li>
            <li> so I was surprised.</li>
            <li> a woman in her early 50&#x27;s, I&#x27;m serious!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> doctor recommended a product that is only physician sold that has really helped.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> While not expecting miracles, I was pleasantly surprised by how this product firms and tightens the under-eye skin.</li>
            <li> My skin absolutely looks younger and my eyes look</li>
            <li> skin is velvety soft , well hydrated and</li>
            <li> old eyes</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because this product is composed of 100% natural ingredients and is non-comedogenic</li>
            <li> which is a bonus for someone like me with sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> did not help me---65 yrs old</li>
            <li> It also moisturizes the skin, leaving it soft.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see nearly the circles that I used to see.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, all of the &amp;#34;congestion&amp;#34; on my forehead was completely cleared by morning.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is natural.</li>
            <li> My friends have noticed I am nearly 65</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised with this Eye Gel.  </li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> Especially for the price which is much lower than the cosmetics you get from shop.</li>
            <li> My eyes are quite sensitive and this did not make them sting at all.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for natural antiaging products.  </li>
            <li> the price is reasonable enough to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55 years young and a skincare junkie....</li>
            <li> It makes the skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> People don&#x27;t realize I am over 55 years old.</li>
            <li> I am 46 years old and this is a miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li> The product leaves my skin soft and I will continue to use it but cannot see any changes to my skin.</li>
            <li> IT IS 100% NATURAL, BUT LABEL ON PRODUCT SAYS 75% ORGANIC.</li>
            <li> Eyes are the most delicate part of your body, they need to be treated with care and only use gentle products around them.</li>
            <li> wow...</li>
            <li> is all natural.</li>
            <li> Yes, the bags under the eyes diminished considerably and at this writing they are gone.  </li>
            <li> The puffiness goes away completely.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m 29 years old.  </li>
            <li> It has completely cleared up the wrinkles I had around my eyes.</li>
            <li> much as natural as you can get with anti-aging products&lt;</li>
            <li> So far I feel like the darkness under my eyes</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing it said it would do, after using it religiously for three weeks.</li>
            <li> My skin feels silky soft in the AM.</li>
            <li> it actually fights puffiness very nicly.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt smoothe, and soft and clear.</li>
            <li> by TallGirlJ a Frequent Contributor on PrairieWifeInHeels.com</li>
            <li> The only thing that really gets them lighter, ironically is when I don&#x27;t eat chocolate or caffeine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Natural</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I have had no issue with burning or stinging near my eyes as I do with some eye gels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so idn if it really work&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Will definitely repurchase because this really moisturizes where it&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li> So far I like it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews very often, especially for skin care products.</li>
            <li> Even, when I do get sleep, I wake up with puffy eyes and &amp;#34;bags.&amp;#34; The eye gel is all natural and 75% organic.</li>
            <li> I wish this came in a larger bottle--you can use this on your entire face and neck--but in doing so it will not last, as it is 0.5oz---need to find another product with the same ingredients --- I&#x27;ll be glad to take any and all suggestions---</li>
            <li> It completely removed the wrinkles around my eyes and lessened the circles under my eyes dramatically.</li>
            <li> A complete hoax.</li>
            <li> So far, I have used this product twice a day for 4 weeks in combination with Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream.</li>
            <li> and I find these products to be made with natural ingredients and the smell of the eye gel</li>
            <li> I spread this completely around the eye, and it seems to eliminate darker circles and puffiness  </li>
            <li> but I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> You won’t find parabens, sulfates, or alcohol in this 100% natural blend with vegan formula and 75% organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and in no way does this product irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I like how soft my eyes feel after applying this gel.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really do anything in the short time period</li>
            <li> Iam 83 years old</li>
            <li> however Oz Natural did the trick.  </li>
            <li> This gel really helps diminish these blemishes and make me feel younger and brighter.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how this feels cooling even when it is going</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a couple of weeks religiously and cannot see much improvement.  </li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t see a marked improvement.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I have yet to notice a change in the color under my eyes but allover my skin feels soft and radiant.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using the product for almost 2 weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> I apply it all over the face and it leaves my skin soft and dewy.</li>
            <li> I have relatively young skin</li>
            <li> If I don’t look young, I do look younger.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> HAVE REDUCED CONSIDERABLY.</li>
            <li> After a week, I saw the circles fading, and after two, they were almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> I just turned 28 years old and have a one year old.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream after having my 2nd child, knowing I would need something that really worked.</li>
            <li> and it turn that cooling action helps reduce puffiness.</li>
            <li> one of my adult daughters asked to try it out</li>
            <li> The product is made to be used on the sensitive skin around the eye area.  </li>
            <li> Give it 3 stars based on what I&#x27;ve seen/experienced so far.</li>
            <li> My look young, alert and</li>
            <li> Too early to tell, but am hopeful.</li>
            <li> The puffiness hasn&#x27;t gone completely</li>
            <li> I think I have noticed that the sides of my outer eyes near my cheeks is getting drier.  </li>
            <li> but I like it so far.</li>
            <li> and so far, I like it.</li>
            <li> I like that this product is all natural.</li>
            <li> only haha).  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t expect them to completely disappear.</li>
            <li> The consistency is like one of those old peel-off masks.</li>
            <li> I know everyone is different and some things work for some people and not others, but I won&#x27;t waste any more money on this product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re someone skeptical about how effective products are, than maybe don&#x27;t put too much hope on this product.</li>
            <li> The number of these microscopic lesions was higher in treated animals than in controls, but there was no clear dose dependency for this effect.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to have the extra layer of moisture/protection around my delicate eye area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had puffiness and dark circles for most of my life - this product goes a long way towards reducing those.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff, and works as well as the expensive stuff at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has an easy to use dispenser, so you are really only using a drop each time, which means no wasted product and no mess like other tubes.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable, it spreads easily and a little amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is not only soothing to the eyes it also combats puffiness which i suffer from, as a new user to this product I would highly recommend it.....</li>
            <li> Please bring back the old formula!!!</li>
            <li> Like I said I am a 52 year old female living right outside of PA.</li>
            <li> I really like the cooling and tightening, but since I&#x27;m still a new user I can&#x27;t speak to the long term effects of this eye cream.</li>
            <li> The directions say you can use it throughout the day, so I keep an extra bottle in my purse for those days when I am extra puffy, and apply it right over my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Someone seeing my occasionally and noticing a change right away is sign enough for me to continue this product.</li>
            <li> It seems to work quick &amp; long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Thick but absorbs pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> but the first thing I noticed after a few days was that under my eyes started to look brighter and I had pretty much no dark</li>
            <li> I can post back later if this does even more, as well as the other (5) products I purchased.</li>
            <li> and it sinks right in.</li>
            <li> Other beneficial ingredients in this product are: various amino acids which are the building blocks of proteins and therefore will assist in repairing tissue and smooth the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a bundle trying many other eye creams and</li>
            <li> Sure, they got &amp;#34;tighter&amp;#34;, but it looked extremely unnatural as if my eyes were pinched closed.</li>
            <li> I also have pretty dry skin all around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have super dark circles</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in the fine lines and crows feet but nothing for my dark circles- which is why I am only giving it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I say this with all the honesty and relief of a 31 year old woman who has been struggling to find a decent face treatment for my combo, occasional acne and blackhead-prone, splotchy face for years:</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any sign of measurable difference in the dark circles at this point, but they do look pretty decent after a tiring day at work.</li>
            <li> I can see a SIGNIFICANT difference in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Finally found a natural remedy that actually had my face and skin looking and feeling better in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Really pleased with the performance of this eye cream as it was recently put to the test when after a hard night&#x27;s worth of merriment I woke up with some serious eye baggage that required quick remedy.</li>
            <li> It did not do anything for the the puffiness under the eye -- perhaps it would help the younger woman, but it does not help an older woman.</li>
            <li> Really struggled with under eye dark circles and has really helped out</li>
            <li> If you rate low, then no more free product!  </li>
            <li> I did not notice any change in the dark spots or shadows under my eyes, but just the fact that the skin is much smoother around my eyes is really noticeable.  </li>
            <li> and I have no black circles under my eyes anymore.  </li>
            <li> wonderful results at a fraction of the cost of the expensive lines I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> This does reduce the puffiness and dark circles and few products I&#x27;ve tried have done so as effectively as this.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is no less in its functions.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> So far each one of them has proven to be amazing compared to any other product I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Oz Naturals Eye Gel not only works wonders but it works wonderfully on my very sensitive skin without any problems!</li>
            <li> They make your eyelids a little puffy, but not ugly puffy.</li>
            <li> Really hasn&#x27;t been long enough to see any lasting results; definitely feel a tightening effect and product absorbs quickly without feeling greasy......................</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin like some other products I have used.</li>
            <li> Right now I feel like it&#x27;s any other eye product that I have tried and isn&#x27;t working...</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product &amp; used it 1 or 2 times daily for two weeks but then decided to stop.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this eye gel if you wanna try something different.</li>
            <li> I even use half a pump because a whole pump is WAY too much for just your eyes.</li>
            <li> In the morning, I let it dry for a few minutes, then apply my under eye concealer over the top.</li>
            <li> do not like getting older any more than the next person and this was the first time that I tried a product that promised to slow down the visible effects of aging.  </li>
            <li> With continued use I am noticing that it is helping to calm my dark circles too.</li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t really comment on long term benefits.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I really like this gel, and I am looking forward to seeing its long term</li>
            <li> I would say it helps immediately brighten the area, but I didn&#x27;t really notice any long term effects even after having finished the bottle.</li>
            <li> It really helps with the puffiness, but not completely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another important ingredient is &amp;#34;plant stem cells&amp;#34; which are usually harvested from plants grown in labs.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to apply, either, so it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;ve any left over on my finger tips, I dab a bit within the laugh lines and above the upper lip too.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many remedy&#x27;s to reduce my bags, puffiness and dark circles from eye masks you pop in fridge, to ones you freeze to other eye creams.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> but after a few days later I started to notice it was actually making my wrinkles more deeper</li>
            <li> no dark cycles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had nobody say anything about my Dark circles so based on what other people say, I would say its an OK product</li>
            <li> I have noticed the glow under eyes in the mornings with no dark circles and no need for concealer which I never thought would happen.</li>
            <li> I normally use two different products, so I gave it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does take a few minutes to completely absorb, it has a heavy gel feel, but when it dries, I can honestly feel the skin tightening.</li>
            <li> If you like a thick eye cream that fills in lines (like those expensive capsules) then this is a good fit for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Start reversing the eye aging process with a product from OZ Naturals – the Superior Youth Eye Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featured in Allure Magazine, you can’t go wrong giving this eye gel (not cream) that’s formulated specifically for the sensitive skin and areas around your eyes, especially the eyelids.</li>
            <li> It does have a cool feeling, but other than that i did not see any results,  I only have few fine lines, and not deep wrinkles</li>
            <li> The little bit of wrinkling I have is quickly diminishing as is the looseness of my under and over eye skin...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 21 year old female with some mild dark circles under my eyes and after reading the reviews decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> I only need a half pump of product for each eye which is good because this is a small bottle.  </li>
            <li> For me, the only potential negative aspect was the light cucumber scent when I first applied it.</li>
            <li> It is better than any other product that I have previously used for this problem.</li>
            <li> unless super miraculous product... won&#x27;t buy it for cost and other cheaper options with similar quality</li>
            <li> I simply cannot live without this Eye Gel.</li>
            <li> The new bottle is white and opaque.</li>
            <li> I am new to this line but definitely here to stay.</li>
            <li> The Hyaluronic Acid and recently the Retinol new product.</li>
            <li> I have always had dark circles and I notices improvement right away.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate and have appreciated the extra moisture.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am really happy with this product for the reason it gives me soft hydrated skin and makes me look less tired.</li>
            <li> I used so far 15 days , seems like is working well enough so far .</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need to use that much, a tiny pearl size amount is enough.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any real difference yet but has only been a short time</li>
            <li> I had to use the OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel for a few weeks before I noticed any results.</li>
            <li> No bad reaction and it definitely reduces puffiness and seems to reduce dark circles.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the smell - it has a very strong smell initially.  </li>
            <li> skin around my eyes is very sensitive and I can only use hypoallergenic eye liners, mascara and eye creams.</li>
            <li> Honestly I have tried so many eye creams because I have bad dark eye circles.</li>
            <li> The fact we received them for free has no bearing on our review, and we have written negative reviews in the past for products we were sent for free.</li>
            <li> So I think if we want major results we have to stick to our regimen</li>
            <li> Be aware that this is only 1/2 OF AN OUNCE of actual fluid the packaging is deceiving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many eye treatment gels in the past, including some of the most expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work a little better than other products, but it&#x27;s not a miracle gel.</li>
            <li> However, no other compensation was received.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a major difference.  </li>
            <li> No other eye cream has done this before.  </li>
            <li> I tried this first before the other products and it soothes my puffy eyes after I shower in the morning</li>
            <li> My dark circles appear to be less and my eyes just look more refreshed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 25 days this bottle is half full, so I would say it may last 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that gets rid of dark circles and puffiness and it works quickly.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a long time and trying so many different products for the dark circles under my eyes, but found this stuff last spring/summer, and have been using it ever since!  </li>
            <li> I am obviously allergic to one or more of the &#x27;natural&#x27; ingredients in this product; I can&#x27;t figure out any other reason for  the mess it made of my skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are the most highly rated ingredients for an eye cream but the amount in this cream must be microscopical (if even true) as it really is one of the worst creams I have tried and I am obsessed with finding a good eye cream for my aging eyes.  </li>
            <li> The serum is fine - can&#x27;t see improvement, but then maybe it&#x27;s too late?  </li>
            <li> This eye gel goes on velvety smooth and sinks right in without irritating my sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li> As usual, my review reflects my own views and experience with the product and was in no way influenced by the manufacturer.ence, especially when looking at photos taken a month ago, but I got the clearest confirmation the other day, when I happened to look at my face mid-afternoon and was dismayed to see that a hint of bags had returned under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> : The box has a clean design but the print is tiny, and the pump action bottle really not friendly for those with a visual difficulty.</li>
            <li> when I put some on it did have a strong smell but the smell isn&#x27;t a bad one and isn&#x27;t so strong it bothers me..</li>
            <li> It is not greasy on the skin and absorbs quickly and only has a slight odor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing a bottle will last a few months--so will try the entire bottle---I am optimistic that I&#x27;ll see improvement in my fine eye wrinkles, as the Oz Hyaluronic serum is working already.</li>
            <li> I do notice a reduction in the dark circles, but I will probably be looking for another eye cream or serum that hydrates a little better.</li>
            <li> I used OZ Naturals on my left eye, and the other on my right.</li>
            <li> Right after I apply this serum, my skin feels tight and needs some moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Feels smooth, but not effective.</li>
            <li> There genuinely does seem to be improvement in under eye wrinkles but not much for the dark circles.</li>
            <li> I am 69 years old and the wrinkles around my eyes plus dark and puffy eyes have really improved.  </li>
            <li> Usually eye-specific preparations are either too light and almost drying, or else they tend to leave a greasy residue which surfaces later through foundation or primer.  </li>
            <li> -)&lt;br /&gt;I am a big advocate of the natural approach and this product did it for me.</li>
            <li> ; I&#x27;ve developed puffier eyes, especially in the morning.</li>
            <li> Couple days later after not using this product the puffiness is almost completely gone but</li>
            <li> My crows feet are barely noticeable now</li>
            <li> I found that it reduced my dark circles a lot just within the first use.</li>
            <li> so be careful pumping it out because you will get 3 x as much as you will need.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I am a 39 year old male</li>
            <li> It did not work.  :o</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to see that one day during my regular morning prep before work I noticed that the skin beneath my eyes looked lighter.</li>
            <li> Helps the dark circles and puffiness really well too!</li>
            <li> and I doubted that anything would help me with some wrinkles around the eyes; I acquired some of them with another eye cream which left me with blisters, redness and then skin like leather aound my eyes; guess I have a sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> So far i haven&#x27;t seen any obvious results.</li>
            <li> Apparently this was not tested on darker skin, because it does not work for me.  </li>
            <li> As a young male in his 20s</li>
            <li> Even as young as middle school</li>
            <li> But as far as daily use goes...</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t burn the candle at both ends and expect this product to fix it - but for allergy shiners and folks with dark circles under the eyes - this product for me really seems to work!  </li>
            <li> Is not a &#x27;miracle&#x27; by any stretch, but it works well enough for aging (old) skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for last 2 weeks and so far I like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but not great.</li>
            <li> but still allows him to have a few distinguished laugh lines.  </li>
            <li> one of the main reasons being due to the fact it has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to copy and paste this review to the products I&#x27;ve listed above to avoid finding a new way to say the same thing!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last very long and didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I like this product but cannot be completely certain of any benefits that it&#x27;s doing apart from other products that I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> Although the packaging looks nice, it&#x27;s impossible to determine how much product remains.</li>
            <li> After just a few days I notice my eyes are not puffy in the morning and already the deeper lines seem less prominent.</li>
            <li> it comes to looking younger, women are usually the first to say that the wrinkles around their eyes make them look older than their age.</li>
            <li> I have been using OZNaturals Super Youth Eye Gel for the past five days</li>
            <li> the effect on the wrinkles is minimal as yet, although certainly noticeable, the real eye-opener has been the dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> Firstly, it is not really a cream; it is more like a gel-cream, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Nor did it really do anything other than keep me hoping a miracle was going to happen.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are gentle and do not cause eye irritation, which has been a problem with other products.</li>
            <li> I’ve used other eyelid moisturizers before but have had problems with them: I’ve either had to apply too much gel</li>
            <li> I suggest using this product at night as the gel is a rich and thick consistency.</li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes is smoother, less lines, the dark circles are definitely lighter and the overall look around the eye is more youthful.  </li>
            <li> The gel is wet and does not absorb into the skin,&lt;br /&gt;all of which makes it hard to apply concealer on top of it.  </li>
            <li> so if you are sensitive to natural products, be careful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a fresh vegetal smell dominated by cucumber and a translucent white color and only a slight viscosity.  </li>
            <li> yet I&#x27;ve seen significant improvement with my dark eye circles due to lack of sleep.</li>
            <li> even after being on all nite, it does not dry the eye area in any way.  </li>
            <li> I think it really helped calm my tired, puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it is thick and somewhat sticky and doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> A number of the eye creams that I&#x27;ve used did a good job in moisturizing the eye area and discouraging wrinkles, but some have been so heavy and greasy that I feel they&#x27;ve made the puffiness much worse.  </li>
            <li> I have been dabbing a small amount of the clear gel under my eyes before bed each night, and when I wake up the skin under my eyes looks smooth, refreshed, with no dark circles and less puffiness.  </li>
            <li> All it takes is a little dab around the eyes first thing in the morning</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok not really working well on me as I expected my dark circles are still the same .</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I actually noticed a slight difference!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My eyes are instantly less puffy and the fine lines around my eyes are visibly less noticeable.</li>
            <li> It releases exactly the amount I want, no more and no less.</li>
            <li> After using this and a few other OZ Naturals products my face is more dry than it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that at 47 years old, I am pretty sick and tired of having tried far too many products only to realize I&#x27;d wasted my money, yet again.</li>
            <li> and I am disappointed because of all the great reviews...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change in my dark circles or wrinkles</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because I don&#x27;t really feel like it helps with dark circles (I didn&#x27;t see a difference).</li>
            <li> It really helped with my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I really think this has helped my dark spots under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for my dark circles.</li>
            <li> It really reduces the dark circles under my eyes and tightens my skin.</li>
            <li> Really helped my dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who has dark circles and wants to improve the look of them.</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing for the wrinkles and dark bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really make any improvement on my dark circles however</li>
            <li> This gel really tightens the skin around my eyes, and I notice a decrease in puffiness and dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced this does much for dark circles.</li>
            <li> The product really didnt help with puffiness or dark circles</li>
            <li> Puffy eyes are demenishing thanks to this stuff and the dark circles have improved in just two weeks..</li>
            <li> IT DID Absolutely nothing for my dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> It really has transformed the look of my crows feet and dark circles.</li>
            <li> I use it each day, and feel much happier when I look in the mirror and do not see those dark circles.</li>
            <li> I really like that this can be used to help dark circles too.  </li>
            <li> The dark circles are so much improved, now it just takes a bit of concealor</li>
            <li> This product suppose to reduce my under eye bags, but often I feel the strange tingeing and itching with this &amp;#34;all  natural product&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Being a gel, it does plump the skin as any moisturizer would do, but I&#x27;ve noticed no long term effects.  </li>
            <li> approach to skincare is rather scattershot, perhaps because there is no solid science here, only marketing claims; I&#x27;m not willing to spend hundreds of dollars on fanciful advertising, nor am I willing to experiment with potentially toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> Just started using it, so don&#x27;t know yet what the long term will be as far as smoothing, tightening, lightening...?</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money on other products to reduce the sign of aging and had some success.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I ordered from OZ Naturals (now am using quite a few).</li>
            <li> The reviews did not tell the true story, or at least in my case.  </li>
            <li> Used sparingly, as is directed, this little bottle goes a long way and is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product helped to lighten my dark circles a little nothing to fantastic.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the results I expected especially since others rated this so high.  </li>
            <li> I love researching eye creams because at the ripe old age of 28 my vanity and waning youth is starting to weigh heavily... especially on my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I give this 4 out of 5 stars because it has the potential to work like it says over time, 2 weeks or even 30 days can be hard to get the  full results of a product.&lt;br /&gt;I received these products for review purposes.</li>
            <li> bottle holds ½ fluid ounce or 15 ml of gel, and I have no idea how much there is left, but the pump dispenser works extremely well</li>
            <li> bottle holds ½ fluid ounce or 15 ml of gel, and I have no idea how much there is left, but the pump dispenser works extremely well</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as well as their other items.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne-prone and very combination skin-- think oil slick forehead and nose, barren desert</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Soon after using this I developed dry, scaly ,reddish eye lids.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also less hydrating and doesn&#x27;t do much for puffiness.</li>
            <li> such to help the dark circles (and the few fine (hopefully) lines I had under my eyes as well) and this eye gel</li>
            <li> Or, perhaps two weeks is too short a time to see any real difference in dark circles?</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t hesitate in using this as a regular remedy for baggy and dark eye-circle type issues.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps reduce puffiness and dark under the eyes, but not as much with wrinkles</li>
            <li> the  past few years I&#x27;ve noticed fine lines (crows feet) near my eyes and those dreaded &amp;#34;laugh lines&amp;#34; around my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Has made a tremendous difference in my eye area especially dark circles.  </li>
            <li> So far no new results to report.</li>
            <li> This Oz Naturals Eye Gel is a little thicker than the usual creams and goes on clear and smooth.  </li>
            <li> After trying out several other upscale brands with no visible improvements in the darkness under my eyes, I am completely satisfied with this eye gel after using it for the past four weeks!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very hard not to squirt too much out at once and easy to waste it that way.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product because it soothed the skin around my eyes and made me look a lot less tired.</li>
            <li> and I really have a tight budget</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m personally not sensitive to products, having fared alright with other intense skin products.</li>
            <li> I bought this item around Christmas, mainly to address my dark circles.</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny amount from the pump dispenser as it glides on thinly and easily.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I trusted Oz to formulate a cream that would take care of dark circles in particular.  </li>
            <li> This eye gel has a rich, creamy texture and a very faint scent of fresh cucumber.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor and Beyond Broccoli and plenty of other books</li>
            <li> I also had new wrinkles around my eyes due to the irritation of my skin from this gel.  </li>
            <li> The pump was also less than half full of product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suffer from dark circles regularly and it was only after several weeks&#x27; use that I realised that I had none even after a particularly sleepless night.</li>
            <li> I was having a real problem with very dark under-eye circles that I couldn&#x27;t even cover with concealor + foundation + powder.</li>
            <li> Not super excited with this product, will give in a little bit long before I make any super hard choices on keeping it or chucking it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as well as all their other products!</li>
            <li> I have noticed my eyes appear less dark but not really the wrinkles, fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong because theyre a cruelty free company , all natural and</li>
            <li> Honestly this product is too expensive for the minimal results it provides.</li>
            <li> Have to say, it really does tighten things up, not a huge difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed and a little shocked by how truly good they are!  </li>
            <li> At least this product was under 20 bucks, I&#x27;ve spent more for other eye treatments that didn&#x27;t work as promised either.</li>
            <li> My skin is normal to dry, pore size is moderate to small, and very sensitive to fragrances, does not like salicylic acid but loves glycolic acid, and</li>
            <li> Last year, a female friend had taken me to the high end counter and picked up a product that really did help to get the tired look gone</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn a lot of makeup lately, however I think either a primer or light eye moisturizing cream could be used, then eye makeup and concealer or foundation with no problem due to the product&#x27;s penetration leaving a matte finish</li>
            <li> All of OZ Naturals products are so low priced in my opinion compared to other natural products and that&#x27;s the biggest plus.</li>
            <li> Seems to help with dark circles but doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference for me on puffiness and fine wrinkles, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this to anyone searching for a complete eye gel, and this has inspired me to try the other Oz Naturals products.</li>
            <li> I only have one face and my skin has become increasingly sensitive with age, so I have to be very careful about the stuff I put on it.  </li>
            <li> This stuff almost immediately refreshed the skin around my eyes, and a week into using it the dark circles were considerably lighter!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tiny bottle, but since it only goes on my eyes it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> After using the gel, my the undereye bags and discolouration decreased significantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it for 3 months and even though its in a small bottle it&#x27;s very long lasting a little bit goes a long way I did see the bags under my eyes diminish very rapidly within the first two weeks of use</li>
            <li> Its only been a week and my dark circles around my eyes aren&#x27;t so profound!</li>
            <li> I have dark circles and some puffiness - it is starting to clear this.  </li>
            <li> while it hasn&#x27;t complete eliminated my dark circles, it has lightened them enough that I often forget to use concealer during the day!  </li>
            <li> Even for this 60 yr old man with DEEP dark circles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about a month haven&#x27;t really seen the results i expected with the dark circles.</li>
            <li> I usually use a lot of my facial products at night so they can really work into my skin while I am relaxed and asleep.</li>
            <li> All active ingredients are 100% natural and 75% organic.</li>
            <li> I am a 59 year old male with dark rings below my eyes, and I purchased this product to try to mitigate this effect of aging on my body.</li>
            <li> I have not been using this long enough to know if it has lasting effects on my wrinkles, but the immediate feeling is that the skin around my eyes is smoother.</li>
            <li> However, they refuse refund for the reason that money back guarantee is for only 30 days, which does not post anywhere in the long product description.</li>
            <li> It dried my skin out &amp; made me look even older.</li>
            <li> and I really wanted to love it, but I must be allergic to something in it. :(</li>
            <li> I really like OZ naturals Eye dark circle eye gel!!</li>
            <li> Really lightened the dark circles under my eyes!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have black circles, but I do have pronounced bags that make me feel very old when I look in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try it because I have developed very puffy eyes but for some reason it didn&#x27;t work for me. :(</li>
            <li> no long term reduction in puffiness, no long term reduction in wrinkle appearance, no long term reduction dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I wake up, no matter how long I slept, my undereyes are sunken in and dark and the lids are puffy and red, so I have to wake up really early to try to increase the circulation and let the darkness fade and cover it with makeup before I go!</li>
            <li> So, I feel certain that the positive reviews are fake.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended by someone who doesn&#x27;t waste time on a bunch of crappy products.</li>
            <li> gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matrixyl synth’ 6 has been shown in laboratory studies to not only stimulate the synthesis of collagen but also help five other major constituents of the skin.</li>
            <li> At first it was hard to notice any difference.</li>
            <li> This works instantly clear out the dark skin.</li>
            <li> Helped clear my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard this exact complaint before when I was reading on-line comments before I purchased it and took the chance.</li>
            <li> No more wasting money on the brands sold in the department stores that really just don&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t say that dark circles were gone completely.</li>
            <li> As for if it really works in not sure just yet.</li>
            <li> It also helps reduce dark circles, wrinkles and puffiness -- I prefer a natural astringent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, not sure if its really doing anything to my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I pumped out a small pea-like amount and it was too much.</li>
            <li> The dark circles have diminished considerably.  </li>
            <li> I must say the puffiness I usually have in the morning has really diminished a lot</li>
            <li> Nothing is ever going to completely remove the dark circles under my eyes except maybe a time machine</li>
            <li> I am 32 years old and already have crows feet and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that tends to react to over-perfumed products.&lt;br /&gt;The eye-cream is aimed at dark circles, wrinkles and puffiness around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t noticed any long term permanent effects, I have noticed that my the puffiness around my eyes is instantly reduced when I apply it in the morning.</li>
            <li> This comes in a pump dispenser and a tiny bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I am still currently using this, so once this bottle is used up I will update on the long term usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ok not really impressed I expected a instant change wont purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a couple days, so I can not yet attest to long term results...</li>
            <li> It is not a product that will help in the long run, you have to constantly use it to get results.  </li>
            <li> It flat out doesn&#x27;t do one thing.  </li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Still not using it long enough</li>
            <li> After using OZ Natural only a few days I started seeing a big improvement.</li>
            <li> next quest is to try RoC Multi-Correxion Eye Treatment and wear sun glasses on sunny days (which I neglected for so long).</li>
            <li> So far I have to give it a thumbs down</li>
            <li> It brought me back to my old, i mean my young self again.   </li>
            <li> The dark circles are still as large and dark as always.</li>
            <li> its not harsh but works well you only need to use a little bit to see the lines flatten out so makeup or no makeup</li>
            <li> Smell to see if rancid-green tea doesn&#x27;t last too long!)</li>
            <li> The bags have lessened and are sometimes completely flat!  </li>
            <li> Toxic ingredients don&#x27;t benefit the consumer, GMO, artificial colors, sugar, salt, chemicals all produce a cheaper or a more addictive product that in no way is anything you want to ingest or use on your body,</li>
            <li> If you sparingly dot it on and let it dry, you actually can see an improvement under the eye area.  </li>
            <li> If anything, it at least acts in place of a moisturizer appropriate for the delicate skin around the eye.</li>
            <li> My eyelids are swollen, red, really dry and they sting when I wash my face.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t completely gotten rid of my black circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> (I am also usually not super sensitive to skin care items.)</li>
            <li> I have used retinol-based products that tend to dry out the under-eye area, but this product does just the opposite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried an eye gel until this one, previously I was used to using creams that took a bit of effort to blend completely into the skin.</li>
            <li> Left skin extremely dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I use just a tiny drop of it and dab under the eyes and let it dry which takes like a minute.</li>
            <li> I ordered two eye creams, this and InstaNatural eye cream, roughly the same price and both claim to do the same things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a few days but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back and looked at those reviews and noticed that the reviewers gave 5 star reviews to every single eye gel they&#x27;ve reviewed.  </li>
            <li> how pretty my eyes are - guess they couldn&#x27;t get past the dark circles to notice my blue eyes!</li>
            <li> I am 46 years old, and have the small &amp;#34;crinklies&amp;#34; starting to develop, but do not have deep wrinkles to contend with.  </li>
            <li> used daily, even multiple times daily, you’ll start seeing results to fading dark circles, wrinkles, and relieving puffiness around your eyes.</li>
            <li> Its super delicate on my skin and soft, and its not too heavy or oily like other eye gels I have used before.</li>
            <li> The gel has really improved the overall texture of my skin and made little creases less noticeable.</li>
            <li> but I can certainly see where the lines around my eyes are less pronounced and underneath my eyes is less puffy.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear any makeup, so I can&#x27;t say how the two interact with each other, and for me there was no noticeable smell - good or bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other more expensive products and</li>
            <li> While I have only been using the eye serum for a little less than two weeks, I have definitely noticed a change in my dark circles, they are much lighter and smoother!</li>
            <li> It have noticed big difference in my dark circles and my eyes look much better and less tired.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s, so I don&#x27;t have excessive fine lines or wrinkles, but I wanted to start using something now in hopes of keeping my skin youthful.</li>
            <li> was hoping to finally find something that would help my dark circles, the only reason I did not return it was because of&lt;br /&gt;the price and other more expensive creams I tried were just as ineffective as this cream.</li>
            <li> you have ever used natural products, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t hurt me but it did do absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> My cold eye patch works better than this cream.</li>
            <li> I have used expensive products, cheap products</li>
            <li> Honestly, do not see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> The dark circles and puffiness under my eyes have begun to disappear after just one week of daily use of this gel-- just wish it came in a larger container!  </li>
            <li> Although it clearly says you can I don&#x27;t want to waste it.</li>
            <li> Depending on the severity of the wrinkles, dark circles, and puffiness, you could definitely look five to ten years</li>
            <li> My eyes are not young.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because Its the holidays in retail and I&#x27;m working long hours.</li>
            <li> Minor improvement noticed after 2 mos.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product long, but I think I see a difference already in reduced under-eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it would show results over the long haul??</li>
            <li> puffiness minimal now, pores on my face appear much smaller, and skin is smoother around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Hopefully in the long run I will notice a difference.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m seeing a a few results but with a product like this you have to continue using longer to see the maximum results.</li>
            <li> I will update my review over time once I have a few weeks of use but so far this is doing what it says it does.  </li>
            <li> idk what it is maybe u shouldn&#x27;t be using it for a long time?</li>
            <li> It was smaller than i expected</li>
            <li> and I shared this with my mom, who has problems with her aging eyes for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually sensitive to products</li>
            <li> I was extremely careful to apply just to the surrounding eye area, but my vision was foggy the next day.</li>
            <li> Minor gripe -</li>
            <li> it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I will look forward to seeing what the long term use will result in.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for long</li>
            <li> will have to see on the long run</li>
            <li> Plus it lasted a really long time.</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to see what the long term results show!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have expected a bigger supply of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it morning and night and now that the bottle is empty, I can only conclude it did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> It is not to greasy or harsh on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but I will proceed with it until I finish it and see if it just takes a long time to work.  </li>
            <li> This product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am  41 years old with combination normal/oily skin and uneven skin tones.  </li>
            <li> This took me a long time to appreciate.</li>
            <li> not much product needed so the bottle should last you a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money if the ingredients are no good from the light.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an eye gel that i could use freely and casually w/o worrying about it getting all over  the place, (your eyes)  </li>
            <li> I completed the entire bottle, down to the very last drops.</li>
            <li> Under my eyes is the most noticeable signs of aging and I have not seen any results from previous (expensive) products I have tried.</li>
            <li> BUT I&#x60;d put it on only at night before bed as its consistency makes it impossible to put on a concealer on top (the concealer wouldn&#x60;t</li>
            <li> This eye gel is very similar to a different brand of Eye gel that I have previously used.  </li>
            <li> I mean really sticky, like flypaper.</li>
            <li> This eye gel has decreased the swelling that I have had under my right eye for over 10 years from eye surgery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been workng long hours though this product doesn&#x27;t do a darn thing except seriously dry your skin, so f you want lo give this a try</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light on the skin, very thin so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My dark circles are much less evident, my skin is smoother and I can use a bit of concealer without ending up with a caked and lined mess.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this because my eyes get dark circles and dry in the winter, it made them worse.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any dark undereye circles, but do have dry and saggy skin due to being 67 years young.  </li>
            <li> The gel left the area very dry so need to be careful to apply moisture afterwards.</li>
            <li> As a kid and young adult I wasn&#x27;t even aware it was a bad thing.</li>
            <li> So a bottle goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Very small container - you tend to use it up fast &#x27;cause there is no way to &amp;#34;put it back&amp;#34; into the container.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last week after an endless search for something that will help me get rid of the under eye bags.</li>
            <li> wanted some thing that would not make my face red like the other acne creams do&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will buy this again, as long as they make it, nothing compares to this that I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> Other competitive brands with similar ingredients are out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying their other products such as vitamin C, hydo etc cream after applying vit C.  </li>
            <li> To me this gel feels similar to putting on a cucumber mask, it cools a little, and totally eliminates my puffiness.</li>
            <li> Only a little bit of product is needed so the bottle will last a while!</li>
            <li> But I do like it for the other reasons listed above, and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> It left no sticky residue either like a lot of other gels.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not gooey like other creams.  </li>
            <li> As we age our skin sometimes needs a little help especially if we don&#x27;t get the proper nutrition all of the time.  </li>
            <li> Not much different than any other eye gel.</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase again and will try other products by this company.  </li>
            <li> I definitely felt the tightening effect it had on my skin, but not only did it remain a little sticky</li>
            <li> could see a visible difference, especially when looking at photos taken a month ago, but I got the clearest confirmation the other day, when I happened to look at my face mid-afternoon and was dismayed to see that a hint of bags had returned under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely try their other products</li>
            <li> But since using this, the puffy eyelids have decreased significantly and the lower eyelids are less sunken in.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very strange.</li>
            <li> The corners of my eyes are normally very dark and irritated from constant rubbing (contact user) and this product has already reduced the darkness after only 3 days!</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Small bottle lasts a very long</li>
            <li> /&gt;Directions:  Wash &amp; pat dry face.</li>
            <li> This product soothed my dry skin..</li>
            <li> I had been having a problem with an area under my eye that was dry.</li>
            <li> Nothing would get rid of the dry spot until I began using the Oz eye cream.</li>
            <li> My skin is on the dry side, but I do not like greasy products.  </li>
            <li> so I will chalk that up to the dry patches.</li>
            <li> I give it about 15 minutes to completely dry.</li>
            <li> To hedge my bets, I apply it, let it dry, and then apply a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My wife had to switch eye cream since the one she was using gave her some issue (dry, itchy lid).</li>
            <li> I woke up one morning with redness and dry skin under my eyes from applying the gel the night before.</li>
            <li> This eye gel has worked for me, smells like cucumber and doesn&#x27;t dry sticky like some eye gels.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t dry, then it just feels sticky.</li>
            <li> It will  take time to dry out and time will eliminate any feeling of temporary stickiness.  </li>
            <li> It may take about 20 minutes to dry for eye shadow prep.  </li>
            <li> Even with dry fingers, the product is still sticky before it dries.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I really had the puffiness and dark circles</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really change anything for me and sometimes it would get sticky and actually felt like it was making my wrinkled worse because it made my skin stick to itself under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I can definitely see a difference in my crows feet after only a few weeks of using this gel nightly &amp; my eyelids feel firmer in the morning when I apply eye shadow..</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;m not drinking caffeine/alcohol anymore, smoking, nor sleeping only 6 hours a night, like a few years back, I&#x27;m still wondering if there&#x27;s any &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I noticed this every single time I tried to use it.  </li>
            <li> Used this cream every single night after washing my face for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found other less expensive products that do a much better job.</li>
            <li> It is a clear gel and comes in a small bottle.</li>
            <li> I was noticing that I was getting some dark circles and starting to get some wrinkles in the corners of my eyes from squinting a lot.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dark circles and puffiness for several years now - and that is something no Botox can fix!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, I have a genetic dark circles since I was a child</li>
            <li> I just received this product in mail, I have been only using a week trying to get rid of my dark circles.</li>
            <li> suffered from dark circles my entire life</li>
            <li> I no longer have dark circles around my eyes, and I have only been using this product for one month!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have problems with dark circles or deep wrinkles around the eyes, but as I&#x27;ve gotten &amp;#34;less</li>
            <li> I have puffy dark eye circles, as well as wrinkles on the upper eyelid and lower lash line area.</li>
            <li> The only problem I started with was persistent dark circles, but since I&#x27;ve started using the eye gel</li>
            <li> My dark circles and bags underneath my eyes have massively improved!!</li>
            <li> In the last year or so I have noticed dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I must agree--&amp;#34;best product ever!&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve been using  several products for lines, puffy eyes and dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Nothing seemed to work to reduce the puffy bags and dark circles under my eyes, that despite enough sleep just wouldn&#x27;t go away.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it not help lighten the dark circles, it seemed to make them puffy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to update once I finish the product to report back on dark circles, which is a problem area for</li>
            <li> Occasionally there was puffiness, or some dark circles.</li>
            <li> On day five I was totally amazed over my dark circles diminishing.</li>
            <li> noticed a big difference in the dark circles but concealer fixes those..</li>
            <li> However, it did nothing for my dark circles and thats the only reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> I would definitely refer anyone with puffiness or dark circles to try this product.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product it seemed as if my puffiness under my eyes got worse.  </li>
            <li> I have less dark circles and puffiness under my eyes; I look less tired and more refreshed.</li>
            <li> It works to tighten loose skin, even on neck.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see any dramatic changes and will probably go back to what I have been using.</li>
            <li> and I have definitely noticed that the puffiness has gone down quite a bit.</li>
            <li> One pump of this product will cover my entire face, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> With twice-a-day use, the product lasted a long time because you only need a little with each application.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, three weeks in, and not the slight bit of lightening in my dark eye circles, which is what I was most hoping for.  </li>
            <li> I use for 4 months and my black spots and wrinkles are the same....</li>
            <li> Pkg is different from previous order; pump does not work as well.</li>
            <li> and you only have to use a small amount to cover entire eye area.</li>
            <li> I used it typically two times a day sometimes only once.  </li>
            <li> lines between my brows are less obvious, the instructions says that this eye gel can be applied in between your eye brows as well, so</li>
            <li> is that my eyes have a burning feel toward the second half of the day and in the evening.</li>
            <li> Not to say that these products don&#x27;t work for others, but I guess you have to balance out the thousands of success stories with at least one unsuccessful one :/</li>
            <li> the ability to use only what I need - and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> use only about half a pump of this, and tap it around my eyes in a diamond shape.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lines around my eyes seem much less noticeable, and my upper eye area seems firmer and lifted.  </li>
            <li> one and half pump provides enough product for both eyelids and underneath the eye.</li>
            <li> This dried out the skin under my eyes and it was 5 days past the return date by the time I really noticed it.  </li>
            <li> but overall I see a slight difference.</li>
            <li> it works, less puffiness around the eyes after only 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first, but this product totally works.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot, but I only used half and then I lost it.</li>
            <li> Oil of Olay provides the same results for less price.</li>
            <li> I randomly found a review of it online, ordered it, and received it so quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dry here</li>
            <li> It also made my skin very dry</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t matter what I did, how much I slept, or what I put on to hide them, I still constantly looked exhausted, unhealthy, and much older than I wanted to look.</li>
            <li> I have been using it now for a few weeks and my eyes are looking fresh and rested and my bags are hardly noticeable anymore!</li>
            <li> I do not have dark circles under the eyes and can not address this issue personally but recommend reading other reviews for their results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;lt certainly does not cause puffiness and even has a cooling effect if my eyes are a bit tired.</li>
            <li> They appear lighter and even a little smaller!</li>
            <li> It tends to burn just a little bit if it&#x27;s too close, and makes my water line a bit red, one of the reasons why I decided not to put it on too often during the mornings.</li>
            <li> I must say it was a little smaller</li>
            <li> This has helped immensely on the dark circles under my eyes!</li>
            <li> That is a big plus and I have reached for this eye gel on those morning when I need a little de-puffing.</li>
            <li> I am not putting a lot of the gel on my entire face and around the eyes, a little goes along way</li>
            <li> You definitely get a bang for your buck with this little miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use a little longer in hopes of results if I experience none I will be requesting my money back.</li>
            <li> Better then all the other expensive department store products I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid twenties and really do not have any wrinkles, but I noticed that this does perk my eyes up a little</li>
            <li> Did nothing, other than dry my eyes area out.</li>
            <li> I personally like to use it at night only as it&#x27;s a little too heavy for me in the day.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the one on the left in the picture) for two and half weeks without treating the other Eye.</li>
            <li> You immediately see less wrinkle due to hydration which last about 2 hours or so.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Key ingredients:  Matrixyl 3000, Peptide Complex, Natural Plant Stem Cells, Cucumber Hydrosol, Jojoba Oil, Vegan Hyaluronic Acid, Amino Acid Blend, Wild-crafted Periwinkle, Organic Licorice,</li>
            <li> I honestly do not see a difference so far.  </li>
            <li> The dark circles under my eyes don&#x27;t seem to be as dark as they were before beginning my OZ Naturals daily regimen.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, I wish I could get my money back!</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent literally hundreds of dollars on products that claim to do wonders for you.</li>
            <li> The Gel is clear and thick and kept hygenic in its&#x27; pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> A girl never can be to careful.  </li>
            <li> The wrinkles are minimal and the skin is brighter.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days.</li>
            <li> Oz Naturals Eye Gel goes on lightly; it&#x27;s not greasy; the puffiness has not worsened but has improved overall.  </li>
            <li> Not really working for my eyes</li>
            <li> Only a few days into using this product</li>
            <li> its only been a few days</li>
            <li> Saw some improvement but not as much as expected.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> eye gel has a faint cucumber fragrance, and it&#x27;s very easily absorbed by the skin, and keeps the skin moisturized.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Skin is softer around eyes, but did not really reduce lines.</li>
            <li> I have dark circles under my eyes because I am anemic and have been embarrassed by it for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say after crying for the last 8yrs after my fiance died...</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money and they do not offer a guarantee for refunding your money.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t need to be overly careful when putting it on, it does not irritate the eye at all.</li>
            <li> I have used it daily for the past two months and have definitely noticed an improvement in wrinkles, dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> Big fat waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> Not very hydrating like i had hoped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few nights and already I can tell my bags are smaller.</li>
            <li> when I use it, it feel like its only temporary for everyday use ......</li>
            <li> One night I had only a few hours of sleep, and used this under my eyes on my bags.</li>
            <li> My wife is always careful about using any product around her eyes.  </li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Did not work as expected.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is definitely smoothing and seems over time to firm and lessen wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> using it every night has still given me the results I expected after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have not really noticed any difference in my under eye bags.</li>
            <li> I work second shift and have trouble sleeping.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I have only been using it a few days.</li>
            <li> It has helped but not as I expected.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use until the product is empty.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s still some darkness, which is hereditary, but it&#x27;s easier to cover with minimal concealer</li>
            <li> and i have seen absolutely no results.</li>
            <li> There was minimal change.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks now and although my dark circles are not completely gone my husband</li>
            <li> They have a wide variety of products pertaining to every skin care needs.</li>
            <li> After it has dried completely (which takes a few minutes), I don&#x27;t even notice that I have it on.</li>
            <li> The only slight difference I have seen is a little brightening effect but overall not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> dark circles, but definitely makes them appear less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have found that the cream refreshes the skin to such a extent that I am using less concealer, because the dark circles are improving or appear less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just because it is all natural doesn&#x27;t mean hypo-allergenic.</li>
            <li> and I think that lightening dark circles around eyes is a long term process, if at all one believes that they can be lightened!</li>
            <li> The bottle is a little smaller than I had hoped, but luckily a little bit of this stuff goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I think that lightening dark circles around eyes is a long term process, if at all one believes that they can be lightened!</li>
            <li> It absorbs well and in the mean time it&#x27;ll hydrates and moisturized completely making your eyes non-greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was easy to put on, there was nothing unpleasant about it, and all in all, if it happens to work for you...</li>
            <li> A very small amount of gel covers my entire eye area, which means the product will last.</li>
            <li> I think using this every night with a deep moisturizing eye cream a few times a week would work extremely well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally decided this was ridiculous and decided to ask for my money back since they give a 100% guarantee.</li>
            <li> , I use it less and less, sometimes I think I am even wearing the Erase when I&#x27;m actually not.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;ll get rid of dark circles around eyes because no matter how expensive a beauty product is, it cannot turn back time and reverse the signs of aging from the face</li>
            <li> I would be careful with the pump because a little of this eye gel goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This little gel can take care of your dark circles, wwrinkles, sagging, puffiness, and dryness with a tiny amount!</li>
            <li> My issues are crows feet, somewhat loose lower eye skin and some dark circles.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of twice daily use, this product has done nothing for my dark circles.</li>
            <li> i tried this eye product but its not useful , only waste of money&lt;</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen improvement with dark circles yet, but I&#x27;ve only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> My husband has dark circles under his eyes from sleep apnea and after a few weeks I have already seen a big difference.</li>
            <li> The dark rings under my eyes have faded a lot, my uneven tones are starting to even out</li>
            <li> It work for first few days but makes it worse after</li>
            <li> Another perk, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way, one pump will cover both eyes.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long  way.</li>
            <li> I feel like a little will go a long ways with this product.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> This eye gel goes on easily; a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have any overpowering fragrance or any at all, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way, dont over use</li>
            <li> Just like the serum, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a  long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> my skin became very dry, I broke out, and developed these random patches of scaly, tiny bumps on my face.</li>
            <li> You only have to use a small amount for both eyes though as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> After using it for only a few days, my eyes look less puffy.  </li>
            <li> It made my eyes look less puffy and tired and lightened up the dark circles too, which has been a problem for me since as far back as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Will always buy from this store and try other products as well.</li>
            <li> but I convinced myself it did because of how much I spent on it!</li>
            <li> My husband mentioned the other night how my eyes look brighter and</li>
            <li> Extremely Well&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s  thicker than other eye products</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Not a pretty sight, if you&#x27;re a chick.    </li>
            <li> I would like to try other products from this brand.</li>
            <li> I only needed a small amount for both eyes.</li>
            <li> Any other product I have tried has not.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll order it again, and definitely won&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Perhaps not as much as other cream-based products that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Since I was beyond the return window, I decided to use the gel on other parts of my face and have noticed no difference in skin quality/wrinkles, etc.</li>
            <li> I can see the difference after only a few days!  </li>
            <li> It could be because of other products I&#x27;m using and it works in conjunction with that.  </li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It just takes a small amount and last me quite awhile.</li>
            <li> , I switched to every other day.  </li>
            <li> With some other eye gels I have used there was burning or irritation.</li>
            <li> extremely well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with any other eye creams, skin creams, retinols, etc.  </li>
            <li> Only a small drop is needed per eye.</li>
            <li> other say it does nothing.</li>
            <li> so sleep is a foreign word to me.</li>
            <li> but my all other concerns are taken care of by this product.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes along way because it&#x27;s rather fluid in consistency.</li>
            <li> I have never tried any other eye care products, so I cannot compare it to any other products.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products with no results.</li>
            <li> You just dab a small amount around your eyes, forehead and cheek area and its like an instant face lift!</li>
            <li> Also, I made the mistake, one night, of having slightly wet fingers when applying it, let me warn you do not do that!</li>
            <li> If I scrunch my eyes for a moment, then release, I can feel skin sticking to other skin.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know what can be done about this other than wiping off the product, which seems counterproductive.</li>
            <li> Second, this eye cream I&#x27;m not sure about yet.</li>
            <li> The company states they will give you your money back if your not completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> #34;treatments&amp;#34; on one side of my face and asked her if she noticed any difference in how I looked (comparing one side of my face to the other),</li>
            <li> I had some hopes regarding the other reviews that I had read before purchasing the product.  </li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t last past just a couple of uses though.</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of time to dry, but once you put it on</li>
            <li> It feels a little tacky when dry</li>
            <li> Because I used all 3 products it takes a little longer to dry</li>
            <li> I noticed a dramatic difference in the first few applications.  </li>
            <li> I am very careful what I eat and use on my body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using a very minimal amount of the product</li>
            <li> It does not completely remove the wrinkles, of course (this ain&#x27;t a miracle drug), but for me at least, it truly reduces the visibility of the wrinkles around my eyes--as long as I keep using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oddly, it actually makes my crows feet appear worse, if that is possible.</li>
            <li> Quantity is way tooooo less than what i expected...</li>
            <li> and it definitely has helped with my usual puffiness and dark circles.  </li>
            <li> Hopeful by all of the positive reviews, I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> but this one stands out and the other thing it takes care of dark circles, wrinkles, and sagging.  </li>
            <li> And then it feels tacky after it sinks in a little.</li>
            <li> Its so hard to find anything whether its facial, body or food that does have all kinds of unwanted and harmful ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, but just decided to give it a shot</li>
            <li> It helps with puffiness, as I am not prone to dark circle, so I can&#x27;t attest to that.</li>
            <li> The puffiness and dark circles under my eyes do seem to be improving after a month&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to get rid of the dark circles.</li>

            <li> This leads to a lot less waste.&lt;br /&gt;-Small and compact.</li>
            <li> After less than a week, the difference is noticeable -- and not just to me.  </li>
            <li> Like...you seriously look younger.</li>
            <li> I saw a slight change</li>
            <li> My eyes may look slightly lighter, but unless I use it, the lightness doesn&#x27;t stick.</li>
            <li> In th morning he&#x27;s less puffy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week and a half now</li>
            <li> I started to see results in less than a week.</li>
            <li> No tremendous difference.  </li>
            <li> I will write a follow up review when I&#x27;m half to three quarters of the way through the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anything less than organic/natural will never work for me.  </li>
            <li> The lines around my eyes seems less noticable and also reduces puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I look less like a mummy now.  </li>
            <li> my black cycles are still on my face for two weeks</li>
            <li> Paired with makeup I did feel like there was a slight difference compared to my previous usage of the makeup alone.</li>
            <li> are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I saw some visible results less puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> My eyes were starting to look very tired and the dark circles were too obvious.</li>
            <li> Made no significant changes To my dark circles .</li>
            <li> While I do notice a little of the puffiness and dark circles are gone</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s far less expensive than the other products I use for my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am 62 , very active, but you&#x27;ll never know it   </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not completely gone and it has taken a while to get to this point, but I can say that it works at least to some degree.</li>
            <li> A waste of money, does not reduce or eliminate puffiness or dark circles.</li>
            <li> After just a few days of using this product I noticed my dark circles were getting lighter, it&#x27;s not oily or greasy feeling</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few days now and have noticed a difference in the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have previously had little luck with eye products.  </li>
            <li> but I did not like the tight feeling and it in no way feels like a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It just dries tight.</li>
            <li> It leaves my under eyes feeling tight post use, and that means its working.</li>
            <li> this product did not work on puffiness but did a little on dark circles waste of time and money</li>
            <li> Had lunch with a long time male friend this week and was told I did not look so tired!</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using this eye gel, the bags under my eyes are less noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No noticeable result on my dark hereditary dark circles I&#x27;ve had since I was born--I usually don&#x27;t expect anything to help those anyway.</li>
            <li> They are no longer black and green.</li>
            <li> 60 years &amp; outrageous $$ later I am dark circle free.</li>
            <li> Can see a little differs in my lines around my Eyes.</li>
            <li> Dark circles have not lighten around my eyes!</li>
            <li> I have tried for years and used EVERY EYE CREAM imaginable , with little or no results.</li>
            <li> I also put a little moisturizer over it during the day, a lot at night.</li>
            <li> so a little goes</li>
            <li> It was a little sticky in texture on my face as well</li>
            <li> and I have felt that this little gel tightness around my eye area and smooths my skin.</li>
            <li> Diminished dark circles!</li>
            <li> My friend bought this eye gel about a month ago and she let me use a little bit of hers.</li>
            <li> Not sure why other reviews are so positve, but if you&#x27;re looking to see improvements, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> but I just didn&#x27;t think until I received the product and noted the crappy little container it came in.  </li>
            <li> little bit pricy for that size.  </li>
            <li> My dark circles are 95% GONE!</li>
            <li> It is also a little lumpy when I apply it.  </li>
            <li> notice when I use this eye gel that the skin around my eyes gets a little firmer.  </li>
            <li> , it looked a little</li>
            <li> Because it made me peel a little.</li>
            <li> The gel does sting a little when I put it on for about 10 seconds</li>
            <li> Not t worth the expense!  </li>
            <li> It was a little sticky under my eyes too.</li>
            <li> I apply a little after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> A little goes along way.</li>
            <li> I started using the product a little over a week ago.</li>
            <li> So I put the excess around my mouth area where I am getting a little jowly.</li>
            <li> My dark circles are gone after continued use of this eye gel!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over 2 weeks now.</li>
            <li> Just use a little bit and it does diminish lines around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> try my bags are diminishing little by little</li>
            <li> I usually can&#x27;t pump out a small enough amount, so I use the rest on forehead and small lines.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey but works well.</li>
            <li> I dab a little bit around both of my eyes during my morning and before bed routine and the skin around my eyes looks refreshed</li>
            <li> Little did I know that I am allergic to something in this eye</li>
            <li> As luck would have it, I came across this little gem.  </li>
            <li> Works a little to reduce puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> brighter and dark circles are going  away!</li>
            <li> No significant change but will keep using and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> I will also use it throughout the day if I think I need a little boost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye gel once a day for a little over a month now.</li>
            <li> It got a little clumpy after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> little about myself and my skin: I am 25, I work at a law firm and I&#x27;m attending law school at night, and I&#x27;ve got a killer commute (100+ miles in a car 4 days a week).</li>
            <li> Just haven&#x27;t seen a lot of results, eyes circles still very dark.</li>
            <li> Beware of allergic reactions, it&#x27;s not a pretty sight!!</li>
            <li> Be careful not to pump the bottle too hard</li>
            <li> There is however very little change in the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I had very dark circles with puffiness under my eyes after using this eye gel for a few days</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the price is that bad either, so it&#x27;s worth a try.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for about two months now and really don&#x27;t see any crazy changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t do anything it only freezes your eyes and makes them worse</li>
            <li> Actually makes crepe-ing under my eyes noticeably worse in the morning if I use it before</li>
            <li> Waste of cardboard.</li>
            <li> eh....... I have been using this for a few months.</li>
            <li> After a few days, my eyes puffed up...</li>
            <li> I can truly state that I noticed dark circles fade and small lines disappear.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it often because I purchased it for my husband, but from the few times that I have used it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not as puffy as I usually am and as dark either.</li>
            <li> For the price you cant go wrong and they are all natural too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sham.  </li>
            <li> have been using it for a few days.  </li>
            <li> After product dried around my eyes it made my skin even drier than before and caused creasing and irritation.</li>
            <li> and I have also been using it on my forehead on a few little&lt;br /&gt;lines</li>
            <li> Now I know why they named the company &amp;#34;OZ&amp;#34; because the wizard was sham at the end.</li>
            <li> and I use it a few times a week.</li>
            <li> a waste of money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been expecting to find some improvement at least on reducing the puffiness or preventing further minute wrinkles, but unfortunately there have been no such results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that using the product, and after some minutes of waiting, then applying makeup, will produce something like dandruff or tiny dead skin but isn&#x27;t either of these things, and I find it abit annoying to have to brush the tiny white particles away after applying my makeup.</li>
            <li> So in a few weeks I will write an up dated reveiw and tell you guys what u think.</li>
            <li> It takes all but a few minutes each morning and each night to apply but it works for hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well it works on color, since I don&#x27;t have dark under-eye circles.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It does have a heavy smell</li>
            <li> so I usually have dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I put it on everyday, Under my make-up.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Been using for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> but none have actually made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> I used the product just a few times, so can&#x27;t say if it does anything.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks</li>
            <li> My eyes looked a lot brighter and it seemed to even out the few wrinkles i have a bit.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My fault for buying it and my fault for missing the return date.</li>
            <li> like I had been crying for hours.  </li>
            <li> Waste of my money</li>
            <li> : I also make Green Tea Astringent.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Have been using for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I waited a few days to review</li>
            <li> I am using it for few days</li>
            <li> I plan to update my review in a few months with results after longer use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> br /&gt;waste of money waste of money</li>
            <li> + male here, with the eyelids drooping and just feeling tired.</li>
            <li> but  enough to take the tired look away.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles do not show after few days.  </li>
            <li> I have now discontinued it and moved on to yet another product that claims to firm and tighten.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> and it was a waste of time and money,</li>
            <li> There are few lines I can endorse as wholeheartedly as I can with OZ Naturals.</li>
            <li> It dried flaky under my eyes too so makeup didn&#x27;t stick and sans makeup</li>
            <li> See my review from a few minutes ago......</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference using this--a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I saw a change in my eyes in just those few days.</li>
            <li> It has a visible effect on the eye area within a few minutes of applying.  </li>
            <li> I already have a few wrinkles around my eyes</li>
            <li> Not an heavy smell but a hint.</li>
            <li> but after a few minutes you feel nothing and feels dry!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 50, but was just about resigned to looking tired all of the time.  </li>
            <li> Have used it for a few weeks and re-ordered already.</li>
            <li> Product dried somewhat flaky and tacky.</li>
            <li> After a few days I&#x27;ve seen a difference, already recommended it to friends</li>
            <li> A waste of money</li>
            <li> No more baggy eyes or dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had too much trouble with my eyes.</li>
            <li> Actually I think the eye puffiness is worse, so I have stopped using it around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have used it a few times but it irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> They could have added a few words in the &amp;#34;money guarantee back&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have not had any issues using the eye gel such as irritating the skin or burning.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a few weeks with no visible change in the under eye area .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I am not saying those things do miracles either, but this was a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> What a waste of my money..</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money</li>
            <li> They are just a waste of space.  </li>
            <li> Sounds like it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> oh well money wasted</li>
            <li> After washing my face with my clarisonic + my Dial acne face wash, I dried my face off and applied the gel on my under eye area.  </li>
            <li> I lasted a few seconds, so I wasn’t bothered, but I wanted to mention it.</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the eye gel for a few weeks now and have received compliments on how rested I look.</li>
            <li> I apply the gel on the eye circles daily for a month, but not happy with the result.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this a few months and have been onward with the results.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> I just ordered this a few days ago and have been using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I had been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> For being a gel I was worried it would be too heavy or greasy</li>
            <li> It got worse the third day.</li>
            <li> Within just a few days of beginning use of this product I noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> Waste of time unless you want to receive and be billed for stuff you do not want.</li>
            <li> It was almost as though it left a thin layer of dried cream on my face.</li>
            <li> My dark circles are not nearly as pronounced, the puffiness has decreased dramatically and there&#x27;s just something about this Oz eye cream that I think may be addicting.</li>
            <li> It went on rather thick, but I left it thick, thinking it might not fully absorb.</li>
            <li> I have had puffiness and dark circles for the past few years.</li>
            <li> Nothing extraordinary , I feel I just wasted my money :(</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re looking to reduce black eye circles, puffiness, and small wrinkles, this may not be for you.</li>
            <li> I noticed immediately a brightness and less wrinkles, I will order this product again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks and my under-eye area is already less puffy than usual.</li>
            <li> So I am not sure if the slight improvement is the product alone or the combination of things.</li>
            <li> and my eyes fee like they are less puffy!</li>
            <li> My black circles are gone!</li>
            <li> No diminished darkness under the eye, no fine line diminishing....</li>
            <li> It does dispense very small amount, so the 1 ounce might last a month, but am not sure!</li>
            <li> The product is unscented so there was no strong odor.</li>
            <li> Many of the expensive department store brands cause this unpleasant reaction.</li>
            <li> I have really bad dark circles under the eye and this product really helped in just 2 days</li>
            <li> Instead, there’s a very slight cooling sensation as the gel dries.</li>
            <li> I have seen absolutely no difference in my dark circles and tired looking eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small pump, but a little eye gel is all you need.</li>
            <li> My dark circles under my eyes are hardly noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Suitable for anyone who is looking to reduce those gruesome wrinkles around the eyes, and looking for a product formulated to avoid puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well I haven&#x27;t been using this eye gel not for so long, I haven&#x27;t seen a changed yet,  but my wrinkles around my eyes haven&#x27;t gotten worse</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product to target this problem for the past few years, but have not found anything that helped.</li>
            <li> I have thrown out a lot of eye gels in the past few years, because I know if I don’t like how things feel, then I am not going to use them.  </li>
            <li> and you never want to risk any alcohol, fragrance, or other questionable ingredients that will give you wrinkles in the long run.</li>
            <li> My eyes appear to be less wrinkled (which is hard for me to believe that a gel can do that -</li>
            <li> It feels sort of heavy and thick even though it is a gel, and takes a few minutes to soak in.</li>
            <li> Since using, I have noticed subtle changes in the puffiness and appearance of dark circles underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> No more dark bags &amp; unwanted lines!!</li>
            <li> but after seeing no change after a little over a month, I wanted to return it, but was told it was too late...</li>
            <li> I have horrible dark circles and fine lines under neath my eyes.</li>
            <li> No more puffiness and no more dark circles!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m so young and my dark circles aren&#x27;t so bad</li>
            <li> Pkg arrived yesterday and at least 2/3 of product was missing.</li>
            <li> not sure I see a difference but will finish the bottle....will not reorder.</li>
            <li> Big fail.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the small print.</li>
            <li> This product works unbelievably well on my eyes and solved my issues which haven&#x27;t been solved by Algenist, Benefit and Clarins eye cream.</li>
            <li> for these little mean things gone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the anti-aging function</li>
            <li> In fact, I looked well rested and the only way people knew i was tired was because I mentioned it!</li>
            <li> Sad that companies go through such measures for sales.</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s all it&#x27;s cracked up to be, but it does help with winter dryness.  </li>
            <li> I usually wake up with puffiness under my eyes, an unfortunate recent development that I have found nothing helpful for... until now.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure what the raves are about.</li>
            <li> After several weeks of use, sadly, I see no changes at all.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t  have a lot of time to waste on long treatments or complicated  instructions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 30 days.  </li>
            <li> Through the years we both have tried dozens of products; expensive dept store lines, drug store lines, mail order only lines of products.</li>
            <li> Not sure about this cream</li>
            <li> I like it but not sure of anything coming from it</li>
            <li> ALSO REDUCED SMALL WRINKLES AROUND EYES AND MOUTH.  </li>
            <li> I took pictures of my eyes and they look no better at all.</li>
            <li> For me this product was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I apply a small amount on each eye morning and night and</li>
            <li> Use a small amount.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product and all I can say is &amp;#34;try it&amp;#34; you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> product was so small</li>
            <li> Just use a small dab.  </li>
            <li> I went past the 30 day mark thinking it took longer to show some results.  </li>
            <li> Only thing, I don&#x27;t recommend using it in the mornings before makeup if you do wear makeup because it leaves a film where you applied it, so it may leave a weird spot under your eye when you put on foundation or concealer.</li>
            <li> So when the eye cream came out I was anxious to try it</li>
            <li> I noticed it was quite small</li>
            <li> Not sure.  </li>
            <li> Not sure there are long-term effects though.  </li>
            <li> My circles have not changed from my use of this product in the past two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure I will reorder at this time.</li>
            <li> This serum comes in a small dispenser and it took me a while to realize that when it says just use a pea sized dab, they are not kidding.</li>
            <li> I usually have allergy problems with eye gels and creams.  </li>
            <li> So farm I&#x27;m not sure..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I would use this during the day (unless I was going to be home or go without makeup) as it does leave a sort of film like another reviewer mentioned.</li>
            <li> Plus no notable change in the under eye area.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I woke up with swollen eyes after the third application.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works, yet I&#x27;m still trying it</li>
            <li> I was not sure if I would see continued improvement as I used this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if it working......</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the small size scare you, this small container lasts for months.  </li>
            <li> It does firm the eye area though so not all negative.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same texture as those expensive capsules that cost a million dollars.</li>
            <li> I plan on continuing to use this product, not sure if I am seeing the results I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> During that process, I must have moved my skin the wrong way because I left a crease in the skin where my finger was.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the puffyness.</li>
            <li> and I could see a difference within a few minutes !</li>
            <li> I noticed I always looked tired but never really paid attention to my puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mommy to a crazy 2 year old</li>
            <li> This small bottle will help you get rid of that stubborn raccoon eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used a small dot for both eye lids.</li>
            <li> Not sure when it happened</li>
            <li> Sorry, I didn&#x27;t get back to you sooner.</li>
            <li> I am anxious to see the results after a weeks use.</li>
            <li> I have used this eye gel for the past year.  </li>
            <li> This does seem to be helping with the small lines around my eyes</li>
            <li> When I received an invitation to try some products from the OZ Naturals range, I did my usual research and read up about the brand and its products before accepting.  </li>
            <li> No problems with it, just not sure if any results yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m liking the results I&#x27;m seeing in just a few weeks!</li>
            <li> You just dab a small amount around the eye area.  </li>
            <li> Feel a small tightening effect when applied.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it improves the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Less wrinkles!!</li>
            <li> So all those people buy and say a work is not true !!</li>
            <li> I have had bags and dark circles under my eyes for years made worse by lack of sleep.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work. :(</li>
            <li> My eyes looked incredibly tired, puffy and had rings so dark a racoon would be envious.  </li>
            <li> First Off I Hate the smell, It smells like pickles.</li>
            <li> It has worked consistently on my dark circles, made worse by allergies and bone structure.</li>
            <li> I used to use expensive eye cream and would always get little whiteheads under my eyes, or it would melt down and cause me to break out on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I feel like the discoloration has lightened ever so slightly and the under eye puffiness has decreased to some extent</li>
            <li> I look less tired.</li>
            <li> and I have been looking less tired.  </li>
            <li> I usually apply mine twice a day with a very small amount.</li>
            <li> I was tempted to over indulge applying it as it is a very thick consistency, but all you need is a little on one ring finger , tap them together and tap around the eyes with each finger</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t hardly wait to see the crows feet between my two brows disappear.  </li>
            <li> And sometimes there is hardly a difference.</li>
            <li> In truth, I should probably resign myself to these imperfections, spend my hard earned money on cover ups and concealers instead.</li>
            <li> but none compares to this little guy!!</li>
            <li> But I guess it&#x27;s mainly because I stay up too late all the time :(</li>
            <li> I see a huge decrease in my eye puffiness which is one of the worst things about my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 20s.</li>
            <li> not so much, at least, for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an eye cream fanatic.  </li>
            <li> Designed For The Delicate Skin Around Your Eyes; Including Eyelids&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still, I don&#x27;t want to leave this delicate eye area unprotected.  </li>
            <li> Eye gel is supposed to work immediately to at least reduce puffiness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since late May 2015 and still nothing.</li>
            <li> I ate chicken last night so my face and eyes were so puffy and swollen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use this in hopes of at least looking like</li>
            <li> It remains tacky on the skin and causes the delicate under eye area skin to bunch up an stick.  </li>
            <li> I like the delicate scent, but will not purchase this again.  </li>
            <li> ( I found that though I was using expensive products I wasn&#x27;t seeing the results I expected and wondered if it was from the additional ingredients they put into these products.)</li>
            <li> Since using this I have honestly never been happier with my face.</li>
            <li> This SUCKS the MOISTURE</li>
            <li> At least I&#x27;m not out a lot of money and it didn&#x27;t hurt anything.</li>
            <li> But it didnt work at all at least for me.</li>
            <li> Lately, I have also noticed noticeable bags under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Common sense -</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had no allegeric or negative reactions to this product.</li>
            <li> I use it at least once a day</li>
            <li> Like to give products at least 30 days.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve noticed absolutely no difference in my under-eye circles, surrounding wrinkles, or puffiness.</li>
            <li> I recommend a thick moist eye cream to counter the dryness.</li>
            <li> The wrinkles or should I say laughter lines are slowly improving.</li>
            <li> This is a thick, gel moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> But, I cannot use it during the day, it&#x27;s just too thick and puffs my under eye area out.</li>
            <li> It is a bit thick for an eye gel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using it as a makeup base for my whole face instead of just the eye area.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> A real waste. .</li>
            <li> Super disappointed with this!  </li>
            <li> You will see results hands down!!!  </li>
            <li> Not very happy with no one addressing this.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Semi-hydrating, I mean it is a gel and not a cream.  </li>
            <li> I mean go into any drugstores and eye creams and face serums are close to this price.</li>
            <li> nothing else has, I mean they are still there</li>
            <li> , sorry I spent the money!</li>
            <li> I mean, what company does that these days?  </li>
            <li> My dark circles are lightening, and my creepy eyelids have improved a lot.</li>
            <li> If anything my dark circles are worse!  </li>
            <li> The burning sensation is only very faint when put around the lower lash line area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a seriously disappointed 29 year old.</li>
            <li> It comes in a very small pump dispenser (0.5 ounces of gel -</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very small bottle, with a squirt lid</li>
            <li> I have puffiness and dark circles that unfortunately run in my family.  </li>
            <li> spend a lot of time reading every day, sometimes painfully small print, and my eyes often look tired at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> I was using a nationally known and expensive eye cream, but still had dark circles.</li>
            <li> No noticeable changes in my dark circles unfortunately.....</li>
            <li> (in time for this  serious</li>
            <li> Save your money if your are really serious about looking younger.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Not for serious eye-area help by itself (unless your under 40 years of age).</li>
            <li> My girlfriends tried a sample, too, and we all agreed that it had an immediate subtle effect.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m seriously thinking about using a laser treament.</li>
            <li> I take my skin seriously...</li>
            <li> Seriously though.  </li>
            <li> Leaves the skin around the eyes feeling tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> However, not very long after that, my face starts to feel slightly painful...</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is the size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even been putting the gel on the furrows I was getting between my eyebrows (which were beginning to show even when I wasn&#x27;t actually furrowing) and on my naso-labial lines, which I had begun to notice but didn&#x27;t think were too bad.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s not a good product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve just purchased it, do yourself a favor and ship it back because I&#x27;ll be shocked if  you like it.  </li>
            <li> My sleep patterns are... not good, and my eyes (specifically, the bags under my eyes) prove it.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in an eye treatment for this price and results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it has done anything for my (admittedly atrocious) dark circles, but I like it as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this would turn out to be a gimmick product for ladies desperate to turn back the hands of time.  </li>
            <li> A month later I am a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Icky!  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s fake or what.</li>
            <li> A big disappointment!  </li>
            <li> I never write reviews on Amazon (although I get Amazon pkgs at least once a week!)</li>
            <li> Plus very disappointing was how tiny the bottle is for $20.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed by the small bottle size</li>
            <li> then what expected but not to bad and</li>
            <li> Come back after a few cups of coffee and, Holy Crap!!  </li>
            <li> Has smoothed out lines and wrinkles and now my mum&#x27;s addicted to it.</li>
            <li> Using this has helped me not look so tired</li>
            <li> Lack of sleep, a proliferation of stress, and a poor diet can all affect the way our eyes look.</li>
            <li> It seemed to have made it worse...</li>
            <li> This eye gel seems to make bags look worse.</li>
            <li> Not great.  </li>
            <li> I always looked tired and disheveled.</li>
            <li> As a mom of a toddler I get tired often</li>
            <li> Nothing I used helped at all, they just seemed to get worse every year.  </li>
            <li> My under eyes looked worse than ever before.  </li>
            <li> Over the months they became progressively worse.</li>
            <li> No great improvement</li>
            <li> In fact, it made the area under my eyes look worse.  </li>
            <li> Rather than let it get any worse, I tried this to see if it would decrease both the puffiness and darkness, and it does both.</li>
            <li> I have noticed an improvement in my tired eyes.  </li>
            <li> I do not look as tired since I started using it.</li>
            <li> There is science behind hyaluronic acid reducing wrinkles, and in fact it did help over a couple of weeks use.</li>
            <li> Not at all irritating to eyes.</li>
            <li> &amp; I don&#x27;t look as tired.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for approximately 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> - I was looking worse with it so time to try something else.  </li>
            <li> My eyes don&#x27;t look as tired anymore.</li>
            <li> , dnd thought this gel eye cream would be the answer, but not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced a reaction like that to an eye cream before.  </li>
            <li> I agree with another reviewer about it not great under makeup.</li>
            <li> tired looking eyes and darker areas beneath the eye.  </li>
            <li> I always recommend using an organic/natural product around the eyes because the skin is so thin</li>
            <li> My eyes always look tired.</li>
            <li> The one I was previously using is suddenly impossible to find.</li>
            <li> Puffiness is not as bad, the dark under eyes are disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a really bad dark circles</li>
            <li> I still have dark circles under my eyes but not as bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed, having seen only negative results.</li>
            <li> Terrible smell, feels like wet paste on your skin and dries to a tight, pasty finish.  </li>
            <li> is very subtle.</li>
            <li> They dried my eyelids out so badly that they looked like wrinkled crepe paper.</li>
            <li> I developed a horrible rash with this product</li>
            <li> Very disappointing as I use other OZ Naturals products.</li>
            <li> I have been sick for the past 4 days and this has helped my tired</li>
            <li> After like 3 days, my dark circles were reduced to 30 - 40 %!!!!!</li>
            <li> Waste of money do not buy this item:(</li>
            <li> Waste of money :(</li>
            <li> just not sure the effect??!!!</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product as it did very little for my eye bags.</li>
            <li> (weird feeling)</li>
            <li> NOT IMPRESSED.</li>
            <li> Here is the basis for my mediocre rating:&lt;br /&gt;1.  </li>
            <li> I was already skeptical.</li>
            <li> I just have to write a review to counteract what must be a lot of fake reviews to help people from being scammed.  </li>
            <li> It had a faint cucumber fragrance, and on checking I can see that cucumber extract is one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Looks like a lot of fake reviews.</li>
            <li> Obsessed with all OZ Naturals Products</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have that tired look!</li>
            <li> Unable as a result to say how well the product worked.</li>
            <li> I have stopped buying expensive cleansers and creams as nothing even comes close to their products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am not impressed.  </li>
            <li> I wake up in the morning and without fail, look like someone has slapped me silly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed that it hasn&#x27;t worked with me, and am not sure if I will buy again.</li>
            <li> But I have also had worse!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skeptic until proven wrong.</li>
            <li> Sorry to report it did not help my swollen lower eyes at all</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this cream did not work for me, although I was hoping I found the one.  </li>
            <li> found this product to be mediocre.  </li>
            <li> Sorry folks,</li>
            <li> (I purchased a serum and cleanser as well), but unfortunately they weren&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not work with me, I did not notice any result</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I read what this eye gel could do</li>
            <li> Worthless don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I am no virgin to expensive &#x27;this and that&#x27; sold from my dermatologist-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Parkinson&#x27;s, neuro-degenerative diseases, and premature aging have all been attributed to this infamous</li>
            <li> sorry tried it already.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical that the reviews of this product might be fake but let me tell you..</li>
            <li> In fact, my eyes look worse - puffier and with &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; below - yikes!  </li>
            <li> This is....just weird.</li>
            <li> this is an expensive product.</li>
            <li> No chemically, fragranced fake smel in the this.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it has done nothing for me, no change or difference.</li>
            <li> well I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Take this back and reformulate it because it is your worst product ever.  </li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> sorry to&lt;br /&gt;say.</li>
            <li> I used to buy expensive products</li>
            <li> Totally worthless waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about ordering skin care products online, but I thought with all the 5 star ratings, I should give it a go.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have used expensive eye treatments and I have to say that OZ Naturals</li>
            <li> I applied this eye gel before bedtime, woke up the next morning with redness around my eyes, my eyelids were drooping terribly where before I had no drooping.  </li>
            <li> After about two months of using this, I suddenly got a terrible reaction.</li>
            <li> but this reaction has caused pain under my eyes, weird wrinkly lines and dryness.</li>
            <li> Beware of fake reviews.</li>
            <li> I have no intention of undergoing plastic surgery for this silly problem.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after two weeks of using it my allergy did hit my eyes, so I can not use it anymore...</li>
            <li> I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say ladies, no noticeable difference</li>
            <li> I am so sad that this did nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> I use to think I would age gracefully and not worry about silly bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> You might say I am obsessed with your products.</li>
            <li> Wrote a review saying after 2 weeks use - no difference, not impressed.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the &amp;#34;quick&amp;#34; review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Designed for all skin types, you can’t go wrong giving this skincare product for your eyes a try.</li>
            <li> Scary, I&#x27;ll never by this product again.</li>
            <li> 34;new mama tired eyes&amp;#34;  will be reordering!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say</li>
            <li> I am a picky, 42, smoker (unfortunately).  </li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> This gel gave me an eye allergy, which is really weird since I have never had any problems with any products before.</li>
            <li> A lot of false comments!</li>
            <li> - yes, I agree, *very* poorly named for a vegan ingredient!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it was basically impossible because i looked so tired.</li>
            <li> all a joke , seller rude,  crap</li>
            <li> i have terrible dark circles and puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> so i was worried and afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> cold snap)</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t be afraid that it irritates your eyes with that cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> Now I am afraid to use it.  </li>
            <li> It stinks, but</li>
            <li> , Then I transfer to a spray bottle, put in fridge, get really cold</li>
            <li> I started using the tea bags, cucumbers and cold gel masks</li>
            <li> My eyes were blood shot, puffy and awful this morning after a night of drinking, heavy makeup</li>
            <li> I also have had basically no sleep this week and a cold.  </li>
            <li> I have a crazy work schedule</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been recommending the product like crazy.</li>
            <li> so it is cold when I apply.  </li>
            <li> Terrible redness and the burning just killed my undereye.</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of expensive eye creams that didn&#x27;t come close to what this eye cream does!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get past the terrible smell!</li>
            <li> - I thought that meant they are working and was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any real dramatic results</li>
            <li> It dries the eye area and makes me very uncomfortable to wear it.</li>
            <li> I have really bad sleeping habits</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how bad it is.</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to this product.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t effect my skin in a bad way.</li>
            <li> Maybe I received an expired or otherwise bad shipment.  </li>
            <li> too bad.</li>
            <li> Maybe my eyes do not look as bad as I thought it did for being a FTM.</li>
            <li> The bags under my eyes in the morning were getting so bad and everything I tried wasn&#x27;t helping.  </li>
            <li> and I was shocked at how well this eye gel worked -</li>
            <li> so disappointed as&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great eye gel!  Very effective!</li>
            <li> no visable results. will not buy again</li>
            <li> After using this for months, I wasn&#x27;t completely whether if it was making a difference. But now, I have no doubt it works! Because...recently, I went about 2 weeks without using it. (I ran out of it, and wasn&#x27;t able to get around to reordering it for about 2 weeks.) In that two weeks that I stopped using it, I noticed a gradual but significant increase in the appearance of the wrinkles around my eyes, as well as increased dryness. Now that I&#x27;m using the gel again, I have seen a significant decrease in the appearance of the wrinkles around my eyes. It does not completely remove the wrinkles, of course (this ain&#x27;t a miracle drug), but for me at least, it truly reduces the visibility of the wrinkles around my eyes--as long as I keep using it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Can see a little differs in my lines around my Eyes.</li>
            <li> It is  a great eye gel, it does not irritate my eyes and that is a biggy for me! It helps with puffiness, as I am not prone to dark circle, so I can&#x27;t attest to that. But it does appear that my laugh lines are reduced.</li>
            <li> Feels smooth, but not effective.</li>
            <li> Overall good product for this price. Non-irritating and it&#x27;s okay. Would probably purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is the only eye moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used that seems to make a difference.  The puffiness and dark circles under my eyes do seem to be improving after a month&#x27;s use.  It comes in a .5 fl. oz bottle, which was dismaying to me at first.  But no problem because, as with all Oz products, only a very small amount is needed at a time.  Be careful not to pump the bottle too hard or you&#x27;ll release more gel than needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, I&#x27;ve been washing with the Vitamin C cleanser, then applying the Vitamin C serum.  Then I pat on the eye gel and finish with the Sea Infused Herbal Moisturizer.  In the evenings, I wash with the same cleanser and just apply the serum and eye gel.  I&#x27;m 60, have dry skin, and absolutely love the results I&#x27;m seeing.</li>
            <li> My daughter told me abut these products and I was shocked at how well this eye gel worked - I noticed some skin drooping on my eye lids and used this and they went away!  shocking!  I have never had a product you could use on your eye lids safely.  This is it.</li>
            <li> This product is so sticky under my eyes, the skin on my lower eyelids/under eyes stick together (weird feeling) after I put this on. I have used this three times, each time hoping it will be better, and each time I use this the same gross stickiness happens. NOT IMPRESSED. Don&#x27;t waste your money, I wish I could get my money back!</li>
            <li> I use for 4 months and my black spots and wrinkles are the same....</li>
            <li> The misses loves these little items and they make great Happy Day presents.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best eye gel that I have used, and it smells so good, and the best part is I got it free!!</li>
            <li> Pkg arrived yesterday and at least 2/3 of product was missing. I returned product yesterday, same day as arrival. Pkg is different from previous order; pump does not work as well. Also, pkg allowed one to view what amount was left in container. Will not order again until changes are made as product is good.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It does a good job in firming up the skin around the eye.  It is the best product for this problem that I have come across so far( and I have tried a lot).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous products and this has been the best. Notice a difference after 4 minutes of applying. It&#x27;s like the skin just tightens up. Good stuff. Will def buy again.</li>
            <li> I received this to test at a promotional price and I like it.</li>
            <li> I received my cream and noticed a change right away.  Can&#x27;t wait to continue using it.</li>
            <li> It causes no irritation and blends nicely. Not seeing any change in lines or puffiness.</li>
            <li> This gel has reduced my bags under my eyes. Doesn&#x27;t seem to get rid of the dark circles. I like it but will probably try something else next time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool.  Sort of does the job.</li>
            <li> Excellent eye cream!!  Better than estee lauder.</li>
            <li> This product did NOTHING.  It promises to be the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; eye gel for dark circles, wrinkles, and puffiness.  My problem in those areas is moderate,but I saw not one degree in improvement and I have almost used the entire container. I used it twice a day.  It came with a money back guarantee and I fully expect a refund.</li>
            <li> great product.  works as advertised.  would order from again.</li>
            <li> After receiving the trial with cool on the eyes，Effect is uncertain</li>
            <li> not sure I see a difference but will finish the bottle....will not reorder.</li>
            <li> Like the coolness when first applied, haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my bags or fine lines but it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks...However what I did notice was an immediate tightening I will continue to use and look for improvement.  Also love that I can use over the entire eye.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my eyes appear less dark but not really the wrinkles, fine wrinkles. I am in my late 20s. I will purchase another product next time.</li>
            <li> This stuff really helps your eye not only feel like there not tired but look like there not tired. Worth the price, helps me feel younger and more put together. Great buy/Great product!</li>
            <li> My eyes are not young. This gel relieved puffiness, first. Wrinkles, second. It didn&#x27;t perform a miracle as I hoped, but I will definitely buy again. Best product I&#x27;ve found for the price.</li>
            <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t do anything it only freezes your eyes and makes them worse</li>
            <li> My son tell me about this and then I order it&#x27;s good...... after one week you can see result.:)</li>
            <li> Big fail. No difference on my undereyes or dark circles.  Actually makes crepe-ing under my eyes noticeably worse in the morning if I use it before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do better with plain old NOW coconut oil for adding moisture to the eye area and reducing fine lines.</li>
            <li> This product suppose to reduce my under eye bags, but often I feel the strange tingeing and itching with this &amp;#34;all  natural product&amp;#34;. Thanks goodness I did not use it very often, because of this stinging sensation and some redness after application of gel. So I continued to use it on and off early in the morning to get rid of the puffiness. Mostly it worked, but with time I have noticed two other  side effects - the under eye area became noticeably dry and wrinkled. This product caused more damage to my skin than help. So, buyers, beware !</li>
            <li> A lot of false comments!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this cream as read all the positive reviews. However it did nothing for me. so disappointed as&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to finally find something that would help my dark circles, the only reason I did not return it was because of&lt;br /&gt;the price and other more expensive creams I tried were just as ineffective as this cream.</li>
            <li> So far I have found this eye cream to be very good at smoothing out crow&#x27;s feet.  I use it with a Vitamin C Serum over my entire face.  Together they give my face a very soft feel.  I look forward to what it will accomplish by the end of the first month.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I think it works well.  Need to use more often.</li>
            <li> It was just okay.  I didn&#x27;t get the results I expected especially since others rated this so high.  I have tried several eye creams/gel over the years and was very happy with one that was made by genesis pharmaceuticals that was very reasonable in price, but they discontinued it.  Since then, I just can&#x27;t find another one that is as good let alone for a similar price.  Here is the basis for my mediocre rating:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Moisturizing - just okay; I found that I still needed another moisturizer in addition this this one.&lt;br /&gt;2.  For highly sensitive skin - I have very sensitive skin and this seemed to do well without causing any skin reactions.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Cost - I believe I can get better results for same or lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;4.  Dispenser - While the pump dispenser is easy, it&#x27;s probably too easy and therefore can easily dispense too much resulting waste.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ve been spoiled for so many years with my other (eye) moisturizer.  I&#x27;ll keep searching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll try something else to get better results.</li>
            <li> I was noticing that I was getting some dark circles and starting to get some wrinkles in the corners of my eyes from squinting a lot. So after trying Bioelements eye cream with no results I looked for something comparable in price, that wasn&#x27;t from the drugstore and filled with cheap ingredients. I came across this and it was highly rated so I purchased a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was that it came in a HUGE box. Waste of cardboard. And when I opened it the label was really crooked. The presentation and the language describing the product did not seem upscale beauty at all. I was already skeptical. A month later I am a bit disappointed. I don&#x27;t really like the gel consistency. It doesn&#x27;t pat into my eyes well and I feel like I have to smear it under my eyes. And then it feels tacky after it sinks in a little. My lover eyelids sort of stick when I blink and it&#x27;s very strange. I even use half a pump because a whole pump is WAY too much for just your eyes. I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change in my dark circles or wrinkles unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see how some people could love this product. Some of the other points in reviews are true - it&#x27;s not greasy, the gel is cooling, etc. but for me it just wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting, or looking for.</li>
            <li> Good for puffiness but not that great for dryness</li>
            <li> I just have to write a review to counteract what must be a lot of fake reviews to help people from being scammed.  The ingredients are the most highly rated ingredients for an eye cream but the amount in this cream must be microscopical (if even true) as it really is one of the worst creams I have tried and I am obsessed with finding a good eye cream for my aging eyes.  At least it didn&#x27;t hurt me but it did do absolutely nothing. No hydration whatsoever and is very gooey so you can&#x27;t wear under makeup.  Hope this helps save others from wasting money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a week now and have already noticed a difference! I love it. My crows feet seem less visable and the dark circles under my eyes are not at noticeable. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as an all over facial mosturiser, and its been very good. I have dry, sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t cause any irritation. It comes in a pump dispenser so no germ laden fingers contaminating a pot...its quite light and easily absorbed into my skin. It had a faint cucumber fragrance, and on checking I can see that cucumber extract is one of the ingredients. That soon dissipates though, so there are no worries about clashing fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;I like to keep my diet and skin treatments fairly natural if possible, and this company specialises in that.&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied with product for review, and have been using it daily for four weeks and would be happy to continue with it.</li>
            <li> eh....... I have been using this for a few months. Like most promising eye creams, this doesn&#x27;t do the job at all.</li>
            <li> Great product! I notice a huge difference. My under eyes have never been better. I have really bad sleeping habits and I really had to make an effort to change that, but now that I use this cream it helped so much more with the darkness and eye puffiness. Will repurchase soon!</li>
            <li> I cannot speak to how the product works, only what happened for me. Just because it is all natural doesn&#x27;t mean hypo-allergenic. After a few days, my eyes puffed up...so if you are sensitive to natural products, be careful. I discontinued use and in a couple days was fine.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream!!! It makes my eye lids feel very refreshed.  I&#x27;m definitely going to keep buying this!</li>
            <li> This product seems to be improving my skin.  I will reorder.</li>
            <li> Easy to wear and I&#x27;m starting to see some improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for over a month now and I am disappointed because of all the great reviews...I do not see a difference</li>
            <li> I bought this because a friend swore it was excellent...not so much, at least, for me.  Being a gel, it does plump the skin as any moisturizer would do, but I&#x27;ve noticed no long term effects.  I got the same results from every eye cream I&#x27;ve used (many of which are cheaper by far)...no long term reduction in puffiness, no long term reduction in wrinkle appearance, no long term reduction dark circles.  My friend thought this product was associated with Mehmet Oz.  It is not.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Great shipping speed! Still waiting to see results...</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve seen so far. I noticed a change within 2 days! Not kidding. This is excellent. The only problem I have is that it has to be re-ordered all the time...in the same month! For what they charge (it is a good deal, I have to admit), but they need to come in BIGGER BOTTLES. I&#x27;ve heard this exact complaint before when I was reading on-line comments before I purchased it and took the chance. But I&#x27;ve already re-ordered twice of this product and the others and with all the cash they are getting by the constant re-ordering, someone needs to talk to the owner/CEO.</li>
            <li> Very nice eye gel, takes a while but it works!</li>
            <li> Buyer beware of the 30 days you have to decide if this product works! There were so many 5 star reviews that I thought this was worth a try. Well, it didn&#x27;t work for me. I needed some help in erasing dark circles under my eyes. This product is rated number one by Amazon for &amp;#34;dark circle treatments&amp;#34;. I used this product religiously day and night for two months because I wanted to be fair and give it an adequate amount of time to see results. I did not realize that all the OZ products have a 30 day limit on their guarantee. I saw absolutely no improvement. I finally decided this was ridiculous and decided to ask for my money back since they give a 100% guarantee. Doesn&#x27;t work that way. I didn&#x27;t read the small print. After 30 days the guarantee is no longer valid and you cannot return the product or get your money back.  The company must be inferring that you should see results before 30 days is up. If you don&#x27;t, be sure to contact the company, because results are not forthcoming.</li>
            <li> I had results from this product after just two nights! Amazing! Under my eyes is the most noticeable signs of aging and I have not seen any results from previous (expensive) products I have tried. I am so pleased with this product! It feels so good to find something that actually works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now and I&#x27;ve been getting compliments from my friends. They say I look younger. I also noticed that the lines and around my eyes are gone. Love this product and I love the price. I&#x27;ve spent literally hundreds of dollars on products that claim to do wonders for you. This one does it and does not break the bank. Another perk, a little goes a long way. I use it every morning and every night for several months now and it will probably last another couple of months.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know if this has made a difference with the dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell any difference in under eye puffiness but I like the feel of the product.</li>
            <li> Excellent, this is my second bottle. I feel it as soon as I apply and it really works well.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Balls&amp;#34; up under makeup...won&#x27;t use again.</li>
            <li> Great for the price....</li>
            <li> This eye gel is not working as well as I had hoped.  I know you need it give it time to work.  I believe I have been using Oz Naturals for almost a month.  I will give it more time and write another review.</li>
            <li> Feels cool, refreshing and makes eye area skin feel firmer</li>
            <li> I have to say that Oz has changed the appearance of my skin dramatically. This gel is awesome. It&#x27;s very light on the skin, very thin so a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s feels refreshing when it&#x27;s on your skin, nearly like fresh cucumber. I&#x27;ve been using this a while. Would dred thinking what my eyes would look like without it. Has smoothed out lines and wrinkles and now my mum&#x27;s addicted to it. Naturals ingredients and Not tested on animals!! Result!!! Thankyou Oz!😄</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this - it&#x27;s very soothing - i&#x27;ve ordered it again - so i&#x27;ll see if it continues working.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Very fast shipping....</li>
            <li> well, i have allergy to cucumber. the more natural the cucumber ingredient is, the more sever my face reacts. so i was worried and afraid to use it. But still i want to give a shot, so i tried it. For the first 3 times, nothing happened and I was quite happy. However, not very long after that, my face starts to feel slightly painful... I have to give up and gave this to my husband...i wish expecting result will happen to him.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give an accurate and fair response to this product, so I used the product for over a month to see some type of results. I can truly state that I noticed dark circles fade and small lines disappear. My eye area appears brighter. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> BEST eye gel ever. Have been using for three months and wow, what a difference. Won&#x27;t stop! using. Ever! Thank you OZ Naturals!</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a decrease in darkness under my eyes as some commenters have.</li>
            <li> i think thiss worked good for me.</li>
            <li> Really GREAT product, really eliminates the dark circles and puffiness! I was happy to get the deal on this item and review it! I recommend it to everyone who has the dark circle, puffy eye problem after they wake up this will really work for you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an eye cream fanatic.  This might be good for hyper pigmentation (can&#x27;t tell yet), but I can tell the skin around my eyes feels more dry than usual (which is what causes wrinkles.  I&#x27;m 36 with no wrinkles bc I&#x27;ve been very diligent about using hydrating eye creams.  Gonna have to switch back to a cream (as opposed to a gel) or switch back and forth to be able to get the hydration this area needs.  Hope this is helpful!</li>
            <li> pefect for me!! will buy it again!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eye cream. It feels really good around my eyes. I also put this around my lips and any remaining on my forehead area for some extra moisture. After that, I put my vit C (or Hydro serum) and let that soak in. I finish with the Super youth cream. I really like this eye gel. I have sensitive skin around my eyes and this did not sting when I applied it the first time. I am on my 3rd bottle already. you only need one pump for both eyes as the dispenser gives you a nice size when you pump. So a bottle goes a long way! I have noticed an improvement in my skin and eye area since using these products together.</li>
            <li> love this eye gel but the bottle is too small -goes too quickly:  i put some during the day around my eyes,cheeks and around my mouth: look so fresh afterwards!</li>
            <li> I always have puffy eyes and dark circles. This product works unbelievably well on my eyes and solved my issues which haven&#x27;t been solved by Algenist, Benefit and Clarins eye cream. Will always buy from this store and try other products as well.</li>
            <li> Really light eye gel, rubs in effortlessly.  My wife now swears by it!</li>
            <li> After 3 days use, I noticed that the dark circles under my eyes looked better.  I will continue use.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. It feels great on my eyes and I can see a difference. I will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I really love this eye gel! I feel like it wakes up my eyes in the morning and I use it every night too!</li>
            <li> This made my eyes itch.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with the great reviews in mind, but frankly, this has done nothing for me. I know everyone is different and some things work for some people and not others, but I won&#x27;t waste any more money on this product.</li>
            <li> The only reason this gets a star is because it is required. This product is terrible didn&#x27;t work at all! Dark circles have not lighten around my eyes!</li>
            <li> This is pretty good. I don&#x27;t use it often because I purchased it for my husband, but from the few times that I have used it I can say that it works alright (I am light-to-medium skintoned). My husband on the other hand has used this pretty much every night and day and I can honestly say that his dark circles are clearing up! They&#x27;re not completely gone and it has taken a while to get to this point, but I can say that it works at least to some degree. He is light skintoned.&lt;br /&gt;This product has a light scent of cucumber and is a clear, light gel. It&#x27;s a decent size for an eye product and I would say it&#x27;s probably worth the cost and worth a try. I cannot say whether or not I would buy this product again for myself since I have not used it enough to give it a fair opinion, but I could see my husband wanting this again.</li>
            <li> It feels good, but hasn&#x27;t helped my dark circles at all - not sure if anything will though :)</li>
            <li> Would not rate this the best, just average.  I needed to use a lot to get any effect and moisturizing and the effects were not as good as my prior eye gel.</li>
            <li> Very mall quantity and haven&#x27;t seen any difference, but it&#x27;s otherwise ok.  Not expensive, anyway.</li>
            <li> OZ Eye Gel was Great&lt;br /&gt;not sticky and made all the wrinkles alot less noticeable&lt;br /&gt;no skin irritation and loved the results</li>
            <li> Love it. Moisture eyes and feels fresh</li>
            <li> Ummm, I&#x27;m not sure how this is a #1 best seller.  I used this stuff faithfully, twice a day, per directions for use for a couple of months.  Nothing.  No change. Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product is really amazing I do have the fine lines and I&#x27;m ready ro for these little mean things gone I will be back in a couple days to let you know how it&#x27;s working, I&#x27;m very excited about this product</li>
            <li> This is a very nice eye gel ad I do see some improvement in my under eye area. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I live in a harsh winter climate and need to use a moisturizing eye product on top of this. I think once winter is over I can wear this alone without dryness. I have to say this eye gel has helped with morning puffiness a lot. And contrary to some reviews I read before buying, this has not interfered with my makeup at all. I received instructions via email from the seller on how to apply so I followed them and had great results.</li>
            <li> Looks like a lot of fake reviews. Some even post pics from two different people posing as before and after. What people will do to sell their products...Unreal!!! This product didn&#x27;t do anything for my under eye bags.</li>
            <li> I have been using Super Youth Eye Gel for a month now. I am 59, and I was not seeing good results with any of the products I had been trying. I have been using some very &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; and fairly pricy products from the selection at QVC. When I found OZ Naturals on line, I had never heard of them before. I kept reading about them for about 6 months befor I finally ordered. I really do like this eye gel. It goes on smooth, and my eyes are looking much better. I use this product all over my eye area, even on my eyelids. My dark circles are lightening, and my creepy eyelids have improved a lot. I will continue to order this product and look forward to continued improvement. And, we just ordered some for my daughter.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream I have ever tried. Must have for your eyes...</li>
            <li> Only been using for a short time, but have found eye gel very refreshing and I am pleased with the results . I have very sensitive eyes and this did not irritate them at all. Will continue to use and hopefully see even more improvement.</li>
            <li> I use many of the OZ Naturals products and love them.  The eye gel is amazing and has diminished the fine lines around my eyes.  It took about 2 weeks of using the product to begin noticing a difference. Overall, a wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> Obsessed with all OZ Naturals Products and this is no exception! Great results and great product!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Really works unlike anything I have ever used. Dark circles, puffiness and discolouration - bye bye</li>
            <li> Very nice texture and you only have to use a small amount to cover entire eye area. My eyes felt and looked more awake and looked smoother underneath. Easy to apply make up over. I&#x27;m Only  giving  4 stars because I&#x27;ve only used it twice after receiving yesterday. So far, I like it and am looking forward to seeing the results over time.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for about 4 days.  I believe my eye area does look better and I do like the feel of it..no burning or odor which makes my eyes water.  I am excited about this product and will continue to use it to see if my eye area looks even better. I am holding out on the 5th star until then.   Also, another reviewer&#x27;s comment about liquid cucumbers is accurate.</li>
            <li> The eye gel has a great texture, and little bit goes a long way. It&#x27;s great for makeup application too!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cream. It&#x27;s more of a gel-like consistency but it&#x27;s incredibly moisturizing. I suffer with chronic eczema between my eyes and above my lips, usually only prescription creams work to hide the eczema...but surprisingly this works too!!! It almost miraculous, I&#x27;ve been using this for over 2 weeks now on my eyes and eczema patches and i haven&#x27;t seen any flare ups since I started. I&#x27;m not sure about the anti-aging function but boy does it moisturize! I will be purchasing this over my prescription cream!!!!! :) &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I have never actually written a review of a product but feel I need to because this eye gel really does help eliminate puffiness.  I am in my late 50&#x27;s and have tried so many products with no results.  I have been using for three days and see very noticeable results.  I can&#x27;t wait to see results after a month.  This Eye Gel does what is says it will do.  Definitely a five star product.</li>
            <li> Im impressed with the results that I&#x27;m already seeing since beginning this eye gel! Its only been a week and my dark circles around my eyes aren&#x27;t so profound! Super excited about the long term results. Thanks for a great product that works! (the statements made in my review are in my opinion only)</li>
            <li> I purchased this because Its the holidays in retail and I&#x27;m working long hours. My eyes were starting to look very tired and the dark circles were too obvious. Let&#x27;s just say, I have been using this for 1 week and I love the results! After my 5th day of 11hr work shifts and 4 hour night sleep. I didn&#x27;t have that tired look! In fact, I looked well rested and the only way people knew i was tired was because I mentioned it! Good product, followed the email directions.</li>
            <li> Amazing results in just 4 or 5 times using OZ. I have tried for years and used EVERY EYE CREAM imaginable , with little or no results. I recommend this OZ cream as it has de-puffed my eyes and started to remove many, many , many years of darkness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to re&#x3D;order this Oz gell, so I can have one on hand in my purse, make-up bag and also one at home when I put on make up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Colleen</li>
            <li> A waste of money, does not reduce or eliminate puffiness or dark circles.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my hereditary puffy eyes. Hopeful by all of the positive reviews, I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. Well, I did. The product has the consistency of hair gel...mostly watery. It did absolutely nothing for my eyes. So, I feel certain that the positive reviews are fake. Sad that companies go through such measures for sales. I would give it zero stars if it was possible.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I am in my mid twenties and really do not have any wrinkles, but I noticed that this does perk my eyes up a little and it is a great preventative for wrinkles. I trust the OZ Naturals brand!</li>
            <li> I was picked to review this and let me just say I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;m always leery about using eye creams, but this one seemed to have did the trick. I&#x27;m not as puffy as I usually am and as dark either. Using this has helped me not look so tired and I love it!</li>
            <li> Minor improvement noticed after 2 mos.</li>
            <li> Very small container - you tend to use it up fast &#x27;cause there is no way to &amp;#34;put it back&amp;#34; into the container. I&#x27;m not convinced it really works as people say it does, have to see???</li>
            <li> If you look at the picture I&#x27;ve attached I treated the left eye (well it&#x27;s my right eye but it&#x27;s the one on the left in the picture) for two and half weeks without treating the other Eye. The picture was taken about three hours after application. I used it typically two times a day sometimes only once.  The untreated Eye did get regular moisture or sometimes Mary Kay Eye moisturizer.  As you can see in the picture there is some reduction in under eye wrinkles.  There is however very little change in the dark circles.  They do look slightly better since the skin is more taut but the color is really nearly the same.  For me the effects weren&#x27;t  really cumulative either, if I didn&#x27;t use it for a day both my eyes looked basically the same after about 24 hours without use.  so I will be keeping it since it did help but I&#x27;m still searching for something that will improve my dark circles more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! I have suffered from dark circles and puffiness for several years now - and that is something no Botox can fix! Nothing can and I tried EVERYTHING! Had been using the most expensive product Le Mer for years - It really didn&#x27;t do much but I convinced myself it did because of how much I spent on it! My yoga instructor is gorgeous and has the most amazing skin so I asked her what she uses and she said &amp;#34;All the Oz Naturals Products&amp;#34;. She is 53 but totally looks 34. For the price you cant go wrong and they are all natural too. I LOVE my skin now and my eye puffiness and dark circles are literally gone. This is amazing under concealer and as a bonus it acts like a primer. I swear it keeps my concealer on longer. People keep commenting on how much younger I look and how pretty my eyes are - guess they couldn&#x27;t get past the dark circles to notice my blue eyes! I even bought this for my daughter. She&#x27;s 21 and I am so happy she is starting to use these products at a much younger age than I!</li>
            <li> This Eye Gel is the best I have ever used! The Gel is clear and thick and kept hygenic in its&#x27; pump dispenser. Once you put it on your skin, it quickly absorbs with no greasy feel. Within just a few days, I saw fine lines diminish and my eye areas was smooth and indeed, VERY youthful looking. I had no sort of allergic reaction or redness whatsoever. My skin accepted it right away.  I am also starting to put it on my forehead where I have some wrinkles. I simply cannot live without this Eye Gel. Another great product from OZ Naturals. They are my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; brand. No more wasting money on the brands sold in the department stores that really just don&#x27;t deliver. It&#x27;s OZ only for me.</li>
            <li> Made my face break out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Eye Gel for a couple of weeks now.  I do like that it&#x27;s a non scented gel, it does not irritate my sensitive eyes, easy application.  However I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s all it&#x27;s cracked up to be, but it does help with winter dryness.  Dark circles are still there.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this eye gel from Oz when I called recently to inquire about their products. I started using this gel with their two serums. I am happy enough with this gel--the fine lines around my eyes seem dimmer...but I must honestly admit that I see absolutely no difference in the dark circles around my eyes. Perhaps this gel is not made to address that issue? Or, perhaps two weeks is too short a time to see any real difference in dark circles? Either way, I am glad to be using this gel as it certainly moisturizes and nourishes the under-eye area without leaving a greasy or shiny look (which a lot of eye creams do, and which I frankly find most annoying.) I am hoping that with sustained use, the darkness of the circles will also diminish somewhat. I am giving it five stars as I have no complaints and I think that lightening dark circles around eyes is a long term process, if at all one believes that they can be lightened! (A girl can hope, right?). I am happy with their serums, so am ok giving this eye gel a chance and using it for a longer period of time before I pass any final verdict on its in/effectiveness.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of twice daily use, this product has done nothing for my dark circles.</li>
            <li> My dark circles don&#x27;t seem to have improved after a couple of weeks using the product.</li>
            <li> It did not do anything for the the puffiness under the eye -- perhaps it would help the younger woman, but it does not help an older woman.</li>
            <li> Having used some of the most luxurious and expensive eye gels in the world…To my amazement this product which is actually &amp;#34;Eye Gel&amp;#34; not &amp;#34;Eye Cream&amp;#34; as described is definitely one of the best I have EVER used….It targets multiple issues, Dark circles, Puffiness, Bags, Crows feet, Fine lines and gives an extra feature...it actually lifts the skin under the eye area to give a more youthful appearance. I use it twice a day morning and night and i actually noticed a difference within two weeks, after six weeks  friends kept asking me if i had something done but they couldn&#x27;t tell what. After nine weeks my eyes look like they did in my twenties and i am 45. The ingredients are all natural and plant based. BEST product on the market and the price is unbelievable. I Promise  you will not be disappointed and will end up using nothing else. Cheers !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase! I have the worst under eyes from lack of sleep!!</li>
            <li> Super disappointed with this!  If anything my dark circles are worse!  I&#x27;ve been workng long hours though this product doesn&#x27;t do a darn thing except seriously dry your skin, so f you want lo give this a try I recommend a thick moist eye cream to counter the dryness. No help for puffiness or crow&#x27;s feet either.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It really works!! My eyelids are always puffy and this makes my eyes look bright and feels light. Just minutes after applying. I will recommend this to anyone and will purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> good product; good price.</li>
            <li> My wife started using the Best Eye Gel Eye Cream for her eyes and the product has really helped her.  She had sacks under her eyes and the eye creme made those sacks go way down and it makes her look younger and she really likes that.  She is hooked on the product and told me to order some more.  I don&#x27;t know what is in the product, but it really works great!</li>
            <li> I got the OZ Natural for free,  I&#x27;m Soo happy it works wonders,  I will definitely continue to use this product,  thank you</li>
            <li> This works the best if you use it in an upsidedown triangle pattern under each eye. You can leave it on overnight to have healthy looking eyes in the morning or when you have puffy eyes from crying or allergies, it has been working in all of those situations so far for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, I have a genetic dark circles since I was a child and i try many many products but nothing work as I wish. This product is AMAZING it&#x27;s help a lot with my dark circles i feel it much lighter and smoother. I used it with OZ natural vitamin C serum and it works great :) I&#x27;m soo happy with the results</li>
            <li> MY EYES LOOK YOUNG AGAIN! DEFINITELY RELIEVES PUFFINESS</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but not great.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last week after an endless search for something that will help me get rid of the under eye bags. My issue is genetic and I know that I will not be fully able to get rid of them, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend money on eye creams that will do a mediocre job. This eye gel is amazing! I can see a SIGNIFICANT difference in just a few days. It de-puffs and cools the area around the eyes. It&#x27;s sooo soothing. I love it. This is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Are you worried about your skin aging?  The area around your eyes is so sensitive and shows aging a lot sooner than the rest of your face.  When you use OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel,  you&#x27;re getting vegan, cruelty-free, paraben-free, sulfate-free, mineral oil-free, lanolin-free, gluten-free, and GMO-free anti-aging goodness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is no runny serum.  No sir!  This is a thick eye gel that targets only the areas you chose.  It absorbs quickly and thoroughly into your skin.  Not only is this a great product for your eyes, you can use this on your whole face for a brighter, more radiant complexion.  OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel can be used multiple times per day and works it well on all skin types. The eye gel will not clog pores and doesn&#x27;t contain parabens, sulphates or alcohol and it works well under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our eyes say a lot about us. Lack of sleep, a proliferation of stress, and a poor diet can all affect the way our eyes look. Puffiness, bags, and dark circles don&#x27;t show us at our best.  Sun exposure and the inevitable aging process contribute to crow&#x27;s feet and even wrinkles on the upper lid. This is why OZ Naturals has created Super Youth Eye Gel. It&#x27;s all-natural product is designed to give you real results.</li>
            <li> I like this eye cream better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  This is a great product to use at night!  while it hasn&#x27;t complete eliminated my dark circles, it has lightened them enough that I often forget to use concealer during the day!  The container makes it easy to dispense the right amount, but if more comes out I just use it on my lips or other area that may need attention.</li>
            <li> The gel glides on very smoothly, however, I actually think it makes my eyes puffer. I&#x27;ll give it some time. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t deliver immediate results. Glad it was realitivly inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I love this line so much ...I never make recommendations but this line specially the eye gel is worth five stars I look forward to writing my recommendations on each and every product everyone should try....i&#x27;m a young 53-year-old and in my 20s worked in a cosmetic department and been blessed to try many products and this is by far the best</li>
            <li> LOVE this eye gel! I&#x27;m very adamant about using only all natural/holistic and cruelty free skincare and makeup, and have tried many many different brands. Probably have sampled every brand at Whole Foods alone. Well I had never found an eye cream yet that seemed to be making any difference as far as not just maintaining my skin, but having real anti-aging (meaning wrinkles) results. BUT! After just only 3 weeks I started to notice the lines around my eyes had diminished! Hallelujah! Also the gel absorbs very quickly which I really like as my regime sometimes consists of applying several products, and I always want to speed up the in between &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; process of each one. But lastly the next best factor about this product is the price. All of OZ Naturals products are so low priced in my opinion compared to other natural products and that&#x27;s the biggest plus. They are a fairly new line I believe, so I hope they don&#x27;t start raising their prices once they become more known and their popularity skyrockets.</li>
            <li> I just received this product in mail, I have been only using a week trying to get rid of my dark circles. I had two coworkers noticed the difference akready. I also love how it is made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Eye gel didn&#x27;t get rid of my cirlces neither did they make a difference. Waste of money do not buy this item:(</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product long, but I think I see a difference already in reduced under-eye puffiness. This product absorbs easily and quickly, and it doesn&#x27;t make my eye makeup smudge as other eye products do. Very happy I tried this product.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for 2months and I did not like the results. My eyes are still puffy, still dark. It seemed to have made it worse... I am so unsatisfied with this product and will not be getting it again.</li>
            <li> I had dark circles under my eyes. Now I don&#x27;t. Great product.</li>
            <li> OZNaturals Eye Gel - Eye Cream For Dark Circles, Puffiness, Wrinkles - This Anti-Wrinkle Eye Gel Was...&lt;br /&gt;from OZ Naturals...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OZNaturals will not clog pores and contains no parabens sulfates or alcohol Provides a perfect base for makeup application while delivering outstanding moisturizing capabilities. Lightweight gel like that absorbs quickly without leaving your skin sticky. I apply this eye gel in the mornings and at night after I clean my face with a facial cleanser.  It dries fast and I am able to wear under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this eye gel by OZNaturals for the dark circles, puffiness, and of course the crow&#x27;s feet.  I have used this product now for several months and I have noticed that the dark puffy circles have faded and the lines around my eyes have become less noticeable. My husband mentioned the other night how my eyes look brighter and younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, one pump will cover both eyes.

            <li> Great feel and absorption. I use twice a day all over face but concentrate on eyes. I have noticed a difference under eyes and around. They look even toned and smooth without puffiness. I like that it is free of parabens and has natural ingredients. Hard to find in an eye treatment for this price and results!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I usually wake up with puffiness under my eyes, an unfortunate recent development that I have found nothing helpful for... until now.  Applied morning and night, my eyes look great!  The personal email that comes with Oz Naturals products is just one example of the professionalism of this company.  I love that I can trust this product to use anywhere on my face... not just on my eyes... and that it contains no parabens, sulfates, or alcohol.  Just buy it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now &amp; I can already see a noticeable difference in the circles under my eyes. They appear lighter and even a little smaller! I recieved this product on discount to give a review and it will definitely be a product I purchase again and would recommend to my friends</li>
            <li> I use this at night after washing my face and during the day. It firms the skin and I don&#x27;t have dark circles any more. I also put a little moisturizer over it during the day, a lot at night. all of the OZ ingredients are either organic or natural ingredients, no chemicals! I am very careful what I eat and use on my body. My goal is to eliminate toxins so that I am as healthy as possible. I have beat hep.c and MS and am continuing in excellent health because I don&#x27;t ingest or use toxins, ever. Toxic ingredients don&#x27;t benefit the consumer, GMO, artificial colors, sugar, salt, chemicals all produce a cheaper or a more addictive product that in no way is anything you want to ingest or use on your body, ever!&lt;br /&gt;The new clear dispenser is perfect! I always wondered about these dispensers and just how much product was in them and now you can see exactly how much is left. Great to know when to re order so you don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin when applied, is very easy to apply, just dab it on, and it stays there-doesn&#x27;t drip off!!</li>
            <li> It did not work for me at all</li>
            <li> I like this eye gel very much. It&#x27;s a clear gel and it&#x27;s  thicker than other eye products so a little goes a  L O N G way.&lt;br /&gt;The actives are substantial.. like Aloe (a great first ingredient,) Matrixyl 3000 along with peptides,  plant stem cells, vegetable glycerin and much more. The first 10 ingredients are all actives and are either kosher or organic or  a cosmeceutical.&lt;br /&gt;Top notch ingredients give you top notch results.  This product soothed my dry skin.. (in time for this  serious So. CA. cold snap) and it feels good going on.  75% of the ingredient list is organic... which is something I love to see. I READ ingredient labels. Do read the ingredient list and note that it&#x27;s seriously great and has a lot of active ingredients from beginning to end and not the junk you seen in a lot of brands.&lt;br /&gt;I like the OZ Naturals  brand because they want you to be happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with gratis product for me to review. It in no way affects my ability  to review things honestly.  It just allows me to try the product so that I can recommend it (or not)</li>
            <li> helped with the puffiness under eyes alot.  did not notice any inprovement with wrinkles. will purchase again</li>
            <li> Just starting using this eye gel; but love it so far!!</li>
            <li> Awesome for eye bags and wrinkles!!  A keeper and I will rebuy for sure.</li>
            <li> The return policy should have provided me insight into the quality of the product line but I was too impressed with so many glowing reviews.(Now I wonder how many are real).  I also read a business news item about  the products flying off shelves and how well the company is doing.  Great, I thought - and bought the WHOLE LINE.  It&#x27;s a sham.  Did nothing for my skin.  Beware of companies that don&#x27;t back up their product with a generous return policy:  there is a reason</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure what the raves are about. it&#x27;s okay. nothing great.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Been using it for about a month and I see no difference.</li>
            <li> Always hoping for magic in a jar, I ordered this by description &amp; reviews alone. After several weeks of use, sadly, I see no changes at all. Sigh. At least this product was under 20 bucks, I&#x27;ve spent more for other eye treatments that didn&#x27;t work as promised either. I would not recommend this to friends.</li>
            <li> After just a few days of using this product I noticed my dark circles were getting lighter, it&#x27;s not oily or greasy feeling and I love that it&#x27;s more natural and less chemical</li>
            <li> I usually love OZ natural products, but this didnt work or change anything around my eyes at all. It was a little sticky in texture on my face as well so I couldnt use it if I was going to wear makeup.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT AGAIN THIS WORKS VERY FAST TRIED IT ONLY ONCE  AND NOTICED A CHANGE RIGHT AWAY LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to love this product! As an Image Stylist, I am always finding organic products to help myself and my clients look and grow Younger and Healthier. I sold cosmetics and skincare for many years.&lt;br /&gt;This added no moisture. Although it smells yummily like cucumbers, It feels as if it sits on top of my skin and does not penetrate.&lt;br /&gt;Oddly, it actually makes my crows feet appear worse, if that is possible. It goes on as a gel and feels sticky as it dries, and then just doesn&#x27;t do anything from what I could tell.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is great.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it had actually moisturized or primed or SOMETHING.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it would show results over the long haul?? (always an optimist...)&lt;br /&gt;Auretha,&lt;br /&gt;Visibility Expert &amp; Soul Stylist&lt;br /&gt;Aurethadotcom</li>
            <li> Good eye cream. Good for dirk circles, wrinkles, and puffiness. Can be used as an all over your face treatment.</li>
            <li> This Eye Gel is really good. After using it for over two weeks , I can honestly say that it works. I was tempted to over indulge applying it as it is a very thick consistency, but all you need is a little on one ring finger , tap them together and tap around the eyes with each finger and it sinks right in. My crows feet are gradually disappearing and people have commented how smooth they look . Yes! I would thoroughly recommend this product. Thank OZ Naturals!</li>
            <li> I now have several Dr. Oz products and I like them all.  I wanted to try this one because if the puffiness under my eyes.  I was given the chance to try it complimentary  to give my honest and unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a few days.  I first wash my face, apply Vit. C serum, moisturizer and then the eye gel.  I apply the gel under my eyes and between my eyebrows.  It goes on nice, it&#x27;s light and not greasy at all.  I have noticed a slight improvement already.  So I plan on continuing using this eye gel.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Try the entire line.  They are great.</li>
            <li> Although product suppose to be natural I had an allergy to the product. Broke out in red whelps under my eye.  Returned for credit.&lt;br /&gt;I have never had an allergy to a product before.  Unable as a result to say how well the product worked.</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels when I put it on.  I use it day and night.  I didn&#x27;t take a before picture, however I can see the changes.  They&#x27;re not drastic but I sure feel a lot better about my eye area!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this eye gel for 5 days so I really can&#x27;t say if it works miracles however I really do like the gel.  It seems like I have less lines and I CAN tell that my dark eyes are not so dark.  So that is a big plus. I will keep using this product.</li>
            <li> After product dried around my eyes it made my skin even drier than before and caused creasing and irritation. I bought this product after reading so many favorable reviews, however after testing the product myself I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product does what it states....puffiness minimal now, pores on my face appear much smaller, and skin is smoother around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;This is a keeper!! Just wish it cames in a larger bottle!!</li>
            <li> I have been using several different Oz Natural products for a while now and absolutely love them.  I have stopped buying expensive cleansers and creams as nothing even comes close to their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 40&#x27;s and have sensitive skin so I was always looking for products that are paraben and sulfate free and as natural/organic as possible while still getting the results that big brand names promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product really helps with puffiness and fine lines under my eyes and I have also been using it on my forehead on a few little&lt;br /&gt;lines and it really has diminished them.  I love that it goes on smooth and absorbs very quickly leaving my skin feeling hydrated and non greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use Oz Natural products as they are top quality, affordable and they work!</li>
            <li> This is great and I used it on my whole face sometimes! A little goes a long  way. So calming to my skin, I let it dry and then proceed with other lotion and makeup. !!!</li>
            <li> It smells like cucumber and has a very silky texture.  Tested it on the back of my hands and i saw a difference in texture just within a couple minutes of it drying.  Got a deal from SnagShout but i will definitely buy this again once i run out.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see that it has made any difference</li>
            <li> I have used this for 5 days along with the OZ Naturals Best Retinol Moisturizer and the OZ Naturals Best Hyaluronic Acid Serum...I am already seeing results with decreasing visibility of crow&#x27;s feet, smile lines, and brow lines.  At age 45, this is the first product that I can say really does what it claims.  I have used department store brands, designer cosmetic store top sellers, and top line drug store products, and none can compare to the results of these 3 products.  As a reader of Product Reviews, I never post a review...until now...this is worth the money because it delivers what it claims to do for your skin.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is wonderful? It feels like Silk when I put it on.  I use it morning and night.  My dark circles are lighter and some of the puffiness is gone too.  I see a big difference under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  I have sensitive combination skin and frequently get a reaction or breakout from any anti-aging face products. With OZ Naturals eye gel I&#x27;ve had no reaction and my skin looks more plump and smooth.  I use it all over my face and like that it is a gel, comprised of quality ingredients,l and not a greasy cream.  Absorbs easily and I have no issues wearing it under my make up.  I would continue to use this as my go to moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Falling in love with this product is super EZ.  This is my third bottle.  After applying Jan Marini Eye Intervention eye cream, I dab OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel under my bottom lashes where &amp;#34;luggage&amp;#34; would normally settle in, above the brow line and where crows feet SHOULD be, but, are not.  If I&#x27;ve any left over on my finger tips, I dab a bit within the laugh lines and above the upper lip too.  A girl never can be to careful.  I adhere to a very well structured beauty routine.  In doing so, I hv managed to find my own fountain of youth with fabulous products such as OZ Naturals Super Eye Gel.  Upon application I can feel it working.  There&#x27;s a cool, tingly feeling, it&#x27;s soothing.  This is how I know it&#x27;s working.  This, and all the amazing compliments I receive on my skin and youthful look.  It&#x27;s a product I&#x27;ve recommended to others and never a complaint, only thanks.</li>
            <li> This is a great gel for the eye area.  It leaves the bags of the eyes smooth and soft and refreshed.  It has a great smell - you can smell the natural ingredients contained in the product</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t worked for me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used eye gel before but I am seeing progress with this eye cream and am extremely happy that I found it. My eyes have always had dark circles and I can already see them looking better. You can use it all over your face to reduce wrinkles and my forehead seems to be appreciating that. I was able to find this product through snagshout.com and got it free.</li>
            <li> Have been trying out a few Eye gel recently &amp; find this to be excellent.  TQ</li>
            <li> Great product, makes my skin feel so smooth and diminishes dark circles.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely worthless! Does absolutely nothing. Who&#x27;s writing these reviews? It&#x27;s like watered down Vaseline that you put under your eye and nothing whatsoever happens. I never complain but this is too egregious. Now I know why they named the company &amp;#34;OZ&amp;#34; because the wizard was sham at the end. Smdh.</li>
            <li> I feel like a little will go a long ways with this product. It has a cooling effect which I like. Hopefully in the long run I will notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I was contacted by this company asking if I would be willing to try three of their products and give a review. After reading all the ingredients and reviews, I said Sure! The OZ company quickly arranged for the Amazon codes so I would purchase these products complimentary. So here I am, I&#x27;m a REAL person and in no way obligated to write a positive review and will not gain a penny or additional products for my opinions.&lt;br /&gt;I used this OZ Eye Gel  in combination with OZ Hyaluronic Acid Serum and OZ Vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;First I apply the Super Youth Eye Gel, then in the morning I apply the OZ Hyaluronic Acid Serum. Right after I apply this serum, my skin feels tight and needs some moisturizing. The serum definitely absorbs quickly into my skin. After I apply a simple organic coconut oil, thats it.&lt;br /&gt;The same procedure at night. First I apply the Super Youth Eye Gel. Then OZ Naturals Vitamin C Serum following by my Coconut oil as moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I used OZ Eye Gel for about 25 days now and have been noticing a slight improvement to my skin. Nothing significant, but I&#x27;m seeing that my skin around the eyes is very soft and looks smooth.  I did notice it give my skin a better tone and gave a brighter appearance over all.&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed after 25 days:&lt;br /&gt;My skin is still soft and I didnt have any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;The lines between my brows are less obvious, the instructions says that this eye gel can be applied in between your eye brows as well, so I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 25 days this bottle is half full, so I would say it may last 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I&#x27;m having with this product is that my eyes have a burning feel toward the second half of the day and in the evening. I&#x27;m going to contact the company to figure out what chemical may cause this or if I&#x27;m allergic to something or maybe i need to rewash around the eyes and re-apply the gel again?. I never had this problem before. For this reason I will give it 4 stars out of 5.</li>
            <li> okay: notice no changes yet....</li>
            <li> I was quite impress with this product.  If you sparingly dot it on and let it dry, you actually can see an improvement under the eye area.  This was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> AWESOME LOVE THIS STUFF!!!!</li>
            <li> So happy with eye product, my new go-to essential</li>
            <li> I have used this twice a day for 3 weeks and have not noticed even a slight difference. I have even had people telling me I look tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please look at how many of the 5 star reviews say they received the product for free for an &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; review. I paid for mine, close to 20 dollars, and was never offered a free product. I will be ordering something different but not from this brand as I now feel I can&#x27;t trust any of the reviews. As much as they say they received the product for an &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; review... after seeing no results (if not negative results...) I don&#x27;t believe most of the reviewers on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how so many people got the product for free but I wouldn&#x27;t keep using it even if it were free.</li>
            <li> The dark circles and puffiness under my eyes have begun to disappear after just one week of daily use of this gel-- just wish it came in a larger container!  It does dispense very small amount, so the 1 ounce might last a month, but am not sure!</li>
            <li> Absolutely softened the appearance of fine lines around my eyes. Very pleased with the product!</li>
            <li> I like it, it truly diminishes my black eye circles and puffiness BUT I&#x60;d put it on only at night before bed as its consistency makes it impossible to put on a concealer on top (the concealer wouldn&#x60;t just stay, it will roll on your skin) plus the skin where you put the gel looks greasy and shiny. I only put it at night and wake up with good results.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  Very happy with it.  Does just what it says.  Will continue to purchase it as long as it&#x27;s available.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This eye gel seems to make bags look worse.</li>
            <li> light and easy to absorb, keep your eyes shining in the morning</li>
            <li> Just like all their products, this is also great. It works great, doesn&#x27;t have a ugly smell, feels great. I&#x27;m  a mother of 5 so don&#x27;t  have a lot of time to waste on long treatments or complicated  instructions. Oz is the one for me. From face wash, eye gel, serum, . The works. Thank you so much love the products and the prices.</li>
            <li> Honestly I have tried so many eye creams because I have bad dark eye circles. I wanted to not wear makeup during the week to school to let my skin breathe but it was basically impossible because i looked so tired. Before i buy a product i research every detail about it, in the end i decided this eye cream was the best choice for me. It honestly has helped my eyes look so much fresher i can go without makeup, it works for fine lines, puffiness and dark circles. After being impressed with this product i bought a couple more from Oz naturals. I reccomend this and will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I buy Oz naturals, not only are they really great, their prices are good too.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom. She initially just tested it on her hand and she said it was really soft and  nice. She used it again in the morning on her eyes. She said again that its nice and it does seem to smooth out her eyes.</li>
            <li> very good cosmetic for eyes....&lt;br /&gt;my mother love it.  and me too.&lt;br /&gt;These costs are not irritating to eyes moist feeling.&lt;br /&gt;The desire to try the company&#x27;s products such later date.</li>
            <li> The best eye cream I have ever used</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s always a first time for everything as this is my first time writing a review and it feels liberating :-)&lt;br /&gt;I am a big advocate of the natural approach and this product did it for me. It delivered as promised!!!!</li>
            <li> I am a newcomer to OZ naturals. I, like many before me, have used many products that claim youthful eyes.  However, because of the favorable reviews, the natural ingredients, and the price, I decided to give the Super Youth Eye Gel a try.  I have been using it morning and night for two weeks. I love the texture as it goes on very smoothly without feeling heavy.  In fact it has a wonderful cooling sensation.  I can feel a tightening of the fine wrinkles each and every time.  What I like best is the way it brightens and highlights the skin around my eyes.  I no longer feel the need for concealer.  This product does everything it says: reduces puffiness, decreases appearance of fine lines, and brightens.  I am quite impressed.</li>
            <li> Just found out about OZ Naturals recently and ordered 3 products.....one of them being the Super Youth Eye Gel.  Used it the first time after a short night of 5 1/2 hours sleep.  I was pleasantly surprised at how bright the under eye area looked.  I have had bags and dark circles under my eyes for years made worse by lack of sleep.  This product helps tremendously.  Also appreciate and love that the products are cruelty free.  Super Youth Eye Gel is a winner!</li>
            <li> I bought this item around Christmas, mainly to address my dark circles. So far it works OK and I use it a few times a week. Maybe I would have better results if I used it daily? Or just got better sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like about it is the nice way it makes my skin feel like it&#x27;s tightening up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say I need to use it longer to be able to tell 100% if this product will remove my dark circles.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a thing. No improvement no changes. Hype is all it is. Just felt like a,dab of moisturizing liquid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past 30 days.  My eyes look amazing!!  The wrinkles are minimal and the skin is brighter.  I am so happy with this product.  ENJOY!!!</li>
            <li> I luv the eye gel my crows feet disappeared in a matter of wks i will continue to use it forever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the eye gel for just about 3 weeks, I can tell you that the name doesn&#x27;t lie.  This really is the BEST eye gel I&#x27;ve ever used!  I could feel and see a difference from the first use.  My eyes aren&#x27;t puffy and dark anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s performance is not what you stated my eyes are still puffy and dark with circles not what I was expecting at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now.  While the difference is not dramatic I do see an improvement in the bags.  Also my make up seems to hide my dark circles better.  I will definitely purchase more.</li>
            <li> I received my eye gel Tuesday.Have used it and I am already seeing results. Puffiness is not as bad, the dark under eyes are disappearing.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone with these problems,  it is working for me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND IT HELPED ME GET THRU&#x27; EYELID SKIN BURNS...NO SCARRING!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!  I&#x27;ve used a lot of products to try and get rid of the bags under my eyes, but this is the first product to actually make a positive difference.  Will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> best eye gel I have ever used</li>
            <li> best eye gel ever, gets rid of those dark circles and more</li>
            <li> Not great.  I do not think it does anything other than make more wrinkles.  It is not like a normal eye area cream.</li>
            <li> I use the gel as the serum for my eye area / between the brow area and around the mouth area - I am absolutely loving the product. For eye area I use another product with peptides that has more of a cream consistency; however, I feel like the other product in combination with this gel gives me much better results.&lt;br /&gt;Between the price and the results - this gel is a champion.</li>
            <li> Kind of a scam if you read all the testimonials on people who got this for FREE.  I admit it, I got sucked in anyways and I am not impressed.  It actually makes my bags under my eyes MORE noticeable. It goes on well but is like glue when it dries and accentuates the puffs and wrinkles.  I am going to continue using KIEHLS products because they are far, far superior to this garbage.  I would sent it back but I cannot find the box.  I received it and tried it for a week, really disappointed, shame on them.  Oh and the plant stem cells....I think they just chopped up a bunch of plant stems and called it a fancy name !</li>
            <li> nothing special to report.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using oz naturals eye gel for 2 weeks and half now and I have felt that this little gel tightness around my eye area and smooths my skin. I did not break out from using this product which is good therefore I spread a bit on my forehead lines. So far I&#x27;m seeing a a few results but with a product like this you have to continue using longer to see the maximum results. But this gel is very lightweight and feels nice and smooth on the skin and I love that&#x27;s it all natural. I give it 4 stars!</li>
            <li> I have under eye puffiness and this gel is the best product I have found as of yet! The fact that it helps and is also not going to break the bank is fantastic! You can smell a hint of cucumber in it and it has some light deflecting action that minimizes the look of the bags. I would definitely recommend this product and any other OZ Naturals product, they&#x27;re effective and perfect for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok not really working well on me as I expected my dark circles are still the same . I bought this item bec of the reviews but I guess it&#x27;s not worth it</li>
            <li> I ordered two eye creams, this and InstaNatural eye cream, roughly the same price and both claim to do the same things. I used OZ Naturals on my left eye, and the other on my right. I can honestly say that I see a noticeable difference on my left eye. I have fewer fine lines, which was my main concern. I used both every morning for a month. I&#x27;m in my late 20s, so I don&#x27;t have excessive fine lines or wrinkles, but I wanted to start using something now in hopes of keeping my skin youthful. The OZ Naturals cream was gentle (I have sensitive skin) and there was never any stinging when applying. I gave 4 stars because I don&#x27;t really feel like it helps with dark circles (I didn&#x27;t see a difference). I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It actually works!</li>
            <li> It did not meet my expectation. My dark circle and puffiness of my eyes did not go away. It was as if it did absolutely nothing. I&#x27;ve used this product for a good several months already and no results. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> fine lines and dark circles did not disappear or fade. didn&#x27;t work on my skin</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference after a couple months of use on my bags and dark circles.  That&#x27;s just me though!  More power to the people for whom this actually works.</li>
            <li> Will not purchase again</li>
            <li> It makes it a bit lighter, but does not get rid of it):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffered from dark circles my entire life and I&#x27;ve always searched for a product that would get rid of it completely, so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to use makeup to cover it. When I saw this product, I was amazed. It had so many great reviews and it was all natural! I saw people post about how they had dark circles all their life and it was gone when they used it. I was so hopeful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for a month and so far, there&#x27;s been not much improvement. Every time I put it on, it seems like it gets lighter. After I go to sleep and wake up again, my dark circles stare at me in the mirror. I can see the lines disappearing (which is great if I wanted to get rid of my wrinkles), but I just wanted the darkness gone from my face. I&#x27;m 17 and I&#x27;m light skinned, so the dark circles are really prominent on my face. People would ask me if I slept regularly or if someone punched me in the eye. That&#x27;s how bad it is. I really wanted this product to work. :(</li>
            <li> Oz eye gel needs no review.  the proof is in the tube. I was looking for an eye gel that i could use freely and casually w/o worrying about it getting all over  the place, (your eyes)  it goes on smooth, looks like vaseline but its not.  I was informed by an Oz rep. that even though its an eye gel u could also use it on the rest of your face.  I have a fine line across the top of my nose, and it relaxes that too.  Its beneficial all over.  the vitamin C serum is great also.  when I order again m ordering the vitamin C serum  with H.acid and vitamin C, I heard about this mixture from the DR. Oz show.  Its a great product, worth he price.  almost forgot, I am a Lupus patient an I just had a Kidney transplant in April this year, my skin looked like mud before the transplant and being on dialysis.  It brought me back to my old, i mean my young self again.   I am 62 , very active, but you&#x27;ll never know it   Yes, i&#x27;m sold</li>
            <li> I have been using the eye gel for about 2+ weeks now and I am satisfied with the results. I have eye bags and I have noticed a difference in this short time. I am very pleased with all the OZ Natural products and will continue to use them. The moisturizer is fantastic !!!</li>
            <li> Best eye product I have ever used. Astounded as I have had @ one month and already noticing an improvement, and others have commented too. I won&#x27;t stop using!</li>
            <li> This eye gel is pretty much one that every woman on the planet should have!!! Its super delicate on my skin and soft, and its not too heavy or oily like other eye gels I have used before. Great product OZ Naturals!!! Will repurchase again!! :) Defiently recommend it to anyone and already did to a couple of my friends.</li>
            <li> Great product. Live the results!!</li>
            <li> One of the best eye creams on the market!!! Works amazingly.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fairly well. Even for this 60 yr old man with DEEP dark circles. While my dark circles are mostly caused by allergies, I have found that the gel works well. Took almost 2 weeks to notice much of a difference, but my girlfriend noticed. I use in conjunction with Oz vitamin C serum. Which certainly helps with the fine lines and wrinkles on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I bought this eye gel because I have some lines in that area now, and need an eye cream at night. I&#x27;ve tried so many but they even if they assist with the wrinkles I wake up with huge bags around my eyes. My neighbor&#x27;s daughter is a trainee beautician and often introduces me to new ideas. She said that this gel is different to creams, and might work better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lt certainly does not cause puffiness and even has a cooling effect if my eyes are a bit tired. I don&#x27;t suffer from dark circles regularly and it was only after several weeks&#x27; use that I realised that I had none even after a particularly sleepless night. I also use this gel on the very top of my cleavage, another area which is sensitive to many of the other creams on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I approve of OZ Naturals&#x27; vegan philosophy and all in all this product has really worked for me. Suitable for anyone who is looking to reduce those gruesome wrinkles around the eyes, and looking for a product formulated to avoid puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NB: The box has a clean design but the print is tiny, and the pump action bottle really not friendly for those with a visual difficulty.</li>
            <li> My sister uses it and she loves it. I tried it as I used eye creams or serums but not a gel before. It felt very refreshing as soon as I applied it under my eyes. It kept my under eye bags less visible. I am very interested in purchasing one.</li>
            <li> The best eye moisturer I have so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a few days but so far I like it. Goes in smooth not greasy! A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I no longer have dark circles around my eyes, and I have only been using this product for one month! I most definitely recommend this product to anyone with dark circle or puffiness.</li>
            <li> This eye gel feels very nice and is light in texture which is what I prefer. It has a tingling feeling after I put it on so hopefully it means the product is working. There hasn&#x27;t been any noticeable difference but I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days. So far I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Diminished dark circles!</li>
            <li> This is my must-have beauty product!! Forget concealer and highlighters when you use this gel because the bags and under-eye darkness are gone. Oz Naturals Eye Gel not only works wonders but it works wonderfully on my very sensitive skin without any problems! I finally found a product that works and is good for my skin, even the uber sensitive under eye area. I love this stuff and I can feel it working within seconds and I can truly see the results. It lasts a long time but you will love it so much that like me, you get super nervous when it gets low and reorder fast. It&#x27;s AMAZING!!! Goodbye bags and hello happy, healthy, awake eyes!!!</li>
            <li> This my second purchase of the Oz Naturals The Best Eye Gel.  I primarily purchased this product to help with puffiness, and it really does appear to work. It is light and not greasy at all. I really like this eye gel and will continue to purchase it in the future.</li>
            <li> Love the cool feel of the eye gel.  Also great to know it can be used anywhere on the face.  I felt it working to reduce wrinkles right away.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is not compatible with my skin! It is supposed to be ultra hydrating but does the exact opposite for me. After using this and a few other OZ Naturals products my face is more dry than it&#x27;s ever been. Thank goodness for the 30 day money back guarantee!</li>
            <li> Great product. I highly recommended this eye cooling gel. The eye area is a very sensitive and important part of our face, and we tend to reject it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often write reviews but Oz Naturals wants to know how the products work and if I am satisfy with it.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to say YES. I got one for my sister I law and one for myself.  I don&#x27;t have a really bad dark circles but at a certain level yes, there is. So, I want to give it a try.  It works. I don&#x27;t say that dark circles were gone completely. I dont believe there is such miracle treatment out there. Everything requires certain amount of time to be healed and that&#x27;s completely fine. I believe it does lift up and relieve tiredness of your eyes too as it has cooling sensation (for about 15 seconds).  But don&#x27;t be afraid that it irritates your eyes with that cooling sensation. I have very sensitive eyes but I have no problem at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it says all of that stuff above my review that makes it look like it is coming from the company.  Just want to say, it&#x27;s not - Just me, Mandy.    I wake up in the morning and without fail, look like someone has slapped me silly.  My eyes are barely open and so swollen, they remind me of Sylvester Stalone&#x27;s after his first fight in, Rocky.  Not a pretty sight, if you&#x27;re a chick.    I have to admit I bought this product after reading all of your positive reviews and I gotta say, you didn&#x27;t let me down.  Slap this stuff on when I first wake up and then run from the mirror.  Come back after a few cups of coffee and, Holy Crap!!  Ain&#x27;t I cool!    Thanks for recommending it.</li>
            <li> I love OZ Naturals products.  They are so good that even my teenagers take it and use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;All natural and smells good and leaves our skin fresh, healthy and younger looking.</li>
            <li> I think this is making my eyes look worst!</li>
            <li> This gel made my eyes more dry. I originally bought this because my eyes get dark circles and dry in the winter, it made them worse. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am a 62 year old grandmother and have my fair share of wrinkles around the eyes. I have been using the Super Youth Eye Gel for a couple of months now and am happy to report that my fine lines are diminishing. Not gone, but definitely improved.  I have a very deep frown wrinkle in between my eyes and that too seems to have diminished .  I am pleased and will continue with these Oz Natural products.  I feel my face really puts these products to the test and know at my age one cannot expect miracles.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s moisturizing and soothing...not sure about reducing fine lines though.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate the eyes, and works well on crows feet.</li>
            <li> I love it but the bottle is very small and it does not last.</li>
            <li> As with the rest of the OZ products Ive used, I cant say enough positive things about this one. I&#x27;ve never been able to use anything on my skin especially around my eyes. If I found anything that I could use, it didn&#x27;t work. This is the ONLY product that gets rid of dark circles and puffiness and it works quickly. Try using on forehead lines. Feels great and has a light, refreshing, cooling feel.</li>
            <li> The gel feels nice but I noticed that it would kind of cake up around the corner of my eye which I do not like.  Otherwise it is not a fountain of youth :)</li>
            <li> I like this product lots, it does seem to help and it is very moisturizing.  even after being on all nite, it does not dry the eye area in any way.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I saw immediate results.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me&lt;br /&gt;I used all of it and my eyes still look the same&lt;br /&gt;Wat a waste of money</li>
            <li> I have tried so many eye creams and serums and until now haven&#x27;t been thoroughly happy with any one of them. I don&#x27;t have problems with dark circles or deep wrinkles around the eyes, but as I&#x27;ve gotten &amp;#34;less young,&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve developed puffier eyes, especially in the morning. A number of the eye creams that I&#x27;ve used did a good job in moisturizing the eye area and discouraging wrinkles, but some have been so heavy and greasy that I feel they&#x27;ve made the puffiness much worse.  I stopped using them for several weeks and, sure enough . . . Still, I don&#x27;t want to leave this delicate eye area unprotected.  Oz Naturals Eye Gel goes on lightly; it&#x27;s not greasy; the puffiness has not worsened but has improved overall.  I use it twice a day and it does not pose a problem with eye makeup.  (Some of my previous creams caused mascara to smudge under the eyes.)  In general, this product is so good that I&#x27;ve recommended it to my friends.</li>
            <li> PART OF MY REGIME. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know yet, ask me in about a month</li>
            <li> WOW!  We both were amazed at this product!  First, it goes on like a gel substance that instantly liquefies with skin contact.  It absorbs instantly.  The instructions say  you can use it not only on the eye area but forehead, cheeks, etc. So--we did.  Honestly, this stuff could be used as an all-over the face anti-aging product.  Lines instantly diminish (within seconds) and lesser ones (for us) vanish!  We still won&#x27;t give up our Oz Naturals Vitamin C serum, though.  For me, it is the ONLY product that successfully obliterated a wrinkle on my upper left eyelid--GONE!  Through the years we both have tried dozens of products; expensive dept store lines, drug store lines, mail order only lines of products. NOTHING ever put a dent in that upper eyelid wrinkle...until Oz Naturals.  My wife is off Aveda skincare ($$$$$$$$) and loves OZ.  Customers for life. We only hope they NEVER go out of business!</li>
            <li> Having used Super Youth Eye Gel for well over a year, I can attest to its&#x27; effectiveness. I have been very pleased with the suppleness of the area surrounding the eye. The gel absorbs quickly and is easy to use. Remarkably, the container with pump lasts a long time, making this purchase cost effective. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> This light cream worked wonderfully for me!</li>
            <li> Just started using this.  Have been using it morning and evening.  Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is very similar to a different brand of Eye gel that I have previously used.  The ingredients are basically the same and this even smells the same.  It is not greasy on the skin and absorbs quickly and only has a slight odor.  This does seem to be as effective so far as what I have previously used and my skin feels softer and seems to be helping.  I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate my skin in any way.  I will update my review over time once I have a few weeks of use but so far this is doing what it says it does.  I also suggest comparing the ingredients list and going with the best priced brand of this type of eye gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> wonderful  will buy again</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on September 4th, 2014. It has now been exactly three months. I&#x27;ve been using it diligently every night, as well as the majority of mornings. That being said, I can&#x27;t really tell you yet if the product will show any results in the future. Maybe it is too soon to tell. (If it does, I&#x27;ll provide an update!) But based upon this time span of usage, I&#x27;ve found no improvements whatsoever. I am already half way through the product. Here&#x27;s hoping that in another three months or so that I have till the bottle is finished, there will be some result. I have puffy dark eye circles, as well as wrinkles on the upper eyelid and lower lash line area. I&#x27;d been expecting to find some improvement at least on reducing the puffiness or preventing further minute wrinkles, but unfortunately there have been no such results. I chose to buy this item because it is highly rated and many people seem to have benefited from OZ Naturals&#x27; eye gel. I&#x27;m a bit disappointed that it hasn&#x27;t worked with me, and am not sure if I will buy again. If anything, it at least acts in place of a moisturizer appropriate for the delicate skin around the eye. I do love that the product won&#x27;t be sticky or heavy on your eyes, and does leave a smooth touch after applying. If you&#x27;re sensitive to most products, maybe be careful about putting it too close to your eye or near the waterline. It tends to burn just a little bit if it&#x27;s too close, and makes my water line a bit red, one of the reasons why I decided not to put it on too often during the mornings. The burning sensation is only very faint when put around the lower lash line area. I&#x27;m personally not sensitive to products, having fared alright with other intense skin products. Another reason why I refrain from applying it is when I&#x27;m applying makeup. I&#x27;ve found that using the product, and after some minutes of waiting, then applying makeup, will produce something like dandruff or tiny dead skin but isn&#x27;t either of these things, and I find it abit annoying to have to brush the tiny white particles away after applying my makeup. If you&#x27;re someone skeptical about how effective products are, than maybe don&#x27;t put too much hope on this product. Still, I suggest giving it a try and seeing if it does work on you! It seems to have worked on many others! I don&#x27;t think the price is that bad either, so it&#x27;s worth a try.  Update: I completed the entire bottle, down to the very last drops. There weren&#x27;t any noticeable differences during usage, although I believe it was moisturizing for my eye area. If you&#x27;re looking for just a moisturizer, I would recommend this product. However, if you&#x27;re looking to reduce black eye circles, puffiness, and small wrinkles, this may not be for you. I will not be purchasing this product again, but I do not regret purchasing it to try it out. I have yet to find an effective product for my eye area, and this product didn&#x27;t make the bottom of the list of tried products, so there&#x27;s that!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to notice a difference in my appearance, but it does not irritate or burn my eyes, so that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> Good product used before.</li>
            <li> Great for my eyes. I use it morning and night and keeps my eyes nice and hydrated.</li>
            <li> My friend bought this eye gel about a month ago and she let me use a little bit of hers. Omg! Incredible results!! My sking feels soo smoth abd my eye bags are gone! Im gonna order my own ASAP</li>
            <li> I have used this product for months, it works.  This is better than anything I&#x27;ve paid triple the price for. I keep this in stock!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I really do see a difference and the price makes it even more wonderful!</li>
            <li> Drying...needs moisturizing action to the mix.</li>
            <li> I think this product is helping some with under eye puffiness</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t noticed any long term permanent effects, I have noticed that my the puffiness around my eyes is instantly reduced when I apply it in the morning. I love that it contains herbal instead of chemical ingredients especially since it is applied so near to my eyes. There is no burning or stickiness. It really does work and does dramatically reduce the puffiness from lack of sleep or aging. I am very pleased with this product and plan to purchase other items from their line.</li>
            <li> Great eye product if creams are too heavy for your skin.</li>
            <li> I just got this, it came super fast. Maybe because it was shipped from two hours away from my county lol Was packaged well but I say that is all about to end since my Amazon prime free trail is up and it looks exactly like the picture shown. I must say it was a little smaller then what expected but not to bad and when I put some on it did have a strong smell but the smell isn&#x27;t a bad one and isn&#x27;t so strong it bothers me..actually the smell goes away fast. So far it goes on easy &amp; dry&#x27;s fast. As for if it really works in not sure just yet. So in a few weeks I will write an up dated reveiw and tell you guys what u think. But right now I love it.</li>
            <li> This has helped immensely on the dark circles under my eyes! I have used this faithfully since I got it! I use every morning and every night. Just 1 pump covers both my eyes. I have tried many remedy&#x27;s to reduce my bags, puffiness and dark circles from eye masks you pop in fridge, to ones you freeze to other eye creams.&lt;br /&gt; This has by far beat the others without a doubt. It takes all but a few minutes each morning and each night to apply but it works for hours. I see clearly why it has such great reviews!&lt;br /&gt;Its been a huge confidence booster when I take my glasses off. They some what &amp;#34;Camouflage&amp;#34; the puffiness and make up helps to cover the circles. I can take my glasses off with pride and not be embarrassed.&lt;br /&gt;Im completely impressed by the results I have gotten so far. Honestly I still need some work on my bags but I still have alot left to keep using. I&#x27;ll update again in about 2 weeks . I got a discount on my honest feed back of this, the above reflects my own thoughts, opinion, and use from my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Final words this is great!</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to this product.  It made my eyes puffy and sticky so I quit using the product.  Very disappointing as I use other OZ Naturals products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a big difference,it is ok</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;ve been using this over a month and this cream makes my fine lines go away but after a few days later I started to notice it was actually making my wrinkles more deeper idk what it is maybe u shouldn&#x27;t be using it for a long time? So I stopped using it and my wrinkles become better! It work for first few days but makes it worse after</li>
            <li> this product really works on your eyes I&#x27;ve tried it for 3 months and even though its in a small bottle it&#x27;s very long lasting a little bit goes a long way I did see the bags under my eyes diminish very rapidly within the first two weeks of use will continue to use and will purchase more strongly recommend</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference</li>
            <li> I was sent this eye gel from &amp;#34;Oz Naturals&amp;#34; to try for free In return for my review of this product. I love this eye gel it works great. Around my eyes are tighter and smoother. The gel is pump dispensed and the extra left after doing my eyes I put between my eyes and around my lips. I used Obagi eye cream in the past and I never got the good results I have gotten with this eye gel. Also this Oz serum is more affordable than the Obagi eye cream. I plan on writing another review in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s doing any good but I&#x27;m not breaking out or anything.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I use it morning and night.  I have no problem using it under make-up, and I do feel like it helps to reduce the bags under my eyes.  I&#x27;m not sure how well it works on color, since I don&#x27;t have dark under-eye circles.  Either way, when I run out, I&#x27;ll definitely repurchase.  You get a good amount for a fairly inexpensive product.  I&#x27;ve tried more expensive products that don&#x27;t work this well, so this is definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I am on my third bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Helps with puffy eyes better than anything I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> My experience with OZ natural eye gel has been amazing. The package is nice and secure with thick bubble wrap. I am in my mid 30s and with fine lines start to develop around the under eyes.I have been using the eye gel for 2 months and very satisfied with the results. Amazing product and can recommend to anyone. I will definitely get more bottles when the first one is finished :-)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> OZ Naturals Best Eye Gel - they got this right it is the best eye gel. it leaves my under eye bags deflated for hours. I apply it in the am after my shower about an hour before putting on make up.  It does the job and is easy to apply.  I jump at the chance to try any of this companies new products because every one has been a winner so far. Great formula! Got on a promo to review and jumped on it. OZ Naturals definitely is making a name for themselves in skincare</li>
            <li> Update, it&#x27;s been months that I&#x27;ve been uing this eye cream, having seen any change whatsoever. I use this day and night. I really wanted this product to work, but  unfortunately it hasn&#x27;t improved anything.&lt;br /&gt;It has been about 2 wks that I been religiously using this gel day and night  and I have yet to see any significant improvements. I&#x27;ll continue to use it because it looks like it has good ingredients,  but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> I have used 2 bottles of this and it has really helped reduce the puffiness under my eyes. Several people have commented on my youthful appearance so it must work!</li>
            <li> Out of all the eye creams/gels I have tried for eye puffiness, I just about gave up.  I read the reviews for this product and decided to give it a try.  It does work for me.  Not 100% and my puffiness is still there, but it helps diminish it.  I will buy again when I run out.  Satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised with this eye cream. I knew it was going to work as soon as I put it on and immediately you see results. The great thing to me is that it is 75% organic and mostly natural ingredients. It does have a heavy smell but I personally like it. The texture is mostly gel but still creamy. It wears really smoothly. I put it day and night and my concealer goes on perfect. The only bad thing is the size. IT IS A TINY BOTTLE with a tiny tiny bit in it. For the price it should really be more.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this - I have bought twice and I will buy and buy again. You will not be disappointed! This, and Miravage and  Vitamin C Serum 20% with Retinol 2.5%, Salicylic Acid 2%, Hyaluronic Acid, Niacinamide, Tea Tree Oil, MSM, Plus More - Best Natural Anti...&lt;br /&gt;from InstaNatural&lt;br /&gt;Love Amazon and love the reviews. I wish it were easier to link to products which rock!</li>
            <li> Not sure about this cream and if it&#x27;s doing anything. Smell is fine but doesn&#x27;t leave skin around your eye feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> I like it but not sure of anything coming from it</li>
            <li> Excellent value, Excellent product !!!!!!  This product is VERY similar to a specialty store eye cream that is TRIPLE the price !!!!  This product even has more in the container that the specialty store eye gel.  Try this, and you&#x27;ll never go back to the big-name products !</li>
            <li> This product was delivered well before the estamated date which was really good and I love this product as it&#x27;s my 2nd time to order it</li>
            <li> This was the first time I ever bought Eye Gel and it was an awful experience.  My eyelids are swollen, red, really dry and they sting when I wash my face.  NEVER again...</li>
            <li> I have been using Dr Oz Naturals for one month, so far, I see no difference. I am in my 40s and have sensitive skin. I also purchased from Dr Oz: the Hyaluronic Acid serum and the Retinol Moisturizer. I will continue to use these products until they run out and post my end results here online.</li>
            <li> Too sticky for my liking. I know its hard to find a good eye cream. This one doesn&#x27;t cut it. I have had much better. But I have also had worse!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had darkness under my eyes. I always looked tired and disheveled. As I aged, it only got worse. But I didn&#x27;t feel that way... so when I saw this, I had to try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews were great. So I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;m a skeptic until proven wrong. In this case, I&#x27;m happy to say I was wrong... and LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost immediately, the results were clear. My eye lids seemed tightened, there was a glow &amp; the texture around my eyes was more even. So then, I slept on it. When I woke up, I LITERALLY could not believe my eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works- more even texture and better skin tone around my eyes. It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li> clean, moisturizing and affordable</li>
            <li> I love this line of products!  I purchased this gel and use it religiously!  I was in the supermarket last week and the checker asked me if I had seen a recent kids movie and I told her that even our grandkids are grown so I don&#x27;t really see those movies anymore.  She said grown grandkids?  You look like you could have early teenagers at best!  It made my day.  These products do work and I highly recommend trying this line of products, they work better than some I have spent so much more on!  My crows feet are virtually gone!</li>
            <li> Not really working for my eyes</li>
            <li> Sorry to report it did not help my swollen lower eyes at all</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my Oz Naturals, I saw results&lt;br /&gt;after using it 4 times, the puffiness has diminished&lt;br /&gt;and the dark circles are fading away, it has a&lt;br /&gt;very light smell of cucumber.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li> Best eye cream I&#x27;ve used thus far, does not make me tear or cause irritation. Will put this one on auto ship.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! A must have in every cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> Least effective of all the creams I have ever used.</li>
            <li> NICE, COOLING FEELING - ALSO REDUCED SMALL WRINKLES AROUND EYES AND MOUTH.  I USED ALL OVER MY FACE, NOT JUST AROUND EYES</li>
            <li> Yes I agree, a very good eye gel, absorbs nicely. Can&#x27;t say I see a dramatic result but sure is worth buying!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased OZ Naturals face moisturizer, Vitamin C cleanser, toner, and eye serum. I say this with all the honesty and relief of a 31 year old woman who has been struggling to find a decent face treatment for my combo, occasional acne and blackhead-prone, splotchy face for years: I. Love. These. Products.&lt;br /&gt;Do they smell like the ocean? Yes. Is that a wonderful thing? No. Does my face look and feel better, clearer, and more even than ever before? Yes!&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been a soap and Aveeno guy his entire life. I asked him to try it out and HE loves it! I&#x27;m kicking myself because now we&#x27;re spending a lot more on skin care, but for us, it&#x27;s worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;m going to copy and paste this review to the products I&#x27;ve listed above to avoid finding a new way to say the same thing!</li>
            <li> I generally like most eye creams I get, and am very pleased with OZ Naturals.  I noticed immediately a brightness and less wrinkles, I will order this product again!</li>
            <li> All my dark circles go it&#x27;s amazing treatments😍😍😍</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product &amp; used it 1 or 2 times daily for two weeks but then decided to stop. The only problem I started with was persistent dark circles, but since I&#x27;ve started using the eye gel I&#x27;m now dealing with puffiness &amp; wrinkles as well, which I&#x27;ve never had before in my entire life! Couple days later after not using this product the puffiness is almost completely gone but the wrinkles still the same.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well.  As a mom of a toddler I get tired often so I usually have dark circles under my eyes.  This helped diminish the dark circles and the Puffiness.  I&#x27;m happy for that since summer is coming up and less makeup can be worn to hide it. Now I don&#x27;t need any concealer to hide the circles.  I did receive this item free to try for the purpose of my review.  But I will definitely be purchasing it!</li>
            <li> Received this item yesterday decided to let my mom use it as she has more under eye issues than i do. It was smaller than i expected but you only use a tad bit under your eyes so it should last a while. My mom said it went on so smooth and she even used it as a face primer under her makeup this morning. Not sure what the results will be yet but so far its great</li>
            <li> After using this for two days, morning and night, under eye puffy bags are gone. Worry lines between brows are visibly reduced as are forehead wrinkles. I can&#x27;t believe the speed of this product. I am throwing away everything that is not made by OZ Naturals.</li>
            <li> smells like real plants, goes on smooth, the consistency is watery. dries and soaks in to the skin fast and does not feel sticky. the box said you can also use this on your forehead and under makeup. I have always had dark circles and I notices improvement right away.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks. I put it on everyday, Under my make-up. I have got to say I can see a significant change in the puffiness below my eyes. This has got to be by far the best gel EVER !!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this cream did not work for me, although I was hoping I found the one.  I took pictures of my eyes and they look no better at all. I doubt if there is even a product on the market that will take care of the puffiness under the eyes. If there is one I haven&#x27;t found it yet.</li>
            <li> Sold by: OZ Naturals:&lt;br /&gt;I found this product to be mediocre.  I saw no improvement in my skin and the once-pleasant cooling sensation soon became a stinging sensation on my normal skin.&lt;br /&gt;Rating: 1 star&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I would not recommend these products although I am very much hoping they work for some people.</li>
            <li> Only a few days into using this product and I&#x27;ve already seeing noticlable differences! The corners of my eyes are normally very dark and irritated from constant rubbing (contact user) and this product has already reduced the darkness after only 3 days! Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and never used eye gel before.  I received this sample and gave it a try for the first time but this eye gel didn’t work well on my skin type.</li>
            <li> For me this product was a waste of money! Very disappointed. I still have dark circles under my eyes and I have been using this eye gel for over 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Great product! A little does go a long way. It takes only a very small drop for both eyes. Feels great!</li>
            <li> Burns my under eye area. I tried it and it just doesn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this because of the great reviews and because it is cruelty free. I can definitely tell a difference using this product. I am on my second bottle and love it! I ran out and after a couple of weeks, I could tell that the area around my eyes was looking a little drab, so I quickly bought another bottle and the area around my eyes are looking much better :). I use it all around my eyes, under, crow&#x27;s feet, under the eyebrow (but not too close that it goes in your eye), between my eyebrows and even above my eyebrows. Sometimes I&#x27;ll even put it on my lips.</li>
            <li> I received my Super Youth Eye Gel, took a picture of my eye,  forehead area, and the place between my eyes. I was given the product to give my honest opinion and here it is.I hadn&#x27;t used any products on my face in quite awhile but used to do several  regimes and use them religiously. This ingredients here are healthy, natural things like organic Licorice, and Reishi mixed with cutting edge effective ingredients like peptides, Matrixyl 3000, and Hyalauronic Acid and Plant Stem Cells. You can smell the cucumber in here. The price is affordable as I think the amount could last up to 2 months for me. I used the product after cleansing 1 or 2 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;  Your skin drinks this in then dries without an obvious color or coating. The product is not greasy yet it spreads easily. One pump was enough for the under eye, side of the eyes, the 11 lines and forehead, along with lower face lines and even the neck. I still had enough left to rub over the tops of my hands and wrists!&lt;br /&gt;  I plan to keep using this to watch how well this product works.  My issues are crows feet, somewhat loose lower eye skin and some dark circles. I have some light wrinkles on my forehead and between my eyes plus some loose skin in the jowl area. I really liked the texture and slip of the product plus lack of oiliness. I think the ingredients are impressive. I believe the lines between my eyes are already a bit better. Some of the skin under my eye seems smoother. I am 55 years old. I haven&#x27;t worn a lot of makeup lately, however I think either a primer or light eye moisturizing cream could be used, then eye makeup and concealer or foundation with no problem due to the product&#x27;s penetration leaving a matte finish after.&lt;br /&gt;  I would like to try other products from this brand.</li>
            <li> Light weight and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Just OK.  Smells nice, feels calming/cool when applied, but truly has little effect otherwise.  I&#x27;ve been using for about a month now and have seen no improvements in skin tone/hydration/wrinkles/etc.  Sorry folks, but this isn&#x27;t a great product for a great price, it&#x27;s just an OK product for an OK price.  Not sure why other reviews are so positve, but if you&#x27;re looking to see improvements, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Product is working great...its only been a few days and I already see a difference. Will be buying more! Delivery was on time. Try it yourself!</li>
            <li> This Super Youth Eye Gel is incredible and works SO WELL over the Hyaluronic Acid Serum+C that your skin will glow with a Rose-like blush and lines are smoothly plumped away!!!</li>
            <li> its okay, I don&#x27;t think I would be again.  Just doesn&#x27;t give me the moisture I need under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Ok this is probably my favorite purchase (and I&#x27;ve bought pretty much the entire line of OZ Naturals) it has an instant effect! I&#x27;ve used other more expensive products and this by far is THE BEST stuff I&#x27;ve tried! You will truly be amazed!!</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this zero stars since this &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; eye gel did NOTHING for me! In fact, it has only caused my eyes to look more puffy and wrinkled since the gel just made my eyes feel like all of the moisture was being sucked out of them! I wish I could return this and get my money back! Horrible product for me!</li>
            <li> I really was hoping that this product would be what I was looking for.  The reviews seemed hopeful but did not work for me.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month.</li>
            <li> Saw some improvement but not as much as expected.</li>
            <li> Been using different types of eye products by far this one is the best</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this product !! Fully recommend it !!!</li>
            <li> Total waste of money. The pump was also less than half full of product.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It really helped with my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have previously had little luck with eye products.  I have to say of all the eye products I have used this is my favourite! It sinks into the skin with no residue and is a lovely light gel.  It has improved my puffiness almost instantly and is increasing elasticity and reducing crepiness! This is all within the first week of use.....I am excited to see how it can improve my eye area with longer use! Another great natural/organic product from Oz naturals.</li>
            <li> Is only 2 weeks since I tried this gel its amazing after only one week everybody noted difference and gave me a complement ..my puffy eyes really getting much better...tku</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Icky!  Made the creases of my eyes stick together, didn&#x27;t see diminishing lines or dark circles.  I think I&#x27;ll stay with my Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair for Eyes.  Sorry!</li>
            <li> It definitely works and I have been using it for a month or so.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered on time.  First time trying it and it feels great! Not oily or slimy. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Fabulous product! Goes on light and smooth.  Has made a tremendous difference in my eye area especially dark circles.  I highly recommend this product as well as all their other products! They are truly the best!!</li>
            <li> feels smooth when you put on the eye gel. feels cool then dries instantly.  makes your eyes look awake and youthful.  overall  great product for everyday use.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is awesome ! It contains all the who&#x27;s who in anti aging properties and it delivers. It&#x27;s not a sudden change, just gives your eyes a well rested look, like a good night&#x27;s sleep. Worth every penny !</li>
            <li> excellent product i love it</li>
            <li> Well I haven&#x27;t been using this eye gel not for so long, I haven&#x27;t seen a changed yet,  but my wrinkles around my eyes haven&#x27;t gotten worse so it&#x27;s a good sign.  So I think if we want major results we have to stick to our regimen and I am cause my eyes feel very soft and though I had dry areas on top of my eyelid this gel has taken care to that.  Thanks oznaturals</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. At first use I could feel the skin tightening around my eyes. Then I began to see the puffiness diminish from under my eyes. I am quite pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This is the best under eye treatment I&#x27;ve ever used! It&#x27;s been a couple of weeks and my under-eye area is already less puffy than usual. There was actual an instant difference as well, but I&#x27;m waiting to see the long-term effects. I haven&#x27;t seen it address much darkness, but I&#x27;ll post an update if I do. It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> It works! I started noticing dark circles, puffy-crapey skin and fine lines under my eyes. This gave me noticeable improvement! I was sick and skipped 4 days- never again! This is better than the $120 eye serum I was using.</li>
            <li> Just started using it. Doesn&#x27;t effect my skin in a bad way. am waiting for the effects.</li>
            <li> Nice eye cream. Happy</li>
            <li> It is good for wrinkle.</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel. I have looked for ages for something to lessen the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes. This is working. I&#x27;m amazed and most pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this produce it comes out too fast it goes quickly can&#x27;t live with out it!</li>
            <li> Handle in care.  Excellent!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best eye gel that I have used. The dark circles are gone~ yay!! I am looking forward to trying all of the products that OZ Naturals has to offer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since the beginning of April. I can definitely see the fine lines around my eyes fading away! It does not feel greasy, or cling. Very light! Has a nice light scent. I also really like that it&#x27;s Cruelty Free!</li>
            <li> Been using for a few weeks now. I look pretty good. I&#x27;m not a fan of makeup but this doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m made up. I don&#x27;t need makeup for my dark circles and lines. I think it&#x27;s really working</li>
            <li> I actually received a sample of this product and it was amazing! Im excited to now have the full bottle!</li>
            <li> Did not help the dark areas under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Not worth buying.</li>
            <li> After reading the myriad great reviews I was really excited and hopeful about trying these products (I purchased a serum and cleanser as well), but unfortunately they weren&#x27;t for me. I liked the idea of a really powerful, all natural and almost all organic line, but from the day I started using these products my skin became very dry, I broke out, and developed these random patches of scaly, tiny bumps on my face. I stuck with it for about 2 weeks hoping it was just a transitionary thing, but eventually I couldn&#x27;t stand what was happening to my skin. Switched back to a tried and true line (I&#x27;ve learned my lesson) and my skin is already looking better after 1 night, and on the road to recovery. If the the switch didn&#x27;t make it so drastically clear that the Oz Natural products were doing my skin a disservice, I may have thought, &amp;#34;Hey, maybe these just aren&#x27;t the best products for me.&amp;#34; However, I&#x27;ve tried other products that maybe didn&#x27;t transform my skin and I didn&#x27;t necessarily *love*, but none have actually made my skin worse. Not to say that these products don&#x27;t work for others, but I guess you have to balance out the thousands of success stories with at least one unsuccessful one :/</li>
            <li> I guess is good . They have a great product but I  never use the best eye gel.</li>
            <li> I have used many, many eye gels / creams over the years.  This is without a doubt the best!!  My eyes are definitely brighter and lines are significantly diminished.  My crows feet are barely noticeable now (I am 64 by the way) and I have only been using for one week.  I am so excited to finally find something that really works ; )</li>
            <li> Soon after using this I developed dry, scaly ,reddish eye lids.  I can think of nothing else that would have caused it.</li>
            <li> great stuff ..less wrinkles..</li>
            <li> Smells and feels nice. I&#x27;m not sure it has done anything for my (admittedly atrocious) dark circles, but I like it as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I first read about this eye cream in an article about the top products of the year. I had been having a problem with an area under my eye that was dry. I tried olive oil, coconut oil and loreal eye treatment. Nothing would get rid of the dry spot until I began using the Oz eye cream. It has also helped with my dark circles and puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> First time to try this, but I&#x27;ve been very happy with all the OZ Naturals products.  Feels very soothing, ingredient list is impressive.</li>
            <li> I like it okay but I do not feel that it is hydrating : (  Doubt that I&#x27;d order again.</li>
            <li> I used so far 15 days , seems like is working well enough so far . I will wait for more a month then will post my review for this product . so far great product i can say among all other product !!!!!!</li>
            <li> Did not see a difference. Felt cool and tingly to they eye which can be a good thing. I expected more since I do like their products.</li>
            <li> I just love this eye gel! Since it&#x27;s a gel and not a cream it wears very well under makeup and it very effective. No more puffiness and no more dark circles!!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works and is gentle</li>
            <li> I liked this product a lot. I found that it reduced my dark circles a lot just within the first use. I&#x27;m still using it and I have been seeing even more good results. However, I do not feel like it has helped a lot with wrinkles. Still I would recomend this to anyone who wants to look like they have gotten more sleep than they actually have. I really like this product a lot. I also would just like people to know that this is a 100% true review, and I have received this product for free to make sure I left a 100% true review.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking when I bought this.  I have read articles on unregulated manufactered healthcare products but I just didn&#x27;t think until I received the product and noted the crappy little container it came in.  Now I am afraid to use it.  Why oh why didn&#x27;t I just buy a name bramd at the grocery store for the same price...I know they hire teams of PhdS from top universities.  I think these people want you to think Dr Oz makes this stuff.  I used the product just a few times, so can&#x27;t say if it does anything.  i did not get a rash or anything.</li>
            <li> This has been awesome for my dark circles and puffiness. I&#x27;ve noticed a change also in the appearance of lines. Big fan of Oz Naturals</li>
            <li> Love this gel works for me far better than cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a couple of weeks but I&#x27;m already seeing some results! Love all of my Oz products!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, works great</li>
            <li> This product has a great consistency and is easy to apply. The gel has a wonderful cool feeling and lovely scent. Eyes stay hydrated all day and makeup applies well over the product. I can&#x27;t say, however, that there has been a reduction in dark circles. I will keep at it and see if there is any improvement. It&#x27;s a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is just wonderful. Put a tiny amount on your finger and rub into your eye area. The formula is super absorbent and leaves no greasy feeling. The product is unscented so there was no strong odor. I have not been using this long enough to know if it has lasting effects on my wrinkles, but the immediate feeling is that the skin around my eyes is smoother. Overall this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream.  I can tell that my eyes are instantly brighter.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not work with me, I did not notice any result</li>
            <li> This stuff really is great and u don&#x27;t need much.  Wish it was a bigger bottle.  I have purchased twice &amp; will again  for sure.  Beats fifty bucks at Estee lauder counter and I found it more refreshing  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and I really do like it. I have noticed a softening of the lines around my eyes. I hope the improvement continues!</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye gel along with the OZ Naturals Vitamin C and HA serums.  The Vitamin C serum is my absolute favorite!!!!!  I will continue to purchase the Vitamin C serum over and over.  This eye gel is okay.  For me, it seems a little sticky and I don&#x27;t notice a real improvement in the hydration of my eyes or reduction in the fine lines.  I do notice a reduction in the dark circles, but I will probably be looking for another eye cream or serum that hydrates a little better.</li>
            <li> (Disclaimer - My wife and I were invited by the seller to try and review their products. I only agree to these requests when it&#x27;s something we would actually use, and in this case, we picked some products to try and review. The fact we received them for free has no bearing on our review, and we have written negative reviews in the past for products we were sent for free. Also, for this type of invited review, I always begin with a disclaimer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This review is from my wife.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye gel has a faint cucumber fragrance, and it&#x27;s very easily absorbed by the skin, and keeps the skin moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is pump-styled, so it&#x27;s very convenient and hygienic (no messes or dipping your fingers into the bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;ll get rid of dark circles around eyes because no matter how expensive a beauty product is, it cannot turn back time and reverse the signs of aging from the face (at least today&#x27;s science cannot do this convincingly yet). But I can say that its moisturizing capability is very good, and does seem to make wrinkles around the eyes slightly less deep.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55 and have found the OZ Naturals Eye Gel  helps reduce morning time under eye puffiness and fine lines. I&#x27;m very happy with the results. It feels cooling when applied, absorbs quickly and the pump dispenser keeps the product fresh!</li>
            <li> Nice product, still using so no significant results yet, but feels good.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if its doing its job as descibed. Does NOT help bags. But it clears under eye lines.&lt;br /&gt;A good price also.</li>
            <li> I absaloutly love this..I apply a small amount on each eye morning and night and it&#x27;s been ace my bags have gone and skin is so much firmer . Will be buying again</li>
            <li> I really liked this product because it soothed the skin around my eyes and made me look a lot less tired. It felt really nice on my skin and istantly made a difference. It feels like you are massaging silk in to your skin. My eyes looked a lot brighter and it seemed to even out the few wrinkles i have a bit. I would defnitly love to see photos of your little ones in there outift! avo</li>
            <li> Has not worked like the good reviews I read.</li>
            <li> I recently received Oz Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel in order to sample the product for my review.  The eye gel has high quality ingredients to moisturize and soften the lines around the eyes.  When applied to the eye area, it has a very soothing feel and does soften the crows feet I have around my eyes.  I also place it on the frown lines of my forehead.  Time will tell if this has an effect on the wrinkles there -- I sure hope so!  No stickiness like some gels.  I like the quality of all the  Oz Naturals products that I have tried.  Affordable for high quality ingredients.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like I had an allergic reaction to it and stop using it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to have any effect though</li>
            <li> OK for hiding wrinkles maybe, but I did not like the tight feeling and it in no way feels like a moisturizer. Will not buy again. I already own better stuff.</li>
            <li> Did not work.no difference withy eye bags</li>
            <li> one of the best eye gels I ever used in my life and I shared this with my mom, who has problems with her aging eyes for a long time. It did help her a lot.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Love the all natural ingredients. Will buy again!  I am 41 and starting to see fine lines and wrinkles.  It stinks, but SO THANKFUL I found these!  It just makes me glow a bit more and that is amazing!!</li>
            <li> This is the best eye gel I have ever used! I put in it my Clarosonic opal and it does wonders!</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel! Goes on smooth and you can tell a difference with fine lines after only a week!</li>
            <li> 3 days in... It feels great!!!! So great that I want to apply more and more. It didn&#x27;t burn, wasn&#x27;t sticky, didn&#x27;t ball up- there is nothing I&#x27;d change about it. I won&#x27;t know how well it works until I&#x27;ve been able to use it a few more times.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my 4th bottle! Absolutely working on my puffy eyes. It has a very light, non-oily texture but penetrates deeply and yields refresh look next morning. I&#x27;m very glad I found this eye gel after trying all those top brand, expensive eye creams !!</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have really noticed a difference in my under eye circles.</li>
            <li> Love it!!  Not only does it make my eyes bright, it will not break the bank.  I starting using the eye gel and the Vit. C serum and am very happy with both.  I especially like the fact that Oz Naturals are made in the USA!</li>
            <li> dear seller looking forward to using the oz natural eye cream&lt;br /&gt;I wanted some thing that would not make my face red like the other acne creams do&lt;br /&gt;I plan on getting another one of your products later on for my self&lt;br /&gt;love caroline boudle</li>
            <li> Skin is softer around eyes, but did not really reduce lines.</li>
            <li> so far it has been great, just received it and it is light and doing its job, the side wrinkles seem to vanish.  The puffiness hasn&#x27;t left but is decreasing.&lt;br /&gt;Will give an additional revue after my first month.</li>
            <li> great product, helps with wrinkles, dark circles and puffiness!</li>
            <li> Use a small amount. Great product and very reasonable price</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Most of the reviews are paid on here.</li>
            <li> This simply does not work. I missed the return date by 3 days, 100% guarantee my a**. What a waste of money. This eye cream does absolutely nothing! My fault for buying it and my fault for missing the return date. OZ Naturals is a complete rip off. #NeverAgain</li>
            <li> This gel is great so far. Not too heavy and works great under concealer.</li>
            <li> I am not so in love with this product.  I do not have lots of wrinkles or dark circles to battle, but I am scratching 40 so I wanted a product that boosts and works.  So far I am not so impressed.  I honestly do not see a difference so far.  But in all fairness I will continue to use and report back to you all.</li>
            <li> I would give this eye gel NO stars if I could.  With so many glowing reviews, I expected this eye gel to at least be somewhat worthwhile.  I did not expect to have my eyelids puff up like I had been crying for hours.  When I did not have to go anywhere, I tried it a second time underneath my eyes only and still the same reaction.  I threw it in the trash and would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable! Brighting the skin, reducing sight of aging.</li>
            <li> great product, I have seen small changes in the suppleness around my eyes and have bee  using for 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 3 weeks now, and I definitely feel that there&#x27;s a difference. When applied, the gel is very cooling and there is an instant tightenting effect. My makeup applies flawlessly over top of this eye cream, which is something that I&#x27;ve had an issue with in the past with other eye creams. I really like the cooling and tightening, but since I&#x27;m still a new user I can&#x27;t speak to the long term effects of this eye cream. I will continue to use it daily!&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for free to try, but I would consider purchasing it on my own.</li>
            <li> Works well for dark circles. Did not see much fine line or wrinkle improvement.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me so I park it in a corner</li>
            <li> So far, so good and like the results.</li>
            <li> This eye gel has decreased the swelling that I have had under my right eye for over 10 years from eye surgery. I am so very impressed!! I did receive this product for free for writing a review, but I&#x27;m ready to buy more!.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference in under eye shades... Still just as dark.</li>
            <li> Happy with this product so far. Nice consistency to apply and absorbs really well.</li>
            <li> Been using it regularly, morning &amp; night. Not a miracle worker but I believe it does help. Lately I have not been getting enough sleep but I also do eye exercises, ice and moisture eye area every night. So I am not sure if the slight improvement is the product alone or the combination of things.</li>
            <li> I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions.  This is a great eye gel. It has a scent of cucumbers in my opinion which is nice and feels cooling and refreshing upon application. It is a gel-like consistency (hence name eye gel). I initially used a whole pump for both of my eyes and that was way too much. I only needed a small amount for both eyes. If you use too much it can leave a sticky residue, so apply sparingly to avoid that and besides it will last that much longer. It definitely helps with puffiness especially on sleepless nights. That is a big plus and I have reached for this eye gel on those morning when I need a little de-puffing. I think you will be pleasantly surprised how well it does for this. I have been using this in combination with my JENU system and it has been working great!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well this works! I have dark circles under my eyes because I am anemic and have been embarrassed by it for as long as I can remember. I have always had to glob on concealer to try and hide them. I have also tried numerous under eye gels and creams and just haven&#x27;t had the results I have been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Over the  past few years I&#x27;ve noticed fine lines (crows feet) near my eyes and those dreaded &amp;#34;laugh lines&amp;#34; around my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and have seen a noticeable difference! The first time I used it, I actually noticed a slight difference!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I have finally found a product that gives me the results I want!</li>
            <li> Wow exactly as advertised.  Five Star Seller.  Thank You...</li>
            <li> It really has not done anything for my bags and that is why I bought it</li>
            <li> I loved this but it seemed to go so fast.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any differences when using this gel.  It didn&#x27;t bother me, it&#x27;s very light-weight with a nice scent.  Semi-hydrating, I mean it is a gel and not a cream.  I used it both day and night, and just ran out after purchasing last February.  So almost 4 months of use, not bad.  However it did not seem to do anything for my fine lines it just provided some hydration.</li>
            <li> The serum is fine - can&#x27;t see improvement, but then maybe it&#x27;s too late?  The eye gel feels good and seems to give temporary improvement.</li>
            <li> I like the this product.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any positive results at this time and I have been using for two weeks. I will finish the bottle to verify.</li>
            <li> I really think this has helped my dark spots under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom. She said it improved her skin 50% . Thats a good number. She is continuing to use this product</li>
            <li> I use this nightly before bed.  It has reduced the fine lines around my eyes.  Plus it has a cooling, soothing effect.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is great. My eye area looks so much better since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> I like the packaging and gel texture&lt;br /&gt;But so far, nothing has changed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been diligently using it, too :(((&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love this and for it to work!</li>
            <li> Great Product I use this under my eyes before , applying &amp;#34;Sudden Change&amp;#34;.  I feel they work great together !!!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was expecting more. I don&#x27;t like to see my skin sticking together after I put the cream on. I feel like I have more lines than before. I&#x27;m not going to use it any more. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to any one.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and sticky!</li>
            <li> Perfect eye product! Not greasy and smoothes tender skin around the eye. Works well under make up!</li>
            <li> A light, cooling gel that soothes and smooths eyelids and under eyes. I use it morning and night. Lessening aging lines at corners, too.</li>
            <li> Awesome result,  more than expectations.  Best of the best</li>
            <li> Like this product very much. It is not sticky, very smooth and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see a difference yet</li>
            <li> I had a drak circle around my eyes  this product fixed it.</li>
            <li> GReat product that really seems to do the trick :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products for my dark circles, love this one. And it is light enough to use right before eye liner.</li>
            <li> Still &amp;#34;playing&amp;#34; with it but seems to have smoothed out some of the fine lines and my under eye appears less sunken.</li>
            <li> Really struggled with under eye dark circles and has really helped out</li>
            <li> This is great,highly recommend this product.It has a light fresh scent that reminds me of melons.And the puffiness and dark circles are lighter.</li>
            <li> This is the first eye gel that has reduced the puffiness under my eyes. I have tried many different brands over the years. I almost did not purchase this one because I was certain that it would not work, and I would be throwing money away yet again. My quest to rid myself of eye bags won out, so I decided to give it a shot. I noticed a reduction in puffiness after about two weeks of use. After a full month, the puffiness was further reduced. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for more than 2 months now. So far the puffiness has be kept at bay. I have not received anything for this review. I paid full price for this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review after just buying my third tube. Quite simply, it works!!!. At first the consistency of the gel felt strange but I quickly got used to it. The fine lines and circles are very diminished and I am very happy with the results. I will continue to use the product</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day for over a month with no noticeable impact.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty amazing...I&#x27;ve noticed a visible difference in my under eye wrinkles and circles in less than a week of use. The product is also very light and non greasy. I am very happy with my purchase. Oz Naturals has a great line of products!!</li>
            <li> This product works for me.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> doesen&#x27;t notice a diference...I preffer Mary Kay</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;m never going back</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best eye gel that I have use so far, and the best part is I got it free , give it a try for your self....</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It goes on smooth, soaks in quickly and makes my eyes feel refreshed!</li>
            <li> Nice, no reaction on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This cream didn&#x27;t do anything for my eyes.</li>
            <li> my eyes look pretty good</li>
            <li> Very light product that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue! Love this!</li>
            <li> It did not work for me .I am 58 and do have wrinkles around eye and crows feet no dark cycles this just did nothing I used it for several weeks and nothing.</li>
            <li> I like that the ingredients are clean. I apply this in the morning and night. In the morning, I let it dry for a few minutes, then apply my under eye concealer over the top. It prevents my makeup from creasing. The company says I need to use it for 60 days to see the results that the product will provide. I&#x27;m looking forward to that. I have hereditary dark circles, and anything that helps is a miracle for me. Frankly, just allowing my makeup to go on more smoothly and last longer is a huge deal for me. I recommend this product, and I love the clean ingredients. Thanks, Oz!! **I received free product to give my honest opinion.**</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and in my opinion, it&#x27;s the best eye gel on the market for dark undereye circles and puffy eyes. I have tried several products in the past but this is by far the best. A little goes a long way. It can also be used all over the face to diminish smile lines around the mouth and wrinkles on the forehead. I recommend this product  to anyone trying to diminish these eye issues.</li>
            <li> The eye gel was ok. I didn&#x27;t notice any real difference with lines or bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Very nice eye cream. Thick but absorbs pretty quickly. I have very sensitive eye area and this feels great - no itching/drying as I have had with many products. Gentle but effective, have used about a month and can see a difference in texture around the eye area. Will keep using this and hope to improve even more</li>
            <li> Worked great. Also used it in my fine lines on forehead.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, I personally love it!!</li>
            <li> I have used this about 1 weeks and I can honestly say that it does tighten the skin on and around my eyes giving me a more awake look. It is very lightweight and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it for it to work. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor. It takes a little bit of time to dry, but once you put it on but it&#x27;s not bad. It didn&#x27;t change my under eye circles but it did help with the puffiness. It didn&#x27;t burn or sting or irritate the eyes either. I received this free to do a review but now as always my opinions are my own. I would give this a 5 star and would recommend it to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Love it!! I am 69 years old and the wrinkles around my eyes plus dark and puffy eyes have really improved.  What I enjoy the most is the cooling feeling I get after putting the cream on my eyes</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 months now and must say that is FANTASTIC! It surely does what it promises and not much product needed so the bottle should last you a long way. If you are looking for something that is good for your skin and free of chemicals , here it is ladies this product is amazing I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s all natural and 75% organic good for all skin types. A must have!</li>
            <li> LOVE this! I have the entire line and having using it for about 3 weeks now! What an amazing change in my skin tome and wrinkles! I higly recommend!</li>
            <li> I was extremely excited to receive this product because I love to try new things. I used it the night I received it. The scent is pleasant and the texture of this eye cream is not too bad, not too thick, not too thin. With that said, I did not like the way it felt on my face after I used it. It was almost like it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;soak&amp;#34; in all the way. It was almost as though it left a thin layer of dried cream on my face. I have been using it for a couple days now and have noticed no noticeable difference in anything that is a problem with my eye area. I was not expecting immediate response to the fine lines, but the puffiness and dark circles should have been rapid, in my opinion. Not super excited with this product, will give in a little bit long before I make any super hard choices on keeping it or chucking it.</li>
            <li> has helped puffy eyes more than anything I have tried</li>
            <li> The bottle is a little smaller than I had hoped, but luckily a little bit of this stuff goes a long way. It feels really cooling on my eyes and absorbs quickly. It&#x27;s great for daytime use, but I need something a little bit more moisturizing for nighttime. I&#x27;ll probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any changes thus far its been 2-3 weeks</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help puffiness around eyes</li>
            <li> I really like this eye cream/gel.  Its super gentle and has a very light and silky texture.  You can even use it on your whole face!  I use this eye cream in the morning and a different one at night and I love the results.  Under my eyes def looks brighter.  You do have to give it time though to work, it wont be an instant change!  Patience and consistency is needed!</li>
            <li> This is a really great eye cream...one of the main reasons being due to the fact it has all natural ingredients. Its very nice to apply, and absorbs pretty fast into the skin leaving it very smooth and hydrated. The bags under my eyes look 10x better after just a few uses! I use it twice a day - once earlier in the day and I also apply at night as well so when I sleep it can work its magic.  I really like the packaging, its easy to get the product out in the right amount and the smell, really great. Smells refreshing and its very easy to toss into your purse or daytime cosmetic bag if you would like to take it with you. I usually apply mine twice a day with a very small amount. (The texture goes a long way) and find it works best when you use it 2x daily for about 2 weeks. You will see results hands down!!!  Overall, I am really happy with this product for the reason it gives me soft hydrated skin and makes me look less tired. My dark circles and bags underneath my eyes have massively improved!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last very long and didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. Wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles but was looking some results in the eye area. I did like the smell.</li>
            <li> Cools, soothes and plumps under eye area.  Love these products.  I just bought the cleanser and Vitamin C serum since these products are so effective.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00GYF65TK OZNaturals Eye Gel - Eye Cream For Dark Circles, Puffiness, Wrinkles - This Anti Wrinkle Eye Gel Was Voted ALLURE MAGAZINE&#x27;S Best In Beauty - The Most Effective Anti Aging Eye Cream Available!]]Love this product!  I&#x27;ve been using it now for 2 years with my skin care regimen and it diminishes the wrinkles around my eyes and they appear younger looking and healthy.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer to the eye&lt;br /&gt;Reduce dark circles</li>
            <li> This eye gel helped the darkness that I have. I love the OZ products because they are natural with all of their active ingredients 100 natural and 75% organic. The cream is light &amp; not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Love their products</li>
            <li> I have tried every eye cream that is out there and this one by far is one of the best.  I was having bad eczema and puffiness under my eyes and awful flaking.  I used this eye cream and the next day I was already starting to heal.  I can&#x27;t say enough about this product and all I can say is &amp;#34;try it&amp;#34; you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Be aware that this is only 1/2 OF AN OUNCE of actual fluid the packaging is deceiving. Although you don&#x27;t need much for your eyes it&#x27;s very hard not to squirt too much out at once and easy to waste it that way.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for my dark circles. Waste of my money</li>
            <li> This product has great ingredients it&#x27;s just that I don&#x27;t think my skin liked it around my eyes. I have sensitive eyes. I gave this product to my aunt and she is thrilled so it&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s not a good product. It&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now. It DOES reduce the bags and darkness under your eyes, but in my experience, its effects are only TEMPORARY. After 30 days of daily use, the darkness and bags are just as prominent as they were when I started. Shortly after applying the gel, the darkness tends to fade, resulting in a more attractive and energetic appearance. At the end of the day, that appearance has vanished.&lt;br /&gt;I have also experienced some irritation while it dries.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has dark circles under his eyes and puffiness. He&#x27;s been using it every night since December (3 months) and he sees no difference.  I just put it on and noticed no discernible difference in wrinkles, puffiness or dark circles. Eye gel is supposed to work immediately to at least reduce puffiness. It&#x27;s like putting aloe vera gel on your eyes; you will need moisturizer too.   Beware the over abundance of five star reviews. You will notice that most of them received free product in order to review. If you rate low, then no more free product!  Plus, a lot of the reviews are just &amp;#34;over the top&amp;#34; bizarre - not real people.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this gel.  I use it all over my face.  It really reduces the dark circles under my eyes and tightens my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know y the company asked me to review this..I already did and I didn&#x27;t care for it much..course that&#x27;s before I found out my house is full of poison. So I do love there hylaronic acid serum, they&#x27;re mineral face wash and sea mineral face moisturizer I use at night. Maybe I&#x27;ll give it another try. After I try the spray toner. That&#x27;s next.</li>
            <li> It works to tighten loose skin, even on neck.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I read what this eye gel could do but I thought I would try it.  I have been using it for about 3 days now and can notice a difference.  I really did not expect to see a difference especially so soon but I can certainly see where the lines around my eyes are less pronounced and underneath my eyes is less puffy.  It looks very smooth where I apply this eye gel.  I did not notice any change in the dark spots or shadows under my eyes, but just the fact that the skin is much smoother around my eyes is really noticeable.  I am going to continue using this, it works so well for me and I feel as though I have a more youthful appearance.  I am 48.</li>
            <li> I LOVE: OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel, OZ Nat Hyaluronic Acid Serum, and OZ Nat Super Youth Retinol Moisturizer (daytime or night time).  Of course I only use OZ Naturals Products ALONE with &amp;#34;Oil Of Olay 7 in One Total Effects Moisturizer&amp;#34; (for daytime-under makeup). I have oily and some semi-dry skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I also make Green Tea Astringent.  (&amp;#34;Green Tea Classic&amp;#34; w/ caffiene -- boil 2 bags as directed with Kentwood &amp;#34;Spring Bottled Water&amp;#34;, let cool-may add more spring water to make a lil less concentrated/make it last longer.  It will last approx 1-2 wks if kept in fridge. Smell to see if rancid-green tea doesn&#x27;t last too long!), Then I transfer to a spray bottle, put in fridge, get really cold ---- I use astringent with a cotton ball works wonders!!!  Tightens the skin on my entire face -- esp around the eyes ! It also helps reduce dark circles, wrinkles and puffiness -- I prefer a natural astringent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I also use coconut oil all over my face and Vitamin E and Rose Hip Seed oil under my eyes for night time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say after crying for the last 8yrs after my fiance died...Jon, My Love Rest in Paradise...I miss you so much my love! .....&lt;br /&gt;My face looks awesome!!!  I had many deep wrinkles from crying so many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched for a few months before I was able to find all the natural info I listed.  Thank you so much for the natural facial products!!!  Its so hard to find anything whether its facial, body or food that does have all kinds of unwanted and harmful ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DENISE</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product and I love it !!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Great service!  Great price!  Highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It works.</li>
            <li> Works very well!  I struggle with puffiness no matter the amount of sleep I get.  I am very happy with this purchase and will buy more.</li>
            <li> Seems to work on bags under the eyes, and not so much for darkness. Its much cheaper than many other high end products. Worth a try.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and great product</li>
            <li> Worthless don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Got item free to sample was good product worked well and love the smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a week but I started getting breakout so I&#x27;m returning this product tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had nobody say anything about my Dark circles so based on what other people say, I would say its an OK product but I probably would not buy this ice cream again</li>
            <li> It works - Most of my wrinkles are gone - have been using it for two months.  Will recommend highly.</li>
            <li> The eye gel works on me and I have tried many other eye products. It&#x27;s a small pump, but a little eye gel is all you need.</li>
            <li> A lovely gel that is definitely reducing the appearance of my fine lines and puffiness.  I was not expecting such quick results so Iam thrilled.</li>
            <li> Works great! As described. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money the product didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> It feels like it tightens the skin a bit but thats all. It leaves a greasy feel even if you rub it in good and didnt improve anything at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try to get rid of the darkness and redness under my eyes. It did absolutely nothing. I&#x27;ve been using this since late May 2015 and still nothing. I would post before and after photos but there is no point. Nothing has changed. Don&#x27;t bother with this product. All it did was lightly moisturize.</li>
            <li> It really really works. I was born with dark circles. 60 years &amp; outrageous $$ later I am dark circle free. That said, it hasn&#x27;t magically filled in the natural hollows so I will always have a shadow, but it is so much better without the dark blue discoloration. This is not a cover-up or light diffusing  topical. I don&#x27;t know how it works but it does and it does it fast. The puffiness is taking longer to abate.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product because I have seen change under my eye a day after I used it.  I was trying to find a better product without success and I am coming back to this again.  I honestly think this is a good product.  I gave it 4 stars because it didn&#x27;t take my under eye puffiness completely.  It made it look better but not completely.  I will continue to use this product until I find a better eye gel.</li>
            <li> Works well but not a miracle worker. It helps keep my skin around the eyes stay moist thus wrinkles go away.</li>
            <li> excellent!! Very refreshin and clears the eye ares</li>
            <li> My eyes are sensitive - and my allergies are kicking up - and this eye gel has been gentle and works.&lt;br /&gt;Love the ability to use only what I need - and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> thanks for the introduction offer, I have seen a difference from dark to light in 3 weeks. rock on oz</li>
            <li> works better than expensive treatments</li>
            <li> No improvement at all :(</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using this magic potion in a bottle, I walked by the mirror and had to do a double take. My dark circles are not nearly as pronounced, the puffiness has decreased dramatically and there&#x27;s just something about this Oz eye cream that I think may be addicting. I am already ordering a second one as I fear I will run out before I remember to order again.  I am no virgin to expensive &#x27;this and that&#x27; sold from my dermatologist- this product beats them all and at half the price.  Happy.</li>

The number of these microscopic lesions was higher in treated animals than in controls, but there was no clear dose dependency for this effect. Therefore, a no-observed-(adverse-)effect concentration (NO(A)EC) value cannot be derived. Long-term inhalation studies with benzoic acid or sodium benzoate were not identified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.topformsecrets.com/2011/03/sodium-benzoate-in-club-soda-is.html  :Just learned today that the sodium benzoate added as a preservative to many foods (including soft drinks and club soda) is carcinogenic. It forms benzene in the presence of vitamin C and E, or in an acidic environment—and benzene is a strong carcinogen. The manufacturers of sodium benzoate should be stopped from adding this poisin to soft drinks. There is evidence that benzene can also damage mitochondria (the powerhouse of cells), cause cirrhosis of the liver, and neurodegenerative disease, including Parkinson&#x27;s.

            <li> I love this gel, it tightened my under eye skin and the it&#x27;s just great !! I use it with a brightner cream to give that area more glow but other than that I am really satisfied :)</li>
            <li> Its very sticky and not seeing the intended results.  I would recommend nor purchase again.</li>
            <li> Oz Eye gel is awesome.  I had sagging skin under my eyes that made me look much older.  Nothing I used helped at all, they just seemed to get worse every year.  I am so glad I ordered the Oz eye gel!  Within days I could see the skin under my eyes tightening.  After about a month now I would say there is a 75% improvement.  I will buy this again, as long as they make it, nothing compares to this that I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product a Must Have</li>
            <li> I was on the fence about whether this was doing anything..have used it for about two months, twice a day. In the past month or so have notice more fine lines and expression lines forming! I&#x27;m very disappointed, having seen only negative results. Returning to my regimen before this product.</li>
            <li> product was so small i initially missed it in the box wrapping etc... got it now... sorry tried it already. love the way it feels. so tiny though..little bit pricy for that size.  Other competitive brands with similar ingredients are out there. unless super miraculous product... won&#x27;t buy it for cost and other cheaper options with similar quality</li>
            <li> Seems to do the job well.</li>
            <li> skin soaks this stuff up</li>
            <li> This is not just a Best Eye Cream, but a Best All-Over the Face serum! Firstly, it is not really a cream; it is more like a gel-cream, and a little goes a long way! It has a nice, immediate-firming feel and depending on one&#x27;s skin, can be enough to moisturize as well. It is chock-full of the latest and greatest anti-aging and skin nourishing ingredients-an impressive combination! I have been using it for a few weeks and this multi-tasker is a welcome and potent addition to my skin care arsenal. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> This is what I&#x27;ve been looking for. Fast shipment!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Just use a small dab.  I really love this product.  I have used other crèmes and this gel is what I needed!</li>
            <li> Wow! I am majorly impressed with this product. I randomly found a review of it online, ordered it, and received it so quickly.  As soon as I got it, I tried it.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two days now and can honestly see a difference already in my dark circles.  I was really skeptical that the reviews of this product might be fake but let me tell you..they are not! I&#x27;ve never reviewed anything on Amazon because I&#x27;ve never been that impressed with a product but this is amazing! Do yourself a favor and give it a try!!</li>
            <li> I received OZ Naturals Eye gel from Snagshout free to leave a review.  Surprisingly I like it. It makes my skin smooth, does not irritate it and smells pleasant.  It seems to work pretty well.  A little goes a long way so be careful pumping it out because you will get 3 x as much as you will need.</li>
            <li> Not the same product packaging!! Not very happy with no one addressing this. Not sure if it&#x27;s fake or what.</li>
            <li> No resuts yet.  i am going to try something else.</li>
            <li> I have this product as a gift, I really like the style and  it feels really good on my eye. I enjoy this project</li>
            <li> Like so many other body products that claim to be the miracle cure, this like all the others did not fulfill my expectations.  Nor did it really do anything other than keep me hoping a miracle was going to happen. It really does not work!</li>
            <li> I am not allergic to anything however this product puffed up all the skin around my eyes.  It is not for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, and I don&#x27;t see any positive effects at all.  In fact, my eyes look worse - puffier and with &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; below - yikes!  I just read a review about an allergic reaction and realized that I am having the same thing - thought it was hives - last night the area to the right of my right eye was very red and swollen, today it is the upper lid on my left eye (making my eye look like its swollen nearly shut).  Very disappointed after reading all those glowing reviews.... I had hoped that, at the very least, it would be a good organic moisturizer for that sensitive eye area.  Luckily, I made the purchase through Amazon, so I know there won&#x27;t be an issue with getting my money back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.  There were so many 5 star reviews that I thought this would really work.  Well, it doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve gone back and looked at those reviews and noticed that the reviewers gave 5 star reviews to every single eye gel they&#x27;ve reviewed.  I guess that&#x27;s how they get free products.  Also interesting that those reviews are all on the same day and some say the exact same thing.  I wanted to give this gel an adequate amount of time to see if it worked and thought I could since they give a 100% guarantee.  Don&#x27;t believe it. I went past the 30 day mark thinking it took longer to show some results.  I contacted the company and was told I had to return the product within 30 days.  I guess the 100% guarantee carries a time limit!</li>
            <li> Love this eye gel I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks but my eyes feel soft and seem brighter.</li>
            <li> This did nothing at all for me when used it as directed, and in fact I got some red spots in the areas where I applied it, which may or may not be related.  Either way I&#x27;m not going to be using this anymore.</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel, it did everything it said it would.  It even helped tighten and lift my cheeks and reduce my forehead wrinkles.  Well worth the price and I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference with this product.</li>
            <li> I would say &amp;#34;The BEST eye gel...&amp;#34; is a stretch. Basically if feels and smells like cucumbers which is mostly just water. Have been using for a month night &amp; day &amp; have seen no difference. Save your money &amp; go with a better brand</li>
            <li> I only used this for a week, but to me, my eyes looked blacker than before.</li>
            <li> This gel is cooling and I have noticed a change in the smoothness of my eye lids which at 66 years of age makes the eye shadow look better.  It is also a great value.</li>
            <li> Nothing extraordinary , I feel I just wasted my money :(</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Took a chance &amp; I am so glad I did!  I can see the puffy, dark circles under my eyes disappearing.  Thank you Oz Naturals!  I will be trying more of your products!</li>
            <li> Seems to work as well as the much higher priced eye cream I had been using.  Seems to be helping reduce puff, under eye looks clearer.  Like the delivery ~ a pump bottle vs a jar you have to stick your finger in.</li>
            <li> Have been using for a few weeks now. I like how it goes on and how it feels.</li>
            <li> I received this eye gel free in the hope that I would give a review on it.  It has a lovely texture, smells lovely and absorbs really well into the area around my eyes. It has improved the dark shadows under my eyes and reduced the puffiness. The wrinkles or should I say laughter lines are slowly improving. You only have to use a small amount for both eyes though as a little goes a long way. I will definitely buy it when I have used this.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and easy to use.  I think using this product makes a difference and is easy to add to my daily skincare regimen.</li>
            <li> Did not see any results. Caused some skin irritation like dryness and readness.will not buy again. Probably some cheap stuff in the pump.</li>
            <li> my eyes looked great after using, the next day I had whiteheads everywhere I put the gel</li>
            <li> This 65 year old face needs help with the wrinkles and puffiness under my eyes.  I use the serum and it really helps so, I’m going to try the eye treatment.  This shipper exceeds expectations.</li>
            <li> okay so I have been waiting to write a review to see how this works. After 2 weeks my mom said my eyes look better and I have noticed an improvement.</li>
            <li> I waited a few days to review so I could really review honestly. I received on friday the 25th, used that night. It went on rather thick, but I left it thick, thinking it might not fully absorb. I checked after about 10 minutes and it did absorb, my eyes felt super plumped, moisturized and firmed. I have used morning, under makeup, and night since. I love this stuff!!  Now I need a larger container so I can use this all over, face and throat.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, especially when reading a good amount of reviews saying its great, but it really is. It&#x27;s great for a nightly eye, and when you first out it on you feel it working right away. Then it says you can use on your forehead and other areas of the face that may be wrinkled or concerning, and it works outstandingly! I&#x27;m impresses and hope it doesn&#x27;t just wear as I continue. So far been using it for a few days and its doing better than my last eyes cream. Only thing, I don&#x27;t recommend using it in the mornings before makeup if you do wear makeup because it leaves a film where you applied it, so it may leave a weird spot under your eye when you put on foundation or concealer. I didn&#x27;t like that. But if you wear it at home it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it would do much. My circles are probably caused by a low Thyroid. So I need to concentrate on that issue. I just wanted to try something I never tried before, so now I can say I tried it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product.  It has seemed to reduce dark circles. Doesn&#x27;t remove them, of course, but mine are not as dark.</li>
            <li> This is a thick, gel moisturizer.  The tiniest amount covers both eye areas easily.  I&#x27;ve been using the same bottle for 3 months and am happy with the product value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many eye treatment gels in the past, including some of the most expensive brands.  This eye gel by Oz Naturals is by far the most effective.  Within minutes of applying I could instantly feel a tightening and lifting effect. The gel is also awesome for brightening dark circles.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an effective eye gel.</li>
            <li> This is....just weird. It is so sticky - after I put it on, and smiled - my under-eyes crinkled (you know, like all eyes do when you smile)....and the crinkles just....stayed there! Tried using a minuscule amount, and there was less stickiness but my then under-eyes weren&#x27;t hydrated. I can&#x27;t imagine trying to put makeup on over this. Does not feel luxurious at all. Will return.</li>
            <li> I am familiar with Oz Naturals and use the hyraulonic serum daily with great results.  So when the eye cream came out I was anxious to try it and I am not disappointed.  The product has a great texture, very rich and creamy but not greasy.  It goes on very smoothly and I like that you can use it all around the eye, both lid and  under eye.  After using it for only a few days, my eyes look less puffy.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after I finish the bottle!</li>
            <li> Happy with this eye cream.  Second purchase.  Lasted about 4 months.</li>
            <li> Feels great on and absorbs easily. Under eye concealer is not effected by gel.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me....it has the sam ingredients as the instanatural. ....neither were good&lt;br /&gt;Np difference after 8 weeks</li>
            <li> This did not work for me at all.  I have dark circles and puffiness. The first time I used this product it seemed as if my puffiness under my eyes got worse.  My under eyes looked worse than ever before.  Maybe because I am over 60 and perhaps this is why.  Don&#x27;t buy.&lt;br /&gt;Try anything but this product for puffiness.  It was a total waste of money and they do not offer a guarantee for refunding your money. I will not buy this product again.  Totally disappointed.  I&#x27;m still trying their other products such as vitamin C, hydo etc cream after applying vit C.  I see no results whatsoever.  I think my Neutrogena face cream works a lot better than this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am using it for few days now I don&#x27;t see much difference I guess have to wait</li>
            <li> I received this to review and I&#x27;m very happy with the results of this product. I use it as a moisturizer and it works beautifully. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I don&#x27;t like its consistency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product 1 day and used it twice. I&#x27;ve been using a good eye area conditioner but this is better. The first time I used it I wanted to use it as a serum for my entire face. Although it clearly says you can I don&#x27;t want to waste it. My eye area at 64 is the only spot so in need of help. I noticed it was quite small so don&#x27;t be fooled into Thinking this is an expensive product. Although it&#x27;s far less expensive than the other products I use for my eyes. I&#x27;m hopeful this will help with the discolored hyper pigmentation in my eye area. This is from many years in the sun ( not in the past 30 years) without sunscreen. As a kid and young adult I wasn&#x27;t even aware it was a bad thing. I will update and describe how well it performs. Update 3/28/15 I continue to see daily improvement as I use this product. I have less puffiness and a more even smooth eye area. I&#x27;ll be using this daily and I think most people would also love this.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work at all...misleading...paid reviews made this product number one...</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t walk out without it. This products does wonders for eye area! I will reorder!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any big changes, so I will give it an OK.....maybe I need to use it longer.</li>
            <li> This product is okay. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again though. It works, doesn&#x27;t perform any miracles haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my face, but there has been some improvement. It got a little clumpy after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Quantity is way tooooo less than what i expected... dint last me a week even... so disappointed... doesnt even do what it claims</li>
            <li> First of all let me state that I DID NOT receive a free sample of this product... I am a regular customer who researched the ingredients, read the reviews, and decided to try it after purchasing it myself right here on amazon.com.  I am 46 years old, and have the small &amp;#34;crinklies&amp;#34; starting to develop, but do not have deep wrinkles to contend with.  My skin is normal to dry, pore size is moderate to small, and very sensitive to fragrances, does not like salicylic acid but loves glycolic acid, and silicone heavy products and my skin do not get along very well.  I have started to ramp up my anti-aging skincare routine more for prevention than for correction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a week now and am very pleased.  Immediate results that I can see are a reduction in puffiness, and the hydration level in the skin around my eyes has increased.  This smooths out the &amp;#34;crinklies&amp;#34; by plumping the skin and retaining moisture.  I am realistic and realize that deeper results are going to take time.  What I can say is that the ingredients in this product are top notch with proven benefits, and they are potent enough that I have complete faith the product will continue to improve my skin over time.  I plan to update my review in a few months with results after longer use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye gel goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.  It does not interfere with the application of my makeup afterwards which I LOVE. My skin is on the dry side, but I do not like greasy products.  Hydration comes from water not oil, and this product delivers hydration and helps skin retain it. Puffiness is reduced immediately, and after just a week I am noticing that the skin around my eyes is smoother and more hydrated even after washing it off.  This tells me real changes are happening in my skin and I cannot wait to see the results I get after continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a product formulator myself (hair care, not skin care) so I understand the importance of good ingredients and formulations that are potent enough to deliver results and not just label excitement.  I feel this product line is top quality, and really appreciate how the company has taken such care to use natural and organic ingredients and to use them in concentrations that will actually give real results.</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel! It is great for early mornings after a late night at work. It helps my eyes feel awake and alert. Sometimes I feel like I can&#x27;t wake up enough to function, but this gel really helps me wake up! I love that it is all natural, and is great for wrinkles and fine lines. Great product!</li>
            <li> This is an eye gel that actually works.  It is on my list of must haves....</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of months on my under-eye area. At first it was hard to notice any difference. But now after using it awhile, I do notice that the fine lines and bags under my eyes have been significantly reduced. The ingredients are among the finest, for sure: plant stem cells, hyaluronic acid and Vitamin E. It feels good on the skin, and one thing I like about it is that I can even wear it in the daytime as it doesn&#x27;t show up.&lt;br /&gt;This was given to me for review, and I am glad it was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Schenck, award-winning author of The Live Food Factor and Beyond Broccoli and plenty of other books</li>
            <li> Seems to really work.  Hyper pigmentation around my eyes is becoming lighter.  Eye area is soft, eye make up goes on with ease now, no pulling or tugging.  Will purchase again</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I have very picky eyes , everything seems to make them red, peel and swollen. Ugh!! This really works and I can see!</li>
            <li> nice product just not results I was looking for can see much of a change</li>
            <li> Why  does all the manufactures of face serum, eye creams make them so expensive  for people like me to buy them, but this is a very good eye cream and you can believe I have tried just about everything that is out in the market place.  I will surely re-order.  Thanks again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product twice a day for about a week now. What I like about it is that you can feel it work and sort of tighten the area under the eye immediately. However I am not seeing the desired results for dark circles. For me this product worked ok on the puffiness side but not at all for dark circles. Remind you I have struggled with dark circles those all my life.</li>
            <li> It seems to work quick &amp; long lasting.  Good buy for the price.  U need to try it for yourself</li>
            <li> I am glad to be using this gel as it certainly moisturizes and nourishes the under-eye area without leaving a greasy or shiny look (which a lot of eye creams do, and which I frankly find most annoying.) I am hoping that with sustained use, the darkness of the circles will also diminish somewhat. I am giving it five stars as I have no complaints and I think that lightening dark circles around eyes is a long term process, if at all one believes that they can be lightened! (A girl can hope, right?). I am happy with their serums, so am ok giving this eye gel a chance and using it for a longer period of time before I pass any final verdict on its in/effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I have been devoted to Ole Henriksen Ultimate Eye Lift Gel for years now.  Decided to try this becuase I have been extremely pleased with my recent discovery of OZ Naturals products.  This comes in a pump dispenser and a tiny bit goes a long way.  Very happy with results and use both at night and in the mornng. I find no issues with applying concealer, etc. over this product.</li>
            <li> bought for the great price and good reviews on Amazon. It is easy to apply and does seem to work pretty well</li>
            <li> i tried this eye product but its not useful , only waste of money&lt;br /&gt;waste of money waste of money</li>
            <li> This is a great product for Men. 50+ male here, with the eyelids drooping and just feeling tired. Decided to bite the bullet and see what&#x27;s out there in the cosmetic world. Last year, a female friend had taken me to the high end counter and picked up a product that really did help to get the tired look gone but it cost $300. After reading reviews decided to give this a try. Wasn&#x27;t expecting much. Wow, I really don&#x27;t care if the drooping and folds don&#x27;t go away, this stuff makes the eyes just feel  really good!! Have to say, it really does tighten things up, not a huge difference but  enough to take the tired look away. But for me, it&#x27;s just how it feels. Besides that, there is no smell, no irritation, no oily sheen. This puts in the moisture that really gives a fresh feeling. Also, don&#x27;t need to be overly careful when putting it on, it does not irritate the eye at all. I&#x27;ve only been using it a week so can&#x27;t really comment on long term benefits. If there are none coming, that&#x27;s OK; this product just makes things feel really good. I look forward to  applying it!!</li>
            <li> I am not seeing the difference like all the reviews are stating.</li>
            <li> Skin around eyes looks great.  Wrinkles do not show after few days.  I will stick to this product.</li>
            <li> Have very sensitive eyes and this is just great.  Has a gel type consistency and the packaging is very good- allows for complete emptying of container.  Have purchased again.</li>
            <li> This product does seem to reduce the puffiness under my eyes a bit.  Any other product I have tried has not.</li>
            <li> This product is just ok for me. I hate the consistency of it. It is a very clumpy gel when you first pump it out, I had to waste about 5 pumps of product before it came out smooth. I think I will stick to my L&#x27;oreal revitalift. I definitely will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews often but I see that there are a lot of questions. I love, love this stuff. I have used it daily for the past two months and have definitely noticed an improvement in wrinkles, dark circles and puffiness. I have had dark circles most of my life, I am 52 years young. I have NEVER found a product that works this well. I have even used very high end products and nothing work. The texture is very smooth and goes on great. Not heavy at all! I love the smell, it&#x27;s kinda like cucumber.  No chemically, fragranced fake smel in the this. I apply it on my eyes, upper and lower, my mouth area and smooth any leftover into my face. It&#x27;s funny when I am applying this I can actually hear myself going mmmmmmm. I use coconut oil as an all over face and eyes moisturizer. Some questions people thought because since there were so many 5 stars it was a marketing campaign. Well not from me. Like I said I am a 52 year old female living right outside of PA. The only way to know for sure is to try it. The price is great! I mean go into any drugstores and eye creams and face serums are close to this price. This has a drugstore price with a high end cosmetic store result. I am getting ready to order for a second time and that&#x27;s unheard of from me. I have never found a product that I wanted to order a second time. Btw- this is not an instant gel, and not a miracle gel, but to me it does work wonders. I hope this helped to clarifiy any concerns that you may have.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product because of the great ingredient list, but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t.  It is not really a cream; it&#x27;s more of a gel.  It was also sticky and did not work with my concealer very well.  I saw no difference in dark circles or wrinkles, and I have been using it a month.  The search continues for the perfect eye cream....</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week now. I wouldn&#x27;t say I love it but I don&#x27;t dislike it either (it&#x27;s a hit or miss). It seem to be woking on the fine lines on my forehead and has made it smoother. However, my under eye darkness just seems to be GETTING DARKER which was the  main reason i got the product for.  I WILL NOT be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Ok, but I&#x27;v seen better. I&#x27;ll let you know in a couple of weeks. By then this product should be gone.</li>
            <li> The packaging is impressive like my previous eye creams. This eye gel is quite reminds me that &amp;#34;Insta natural Eye gel&amp;#34; The color is transparent as you can see. It feels so cool and refresh as well.Good for my puffy, tired eyes.♥ It absorbs well and in the mean time it&#x27;ll hydrates and moisturized completely making your eyes non-greasy.I am loving this to wear it under doing makeup. I highly recommend this eye gel if you wanna try something different. Good for any skin type i guess.</li>
            <li> I have used it only three days but I see no change at all.  Suppose to see visible results quickly.  I don&#x27;t expect miracles but I expect something.</li>
            <li> Stays sticky for hours, despite using least amount possible. Only used for a week, so cannot address results. Just couldn&#x27;t get beyond texture.</li>
            <li> I like to use this in the morning before putting my makeup on. It is a very lightweight formula that smooths onto my skin very easily. I tend to focus this around my eyes and onto my forehead, but I do take whats left over on my fingertips and use it all over my face and neck. This product also kinda helps work as a primer for my foundation as well. So that is kind of an added perk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel like I said is very lightweight. One pump of this product will cover my entire face, so a little goes a long way. To me this gel feels similar to putting on a cucumber mask, it cools a little, and totally eliminates my puffiness. I don&#x27;t suffer from fine lines or wrinkles yet (I&#x27;m only 25) but I do like to use skincare products to help prevent and reduce skin issues I may have in the future. Where I have applied it, my skin does have a brighter, more healthier look to it. I am still currently using this, so once this bottle is used up I will update on the long term usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this product is amazing, a soft cucumber / aloe smell. Very fresh and clean smelling which I like, plus it&#x27;s not too over powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like this gel, and I am looking forward to seeing its long term results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t like  this.</li>
            <li> In the last year or so I have noticed dark circles under my eyes. Over the months they became progressively worse. I tried so many different products. I tried concealers, powders, and just about every eye cream (one was $150!) and nothing worked. Then as I was searching on Amazon, and reading reviews, I read in a review for another product about OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel. The reviewer absolutely loved this product. So I checked out the reviews for OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel, and after reading so many positive reviews I ordered OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel. Oh my goodness, this is THE BEST EYE CREAM/GEL/PRODUCT EVER! My dark circles are 95% GONE! My eyes appear brighter, I appear well rested...and younger! I don&#x27;t even wear concealer anymore, it is amazing. If you&#x27;re hesitating, hesitate no longer! If OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel works half as well for you as it did for me, the only thing you will be sorry about is not buying it sooner!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a year now and really like it.</li>
            <li> The reviews of this are so excellent I had to try but unfortunately it has done nothing for me, no change or difference.</li>
            <li> Eyes are 65+ old and I&#x27;d been slathering on oily creams to keep wrinkles at bay. But the oils either crept into my eyes and burned, wore off after a couple of hours, or did nothing for puffiness. The oil also tended to wear off any kind of eyeliner I used. Then I tried gel formulas that supposedly tightened and took care of puffiness. They dried my eyelids out so badly that they looked like wrinkled crepe paper. This was a desperation purchase, and I&#x27;m glad I got this stuff. It&#x27;s right in the middle of moisturizing and tightening, does a great job of taking care of puffiness, doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34; into my eyes, is much kinder on eyeliner, lasts a good 10 hours (for me), doesn&#x27;t make my lids (upper or lower) crinkle, but leaves them very soft and smooth. And the cream (I&#x27;d call it more of a gel) does the best job of tightening out of all the (MANY!) gels and creams I&#x27;ve tried for eyes. I won&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best eye serums I&#x27;ve used.  Definitely can feel the tightening (i.e. lift) this product offers.  Some will still need to use retinal along with this product, but using retinal alone will not deliver as much as using it in conjunction with this product.  This is a must use!</li>
            <li> This is the second time ordering this eye gel. It came in a clear-see through container this time.  It was in a solid white-no see through container last time.  I&#x27;m not a chemist, but I have done a lot of research on ingredients.  I do know some ingredients can not be exposed to light. It also smells different this time.  I might send it back. Not sure.  It&#x27;s a waste of money if the ingredients are no good from the light.</li>
            <li> This product turned the very fine lines under my eyes black. It didn&#x27;t hurt and I liked the way the gel felt but I think I may be allergic to something in the product. The blackness went away after I put another cream on top of the eye gel. It also produced two tiny itchy bumps under one of my eyes. I&#x27;m not usually sensitive to products so I was surprised.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t see any difference with this product. if you use it under make up it gets gloppy and has to be removed.  i will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I must agree--&amp;#34;best product ever!&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ve been using  several products for lines, puffy eyes and dark circles.  This is now the only thing I need.</li>
            <li> .I have order twice I haven&#x27;t specific progress but feel that it is safe for my eyes. I would purchase again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month twice a day. I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine to use at night. Has made somewhat of an improvement to teeny wrinkles around my eyes. But, I cannot use it during the day, it&#x27;s just too thick and puffs my under eye area out. Do not use it above your eye, not even at night.  It is a bit thick for an eye gel and I do prefer eye gels to creams.</li>
            <li> Hi I been using this product since May 20 2015 and don&#x27;t work is been a month I don&#x27;t see any result. So all those people buy and say a work is not true !!</li>
            <li> This item came without any type of plastic cover to indicate that it is new. Usually make up product comes with some kind of protecting materials, but not this one. It also doesn&#x27;t work. I bought this for my puffy eyes. This item do nothing. My cold eye patch works better than this cream.</li>
            <li> Save your money if your are really serious about looking younger.&lt;br /&gt;As a woman in her early 50&#x27;s, I&#x27;m serious!&lt;br /&gt;My doctor recommended a product that is only physician sold that has really helped.&lt;br /&gt;I also started to wear sunscreen every day and have noticed a huge change in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye gel for about 3 weeks now and I definitely see a difference in the puffiness and brightness of my eyes after using this for a weeks, the eye gel doesn’t work instantly but the first thing I noticed after a few days was that under my eyes started to look brighter and I had pretty much no dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this is an all natural formula and I would recommend trying this out if you are looking for a good eye cream!</li>
            <li> This worked great from the first time I used it and my wife uses it too. I no longer have any left because I used it all up. Probably will buy this product soon after I use another eye cream that I have.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mother in law.  She needed an eye gel for the bags under her eyes.  Her skin is very sensitive, so I was a little worried that she would not like this product, but I am happy to report that she did not experience any irritation and the bags under her eyes are reduced significantly.</li>
            <li> Just okay. I saw no change or improvements to my skin. I&#x27;m over 60.  I&#x27;ve found other less expensive products that do a much better job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Really helped my dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin around the eyes feeling tight and uncomfortable. It&#x27;s very unpleasant feeling and there are no results to make it worth it.</li>
            <li> Awful. Did nothing, other than dry my eyes area out.</li>
            <li> Great eye gel. Recommend to every one.</li>
            <li> I really like the silky texture of this eye gel. I use it morning and night - in the am it&#x27;s almost like having a light primer around my eyes - makeup just slides on beautifully over it. Also, so great that they have airtight packaging and a pump dispenser. I hate spending a ton on eye creams that are exposed to the air and lose their anti-oxident properties. This one is a winner.</li>
            <li> Love this product, going on around the eyes very easily. Takes only a minute to soak in, make up goes on very smooth over the top, skin feels firmer.</li>
            <li> The eye gel makes eyes feel cool and relaxed. It is not greasy or oily, I do not know how good it is to reduce wrinkles but it does make the eyes feel less tiring. I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> Of the four Oz Naturals products I have tried, this is the one product I was really disappointed with. I don&#x27;t have problems with wrinkles or dark circles around my eyes.  My reason for purchasing this product was to address the sagging, crepey skin on my eyelids. I have been looking for a product to target this problem for the past few years, but have not found anything that helped. I read a review on this product where someone mentioned good results for firming the skin in the lid area, so decided to give it a try.  I used the product for a full five months, and saw no improvement at all.  The gel goes on easily and smoothly and soaks right in, and seems as good as any other general eye cream/moisturizer, but it just didn&#x27;t meet my expectations.  I have now discontinued it and moved on to yet another product that claims to firm and tighten.</li>
            <li> Pretty good. Love the smell.</li>
            <li> First eye cream I&#x27;ve ever bought that has actual results. It makes the puffiness go down soon after applying and fine lines reduced. Maybe dark circles fade a bit too. Not sure there are long-term effects though.  **Edit:  The third time I ordered this it came in a new container that forces you to squirt out about ten times more gel than needed. Pretty sure that&#x27;s what they are hoping you&#x27;ll do. The container can&#x27;t be opened in order to put the unused gel back in. Big fat waste. Not sure I&#x27;ll order it again, and definitely won&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. Greedy move. The old bottle was wasteful too, but this one is worse.</li>
            <li> Eyes look much less wrinkly</li>
            <li> Did not work on me :(</li>
            <li> I thought it would really be good at first. But then I noticed more detail to the lines under my eyes. I didn&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li> Did not work.  And I used it daily.</li>
            <li> smooth touch. Nice products</li>
            <li> The product smells nice and feels great going on. Hope lily I will get the results I need. Great product</li>
            <li> I use this product at night only.  My circles have not changed from my use of this product in the past two weeks.  It is also a little lumpy when I apply it.  I am not sure I will reorder at this time.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not bad. I&#x27;ve tried every thing on the market for crow&#x27;s feet. It seems to work a little better than other products, but it&#x27;s not a miracle gel.</li>
            <li> I got this hoping to see a difference but nothing. I read the reviews and thought this would be good for me, well I was wrong. Waste of money :( for me!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I do love this product, and wanted to share. It hasn&#x27;t completely gotten rid of my black circles under my eyes (I do still have a 13 month old who refuses to sleep!) but they are much better. My eyes look much brighter and feel more smooth around them. I will purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I have been so impressed with this eye gel, that I have already reordered. I like the look, smell and feel of it even better than the Christian Dior Capture products I have been using for more than 20 years, and the Oz Youth Eye Gel saves me 80 percent compared to the cost of the Dior products.  It&#x27;s about time disruption is coming to the snooty, overpriced cosmetics industry!</li>
            <li> Really liking this product.  I have super sensitive eyes and I can apply this all over them. I use this for my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> This serum comes in a small dispenser and it took me a while to realize that when it says just use a pea sized dab, they are not kidding. This works great around the eyes and usually there is more to spread around to other areas needing the attention of a moisturizing serum. Used sparingly, as is directed, this little bottle goes a long way and is well worth the price. I have compared it to much more expensive serums and this OZ Naturals product is the best, in my opinion. Try it, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> While not expecting miracles, I was pleasantly surprised by how this product firms and tightens the under-eye skin. I don&#x27;t have dark circles, but this eye gel seems to brighten the eye area, too. I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any change​</li>
            <li> Worst product ever-- and it takes a lot for me to say this because I&#x27;m a fan of OZ Naturals.  Terrible smell, feels like wet paste on your skin and dries to a tight, pasty finish.  It reminds me of a face mask that dries to a clear matte finish before you wash it off.  It makes your skin feel tight and uncomfortable. Note to OZ NATURALS:  Take this back and reformulate it because it is your worst product ever.  If I could return it to you (I no longer have packaging), I would return it in a heartbeat. If you&#x27;ve just purchased it, do yourself a favor and ship it back because I&#x27;ll be shocked if  you like it.  However, if you DO like it, and you find your experience vastly different from what I&#x27;ve tried to describe here, please let me know.  Maybe I received an expired or otherwise bad shipment.  Thank you.  Otherwise, if I was able to give this NO stars, I would have done it.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in this product. While it seems to have a gel consistency, it feels thick and doesn&#x27;t smooth on easily. Instead, it is sticky and remains sticky. I have to smooth regular moisturizer over it to get rid of the stickiness. I can&#x27;t speak to any of the other claims of this product because the stickiness makes it pretty much unusable to me. I regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> I saw nothing special and found it very sticky.</li>
            <li> Yes, this has reduced some of the puffiness around my eyes, and as an added bonus I have noticed an improvement in skin coloring around the eyes.  It&#x27;s not nirvana, but it is definitely an improvement and I will order again.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and they were so good I decided to order some of the Oz products. I think most people must have gotten these products for Free in return to leave a positive review! They are ok - nothing great, just ok. I paid for my items so I wanted to leave a real review for anyone looking to purchase. They are ok, not very foaming and I do not feel it removes make up well. I will use up what I have but not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am the type of buyer that research for hours to find a good product that will not make me break out.. Also.. I have failed many times before and I really have a tight budget so I have to be safe when choosing a product that will be good for me. I searched for a eye cream on amazon for 2 days straight and decided on this one because it seemed most safe and affordable from reading all the reviews. I ate chicken last night so my face and eyes were so puffy and swollen. This package arrived at work so I just dabbed it on right away and the gel feels so cool and my eyes fee like they are less puffy! I wish I took a before and after photo but this is definitely IT!!</li>
            <li> Good eye cream but not working for my condition.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Dr. Oz!!!  You will be amazed by the noticeable results and it only gets better with ongoing use.</li>
            <li> Useless. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says on the tin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use only about half a pump of this, and tap it around my eyes in a diamond shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has reduced puffiness around my eyes, and the area feels much smoother. It says that the cream can be used as a face treatment too.</li>
            <li> Great product! Helps smooth my fine lines &amp; even filled in the vertical crevice between my eyebrows. It seems to help lighten around my eyes &amp; tighten up the skin. Very satisfied with my purchase. My only concern is that I&#x27;ll run out! Although the packaging looks nice, it&#x27;s impossible to determine how much product remains.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many eye creams and undeniably, this eye cream is the best! I couldn&#x27;t live without it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It felt so good the very first time I applied it.  As if the skin around my eyes was IMMEDIATELY moisturized and on top of that, it felt comfortable all day. Never felt sticky or pasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a short period of use (not quite 2 weeks) there was definitely a noticeable difference.  The skin around my eyes looked more supple and there was a major difference in the texture and overall appearance.  My skin absolutely looks younger and my eyes look brighter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> Removes dark circles and love this. No side effects observed.  A sample was sent for review  purposes.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen much improvement</li>
            <li> excellent eye serum and priced with the budget minded consumer. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Seems to help with dark circles but doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference for me on puffiness and fine wrinkles, unfortunately. It isn&#x27;t scented at all and doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes which is good. It feels sort of heavy and thick even though it is a gel, and takes a few minutes to soak in. Once it does though, the area you&#x27;ve applied it to feels silky smooth and hydrated. It feels almost like a silicone makeup primer, so its great to use before applying makeup because it makes the makeup hold better. I feel like the packaging could be a bit nicer but for this price point it&#x27;s fine. Only a little bit of product is needed so the bottle will last a while! I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who has dark circles and wants to improve the look of them.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice any marked improvement-unfortunately.  It may work for others though.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing for the wrinkles and dark bags under my eyes. I&#x27;m a seriously disappointed 29 year old.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye gel I&#x27;ve ever used!  It reduced my under eye puffiness to a minimum.</li>
            <li> Most magnificent product to improve wrinkles and fine lines. I not only use this on and around my eyes but also on my forehead and around my mouth. I love all the ingredients that nourish my skin, but I love the hyaluronic acid which is so important for hydrating and plumping the skin. I have tried all sorts of eye creams and I really like this one. It goes on smooth, and smooth&#x27;s the skin under and around my eye. It is not greasy or oily. My concealer and make up goes on well and does not cake up. Best anti-aging!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for letting me try your eye gel! I am going to let my sister so the testing on this product, since her wrinkles are pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;She is on day 5, and there is a difference. SHe says she loves it, so if it keeps working, I&#x27;ll keep buying it for her.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. I used the whole thing and at the end of it.  I didn&#x27;t notice any changes.</li>
            <li> Not the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used, but good. I bought this to replace my favorite eye cream. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune, but wanted something that moisturizes and protects. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or allergies, so my eyes adjusted to this gel quickly. You don&#x27;t need much per application and it goes on with a smooth, cool feeling. I can&#x27;t say it really does much, but it seems to moisturize. Perhaps not as much as other cream-based products that I&#x27;ve used. It doesn&#x27;t seem to help for dark eye circles (as I chronically suffer from). Still haven&#x27;t found the best product for that without spending a fortune.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, must be a scam.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eye gel. I can feel it slightly tighten around my eyes when I put it on and I have noticed less fine lines. Not irritating at all. Excellent!</li>
            <li> just moisturizing that&#x27;s it...</li>
            <li> Love the way this works</li>
            <li> Thank you great product will order again</li>
            <li> I like the gel. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days. I can somewhat see the difference. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the change.</li>
            <li> Did not see a difference at all. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was not my favorite product.  It smelled very nice and had a pleasing cooling texture.  It didn&#x27;t really make any improvement on my dark circles however</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye creams, but this gel like cream absorbs into the eye area very nicely and makes under eye cover cream easy to apply. It does help with puffy under eyes and dark circles.  Would recommend to  friends</li>
            <li> Ehhh.  No great improvement but it did hydrate the skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li> On most days I wear Benefits &amp;#34;Erase Paste&amp;#34; for my darker circles, but I feel like with consistent use of this, I use it less and less, sometimes I think I am even wearing the Erase when I&#x27;m actually not. I can&#x27;t say for sure this product is making all the difference, as I have made dietary changes as well. I like the consistency of this product, it goes on like a light weight gel and sinks in. It feels a little tacky when dry but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I usually have allergy problems with eye gels and creams.  Not this one!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin  and so far so good! No bad reaction and it definitely reduces puffiness and seems to reduce dark circles. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, so I can&#x27;t attest to that. But anything that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin is amazing!</li>
            <li> Best Eye anti aging money can buy!!!!</li>
            <li> be patient as results show down the road.  All Oz products are excellent! You will see results but be patient as they get better with time.  3/12/2015 I have been using this product for about 8 months now and I m still seeing positive results.  The skin under my eyes is smoother, less lines, the dark circles are definitely lighter and the overall look around the eye is more youthful.  This product used consistently continues to give results.</li>
            <li> This gel did nothing but irritate my eyes. I was extremely careful to apply just to the surrounding eye area, but my vision was foggy the next day. I noticed this every single time I tried to use it.  Since I was beyond the return window, I decided to use the gel on other parts of my face and have noticed no difference in skin quality/wrinkles, etc. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> A big disappointment!  The gel is wet and does not absorb into the skin,&lt;br /&gt;all of which makes it hard to apply concealer on top of it.  I do not&lt;br /&gt;like this product and it was a waste of time and money, sorry to&lt;br /&gt;say.</li>
            <li> Scent too strong for me, I am hypersensitive.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I started to use this product about 2 months ago and I am ordering my 2nd bottle today. As many, I was also skeptical about the results but it does work. I started to get saggy eyelids especially my right eye because I tend to sleep more on that side/sideways. It has seriously reduced that sagginess and I didn&#x27;t think that was possible other than with surgery. I use this product every morning and some nights. It&#x27;s very reasonably priced for such a fantastic product. I use this along with the OZ naturals vitamin C serum and I cannot even tell you how many compliments I get on my skin even from the esthetician that does microdermabrasion treatments on my face. She told me &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t recommend anything to you because whatever you are using now works so well&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The lines on my upper lip, chin, eyes and forehead have been greatly diminished with the use of OZ Naturals Eye Cream. The price was reasonable, it spreads easily and a little amount goes a long way. I&#x27;ll keep using it for sure!</li>
            <li> I can see the difference after only a few days!  It could be because of other products I&#x27;m using and it works in conjunction with that.  But the difference is noticeable as the dark shadows around my eyes are noticeably fading.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product !!!&lt;br /&gt;I rarely write reviews but this really deserves one !&lt;br /&gt;My skin is velvety soft , well hydrated and some lines around my eyes are responding nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy that the formula is made from real plants and has no chemical junk in it.&lt;br /&gt;Even when I had to miss a couple of days without it, the hydration and smoothness remained&lt;br /&gt;even though I am 68 with a lifetime of sun.....&lt;br /&gt;I am not a big user of cosmetics or potions, but I confess that I already had the hyalauronic acid+ C&lt;br /&gt;from OZ and used that after cleansing and then the eye cream. I used it on my whole face until I&lt;br /&gt;remembered that is was for the eyes...&lt;br /&gt;What a fantastic COMBO...  Thank you OZ for this trial. I am sold...</li>
            <li> This eye gel goes on easily; a little goes a long way. It does not irritate my eyes like so many other eye creams. Puffiness is lessened as are fine lines. I&#x27;ve had dark circles under my eyes since I was a kid. I can&#x27;t say I see much difference in that after using this gel. But I do like it for the other reasons listed above, and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE TEXTURE AND SMELL</li>
            <li> So - so, don&#x27;t really see a difference in my 60 yr. old eyes</li>
            <li> feels like aloe vera, i dont notice any improvement</li>
            <li> This product Is 100%, excelent. I feel satisfecha!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 21 year old female with some mild dark circles under my eyes and after reading the reviews decided to give it a shot.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m so young and my dark circles aren&#x27;t so bad but I saw no change after using this product.  I suppose this product is best suited for older folks with more severe problems so it maks a more spectacular change.</li>
            <li> Really pleased with the performance of this eye cream as it was recently put to the test when after a hard night&#x27;s worth of merriment I woke up with some serious eye baggage that required quick remedy. Am pleased to report that OZ Naturals&#x27; eye gel went to work and reduced the unsightly puffiness quickly and effectively. All it takes is a little dab around the eyes first thing in the morning and maybe a quick afternoon touch up if necessary to get you looking nice and healthy through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this product is composed of 100% natural ingredients and is non-comedogenic I really don&#x27;t hesitate in using this as a regular remedy for baggy and dark eye-circle type issues. The gel is on the viscous side (Aloe is the primary ingredient) and is mostly odorless. It comes in a very small pump dispenser (0.5 ounces of gel - but since a dab will do it seems like it will last awhile) which I prefer as it allows me to easily carry it around throughout the day should the need arise.</li>
            <li> This eye cream contains a mixture of some very potent stuff. You can look at some of the other reviews to read what each ingredient actually does, but this gel is effective at combating lines &amp; wrinkles around the eyes. I’m not so sure about the puffiness/black circles, but I assume it does well for that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s formulated for applying to the thin skin near your eyes, so it’s not irritable at all–which is a bonus for someone like me with sensitive eyes. Instead, there’s a very slight cooling sensation as the gel dries. You only need a thin layer every night, so despite the small size of the bottle, it’s been lasting me quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I’ve found it best to use it during the night, right before sleeping, as that gives the eye cream plenty of time to work its magic. I’ve been using it for two weeks, and I’ll keep this review updated as I use it longer. Overall though, this eye cream contains some powerful ingredients, but this does NOT mean that it would work for everyone, since everyone’s skins are different. Feel free to give this a try if you’ve used other products with those ingredients and have found them to be effective.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is not only soothing to the eyes it also combats puffiness which i suffer from, as a new user to this product I would highly recommend it.....</li>
            <li> Does only a fair job at moisturizing the skin around the eye.  I believe OZ is coming out with a better eye gel soon.  Do not recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Helped with brightening and puffiness.</li>
            <li> I would love to try your super youth eye fel. Irs always about the nautral product! ! TIA</li>
            <li> The eye gel did absolutely nothing for me.  I read the reviews here and thought it made be good.  In fact, it made the area under my eyes look worse.  Hated it!!!</li>
            <li> So far so good. It seems to be working</li>
            <li> Just gone through the whole bottle.... it goes on smooth and light, like it said, it is a gel.  However, not sure if its really doing anything to my eyes.  I ended up using it on my whole face since it suggests the it is very gentle that  it can even be used all over your face.... just not sure the effect??!!!</li>
            <li> I am prone to dark circles and puffiness under my eyes and this product is really effective. I love the cool gel feel and that it does not take very much to cover the eye area. I also dab some on my forehead and around my mouth. A great draw for me: it&#x27;s cruelty free and has a vegan formula and doesn&#x27;t contain parabens, sulfates or drying alcohol. My skin is very sensitive and this works well for me. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and feels good on your skin but it does not do what it states.</li>
            <li> Saw results the third day.....won&#x27;t leave home without it</li>
            <li> Best eye product ever.  Not giving 5 starts because the amount  in the container is smaller than the container.</li>
            <li> Nothing great to write about it.</li>
            <li> did not help me---65 yrs old</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the eye gel for about 2 weeks now and I love the creamy smooth texture of the gel.  I&#x27;ve started using it as a makeup base for my whole face instead of just the eye area.  I mix a little with my foundation and it really makes it go on much smoother and leaves my face very well moisturized.  It&#x27;s a very good product!</li>
            <li> This has taken the puffiness from under my eyes.  It is a great value!</li>
            <li> This is a really wonderful eye gel and it really works fast I love it because I have a few lines under my eyes that look deeper with makeup I am 54 . I put this gel on before applying the makeup and it makes the wrinkles not do that so I get a really really smooth look and finish to my makeup . its very cooling and easy to use. its not harsh but works well you only need to use a little bit to see the lines flatten out so makeup or no makeup my face looks better and smoother. I love it and use it all the time.&lt;br /&gt; I received a free sample in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own thanks for looking</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference!!</li>
            <li> The first time I put this on I knew I would be coming back for more.  I have been looking for ingredients like this for years!!!  It is one of the only products I thought I really saw a difference the first time using it.  I have put it around my eyes, mouth and between my eyebrows.  Thank you to those at OZ naturals...Angela Irish!</li>
            <li> Helps with dark circles  Mine were horrible.  It is not greasy. As a licensed EstheticIan this us my first choice for my skin care</li>
            <li> Great product , very moisturizing but i got this tingling feeling after application</li>
            <li> Not for serious eye-area help by itself (unless your under 40 years of age). If you use it with another product it will give aging eyes the ingredients it needs-- but alone, it lacks moisturizing quality.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of this line!!! Can&#x27;t wait to try new products for my aging acne skin.</li>
            <li> I used the product as recommended but  did not see any improvements.  I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> DID NOT DO AS WELL AS  ANTICIPATED. STILL HAD PUFFY EYELIDS WHEN I WAKE UP.</li>
            <li> It really works like advertised. Like it.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I used to buy expensive products and I found this amazing products in Facebook, now my skin is and looks healthy and young!&lt;br /&gt;You have to try them!!</li>
            <li> Great product, will order again.</li>
            <li> I made sure I researched it before I bought it, I seen how it helped others, but didn&#x27;t do anything for me, sorry to give a rate like this but I used it as directed, and nope no changes...</li>
            <li> So farm I&#x27;m not sure..it hasn&#x27;t done anything for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I&#x27;m satisfy.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s I&#x27;m trying to start taking better care of my skin, specifically preventative care.  I&#x27;m hoping that I can prevent some of the signs of aging as I get older.  I like OZ Naturals products because they are mostly organic, and they don&#x27;t have harsh chemicals, or strong fragrances that irritate my allergies.&lt;br /&gt;I notice when I use this eye gel that the skin around my eyes gets a little firmer.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a short time but I&#x27;m hoping that with continued use it will help prevent some fine lines from coming out as I age.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for review purposes.  I have been pleased with every product I have tried from OZ Naturals and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful eye gel.  It takes care of all eye problems.  I have tried many products.  This is the best I have tried.  I saw results the first day.  Remember, this is a treatment, and must be used regularly, morning and night, if you want good results.  It is economical and a product that really works.  It makes my wrinkles disappear and gets rid of puffiness and black lines.  Try it, you will love it.  I do.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product as it did very little for my eye bags. I am surprised so many people rated it so high. Only good things are it is not expensive and it does not irritate skin.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get the eye gel as I have a lot of puffiness and dark circles under my eyes.  This gel really tightens the skin around my eyes, and I notice a decrease in puffiness and dark circles.  The directions say you can use it throughout the day, so I keep an extra bottle in my purse for those days when I am extra puffy, and apply it right over my makeup.  I am very pleased with this product.  It also moisturizes the skin, leaving it soft.  Two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I know that beauty magazines often tout products that don&#x27;t do a fraction of what they claim. I&#x27;m a big fan of Allure, and in my opinion, they&#x27;re pretty honest with their claims. They gave OZ Natural&#x27;s eye gel a top grade, and as I said, they weren&#x27;t kidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works fine with reducing morning puffiness, and best of all, the price is reasonable. My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive, and I&#x27;ve been able to use their skin care line with zero negative effects, and lots of positive ones. Definitely makes a difference in the appearance of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am asked to review a lot of skin care products. There are few lines I can endorse as wholeheartedly as I can with OZ Naturals. Really good stuff, and works as well as the expensive stuff at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I have absolutely no complaints! I&#x27;ll update in a couple weeks how it had helped. Its only been 3 days, but so far I am impressed!</li>
            <li> Good product.. love that it is natural!!</li>
            <li> I am going to update this review as I use this product. So, I&#x27;ll give my initial impression now, come back in 2 weeks, then do a 30 day review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little about myself and my skin: I am 25, I work at a law firm and I&#x27;m attending law school at night, and I&#x27;ve got a killer commute (100+ miles in a car 4 days a week). I imbibe a fair amount of caffeine, have a lot of stress and don&#x27;t get nearly enough sleep, so I have some pretty defined dark circles. I have sensitive, acne-prone and very combination skin-- think oil slick forehead and nose, barren desert lowest third of my cheeks/jawline. I came across this product looking for some help with the dark circles and to get started on a good, anti-aging/wrinkle preventing regime that would not cause more acne or aggravate my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial impression: I like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the product is definitely gel like, so don&#x27;t let the &amp;#34;eye cream&amp;#34; in the product name confuse you. It&#x27;s a cloudy clear, well, hair-gel like substance. A little goes a long way! I pumped out a small pea-like amount and it was too much. I dabbed the product on my under eyes, my browbones, the outer corners (where the &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; start forming) and then dabbed the remaining product in a second layer over the same areas. It stung a teensy bit where I have some weird dry patches near my eyebrows, but it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin anywhere else.. so I will chalk that up to the dry patches. I&#x27;m not sure I would use this during the day (unless I was going to be home or go without makeup) as it does leave a sort of film like another reviewer mentioned.</li>
            <li> sticky, tried for 3 weeks. all a joke , seller rude,  crap</li>
            <li> I like this product.  The gel is very refreshing and goes a long way.  I have noticed a difference in the fine lines and crows feet but nothing for my dark circles- which is why I am only giving it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I feel the product was more hype than help. It went on creamy, but absorbed well. It didn&#x27;t seem to help my dark circles or tone the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see that it is doing anything.</li>
            <li> This product helped to lighten my dark circles a little nothing to fantastic. It did not help with puffiness for me in fact it tends to make my eyes look more puffy</li>
            <li> I received a free sample for review from BuView but I had already been using this product - I requested to review because I LOVE this eye cream. Minor gripe - the initial bottle design was translucent therefore I could see how much of the product was in there. The new bottle is white and opaque. I liked seeing the amount so I knew when to reorder. I now run out and then have to wait for a new delivery. The bottle aside, the product itself really works. This feels and smells like a cucumber eye spa treatment. You can feel your skin tightening and it helps reduce my puffy eyes and crows feet. You really don&#x27;t need to use that much, a tiny pearl size amount is enough. I give it about 15 minutes to completely dry. I&#x27;m using this product with the OZ hyaluronic serum and the retinal moisturizer. I used to buy Roc retinal but I gave their retinal a try and it seems to work just as well and you get much more.</li>
            <li> I received this from a promtion website Snagshout.  I did not expect such a nice quality eye gel.  It makes my skin smooth.  It left no sticky residue either like a lot of other gels.  The smell was very light and pleasant.  I would be careful with the pump because a little of this eye gel goes a long way. I have no complaint about this product. Was very glad to be able to try it before I buy it.</li>
            <li> I did have to get used to the egg gel at first.  Really love these products!</li>
            <li> i bought this product after I read the reviews. I have used many products costing hundreds of dollars that never worked. I honestly want to say this product is the best eye gel. I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and I can see much improvements.  My dark circles are disappearing, the puffiness is less and my wrinkles are less visible. i would definately buy it again.</li>
            <li> This eye gel has a rich, creamy texture and a very faint scent of fresh cucumber. I love the precision of the pump! It releases exactly the amount I want, no more and no less. A very small amount of gel covers my entire eye area, which means the product will last. After drying, the gel feels like a protective, moisture shield around my eyes. I actually look forward to using it because I know that the most delicate area of my face is being properly moisturized and protected by pure and effective ingredients. The area around my eyes appears brighter and more open. Yay! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> So far so good- really like the product and I could feel it working instantly - also love the emails the company is sending with beauty tips.  Product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin/eyes and I can feel it moisturizing and tightening the skin!</li>
            <li> Having just used this for a short time, I don&#x27;t know if it will improve my eye area. I do know that I like the consistency, which is a light gel. It is easy to apply above and below the eye. It feels good, is easily absorbed and is cooling.</li>
            <li> Is a good. Cream, when combined. With oz vitamin. C sirum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it has such good reviews.  It was a marginal product at best.  There are much better eye creams/gels on the market.  Check out Obagi instead.</li>
            <li> (I purchased with my own money) I really love this eye gel! It goes on so smooth and feels super moisturizing. I personally like to use it at night only as it&#x27;s a little too heavy for me in the day. But keeps me looking awake and refreshed the next day! Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I just started using the Super Youth Eye Gel and LOVE it! Not only has it removed the puffiness underneath my eyes, it&#x27;s soothing and tightens the skin around my eyes. Honestly, I can already see a difference. A lot of eye gels stay on top of the skin making eye makeup messy throughout the day. This gel soaks into the skin which I love too because I live in very dry climate and need all the moisture I can get!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I have been using this every day and night for the past three weeks, have see some improvement under my eyes, it does not remove the wrinkles entirely but it does reduce it appearance, it also does not reduce the bags, but it has cleared the skin, no more dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Does nothing. Don&#x27;t waster your money.</li>
            <li> I arranged for this product to be tried by a professional model, who is very well-acquainated with these types of products. Her appearance as a professional is of paramount importance; thus, she has an incentive to accurately review this product. Here is her summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Love it. Amazing ingredients which, after only a couple days, seem to make my skin under my eyes look better. Most eye products charge a fortune and really don&#x27;t do much, but I look forward to seeing the results after more usage! I really like the dispenser bottle. It&#x27;s lightweight and cute, and comes out great. You can regulate quite well how much you want. I think it&#x27;s an excellent product.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;√ Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> This gel works well to decrease puffiness, but after almost 30 days of use, there has been no change in the dark circles. The dark circles are the reason I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> Of any of the OZ Naturals treatments I&#x27;ve tried, the Eye Gel has been the most useful to me. My sleep patterns are... not good, and my eyes (specifically, the bags under my eyes) prove it. Rather than let it get any worse, I tried this to see if it would decrease both the puffiness and darkness, and it does both. I&#x27;m really impressed... I can look at my face and I don&#x27;t see nearly the circles that I used to see. It only takes a small amount applied under each eye one or two times a day, and it really does make things look a whole lot better. I&#x27;ll continue to use this in hopes of at least looking like I sleep well... :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:&lt;br /&gt;Obtained From: Manufacturer&lt;br /&gt;Payment: Free</li>
            <li> This eye gel does work. I love it. My under eyes don&#x27;t have as many wrinkles as they used to. i will be buying this again when i get close to running out. What i love about this is that a little tiny dab is all you need. it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been someone who has been wowed by an eye cream. For years I&#x27;ve continuously changed creams- hoping to find one that made any difference at all. I never have until now. This is seriously the most amazing eye cream I have ever used, It makes a visible difference both when I use it and even when I don&#x27;t. You will notice that this is a very light textured gel. It has a pleasant scent and feels nice going on. It hasn&#x27;t irritated my eyes at all like so many other eye treatments. I apply it after using my serums and it immediately tightens and lifts around the eye area. My skin feels moisturized and I look like I had a great nights sleep. I even reapply it during the day if I want to look instantly fresher. My eye area looks lighter and brighter and I&#x27;ve noticed a lifting and tightening even on days when I don&#x27;t use it. The icing on the cake is the great price and how long it lasts. Do not wait to try this product. It is the best I have ever found!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for awhile now and I really do like it.  It just takes a small amount and last me quite awhile. I always take any extra I have left on my finger and put around lines in corners of mouth</li>
            <li> This was ok, but there&#x27;s not a lot in the container so I was very disapointed with that. So for that reason I&#x27;m giving it a 3 star.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help me at all. This product would sting me occasionally as well. Puffiness stayed the same!</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve tried that works. I&#x27;m 32, so wrinkles aren&#x27;t as much of a concern. However, it does reduce puffiness and help with tiredness.</li>
            <li> It remains tacky on the skin and causes the delicate under eye area skin to bunch up an stick.  I like the delicate scent, but will not purchase this again.  Plus no notable change in the under eye area.</li>
            <li> Sadly I really didn&#x27;t notice anything after 3 weeks. But maybe it was just me.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT WORK AT ALL!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eye gel...I have the beginnings of fine lines around my eyes and this product really does the trick with helping to minimize them. The gel also feels like you&#x27;re getting an eye lift every time you use it- the area around the eye feels and looks tighter/firmer. A must have product for sure!!</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t made a bit of difference. It dried flaky under my eyes too so makeup didn&#x27;t stick and sans makeup, it looked a little like I was peeling from a concentrated sunburn. The dark circles are still as large and dark as always. I&#x27;ll be trying another product; trashed this one.</li>
            <li> This is the fastest working eye gel I&#x27;ve ever used. I put it on in the night after washing my face and when I wake up, my eye creases are almost pushed out. They make your eyelids a little puffy, but not ugly puffy. Like supple and refreshed. I&#x27;m definitely impressed.</li>
            <li> Reduces dark circles but felt it did not reduce the puffiness I sometimes get under my eyes. Bit heavier in substance than I thought it would be</li>
            <li> I used my Oz Natural products last night and they felt great. They don&#x27;t have any overpowering fragrance or any at all, and a little goes a long way. To my surprise, all of the &amp;#34;congestion&amp;#34; on my forehead was completely cleared by morning. My forehead is completely smooth! Great products! I love that they are basically unisex and are completely natural with dermatological-grade active ingredients. They now only need to make a face scrub and sunscreen and then I am set :) Purchased the Vitamin C facial cleanser, Vitamin C 20% serum, Facial Toner, Eye Gel, and Retinol Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Really hasn&#x27;t been long enough to see any lasting results; definitely feel a tightening effect and product absorbs quickly without feeling greasy......................</li>
            <li> Totally worthless waste of money. This product does zero of what it claims to do. I&#x27;ve tried it for months now and have seen zero difference. It feels nice and cooling going on, but then, so does pretty much any moisturizer. Save your money.</li>
            <li> This cream definitely tighten my skin.  It was a little to strong to use every day, I switched to every other day.  Because it made me peel a little.</li>
            <li> I think it is helping will continue to use</li>
            <li> This stuff was awesome I noticed a difference in like two days.</li>
            <li> The dermatologist recommended this. I love it!!  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for over a month, I noticed that my dark eyes started to brighten up, and it smells really good when I apply it under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;But as it went on its not improving.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t understand what the other reviewers are talking about..The product is not delivering what it is supposed to after 3 weeks of using it. I have dark circles and after reading all the glory reviews felt like I should try it. Now, I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel for several weeks now without any adverse reactions. I apply it under my eyes twice a day. After I apply it, I feel a slight cool feeling under my eyes but in my opinion it&#x27;s kind of a nice, relaxing, invigorating feeling. It&#x27;s not uncomfortable at all and it only lasts a minute or so. This eye gel is thicker in consistency but it goes on smoothly. After it has dried completely (which takes a few minutes), I don&#x27;t even notice that I have it on. I had to use the OZ Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel for a few weeks before I noticed any results. Since using, I have noticed subtle changes in the puffiness and appearance of dark circles underneath my eyes. Basically I look less tired and feel more confident about myself when going makeup free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclosure:  I was sent this OZ Naturals products for free in order to perform this review. However, no other compensation was received. All opinions expressed are my own.*</li>
            <li> Didnt love it. Not very hydrating like i had hoped.</li>
            <li> See my review from a few minutes ago......I forgot to include the &amp;#34;star&amp;#34; rating</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a product that works for my eyes.  I love this eye gel!  It works to soften the lines and get rid of the bags. I am really happy with it.</li>
            <li> Have just started using this gel. So far it feels very nice. I have no skin rashes which I usually get from most eye creams. It is light and glides on with ease and can be used under makeup. I like the fact that it is natural. Time will tell how I look in a month or so . I will write again! Here I am on my second bottle .  My eyes look healthy, less wrinkles under eyes and it glides on so nice that you use very little. I use it day and night. My friends have noticed I am nearly 65 and I think I look younger. The price is very good and being natural is truly what you should be using. You won&#x27;t be disappointed buy it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel. I have used so many over the years that don&#x27;t do what they claim, but this one does! My eyes are instantly less puffy and the fine lines around my eyes are visibly less noticeable. It absorbs almost immediately making make-up application easy.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! It helps with fine lines for sure, and lessens wrinkles as well! &amp; best of all, it is an all-natural product that is NOT tested on animals! This brand is both effective and cost-friendly when compared to other drug store brands.</li>
            <li> I have noticed an improvement in my tired eyes.  I am not a morning person and this product helps me to look refreshed and awake. I will look forward to seeing what the long term use will result in.</li>
            <li> Even though I love the soft feeling this gel leaves around my eye area, I won&#x27;t be able to keep using it.  I experienced a stinging feeling the first time I applied it, but I kept using it.  I wanted to give my skin time to get used to it. Unfortunately I woke up with swollen eyes after the third application. I think my eyes are allergic to an ingredient in this gel.&lt;br /&gt;The skin around my eyes is very sensitive and I can only use hypoallergenic eye liners, mascara and eye creams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked for good eye creams and never seemed to find one I like. This eye gel is amazing!!!! I&#x27;ve used it a few nights and already I can tell my bags are smaller. Love !!!!</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream!  I am 51 years old and have tried many different brands of eye cream.  This is by far the best I have used.  I love the consistency, and the way it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.  The lines around my eyes seem much less noticeable, and my upper eye area seems firmer and lifted.  I even use it around my lip area and have seen the fine lines there diminish as well.  I will definitely continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, after a week of use I saw incredible results, my eyes wrinkles disappeared! Also, it&#x27;s cost is very comprehensive...</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised with this Eye Gel.  My skin is extremely sensitive. With some other eye gels I have used there was burning or irritation. Not the case with OZ Naturals! Very nice to use and really hydrates the eye area without any oily residue.</li>
            <li> I think it works for my dark circles under eyes. It starting to have some effects. Hopefully all my eye puffiness and dark circles will be gone for good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 47 and so far I have loved all Oz products so I thought I would give this a try. This eye gel is very cool and soothing going on and works well under makeup. I do notice a difference in appearance since using it. I will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> After trying out several other upscale brands with no visible improvements in the darkness under my eyes, I am completely satisfied with this eye gel after using it for the past four weeks!  I totally recommend this to anyone searching for a complete eye gel, and this has inspired me to try the other Oz Naturals products.</li>
            <li> LOVE ITTTTTT!! Okay, first of all, someone did not pay me to post a 5 star comment. I really really really reallyyyyy LOVE this product. After like 3 days, my dark circles were reduced to 30 - 40 %!!!!! Definitely gonna buy it again. My friends in school are also noticing it YAYYYY :DDD</li>
            <li> I am hooked on Oz Naturals! I was skeptical about ordering skin care products online, but I thought with all the 5 star ratings, I should give it a go. I am SO glad I did! Literally within minutes of applying the eye serum, I felt my skin tightening, and within days, my fine lines and even my dark circles greatly diminished! I wouldn&#x27;t think twice to order any products from Oz Naturals!</li>
            <li> Love it. I use in morning and at night. It does take a few minutes to completely absorb, it has a heavy gel feel, but when it dries, I can honestly feel the skin tightening. I love it because I can actually feel the tightness around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been impressed with all of OZ Naturals Products, I have tried a lot of eye creams and nothing actually did what it claimed to do. I recently purchased eye gel...its easy to use, easy to apply and you can seriously see the results instantly! THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> Great skincare product. Very reasonable price. I use every evening after I apply Retin-A, then Garnier Sleeping Creme</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used for eyes. Can&#x27;t feel more fresh than this! :)&lt;br /&gt;Personal note*: I prefer to dilute the gel&#x27;s action by mildly wetting the skin area before applying the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I am a 39 year old male</li>
            <li> I keep buying this eye gel because it is the best ever.  It goes on smoothly and I love the the feeling of tightening of the skin around the eyes when I apply it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. Went through the entire bottle. No difference and peeled off with make up application.</li>
            <li> I realllly wanted to like it, because the Retniol Moisturizer is so fabulous, but other than it smelling real nice, I haven&#x27;t noticed a thing. I will start showing my befores and afters now. I didn&#x27;t think to do them because the first product I had, the Retniol Moisturizer was so fabulous I just posted my five star review right away. However, this one didn&#x27;t go as well. For my next product I receive I will post before and after shots. Their other stuff though is awesome.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much of a difference. I have been using it for over 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting to see what will happen after a month. No real change so far. Really hope it works soon !!!!</li>
            <li> instant mini eye lift!</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference using this--a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find this product that miraculous, but it&#x27;s fine.  I have learned to just pay the money for Obaji and Skinceuticals products.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product at an excellent price. It gets rid of the morning puffiness and even helps the dark circles.</li>
            <li> Does not sting..does nothing for puffiness..</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever put on my skin.  I use it on my whole face.  It is amazing.</li>
            <li> ok not really impressed I expected a instant change wont purchase again.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> I have had puffiness and dark circles for the past few years. I have tried many products that did not do what they claimed. However, Oz Natural is the best and the physical results are obvious. I can now go without makeup or concealer and feel good about the way my circles have literally disappeared. I have purchased this product several times because it works!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Love it.  It seems to have softened the wrinkles around my eyes after using it for over two weeks.  I also use it entire face.  I wish that they offer bigger size because I use it for my entire face.  I can&#x27;t hardly wait to see the crows feet between my two brows disappear.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Excellent service. Great product.</li>
            <li> I like it. Especially for the price which is much lower than the cosmetics you get from shop.</li>
            <li> This gel is good but it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;I have to buy this again!&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m using mine but I would probably try a different kind next time just to see if there&#x27;s something better.</li>
            <li> If results are what your looking for.  This is an amazing serum.  Not just for eyes, try using it in other trouble spots on your face.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin around my eyes, so I&#x27;m always picky about what products I will use for my under eye area. This eye cream is really great! I love it! It goes on smoothly and feels calming on my skin. I noticed that it  brightened the areas around my eyes &amp; very much reduces the puffiness. My skin looks great! I recommend it highly, a must have product.</li>
            <li> I gave it a go but no noticeable difference in under eye circles after about 2 months of use. Smells and feels good though</li>
            <li> Terrible lotion. It dries the eye area and makes me very uncomfortable to wear it. I won&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> I have been using Oz Naturals Eye Gel for about 2 weeks and I am very pleased with the results already.....The gel is a silky, non fragrant formula that glides on the skin and soaks in quickly... I have seen a slight reduction in my eye &amp;#34;crinkles&amp;#34; and know as time goes by they will continue to improve... Absolutely recommend this Eye Gel....</li>
            <li> it is not greasy so i love it. hopefully it will work my under eyes:)</li>
            <li> A really gentle serum that definitely helps with reducing puffiness and filling out fine lines.  My eyes are quite sensitive and this did not make them sting at all.  A very nice product :)</li>
            <li> My friend let me try this for a few days and loved the results! I saw a change in my eyes in just those few days. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get my own! I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift from family the December of last year and I have noticed great results ever since I have been using it.  It does a great job moisturizing my under eye area and preventing puffiness.  I will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> Over the years I have used expensive eye treatments and I have to say that OZ Naturals The BEST Eye Gel beats them all!!  My daughter even complimented me!  You can&#x27;t beat the price and the results are real!</li>
            <li> OZ Naturals products are the real thing. My skin looks so much smoother. They aren&#x27;t sticky, are easy to apply and priced really great! The eye gel is no exception. Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for natural antiaging products.  A friend recommended Oz Naturals.  Before I bought, she let me use this eye gel-loved it! Only used it for a week but it seemed to lessen the dark circles and puffiness under my eyes.  It convinced me to use Oz Naturals for all my anti-aging products and I have been impressed with all the products I&#x27;ve tried so far plus the price is reasonable enough to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Love Oz Naturals is amazing!  I love all of their products!  I recommend them to anyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55 years young and a skincare junkie....tried just about all of them in every price range.  I LOVE you Oz Naturals!  I&#x27;m amazed and a little shocked by how truly good they are!  Buy this eye gel...you will love it and please try the other products....you won&#x27;t be disappointed and what value too!</li>
            <li> I just started using the eye gel.  It seems like a wonderful product.  It goes on so smoothly and it feels so light and delicate.  It makes the skin so soft.  I am hoping that it will reduce some of the wrinkles too.</li>
            <li> As with any Oz Natural product, you will begin seeing results within the first week with consistent use. I suggest using this product at night as the gel is a rich and thick consistency. This is super concentrated and one and half pump provides enough product for both eyelids and underneath the eye. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few eye creams, and this is the best I have used. After the first of the year, I started noticing that my eyes were puffy when I got up in the morning. I started using the tea bags, cucumbers and cold gel masks and they worked but they take time to work, and I personally don&#x27;t have an extra 15 minutes in the morning. I use this morning and night and I don&#x27;t wake up with puffy eyes, and the skin around my eyes has smooth out considerably and I have only been using this product for two weeks. It&#x27;s on my &amp;#34;Hit List&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The product might work great on puffy eyes, but that is not my concern. I hope it will reduce the lines beneath the eyes but it has not been very effictive after almost 3 weeks. The gel left the area very dry so need to be careful to apply moisture afterwards.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this product. I haven&#x27;t been using it for long but when I do I can literally feel my skin tightening up in a good way. My dark circles appear to be less and my eyes just look more refreshed. It also says in the bottle that you can use it on your whole face and I must admit that I have tried this with happy results. When I&#x27;ve tried this I felt that the overall appearance of my skin just seemed healthier and more dewy. Also, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should try this under my makeup but for me it almost acted like a very nice primer and I actually felt like my makeup stayed on better all day. I will definitely continue using this product :-)</li>
            <li> First time use but I really like it.  I am on the second bottle of the oz naturals and I love that also.  All these products are really good.</li>
            <li> Great eye cream, doesn&#x27;t seen to do anything but moisture the skin and is great for sensitive skin. Does not improve dark circle or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I am using this to delay surgery. I also use Tua Viso which is a device that stimulates collagen and exercises the facial muscles. People don&#x27;t realize I am over 55 years old.</li>
            <li> Finished the whole bottle but see no difference at all!</li>
            <li> This item was pretty good.  I only wish there were more in the bottle.</li>
            <li> First eye serum that has really worked on undereye bags &amp; dark circles for me. It started showing results with the first use, not like some other brands where they tell you it takes a couple of months or more before you see any real change.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I really had the puffiness and dark circles this was meant fo as I don&#x27;t feele there is a real difference on me.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works, yet I&#x27;m still trying it</li>
            <li> Just haven&#x27;t seen a lot of results, eyes circles still very dark. Have used it every day for a good month. I mix it with my moisturizer. I&#x27;ll keep you posted.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see or feel any difference</li>
            <li> OMG I Love this product.I am 46 years old and this is a miracle in a bottle.It really helped all my areas.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be working well with me but not sure how long it takes before seeing results.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a major difference.  The product leaves my skin soft and I will continue to use it but cannot see any changes to my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few days now and have noticed a difference in the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes.  No other eye cream has done this before.  The gel goes on very smoothly and absorbs beautifully into the skin.  Hopefully within a few weeks, I will see even more progress.</li>
            <li> Tried this for a month.  No noticeable difference.  Did have a nice refreshing scent, though.</li>
            <li> This helps with smooth fine lines and has a cool refreshing feeling on the eye area when applied.</li>
            <li> I would have put zero stars if I could.  I don&#x27;t know how some of these products get so many good reviews, this is not the first time a highly rated item was all BS.  The number 1 ingred. in this gel is aloe!  I have a big aloe plant in my dining room and could have just used that.  Almost $20 for a half oz of product that is mostly aloe!.. Save your money and just buy an aloe plant.  also, IT SAYS IN THE WRITE UP IT IS 100% NATURAL, BUT LABEL ON PRODUCT SAYS 75% ORGANIC.</li>
            <li> This eye gel has met all my expectations. It is not going to make my &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; eyes look like they did years ago: but, it has definitely helped my eyes. I do not look as tired since I started using it. My eyes appear to be less wrinkled (which is hard for me to believe that a gel can do that - but it did.) My makeup does not crease under my eyes now. That alone is worth using this eye gel.</li>
            <li> Very very pleased with this product.  I never write reviews on Amazon (although I get Amazon pkgs at least once a week!) but I wanted to show my support for this product.  It has a visible effect on the eye area within a few minutes of applying.  My eyes were blood shot, puffy and awful this morning after a night of drinking, heavy makeup and then so much makeup remover and elbow grease to get it off.  I also have had basically no sleep this week and a cold.  Put this stuff on and I all the redness, swelling, puffy, dryness was gone within 5-7 minutes.  Buy this!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Great item</li>
            <li> Great value and I think this does a good job and fighting the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Eyes are the most delicate part of your body, they need to be treated with care and only use gentle products around them. The OZ Naturals eye gel is exactly that, a wonderful, delicate product that works extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is light and absorbs nicely into skin. The pump bottle is elegant, simple and delivers a small spot of cream the right size for each eye. The cream is odor free. This eye cream absorbs into the skin quickly allowing makeup to be applied evenly and without streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream has good ingredients. There is science behind hyaluronic acid reducing wrinkles, and in fact it did help over a couple of weeks use. Plant stem cells sounds like something controversial in fact is simply an extract of plant stems and is not the other thing you might think. Vitamin E is always an excellent ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream just feels good. I love OZ Naturals packaging. I have three of their products and each is in a unique container with a different colored label. It makes it easy to choose the right product. Even though the product itself is the critical thing, I love the company logo with a beautiful tree - it is calming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important thing, this eye cream works as well as other much more expensive creams. It is gentle and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what this is supposed to be but it goes on sticky and stays sticky and does nothing to help with puffiness or moisturizing around your eyes.  I had to wash it off to get it off as soon as I put it on.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product (provided to me for review) for a couple of weeks. Do I see miraculous changes? No. Did I expect to see such from any beauty product? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My approach to skincare is rather scattershot, perhaps because there is no solid science here, only marketing claims; I&#x27;m not willing to spend hundreds of dollars on fanciful advertising, nor am I willing to experiment with potentially toxic chemicals. So, I aim for products that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Don&#x27;t contain chemicals considered hazardous or unhealthful on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep database (Yes, I know it&#x27;s not the last word on certain ingredients, but for now it&#x27;s the best I have)&lt;br /&gt;2. Do contain ingredients that make some bit of scientific sense (such as Vitamin C, Vitamin E, hyaluronic acid, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;3. Feel good on the skin&lt;br /&gt;4. Have no annoying odors&lt;br /&gt;5. Are easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;6. Are efficiently designed, so as not to take up inordinate space in my medicine chest&lt;br /&gt;7. At least fool me into seeing some benefit on my inevitably aging skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently received three OZ Naturals products for trial, and I&#x27;m pretty happy with all three, based on the criteria above: this Vitamin C serum, the Super Youth Eye Gel, and the Hyaluronic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the three, the eye gel might my least favorite, but only because I prefer a rich emollient eye cream; this gel dries quickly and feels dry. Maybe it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, but for those who are looking for more moisture, this might not fit the bill. To hedge my bets, I apply it, let it dry, and then apply a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> When I got this product I have never used it before. I do like this product because it made my eyes look better and feel better. I will be recommending this product to the people that are in my life.</li>
            <li> After use several days . My under eye area was lighter than before.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money on other products to reduce the sign of aging and had some success. I started using the OZ Naturals and wow...within a week my lines and the dark circles were fading. I have been using the products for about 3 weeks now and my eye lids are tighter. All of this improvement at a third of the cost.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a couple days, so I can not yet attest to long term results...but initially it performs well.  It goes on easy and smooth around the eyes. Provided instant cooling feeling and I love that is is all natural.</li>
            <li> Best eye gel I&#x27;ve ever used. Feels so soothing around the eyes.  Even tried it on forehead and slight cheek lines. Works well on all over face. Love It and have ordered it a second time.</li>
            <li> My wife had to switch eye cream since the one she was using gave her some issue (dry, itchy lid). She was looking for an option with better ingredients and found this eye gel: as she says, it&#x27;s very moisturizing, soothing and the gel formula dries quickly (works great under the make-up). Definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> I Love OZ Naturals.... I have been using the Trio of Vit C, HA and the Vit A Moisturizer for months.  I found OZ Naturals while doing research on all the different Natural Products available on the market. ( I found that though I was using expensive products I wasn&#x27;t seeing the results I expected and wondered if it was from the additional ingredients they put into these products.) My first purchase was the combo of Vit C and HA serums. After giving the serums a 2 month test it was obvious to me that these products WORK !!  I was perfectly content with my Trio and then received info about the Eye Gel product which the company was providing to us for a review (mind you I had my own brand of Eye Gel but decided to try this offer based on my Great experience with the Trio).  I was amazed at the quick results I received.  Yes, the bags under the eyes diminished considerably and at this writing they are gone.  The Eye Gel helped a lot with the medium shade of dark circles under my eyes.  I still have a light presence under the eye but if I wanted to go without concealer I could do that without a problem. Secondly, I am using the Eye Gel as an &amp;#34;all over the face&amp;#34; Peptide gel... especially using this Peptide on the hollows of my cheeks where light expression lines are appearing and around my mouth.  I am not putting a lot of the gel on my entire face and around the eyes, a little goes along way and I tap and lightly massage the product into my face until the tackiness disappears and I know its been absorbed.    Here&#x27;s my results -  I am flabbergasted with the results I am seeing in such a short period of time... or rather I am astonished with the results I am seeing period.  The dark circles have diminished considerably.  For me they are still there but ever so lightly.  The puffiness goes away completely.  Because of the peptides I am experimenting with putting this product on the hollow areas of the cheek to address the fine lines.  Note:  I  have been using another Peptide Product in this area and will be interested in seeing if I get the same results.  If so, then this product goes beyond using it for the eye area.  In which case, I hope they offer it in a larger dispenser. If the peptide in the Eye Gel does the job for my cheek area then it looks like I will be using Oz Naturals exclusively.  I am 59 and have been using serums and creams since my mid 30s when Vit A and Vit C became available in the market. So, when I say that a product works I am not kidding.  I have too much experience with all sorts of expensive anti aging products.  I truly like the Oz Naturals I am using and I just bought the Vit A Serum so my Oz Naturals have expanded to 5 products.  I am looking forward to seeing how the Vit A serum works for one specific brown spot that I have on my face. Hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> Seems to improve lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> This eye gel works very well, I have dark circles around my eye, I get it from my mom, I&#x27;m 29 years old.  It has helped reduce the appearance of them and trust me nothing else has, I mean they are still there but I have only been using it for about a month.  The gel does sting a little when I put it on for about 10 seconds but I don&#x27;t mind it just makes me feel like its working.  I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working as advertised</li>
            <li> Very effective in reducing puffiness and lighten dark circles.</li>
            <li> we shall see how well this works.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference. Will not order this product again.</li>
            <li> Love it.  First product I have found that really does get rid of dark circles.  The puffiness somewhat but that may be not getting enough sleep. Update - just received and started to use 2nd bottle of this.  My black circles are gone! Completely gone! I had black circles under my eyes since I was in my 20 and I am now in my 50s.  People tell me I look younger and starting kidding with me about being &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; and I must be going to bed at 8:00.  Still go to bed later than I should but you would never know it. I just ordered some for a friend for a Christmas present.s 1-6-15 Update:  I have been using this product for over 4 months now and the results are pronounced.  It goes on easy and I have no black circles under my eyes anymore.  I was not sure if I would see continued improvement as I used this but I have.  Heck, it worked so well my boyfriend ordered some for himself.  He has a high stress job and it tells.  This eye gel firms up the bags but still allows him to have a few distinguished laugh lines.  It is great stuff.  I have not tried anything else but don&#x27;t plan on it.  This works so I am sticking to it!</li>
            <li> Bought 5 products from OZ Naturals and just starting using them (this eye gel, vit. c cleanser, ocean mineral tonic, vit. c serum, sea infused herbal moisturizer). The odd thing is, my skin feels protected yet it&#x27;s breathing. So far very good. (Btw, I also got a Sisley Gentle Face and Neck Exfoliating brush to use with the cleanser and it&#x27;s a very nice effect.)</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite eye cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously I was using Clinique and before that Neutrogena. Both brands worked well but they didn&#x27;t have any anti-aging elements. I am in my 20&#x27;s so I use this more as a preventative measure. I wear contacts and glasses so my eyes are always squinting and being pulled on. I already have a few wrinkles around my eyes so I wanted something that would help me now and going forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff. It has completely cleared up the wrinkles I had around my eyes. I also use it on my eyelids to tighten that area as well as around my nose where I have very deep wrinkles. Since using this I have honestly never been happier with my face. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a bit drying. I think using this every night with a deep moisturizing eye cream a few times a week would work extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is by far the best eye cream I have ever used. It&#x27;s a bit pricey but I&#x27;ve used this bottle every night for 3 months and it&#x27;s still going strong! Well worth the money to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Erases wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;-Can be used all over your face. I use under eye, eyelid, foreheard, next to nose, and on my neck to prevent wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;-Pretty much as natural as you can get with anti-aging products&lt;br /&gt;-The bottle is extremely easy to use with a pump that dispenses the perfect amount. This leads to a lot less waste.&lt;br /&gt;-Small and compact. I can easily travel with this.&lt;br /&gt;-Small bottle lasts a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Does sting if it gets in your eyes but I&#x27;ve never found an eye cream that doesn&#x27;t do this. I do find that this eye cream tends to stay in place on my skin and doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes during the night.&lt;br /&gt;-A bit drying but not terribly so.</li>
            <li> This eye gel smells of cucumber. Not an heavy smell but a hint. I&#x27;m using on my dark and puffy eyes. It&#x27;s good for all over the face as well. A little bit goes a long way. Just a dab on finger tip and use around eyes and face area. Use alone or under make up as well. I received a promo discount for my unbiased opinion. Time will soon tell how good it will continue to work.</li>
            <li> This actually works over several days, don&#x27;t expect immediate results.</li>
            <li> This does nothing as implied, very disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;Feels good when you first put it on but after a few minutes you feel nothing and feels dry!&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your time and money!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and have not seen my puffiness or dark circle improve.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love this product!  Works better than any I have tried in 20 years!  And I have tried everything!</li>
            <li> Nothing special about the gel. It is hydrating but it has not made any difference to under eye circles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure if it working...... when I use it, it feel like its only temporary for everyday use ......we&#x27;re at the end of the day my eyes are back poofy,.....and my eyes are still dark  .......I don&#x27;t see a change</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. One night I had only a few hours of sleep, and used this under my eyes on my bags. Within 30 minutes, the area had lightened up and looked brighter. I was so amazed, I couldn&#x27;t believe it worked that fast. You really gotta try to believe it. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is working!  I was truly a skeptic after trying many different eye and face creams, even concealers.  Nothing seemed to work to reduce the puffy bags and dark circles under my eyes, that despite enough sleep just wouldn&#x27;t go away.  I&#x27;m only 50, but was just about resigned to looking tired all of the time.  After less than a week, the difference is noticeable -- and not just to me.  When a complete stranger gave me a complement yesterday, I knew I&#x27;d found the right product!  I have very sensitive skin and eyes, but this is soothing, non-irritating, and absorbs quickly.  I&#x27;m now a believer.</li>
            <li> I applied this eye gel before bedtime, woke up the next morning with redness around my eyes, my eyelids were drooping terribly where before I had no drooping.  I also had new wrinkles around my eyes due to the irritation of my skin from this gel.  I am obviously allergic to one or more of the &#x27;natural&#x27; ingredients in this product; I can&#x27;t figure out any other reason for  the mess it made of my skin around my eyes.  I have never had a problem with any other eye creams, skin creams, retinols, etc.  Thankfully my skin around my eyes is back to normal after three full days.  Beware of allergic reactions, it&#x27;s not a pretty sight!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye gel now for 5 days and so far its a good product. It goes on really smooth, feels refreshing to the eye once applied. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it messing up my makeup once it&#x27;s applied. So far I feel like the darkness under my eyes has lightened a bit, but the bags are still there. I do believe I need to give it another 5 days or so and then I&#x27;ll come back with a second review. I do recommend the product for undereye darkness!</li>
            <li> This may be the only time I review a beauty product which my wife (31 yrs old) orders for herself, but there&#x27;s a good reason for my review - because I actually noticed a real difference from a beauty product she had bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Twas the day after she received the eye gel and we were chit-chatting in bed before we turned off the lights and went to sleep. Whenever I notice that my wife looks extra-pretty I make a point to tell her. It went something like this:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Babe, your eyes look so good. Like...you seriously look younger. Did you put on makeup before bed or something?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;She told me that all she had on was the eye gel, and I was like &amp;#34;Well this would make a great customer testimonial from the husband&#x27;s perspective!&amp;#34; and she was all &amp;#34;Yeah!&amp;#34; and then I wrote this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps. I&#x27;ve started using it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6 stars out of a possible 5.</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff. Have used it for a few weeks and re-ordered already. It is easy to use and seems reasonably priced. Thanks.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS OZ NATURALS FOR MY DAY EYE GEL  IT FEEL GOOD AND MOISTURE AND MY EYE WRINKLE.  WORKING SO GOOD.  THANKS I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
            <li> leaves my eye area feeling refreshed</li>
            <li> This gel is easily absorbed. Unlike some eye creams, you can use this gel all over your eye area.</li>
            <li> So, far the best eye cream I have found.  It goes on like a smooth gel, and immediately removes wrinkles under eyes.  Don&#x27;t let the small size scare you, this small container lasts for months.  Only a small drop is needed per eye.</li>
            <li> Not only did it not help lighten the dark circles, it seemed to make them puffy. I stopped using it. I don&#x27;t understand all the good reviews. I used it twice a day for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Did not help my eyes at all!!!</li>
            <li> Love the eye cream, been using it for awhile now. Love its vegan formula, 100% natural &amp; 75% organic. I have sensitive skin type, and this eye gel really works and not giving me rash or itch feeling. Even I don&#x27;t have dark circles, but it helps with my wrinkles around the eyes. Half bottle gone now, great value!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it now for three weeks. It doesn&#x27;t work.. My eyes are still puffy morning and night.. I was disappointed.  I was actually really excited about trying something that would help and I noticed such great reviews I went for it.. But am left with no results....</li>
            <li> I thought this product was working, since it seemed as though my fine lines have reduced a little. It did not do anything for dark circle. After about two months of using this, I suddenly got a terrible reaction. I woke up one morning with redness and dry skin under my eyes from applying the gel the night before. The directions say you can use it day and night (which I do) but this reaction has caused pain under my eyes, weird wrinkly lines and dryness. Use with caution! (I am also usually not super sensitive to skin care items.)</li>
            <li> Product dried somewhat flaky and tacky.</li>
            <li> I like this product but cannot be completely certain of any benefits that it&#x27;s doing apart from other products that I&#x27;m using. It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes. It dries quickly and concealer holds to it very well.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing it said it would do, after using it religiously for three weeks.</li>
            <li> Used this cream every single night after washing my face for 3 weeks. I thought I might see some gradual changes but they weren&#x27;t the changes I would have hoped for... This SUCKS the MOISTURE RIGHT OUT OF YOUR SKIN and CAUSES wrinkles. I barely had noticeable crow lines and this was creating fine lines under my eyes I have never had before! I am throwing this out. Don&#x27;t bother with this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Showed noticeable decrease in under eye puffiness and dark circles after just one overnight use.  Dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky so you can apply makeup over it. Highly recommend and will continue to use this product!  UPDATE: Now that I have had this product for a while, I would change my review.  The product only works if you faithfully apply and never skip a day.  It is not a product that will help in the long run, you have to constantly use it to get results.  Even miss one day, you are back to square one!  Not t worth the expense!  Plus if you don&#x27;t use the product quickly, it gets &amp;#34;gummy&amp;#34; and unusable unless you keep pumping to find the gel.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel. It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quickly so it can be used under makeup. I haven&#x27;t noticed any real dramatic results but it&#x27;s nice to have the extra layer of moisture/protection around my delicate eye area. A recommendation is to keep it in the refrigerator and when applied it decreases puffiness.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for almost two weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is moist and much clearer and feels soft to the touch. It goes on smoothly, and it&#x27;s cooling and almost dries immediately.  It&#x27;s definitely not gooey like other creams.  I think I&#x27;ll be using more of this product in the future.  Also, there is no smell at all to the product and love the cooling effect to my skin.  I must say the puffiness I usually have in the morning has really diminished a lot and it doesn&#x27;t seem that the dark circles aren&#x27;t so dark anymore.  Think I&#x27;ll keep using it.Thumbs up on this one for sure.</li>
            <li> I was using the InstaNaturals Eye Gel, and I felt it was a bit too greasy on the skin. So I decided to try this instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Puffiness-reduction is hit or miss, I feels some days it looks good and others it does not.&lt;br /&gt;Dark circles seem to be more reduced, just a bit, but not significant.&lt;br /&gt;I seem to be noticing more lines underneath by eye with this product, which makes me wonder... HOW CAN IT CREATE LINES around my eyes?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had better results in all these areas with the InstaNaturals, to be honest. Returning and going back to it.</li>
            <li> I have only used this eye gel for 4 days but I can already see a difference. My dark circles are brighter and my skin feels smoother. Plus, it&#x27;s very gentle on my skin! Very happy with this product. I have tried several popular brands of eye gel and so far this is the best!</li>
            <li> After a few days I&#x27;ve seen a difference, already recommended it to friends</li>
            <li> Good product will buy again</li>
            <li> This is good but not as great as other OZ products. It does firm the eye area though so not all negative. The gel is light and adds moisture to the skin</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells! It&#x27;s so fresh on your face and is blended well. Love it so far. I will update this review within a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every mroning and evening and I don&#x27;t see any improvement after two weeks, as with the face serum, I wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tiny bottle, but since it only goes on my eyes it will last a long time.  It&#x27;s very cooling and soothing, and it smells amazing.  It&#x27;s very safe for my sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t burn my eyes at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this free in order to give my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> This Serum is wonderful i have a weak eye, it has done amazingly great for the overhang, just ordered for my mother Day before yesterday she is all ready using arrived this morning,  i am ordering my second time today. So so greatful i found this. Telling everyone i know.</li>
            <li> Beware of fake reviews. I used this product twice a day and it truly really didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced this does much for dark circles. It feels nice going on and moisturizes to some extent, though.</li>
            <li> so far so good. will have to see on the long run</li>
            <li> this product did not work on puffiness but did a little on dark circles waste of time and money</li>
            <li> Zero effect while trying to reduce bags.  A waste of money</li>
            <li> Not bad I saw a slight change</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really notice any reduction in puffiness</li>
            <li> This seemed to peel off.  I did not even finish the bottle, just tossed it.  Perhaps it works for many but not so for me.</li>
            <li> Not of much help in removing the bags under my eyes.  Nothing can defeat age!  I don&#x27;t have black circles, but I do have pronounced bags that make me feel very old when I look in the mirror.  I&#x27;ve tried every household tip there is and nothing improves them.  I have no intention of undergoing plastic surgery for this silly problem.  No one expects an old man to look good anyway :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was easy to put on, there was nothing unpleasant about it, and all in all, if it happens to work for you...it will be a great product.  Just no help in my case.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very impressive product</li>
            <li> Great product! I can already see the results in 3 days!</li>
            <li> It hydrates, cools and just feels great on your skin. I have used retinol-based products that tend to dry out the under-eye area, but this product does just the opposite. I can&#x27;t speak for wrinkle reduction (that would take a lab and clinical observations), but I can say that my skin looks and feels brighter after using this eye gel. I use it as part of my evening cleaning and moisturizing ritual: wash face with mild cleanser (or even just water), then apply the eye gel. My skin feels silky soft in the AM.</li>
            <li> After I put on this eye cream, my skin feel very soothed and cooling....I will tell if it makes a difference in 3 weeks...great product...</li>
            <li> I love this Eye Gel!  I have been using it now for about three weeks.  I have bags under my eyes and dark circles which are primarily hereditary.  The bags have lessened and are sometimes completely flat!  Also my dark circles seem a somewhat lighter.  One of my colleagues who had not seen me in awhile, came up to me at a recent event and asked if I had been on vacation because I looked so &amp;#34;rested&amp;#34;.  I will buy this again!!</li>
            <li> Great gel! NO ALERGY. it actually fights puffiness very nicly.  Thanks. Update after two weeks of using the gel. Unfortunately, after two weeks of using it my allergy did hit my eyes, so I can not use it anymore...</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a change</li>
            <li> This eye gel is very soothing when applied and does not irritate the sensitive skin around my eyes.  I keep it in the refrigerator for a cooling sensation after a warm shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a fresh vegetal smell dominated by cucumber and a translucent white color and only a slight viscosity.  It is almost instantly absorbed when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains mostly botanical and organic ingredients that moisturize, soften, and protect the outer layer of the skin, such as aloe, glycerin and jojoba oil, plus ingredients like hyaluronic acid and vitamin E that penetrate it to support skin health and structure on a cellular level.  Regular use will help improve the appearance of fine wrinkles caused by age and damage from sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 0.5 oz.

            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for me. It was a little sticky under my eyes too.</li>
            <li> I started using this product in May and after using everything else over the counter at I am really pleased with the results. No more baggy eyes or dark circles around my eyes. I have also noticed the fine lines are smother and I am so tempted to put this in my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;Happy customer. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream and recommend it to anyone needing hydration under your eyes. It lifts and moisturizes quickly and it works! The product is legit and it&#x27;s made from ingredients good for you. A friend turned me onto it and he looks great for his age. I even got my boyfriend and my mom to start using this as well!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week. I dont have dark circles but I do get morning puffiness. I apply a little after I wash my face. A little goes along way. It really brightens my eyes. It gets rid of that I just rolled out of bed look at 6 am.</li>
            <li> Great product, will buy again</li>
            <li> note no changes had high hopes</li>
            <li> This eye gel worked well for decreasing puffiness around eyes.  It didn&#x27;t cause any irritation and I am usually very sensitive to eye products.  I wish it had a bit more moisture for a mature aging eye.  I found that using this first and then a small amount of the OZ Ultra Ageless Eye Creme together are a perfect combination for more mature skin.  I have tried many OZ products and the eye gel is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I expected more.  It did not work any better than other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Showed no improvement</li>
            <li> I have used this several times and nothing has changed.  It flat out doesn&#x27;t do one thing.  Would not recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> So far so good! Will continue to use the product!</li>
            <li> took the recommendation of leaving this eye gel in the fridge, and holy goodness it kisses puffy eyes goodbye in the morning wonderfully! Tightens (without discomfort) fine lines around eyes amazingly well. Isn&#x27;t my favorite for forehead or other areas like it suggests on the label- I prefer OZ Naturals hyaluronic acid serum with vitamin C for all over face treatment. Haven&#x27;t seen improvement with dark circles yet, but I&#x27;ve only used it a few times. I&#x27;ll try to update once I finish the product to report back on dark circles, which is a problem area for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I like it! I use it under my Bobbie Brown Extra Eye Repair Cream- the eye repair cream sometimes causes milia for me (those pesky white bumps around eyes), but the OZ Naturals eye gel  along with eye repair cream has been working great together for me. Not convinced I&#x27;d use either alone, however. I&#x27;d recommend this OZ Naturals Eye gel! As I would with most OZ Naturals products. They are all wins for me thus far. :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would see any results - I&#x27;ve tried so many things for around my eyes.  I love this product and continue to use - big difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about a month haven&#x27;t really seen the results i expected with the dark circles. Perhaps I&#x27;m just expecting too much but I bought it based on the ratings and comments.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really change anything for me and sometimes it would get sticky and actually felt like it was making my wrinkled worse because it made my skin stick to itself under my eyes.</li>
            <li> The product really didnt help with puffiness or dark circles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried an eye gel until this one, previously I was used to using creams that took a bit of effort to blend completely into the skin. This gel is a lot easier to work with and spreads over the eye area really easily. I found that it works best when paired with one of the serums from OZ Naturals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had too much trouble with my eyes. Occasionally there was puffiness, or some dark circles. But since I started using this, I haven&#x27;t experienced any of them. The skin around my eyes looks really clear and even, which makes my eyes look brighter. Plus it lasted a really long time. I also liked the pump because I didn&#x27;t have to put my fingers in the product and get bacteria in it. A very cool, effective eye gel!</li>
            <li> Very light weight. I feel safe using it on my upper lids, but the puffiness is not gone from under my eyes yet after 4 weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 years old and thankfully have pretty good skin. There are no wrinkles and no puffy bags under my eyes. I wanted to find a product that would help me stay that way. I read all the reviews about OZ cream, and decided it was the product to try. SO far I have been more than satisfied. I use this product twice a day - once in the morning and again before bed. The one thing that has noticeably changed is the dark circles under my eyes. I have a crazy work schedule and I can not stop from getting them. OZ has put an end to the dark circles and makes me look awake at any time. Love the fact that this is a gel, it is easy to apply. I don&#x27;t wear any makeup, so I can&#x27;t say how the two interact with each other, and for me there was no noticeable smell - good or bad. A great product that I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  It did not work.  :o(</li>
            <li> Nice, I used it all over over my face and it felt great. My skin felt smoothe, and soft and clear.</li>
            <li> I have used for about a week and no improvement with the puffiness. Actually I think the eye puffiness is worse, so I have stopped using it around my eyes.  It is a nice lotion in a pump, which I am now using on the rest of my face.  It does feel refreshing, but had hoped to find something to help with the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the product, but I don&#x27;t see the result after a week. It is not a bad product though.</li>
            <li> Good product. Soothing and moisturizing. Not at all irritating to eyes.</li>
            <li> This is amazing and wonderful. It&#x27;s the same texture as those expensive capsules that cost a million dollars. It&#x27;s thick so it fills in the little crepey lines under my eyes, crow&#x27;s feet, and gives a nice, supple appearance to the eye area. It doesn&#x27;t soak in and fade away either. It&#x27;s thick enough that it stays put. It makes my makeup look better because it keeps it from getting into the grooves around the eye. Makes me look younger. It&#x27;s very dry here so I am all over anything that will keep my skin soft and supple for more than a few hours. I have high hopes for this product. I was a little disappointed by the small bottle size but it&#x27;s really like gold. I will definitely order this again. So far, it&#x27;s my favorite eye cream out of the 5 I have ordered already this year. Right now I am looking to see if they make a face cream. If you like a thick eye cream that fills in lines (like those expensive capsules) then this is a good fit for you.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many eye creams and this is by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd order of OZ Naturals Eye Gel, so that should tell you something. I started looking for made in america products that were clean. This is the first product I ordered from OZ Naturals (now am using quite a few). It&#x27;s a gel which I like because it doesn&#x27;t sit on top of the skin it actually soaks in. I feel like other eye creams just sit on top of the skin and don&#x27;t actually sink in. Before using this product I never used an eye gel before. It&#x27;s my opinion it does the job .....moisturizes and I have noticed it minimizes dark circles. I really like this product so if you are looking for an alternative to questionable store eye creams this would be a great option.</li>
            <li> I am a 31 year old woman with two kids, and one more on the way in a few months. While I have only been using the eye serum for a little less than two weeks, I have definitely noticed a change in my dark circles, they are much lighter and smoother! The serum adds a nice amount of moisture to my eyes and forehead ( I use it on my fine lines there too). I live in a dry climate and have appreciated the extra moisture. I use it morning and night and my makeup goes on smoothly over it. I cannot wait to see what the long term results show!&lt;br /&gt;Review by TallGirlJ a Frequent Contributor on PrairieWifeInHeels.com</li>
            <li> Delivered promplty. Item exactly as described. I am very happy with the quality. Easy transaction.</li>
            <li> This product feels nice going on. As I do not have much  puffiness in the eyes I cannot comment.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it.  As we age our skin sometimes needs a little help especially if we don&#x27;t get the proper nutrition all of the time.  My wife is always careful about using any product around her eyes.  This eye gel treatment is not to be underestimated as it&#x27;s highly effective at reducing dark circles, puffiness and wrinkles.  This is a great Natural Product !&lt;br /&gt;CJ</li>
            <li> helping with my dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> I was soooo hopeful to get this product especially after reading all the positive reviews!  I liked before I got this, that the seller emailed me how to use it so I was prepared in that way. However, been using it about 2-3 weeks and don&#x27;t really see all that change. My eyes may look slightly lighter, but unless I use it, the lightness doesn&#x27;t stick. And sometimes there is hardly a difference. Plus very disappointing was how tiny the bottle is for $20. I would have expected a bigger supply of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had bags under my eyes since birth. The only thing that really gets them lighter, ironically is when I don&#x27;t eat chocolate or caffeine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy this product again. I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> Just started using this and I am very picky but so far I really like it.  The gel consistency is just what I like.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this would turn out to be a gimmick product for ladies desperate to turn back the hands of time.  I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this.  This instantly reduces the appearance of wrinkles.  I thought this was only for around the eyes use, but I tried it on two wrinkles on my forehead and right after I was surprised that I couldn&#x27;t notice them anymore.  The disappearance of wrinkles only worked for me when I put the product on.  If I wash my face, the wrinkles are right back where they were.  I applied makeup over it and it didn&#x27;t make my skin break out.  I&#x27;m excited about this product.</li>
            <li> I plan on continuing to use this product, not sure if I am seeing the results I was hoping for. Not giving up!</li>
            <li> When reading face product reviews, I always like to know the age range of the reviewer. It helps me get a understanding if it pertains to me or not. So with that being said I am 55. I was so excited to try the product like mostly everyone else in my age group. Sorry to say ladies, no noticeable difference what so ever.</li>
            <li> Made no significant changes To my dark circles .</li>
            <li> no me gusto, no vi resultados</li>
            <li> I tried this because the reviews were good. Well ,maybe it works for some folks but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference. I plan on trying another higly rated product. If the next one doesn&#x27;t work, that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a three week trial by using it under just my left eye to see if there would be a difference from my right eye. I stopped the test after one week. There was already a perceptible positive difference. This product works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 and showing signs of premature aging and this stuff works fantastic in hydrating my eye area which is prone to dryness and fine lines.</li>
            <li> OZ Naturals Eye Gel-Eye cream was a great find! Yes, puffiness and lines disappears and wrinkles as well. I used it as face moisturizer and I can feel the difference in just one week of usage.  I strongly recommend this product to anyone. Just give it a try:)-- all that you have to do. It is surely 100% guaranteed as claimed by seller.  It works for me!!!</li>
            <li> I do not generally write reviews, but this eye serum is amazing! I had been looking for a long time and trying so many different products for the dark circles under my eyes, but found this stuff last spring/summer, and have been using it ever since!  My skin looks so much better and feels amazing!  I also use it on my neck with great results.  I will continue to use this. Only wish it came in larger size so I would not have to reorder as often!</li>
            <li> Seems to have an excellent moisturizing quality. That I appreciate!</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use. I have been using it for over a month and have noticed the dark circles and puffiness is gone. I look fresh. It did not clog my pores. It is cool and smooth. I have noticed the change and like it!</li>
            <li> Perhaps you have to use this a longer time!  I really didn&#x27;t see any dramatic changes and will probably go back to what I have been using.</li>
            <li> Being using this product in am and pm for over 2 weeks and have seen no improvement.  Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> This actually worked pretty well.  My eyes looked incredibly tired, puffy and had rings so dark a racoon would be envious.  I used it twice a day since I bought ti and it reduce the puffiness and faded the dark circles nicely.  My issue is there isn&#x27;t enough of it in the bottle to make the expense worth it.  The texture is similar to aloe vera and the smell is decidedly plant like, which is not a bad thing.  You have to hurry and smooth it on your eye area before it drys and becomes tacky.  I&#x27;m going to try the other best selling eye cream to how it works before coming back to this one.  It is definitely on my list to rebuy later on.</li>
            <li> I am 24 and have inherited bags under my eyes. I was hoping this product would make me look more &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34; but it didn&#x27;t help. It does tighten up your skin some. I found that out because I put the cream on and then proceeded to do my eye makeup. During that process, I must have moved my skin the wrong way because I left a crease in the skin where my finger was. So it does work, but not for someone that has young/tight skin already.</li>
            <li> This works instantly clear out the dark skin. However, the eyebag/fat undereye could only result if you have surgery to remove it...There&#x27;s zero product that will remove the eyebag(s). If you want to rejuvenate the dark skin around eye or on your face, this is it...Thanks\^^/</li>
            <li> Another miracle-product that does not work. I used it for two months without any results. Positive notes: Fast shipment. Nice bottle pump.</li>
            <li> I tried this first before the other products and it soothes my puffy eyes after I shower in the morning and when I&#x27;m putting on makeup the puffy eyes are so much better.</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about this eye gel. I have used it a few times but it irritated my eyes. I have stopped using it and have not had any problems with irritation.</li>
            <li> I have used this eye gel for 3 months, but I have not noticed any result. I did contact the seller for refund as they guarantee 100% satisfaction. However, they refuse refund for the reason that money back guarantee is for only 30 days, which does not post anywhere in the long product description. They could have added a few words in the &amp;#34;money guarantee back&amp;#34; line. 30 days is too short to see if the product actually works.  This one does not work for me. Disappointed!</li>
            <li> I found that using the Oz Naturals Super Youth Eye Gel my eyes felt good throughout the day. I haven&#x27;t seen any sign of measurable difference in the dark circles at this point, but they do look pretty decent after a tiring day at work. So the gel seems to be helping. I have not had any issues using the eye gel such as irritating the skin or burning. It works fine for me. My vote is still out as to whether I prefer a cream or a gel for an eye product. This Oz Naturals eye get works very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a complimentary product to facilitate this review. .are solely my own</li>
            <li> Purchased based on the reviews on Amazon but I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference since using it:(  But its a good price, fast shipping and exactly as described, so will buy from seller again!</li>
            <li> Not much different than any other eye gel.</li>
            <li> Sticky and doesn&#x27;t moisturize. I&#x27;ve been using it and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. It says you can use on your forehead and so I did. I broke out. Would not buy again. Disappointed</li>
            <li> I mainly bought this eye gel because I was looking for something to help reduce my under eye circles. I would say it helps immediately brighten the area, but I didn&#x27;t really notice any long term effects even after having finished the bottle.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the puffyness. But it did lighten my dark circles under my eyes I use it every night before bed</li>
            <li> This is a very good cream for your eyes and it is non irritating. Some what costly, but cheaper is not always better.</li>
            <li> Why is this the best eye gel cream for puffiness and dark circles? because it simply takes them all away JUST LIKE THAT! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of expensive eye creams that didn&#x27;t come close to what this eye cream does! Its absolutely amazing to me, my eyes are nice and smooth with no puffiness or dark circles. The bottle is small and a little bit goes a long way but I for one will be placing my order for more very soon. Thanks so much. I am soooooo very happy!</li>
            <li> As soon as I received this eye cream I put it on one eye only, to compare and I could see a difference within a few minutes ! Less wrinkles!! Its amazing! I have tried many expensive products. I am going to love this one!!</li>
            <li> I was convinced the very first time I tried this eye gel:  I get puffiness from my allergies and this certainly does eliminate that for me.  It&#x27;s a great item to have and I will continue to order. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I love this and it makes my skin so smooth and my pours are not so large anymore</li>
            <li> I loved this gel.  It made me feel and look better.  Would recommend buying it!</li>
            <li> Love all health and beauty from oz naturals</li>
            <li> This product took the darkness out of the circles under my eyes and I think has lessened the crow&#x27;s feet that I have as well. Smooth, only takes a little and no sting or irritation experienced. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for almost 3 weeks and still not see any improvement.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t change the appearance of my dark circles in any way.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  Did not work as expected.</li>
            <li> WooHoo! Finally found a natural remedy that actually had my face and skin looking and feeling better in less than a week. My blotchy skin has evened out, too.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff is definitely different for every user. I saw many folks say it works great and other say it does nothing. For me, I&#x27;m about mid to nothing on that scale. While the darkness of the puffy circles under my eyes is slightly alleviated, the puffiness hasn&#x27;t been budged at all. Partly, my puffy comes from allergies and the building I work in every day so it may be fighting an uphill battle but even so, it doesn&#x27;t live up to the miraculous claims that it solves everything. It does, though, seem to lighten the darkness somewhat. So it&#x27;s not terrible. It&#x27;s just not as spectacular as the advertising says.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice eye gel. A tiny bit goes a long way. I find it is very potent so do not use too much or your under eye area will become sensitive. I think it really helped calm my tired, puffy eyes. It also helps with those little fine lines. With continued use I am noticing that it is helping to calm my dark circles too. I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, and I feel that it is softening the lines&lt;br /&gt;around my eyes. I use it on the upper part of my eyelids and&lt;br /&gt;have noticed a big difference. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I heard this is the best!  Just ordered it! I&#x27;ll keep you posted</li>
            <li> also did not perform as advertised.</li>
            <li> This works great.  My eye lids don&#x27;t sag and it took care of the puffiness under my eyes.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Really can&#x27;t see the difference, sorry I spent the money! What a waste.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Noticed improvement after 3-4 days of use.  Will definitely buy and recommend.  Feels like complete regeneration of the under eye area!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed that much improvement.</li>
            <li> I started using the product a little over a week ago. it was suggested I take a before picture so I can see t the results as I used the product. I noticed I always looked tired but never really paid attention to my puffy eyes. Not until I compared my before and after pictures did I realize how well this product was working. I&#x27;ve been recommending the product like crazy. I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is good I can see the changes it has made</li>
            <li> U didnt give me time to use i</li>
            <li> This eye gel changed my life!! I&#x27;m a mommy to a crazy 2 year old so sleep is a foreign word to me. This eye gel has transformed my eyes from sleepy &amp; baggy looking, back to looking great! No more dark bags &amp; unwanted lines!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new eye cream. The one I was previously using is suddenly impossible to find. I was really skeptical since this product is so hyped up, and so many scam sites doing &#x27;reviews.&#x27; But there were so many good reviews here, I had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ever used natural products, a little bit goes a long way. The pump always dispenses too much. So I put the excess around my mouth area where I am getting a little jowly. The next morning I was like, holy s**t. My eyes didn&#x27;t look any better, but the skin around my mouth was noticeably improved. Now to be fair, I have hereditary bags that I don&#x27;t think anything on this earth can get rid of. I&#x27;ve had them for years, no matter how well I eat or how much I sleep. If this stuff gets rid of them, it will be a miracle. After a week, they are improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people found this greasy and said you could not wear it under makeup. I haven&#x27;t found that at all. Maybe they are using too much, or not waiting a few minutes before putting makeup on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is not soothing. I find myself putting another moisturizer on. But I can&#x27;t argue with the fact that I have seen improvement after only a week. Facelift in a bottle? Not quite. But its good.</li>
            <li> I have what is politely referred to as &amp;#34;mature skin&amp;#34; - I just call it &#x27;older!&#x27; This is soothing, non-irritating, and most important, reduces under-eye bagginess and the appearance of lines around the eye area. Definitely a new product in my beauty regimen!</li>
            <li> Natural yes, hydrating yes, but didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my dark circles. Back to the drawing board</li>
            <li> This dried out the skin under my eyes and it was 5 days past the return date by the time I really noticed it.  Just had to toss it in the garbage and eat the money I paid.  I personally wouldn&#x27;t recommend, but everyone is different, I guess.</li>
            <li> Pleasent Surprise!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for a month now and here&#x27;s what I noticed about my around eye area within that period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1: when you apply the product around your eyes, you notice the area extremely hydrated and puffed up in a good way instantly. You immediately see less wrinkle due to hydration which last about 2 hours or so. This product smells like cucumber to me and I love that smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2: within a weeks period , you will see the under eye is getting brighter and you will need less concealer to hide the dark circles. Also the brightness comes from the smoothness and elasticity the skin has got within this period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3: In a month, the under eye dark are drastically reduced, and I notice the wrinkle around eyes are shallower than when I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any problem with puffy eyes so I can&#x27;t comment anything about that but my all other concerns are taken care of by this product. Love it. I will be a staple in my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> This eye gel goes on velvety smooth and sinks right in without irritating my sensitive eyes.  I can definitely see a difference in my crows feet after only a few weeks of using this gel nightly &amp; my eyelids feel firmer in the morning when I apply eye shadow.. I will be recommending this product to all of my friends &amp; family who want an effective eye treatment that is cruelty-free!</li>
            <li> This small bottle will help you get rid of that stubborn raccoon eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this to my mother that is in her sixties, and asked her use this with her nightly regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first few nights she started to see some improvement on the fine line and puffiness. After one week, I was even able to see a change in here overall appearance. Her skin had an overall even complexion with a youthful radiance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now she swears by this eye gel. This is coming from a woman that has been using \\&quot;St. Ives\\&quot;, since I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.</li>
            <li> Wow! This worked great and really reduced the swelling and black circles under my eyes. Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I am so sad that this did nothing for me.  I used it for dark circles.  I used it morning and night and now that the bottle is empty, I can only conclude it did not work for me.  I wish I was as happy as the other reviewers I read.</li>
            <li> I love this under eye serum.  It gives just t he right amount of moisture and minimizes fine lines.  I don&#x27;t use it for dark circles and puffiness, but I can&#x27;t comment on that.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t buy a lot of products like this so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but after using for just a few days I noticed how much brighter my eyes looked! I&#x27;m a believer now, I can&#x27;t wait to see the difference after using it for weeks.</li>
            <li> This really works to reduce puffiness around your eyes.  It feels good on the skin. The results get better after prolonged use.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I&#x27;ve tried many....many....but none compares to this little guy!! LOVE it!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only eye gel I&#x27;ve bought more than once. I have tried many and often don&#x27;t finish them because I don&#x27;t get results. Well, this one delivers. It helps with my dark circles while smoothing and lifting. Love it!</li>
            <li> i had bought  this product.the.first time.it came.in a clear.botle.that one worked.very.good,the.second time.i.bought.it recently.it hasn&#x27;t.done.anything.  how do i.get my money.back or.the product i.purchased.before</li>
            <li> Formula: The gel is non-sticky, lightweight and absorbs rapidly. I love that it&#x27;s made to be used all over the eye area including the lids because I have sensitive eyes and do not appreciate the burn. The skin around my eyes felt moisturized and soothed. I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks so I can&#x27;t comment on the dark area brightening effect but overall I see a slight difference. A fabulous feature of the gel is that it can be used on your face as an all over brightener. You can apply the gel on your eyes and face in one step! A small amount goes along way because it&#x27;s rather fluid in consistency. I used a small dot for both eye lids. The best part for me is having an eye product that is cruelty free and vegan but with powerful antioxidants and anti-aging ingredients. It&#x27;s also more affordable than any department store brand. There&#x27;s really nothing to lose in trying for yourself and it happens to be the best selling eye gel on Amazon. Visit Oz Naturals to browse collection of amazing skin care products. Product was sent to me for consideration but my opinion is my own and genuine.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best eye treatment out there.  I have used expensive products, cheap products but this one stands out and the other thing it takes care of dark circles, wrinkles, and sagging.  I am new to this line but definitely here to stay. I also love their retinol moisturizer (it doesn&#x27;t break me out).</li>
            <li> BEST I USE FOR UNDER EYE DARKNESS</li>
            <li> Pretty good eye gel. I received this free but THIS REVIEW IS SOLELY MY OWN.I like the way it felt while applying it. It is not to greasy or harsh on sensitive skin. It is a truly good eye cream. I tried it for 3 weeks now and already could tell a bit of difference. I will buy this product once I&#x27;m finished with my tester. :)</li>
            <li> i love it,it really  work</li>
            <li> InstaNatural makes a far better eye gel for the same price.</li>
            <li> Helped clear my dark circles.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely awesome, but you probably already knew this from all of the other reviews.  So what I want to tell you is this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite one of the ingredients being &amp;#34;Silk Amino Acid Blend&amp;#34;, this product really is vegan.  The Silk Amino Acid Blend is a vegan ingredient made for Oz Naturals by a lab in Oregon.  I know this because I challenged Oz Naturals on this very thing, and they sent me the detailed information from the lab (it is the lab that calls it Silk Amino Acid Blend - yes, I agree, *very* poorly named for a vegan ingredient!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;m really glad that Oz Naturals made the effort to demonstrate that the product actually is vegan (thank you, Oz Naturals!) - because now I&#x27;m a dedicated Oz Naturals gal, using this, their C serum, and two of their moisturizers! (One for day, one for night!)</li>
            <li> I see the difference  under my eyes after using this  products.less dark.</li>
            <li> The bottle is smaller than I expected, but the packaging is top notch. I liked the product a lot. It does nothing for puffiness under the eye, but works well for my crows feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> Made my eyes so itchy!!! I bought 3 of them, just used couple times. What to do with rest?!</li>
            <li> To begin with, I got this product discounted so I may review. Regardless, everything that I say is my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you put on this eye cream, it feels so soothing and like it&#x27;s really working. I saw the area under my eyes look brighter. I didn&#x27;t expect it to but I was pleasantly surprised. I tried this eye cream on with makeup and for once my fine lines weren&#x27;t apparent. My concealer completely covered my dark circles and my makeup went on flawlessly. I looked much more awake and youthful with it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So would I recommend this? Yes. Absolutely! For the price and what it does, I feel like it will over time, lessen dark circles and brighten the face.</li>
            <li> best eye gel ever had1 thanks</li>
            <li> This is the BEST eye gel. AMAZING how it makes my under eyes feel.</li>
            <li> Puffy eyes are demenishing thanks to this stuff and the dark circles have improved in just two weeks..great stuff</li>
            <li> So far so good with this product. Not causing any skin issues and appears to be working.</li>
            <li> This is the only eye cream I use..It is by far the best..</li>
            <li> I received this eye gel over the holidays and can&#x27;t wait to see results after some time. Easy application and almost odorless</li>
            <li> I was sent this product for review &amp; have been using it for about a week. The Oz Eye Gel is goes on smooth and dries quickly. There is a very light scent.  I have had no issue with burning or stinging near my eyes as I do with some eye gels. I only need a half pump of product for each eye which is good because this is a small bottle.  What I have noticed so far is that my eye area remains smooth most of the day &amp; I don&#x27;t look as tired. I don&#x27;t have super dark circles so I really can&#x27;t rate that part of the product. I like it so far and will continue using, would love to see it in a larger size though.</li>
            <li> Where do I start...I love this product. I decided to try it out after reading the reviews and description on Amazon about two weeks ago. I received the eye gel and within one day I knew I found something amazing. I put it around my eyes and decided to also put it on a crease line I developed between my eyebrows from squinting over many years. I was absolutely amazed at what it did. It lessened the appearance of the crease almost immediately. I have never seen anything work that fast. It made my eyes look less puffy and tired and lightened up the dark circles too, which has been a problem for me since as far back as I can remember. I was so pleased with this product that I told some of my co-workers about it and they too noticed the difference in the crease between my eyebrows and around my eyes. One co-worker was so excited she went home that very night and ordered several items from the OZ Naturals skin care line. I was so excited too that I also ordered several more items from the skin care line. So far each one of them has proven to be amazing compared to any other product I have used in the past. And I have used many expensive department store brands and drug store brands alike looking for the one line that works best for me.    I just turned 50 years old and I have always had very sensitive skin. I get red and rashy around the sides of my mouth and also on my cheeks from many brands. I seem to be allergic to everything and I also have Celiac disease. Many of the expensive department store brands cause this unpleasant reaction. OZ Naturals has not done this to me and in fact makes my skin look and feel so soft and healthy, all I can say is I am amazed. I highly recommend this product as well as their other items.</li>
            <li> I LOVED this cream. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> What more can you say? it works, less puffiness around the eyes after only 2 weeks of use. Be sure to take before &amp; after pics, to see the difference! I like the fact OZ guarantees your purchase, if you don&#x27;t see results, send it back.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working for me. Can feel the tightening effect instantly. It appears to be making dark circles disappear.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is definitely smoothing and seems over time to firm and lessen wrinkles.  It has a cooling feel, is quickly penetrating and I use it under additional moisturizer. Plus it smells fresh and healthy!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  My fine lines and wrinkles are much less visible.  My skin feels great!</li>
            <li> I had very dark circles with puffiness under my eyes after using this eye gel for a few days the difference was so amazing.  My husband said that I looked well rested!!</li>
            <li> I feel this eye gel is fabulous and looking forward in purchasing it next week</li>
            <li> Returned it. Does not work for me. Still have lines.</li>
            <li> I heard many good comments about this product from my friends, then I decided to give it a try!  Looking forward to this!!</li>
            <li> Really awesome product, but you barley get any gel in the tube! A good substitute is the Instanatural eye gel</li>
            <li> First Off I Hate the smell, It smells like pickles. I&#x27;ve only used it once so idn if it really work&#x27;s. It leaves sticky after applying. So i can&#x27;t say weather i like it or not. I dont really like the smell &amp; Thats really strong.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  The wrinkles around my eyes improved after about one week of use.</li>
            <li> I tried many under eye creams. This one really works to tighten the skin. I still have dark circles under my eyes but not as bad. With tighter skin, the make-up does not end up in the lines.</li>
            <li> I waited this long before I give my review to make sure I see the result and indeed, this is the best eye gel everyone could ask for.  IT works great!</li>
            <li> This is nice on the eyes.  It&#x27;s cooling and has a pleasant smell.  It does help with wrinkles.  I rated 4 stars because I find that I only use it at night because it is somewhat sticky and difficult to apply makeup over the top of it.  I continue to buy it because it is effective.</li>
            <li> My dark circles are gone after continued use of this eye gel! I like using this every night because it doesn&#x27;t have a sticky feel to it. You really should try this one and I definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I feel like I am on a never ending quest to find an eye cream to banish under eye circles and corner of the eye discoloration. I have been using this gel twice a day for about one month. I feel like the discoloration has lightened ever so slightly and the under eye puffiness has decreased to some extent but this is not the answer to my prayers.  The gel is soothing, though and does hydrate the eye area. In truth, I should probably resign myself to these imperfections, spend my hard earned money on cover ups and concealers instead.</li>
            <li> You feel it penetrating and lifting, but what good does that do when it dries out the area and makes your wrinkles look WORSE?</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 1 and 1/2 weeks. I most definitely see a difference in my skin. Not real dramatic . . . but still hoping, although I&#x27;m thrilled with anything. Will definitely repurchase because this really moisturizes where it&#x27;s needed. Will return to tell you about the final result. I&#x27;ve been taking pics of the &#x27;before&#x27; but haven&#x27;t taken any others yet!</li>
            <li> used for over a month i see no difference or change. I dont think it works order than a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am very much into skin care.  I have been using this product for approximately 2 weeks.  I simply love it.  I can actually see a difference.</li>
            <li> This really helps my moisturizer soak in better- love it!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt anything .. . but it didn&#x27;t help, either. I gave it time to work - I&#x27;m writing this after using up the bottle. It did next to nothing. I was attracted by the price and great reviews from beauty magazines. I should have known better. At least I&#x27;m not out a lot of money and it didn&#x27;t hurt anything. But I&#x27;ll never buy it again, nor can I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the product obtain it for free from i love to review . Its non greasy , no scents , no allergy , i like the results</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks now and i can already see a difference in my dark circles.  The gel is also very good for de-puffing, it has a tightening effect and seems to brighten my eyes well too.  All good!  I have given it 4 stars as maybe it needs a little more time to work on my fine lines!</li>
            <li> i have terrible dark circles and puffiness under my eyes. i have tried just about every product out there. i havent noticed a difference after using this product! i love other OZ naturals, but am not a fan of this one! delivery was good and packaging was great!</li>
            <li> So refreshing! I love a an eye cream that has a gel like feel and is cooling and refreshing and this one is all that! I love the feel, I almost feel like my under eyes are tightened in a good feeling way. Very cooling which is super nice esp with hot weather coming up. My makeup goes on just fine over it which is a plus. It&#x27;s moisturizing but not so much where your cant easily use it under makeup with out a big ol mess. I am very pleased with the feel and outcome so far, loving it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this according to the reviews. I have been using one week.So far I am happy with this product.. I will let you know after I have used couple weeks....the reviews sold this product to me.</li>
            <li> Not quite sure if it&#x27;s working to remove wrinkles and whatnot, but it does feel hydrating. My eyelids usually get really dry, but I have not had issues with that since using this product. I have never tried any other eye care products, so I cannot compare it to any other products.</li>
            <li> So far I like it, I don&#x27;t see much more results that I did from other eye creams/gels and I have tried them all :-(</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over 2 weeks now. I usually use a lot of my facial products at night so they can really work into my skin while I am relaxed and asleep. So I began using this the 1st week just at night and the next week I started applying it once in the morning and once before bed. While I do notice a little of the puffiness and dark circles are gone I can&#x27;t say that it did a whole lot of difference to my eye area just yet. It was easy to apply and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin like some other products I have used. I have used this with and without make-up and it works great either way. Because I used all 3 products it takes a little longer to dry so keep that in mind before applying any moisturizers or make-up afterward. I am going to keep using this to see what results I get after the 30 days. I give this 4 out of 5 stars because it has the potential to work like it says over time, 2 weeks or even 30 days can be hard to get the  full results of a product.&lt;br /&gt;I received these products for review purposes. However ALL opinions are honest and my own. I do not recommend products I would not use myself.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week and I love it. You only need a tiny amount from the pump dispenser as it glides on thinly and easily. There is no goopy eye feel after application the gel always seems to feel cool and very soothing. The smell is soooo good, it&#x27;s like melon, I love it. After just a few days I notice my eyes are not puffy in the morning and already the deeper lines seem less prominent. (I&#x27;m 40) I look less tired. I have also been applying this on the fine lines above my top lip and noticed that there is improvement there too. I will definitely be ordering more it&#x27;s the only eye treatment my sensitive skin has tolerated and that has made a visible difference so quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this product. A defiantly buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used this eye gel for the past 3 months and find it very effective in reducing the dark circles under my eyes. It&#x27;s a good product and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am always sceptical with eye and face products but this eye gel blow me away. I have noticed the glow under eyes in the mornings with no dark circles and no need for concealer which I never thought would happen. I am hooked on Oz Naturals products as they do WORK!</li>
            <li> This really is the &amp;#34;Best eye gel&amp;#34;!! I am very happy to rate this product 5 stars or a 10 on a 1-10 scale. I use to think I would age gracefully and not worry about silly bags under my eyes. But, the bags appeared and aging gracefully without baggie eyes became my new goal. After spending way too much money, time and hope on products I found this eye gel by Oz Naturals and it Really works!! Thank u! Back to aging gracefully, until my next age dilemma!</li>
            <li> It is super calming and rejuvenating!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. does not &amp;#34;remove&amp;#34; dark circles, but definitely makes them appear less noticeable. I found if I used my moisturizer FIRST then apply oz eye gel it makes the eye brighter and circles diminished! Will continue purchasing. PLEASE do not discontiue!!! A happy more rested looking customer!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of other products and nothing worked for me until I found OZ Naturals - they are simply the best products at the best price you will ever find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle of eye gel and I really think it has made a difference with the skin around my eye. It seems smoother and firmer. I also use it during the day when I want a quick pick me up for my face. I&#x27;ll put it on my forehead and around my lips and my jaw line. It gives me a refreshed look. I&#x27;m 65 and have been into natural skin care products most of my life, and I have to say OZ Naturals is the best so far. Just shows you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money to get a quality product. Shelly</li>
            <li> Disappointed again. Have been using for a few weeks with no visible change in the under eye area . Will continue until gone but don&#x27;t expect any discernible changes .</li>
            <li> So far, pretty nice. I have only been using during the day, going to try night use as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews very often, especially for skin care products. I can honestly say that at 47 years old, I am pretty sick and tired of having tried far too many products only to realize I&#x27;d wasted my money, yet again. I&#x27;m happy to finally be able to write a positive review because I&#x27;m happy to have finally found something that actually works! I&#x27;ve always had dark under eye circles since I was in my teens. (some of it must be the Russian heritage in the mix). I started using Oz Naturals about 2-3 weeks ago. I didn&#x27;t expect anything to happen so I wasn&#x27;t looking much. I was pleasantly surprised to see that one day during my regular morning prep before work I noticed that the skin beneath my eyes looked lighter. Not sure when it happened but it didn&#x27;t matter. It was lighter and continues to stay lighter. I only need to use it now a couple of times per week and if I skip it, it doesn&#x27;t come back. I&#x27;m hopeful this will continue. I am still too beat up from years of no results to not keep my fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing when it goes on, and I let it dry before I put on make up, and it works great.</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel I use it every morning along with the serums and face mask and the face lotion. You might say I am obsessed with your products. I am almost 50 years old but you would never know it thanks to you guys.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel.  It is cool and soothing when applying.  It does reduce puffiness and fine lines.  If applied at night also you awake with a fresh look and no puffiness.  Also love it is a natural skin product.  Will definitely purchase again and will try other products by this company.  Great prices also.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference. It&#x27;s alright for the price and hasn&#x27;t done any harm so I may buy it, again.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I didn&#x27;t get back to you sooner. I really like your eye gel. I would also like another product for moisture to use over the gel. It really helps with the puffiness, but not completely. It is better than any other product that I have previously used for this problem. Next, I will try your vitamin C serum. I have already re-ordered the gel.  Harriet G.F.</li>
            <li> I was offered to try Oz Naturals Eye Gel and I jumped at the chance. I often do not get enough sleep. Even, when I do get sleep, I wake up with puffy eyes and &amp;#34;bags.&amp;#34; The eye gel is all natural and 75% organic. The gel can be used morning and night and under make up. I don&#x27;t wear too much undereye make up but I had no issues with this. The gel goes on smooth and feels cool to the skin. I really noticed a result even after a few days. You only need a tiny dab, so the product should last a while. My girlfriends tried a sample, too, and we all agreed that it had an immediate subtle effect. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I wish this came in a larger bottle--you can use this on your entire face and neck--but in doing so it will not last, as it is 0.5oz---need to find another product with the same ingredients --- I&#x27;ll be glad to take any and all suggestions---PLEASE.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> not such an effective product</li>
            <li> Have allergy from it.</li>
            <li> Product lives up to its claim☺</li>
            <li> love this product...tightens up under eye area taking away puffiness and bags...recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the eye gel for a couple of months. I have less dark circles and puffiness under my eyes; I look less tired and more refreshed. I love this product!</li>
            <li> this is an amazing product I would recommend it to all ages I even used it above my lip and it worked well also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 66 and always use something around my eyes.  Ox Naturals eye gel is the best I&#x27;ve ever found - regardless of price.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> worst eye cream on the market.  The reviews did not tell the true story, or at least in my case.  Left skin extremely dry and flaky. Be cautious if you decide to purchase</li>
            <li> Love this soothing light weight eye gel.  Have my husband using as well.  Told my sis about it.  I really like the results I get from the Vitamin C serum.  The Hyaluronic Acid and recently the Retinol new product. So happy to find these products a year ago.  Thank You.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a couple of weeks now - and it is great.  I have dark circles and some puffiness - it is starting to clear this.  I tried another cream but it just was not working - I was looking worse with it so time to try something else.  It is very cooling and soothing when you use it.  I love that you can use it anywhere else on your face - so if I use a bit too much I just smooth it in other areas of my face (usually around the eye area).  I don&#x27;t wear makeup up so I use it both day and night.  At night I also use a retinol and in the morning a Vitamin C serum then a moisturiser.  Genuinely recommend you buy it and try.</li>
            <li> tried for the last 2 days, most lotions make my skin red and sore so far no irritation feels good</li>
            <li> The best eye gel I&#x27;ve used. My eyes are sensative and can puff up with well known brands but this gel sooths &amp; conditions. Will be buying again</li>
            <li> I am 55 and have been using the eye gel for 2 months and have noticed a amazing improvement in the lines around the eyes.  I only use it at night as I found my make-up did not sit well, but using it every night has still given me the results I expected after reading the reviews.  I use the whole range of Oz products.  and would not use anything else now.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It completely removed the wrinkles around my eyes and lessened the circles under my eyes dramatically.</li>
            <li> Love this eye gel! It&#x27;s super hydrating to the eye area and reduces the look of my fine lines. Mostly, I love how soothing it is.  I call it liquid cucumbers because that&#x27;s what it feels like. I have also noticed a reduction in dark circles. This one is a keeper!</li>
            <li> Love this eye gel.  For me, it is a light, non irritating product that has worked for my eye puffiness and darkness under eyes.  You only need a small amount and the pump dispenses it nicely.  Will definitely be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> This is a great gel. I applied it every morning and at night for about two weeks. The puffiness is gone. My eyes don&#x27;t look as tired anymore. It really works. I have tried other products with no results. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Received this from my daughter as a gift.. It is very cool and refreshing..it goes on like a gel and ads a dewiness to the skin. Packed with antioxidants all good for your skin. Also, smells very earthy and natural...almost like cucumbers! Will definitely be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> It did not help with wrinkles, and it is a bit drying. It does have a cool feeling, but other than that i did not see any results,  I only have few fine lines, and not deep wrinkles, dnd thought this gel eye cream would be the answer, but not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know who has been writing the reviews but I made a mistake by relying reviews on Amazon instead of cheking on the web. A complete hoax. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Just use a little bit and it does diminish lines around the eyes.  For the best result, let it dry before applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I received  this as a gift for Christmas and love it so much I bought some for my sister and husband. My husband has dark circles under his eyes from sleep apnea and after a few weeks I have already seen a big difference. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Received the eye gel-eye cream today, 01/21/2015 and applied it after shower.  I love that it is all natural and it goes on so smoothly.  I am anxious to see the results after a weeks use.</li>
            <li> Like all oz products, this gel is of high quality</li>
            <li> First, I wasn&#x27;t paid to write this. I bought into the entire line. I have just been using this week but here is what I have noticed.It has a great consistency (gel) and seem to tighten up the myriad on lines under my eyes (I am 55). I can post back later if this does even more, as well as the other (5) products I purchased.</li>
            <li> This is some great eye cream. I use it on my husband only at night when he allows me to. I&#x27;ve noti a huge change in his skin. In th morning he&#x27;s less puffy. He has great skin anyway. He&#x27;s so handsome</li>
            <li> I feels nice but I really don&#x27;t notice much difference</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands of eye creams over the years, and this one stands alone!  I love the &amp;#34;lightness&amp;#34; of this product!&lt;br /&gt;This gel is wonderful......light, pleasant smell (extremely light smell!) light gel with no greasiness what so ever.  My skin immediately feels smoother!  Helps the dark circles and puffiness really well too!</li>
            <li> wonderful results at a fraction of the cost of the expensive lines I have bought in the past. Love this line of products!</li>
            <li> Still not using it long enough but I can tell the significant difference so I am really happy!</li>
            <li> Bought this about 3 months ago. Wrote a review saying after 2 weeks use - no difference, not impressed. Fast forward 2.5 months. Had lunch with a long time male friend this week and was told I did not look so tired! I see my face every day in the mirror, and if the change is not obvious then I see no change! Someone seeing my occasionally and noticing a change right away is sign enough for me to continue this product. Sorry for the &amp;#34;quick&amp;#34; review.</li>
            <li> I have used this eye gel for the past year.  I really like how gentle and soothing it is around the eyes.  It is a nice addition to my daily skin care regime.</li>
            <li> Love all oz natural products</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!!! I saw results immediately</li>
            <li> OZ Naturals Eye Gel is fantastic! I love how it has a nice faint cucumber scent to it, it is cooling and feels so refreshing when you put it on! It totally removed my under eye puffiness with one application! You just dab a small amount around your eyes, forehead and cheek area and its like an instant face lift! This little gel can take care of your dark circles, wwrinkles, sagging, puffiness, and dryness with a tiny amount! I truly love this product!  I am amazed with the results and how nice it feels on my face! It is safe to use morning and night and can be used under makeup!  This will be great for those hot summer days coming up!  This product is 75% organic which I love.  The results are INSTANT you can feel and see the results immediately which I love! My husband says I look younger ( I&#x27;ll take that)! I feel like I am brighter and more glowing after using Oz Naturals products. This truly is a great company made in the USA! Thank you for your INSTANT MIRACLE EYE GEL~&lt;br /&gt;**I received free product to give my honest opinion.**</li>
            <li> So far, I have used this product twice a day for 4 weeks in combination with Body Merry Age Defense Eye Cream. I have seen absolutely no difference in my dark circles and tired looking eyes.</li>
            <li> Love it . Will buy it again</li>
            <li> Very light - i have used this product for a few weeks and so far best eye cream i have used.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Almost instantly I noticed a difference in the puffiness under my eyes. Nice fragrance and easy to use. You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> First off, I got this item Free from Snagshout to write a review for this product. I have been using this product for about a week and a half now and I already see the dark circles under my eyes lighten. I hope that it continues to improve the more I use it. I really like OZ naturals Eye dark circle eye gel!!</li>
            <li> This eye gel has worked for me, smells like cucumber and doesn&#x27;t dry sticky like some eye gels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for weeks and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference but I still use it because it&#x27;s better than nothing</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it because I have developed very puffy eyes but for some reason it didn&#x27;t work for me. :(</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first, but this product totally works. Amazing !!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> i think its a great product does what it says it does no strong steanky smell or anything love this product</li>
            <li> This used to be a 5/5 product for me--I re-purchased it three times. But the most recent batch feels very different on my skin. More tacky and peely. When I use it in the morning, halfway through the day I notice I have peeling white gunk on and around my eyelids. It&#x27;s also less hydrating and doesn&#x27;t do much for puffiness. Please bring back the old formula!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this eye gel twice a day for four days before giving up.  I definitely felt the tightening effect it had on my skin, but not only did it remain a little sticky (I only used a tiny, tiny bit!), something about it made my eyes burn and tear non-stop!  I&#x27;ve never experienced a reaction like that to an eye cream before.  I was so excited about trying this product and I really wanted to love it, but I must be allergic to something in it. :(</li>
            <li> This gel is great for puffy eyes. It is cool and soothing and not oily. I have tried also the Vitamin C serum and I find these products to be made with natural ingredients and the smell of the eye gel is very subtle. I have read we shouldn&#x27;t put heavy oils around the eyes so an eye gel is a good solution. It does not sting if it gets in the eyes. I put it on before bed every night now.</li>
            <li> I was having unsightly under eye dryness and puffiness. Since using this eye gel, this condition has lessened. The ingredients are gentle and do not cause eye irritation, which has been a problem with other products. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product has done NOTHING for me. No reduction in puffiness. No reduction in dark circles. Most definitely no changes in fine lines or anything else. It just dries tight. If it doesn&#x27;t dry, then it just feels sticky. I&#x27;ve had better results with simple Walmart brand/Equate brand items. I am not saying those things do miracles either, but this was a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Definitely a product I will keep in my daily skin regime. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is such a great product not only for dark circles and wrinkles around the eyes but it also works wonders for acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;I am recommending it to my friends and family as well.</li>
            <li> This product is actually best for nighttime, after you wash your face of the day&#x27;s grime and makeup.  What I like about this gel, is that it has  creamy feel to it, goes on nice and smooth, and has NO odor.  Once you spread it on your face, you cannot ever smell anything chemically odorous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t try to put this on under your make-up right away, especially if you are putting on eye shadow.  It will  take time to dry out and time will eliminate any feeling of temporary stickiness.  It may take about 20 minutes to dry for eye shadow prep.  So, I like to use it without any makeup, or at bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very small bottle, with a squirt lid and you cannot over do the squirt.  Give it a couple of pumps for both eyes.  I spread this completely around the eye, and it seems to eliminate darker circles and puffiness  I get, after not enough sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe anything can turn back the hands of time, but this product is a good aid, enhancement, additive to your livelihood.... Product received for review...  Rizzo</li>
            <li> Love this item, works well and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I like this product!  I haven&#x27;t noticed it doing anything for dark circles, yet.  My eyes are not puffy so I wouldn&#x27;t be able to address that claim.  It does tighten and lift and that&#x27;s what I needed most, and it stays all day unless you are in the extreme outside heat and perspire, then re apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cathy&lt;br /&gt;Las Vegas, NV</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye gel for 3 weeks and I love it.  It took a week or so to see results.  It definitely helps reduce puffiness and dark under the eyes, but not as much with wrinkles but I plan on continuing use. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it is thick and somewhat sticky and doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.  It also made my skin very dry but I have sensitive skin.  I contacted Oz Naturals and they were great at responding very quickly and gave me advice to use it with my moisturizer.  Once I did this it made a big difference! I use it every night with my moisturizer and I love it!  I also use Oz Naturals Vitamin C serum every morning and love that also!</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes appears firmer and my crows feet have diminished significantly after only one week of use!</li>
            <li> Love the ingredients. When you apply it to your eyes, you feel instant hydration to the skin.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference, but all Dr. Oz products are great.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I trusted Oz to formulate a cream that would take care of dark circles in particular.  So far I have to give it a thumbs down but I will proceed with it until I finish it and see if it just takes a long time to work.  As of now though, I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like this eye gel, the dispenser is easy to use and the product performs well.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It is very light and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> What a waste of my money.. Whatever you do DO NOT BUY THIS IT DID Absolutely nothing for my dark circles under my eyes WHAT A SHAME NEVER NEVER AGAIN</li>
            <li> Nothing is ever going to completely remove the dark circles under my eyes except maybe a time machine but I was looking to reduce the puffiness I experience.  This product solidly delivered on that.  I did give it 2 weeks to see any results.  The feel is cooling and soothing.  I use it both morning and night.  It works well under my make up.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks. While I can’t say that I look like a teenager again, I do see some lightening in the dark bags under my eyes. My makeup goes on easier now since I started using this product.. a bonus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to looking younger, women are usually the first to say that the wrinkles around their eyes make them look older than their age. Depending on the severity of the wrinkles, dark circles, and puffiness, you could definitely look five to ten years older.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start reversing the eye aging process with a product from OZ Naturals – the Superior Youth Eye Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Featured in Allure Magazine, you can’t go wrong giving this eye gel (not cream) that’s formulated specifically for the sensitive skin and areas around your eyes, especially the eyelids.

            <li> Even though I received the product for free, I can attest that it&#x27;s a good eye gel.     I&#x27;ve been using this gel morning and night, and I can pleasantly say that it does a good job of vitalizing the area around the eyes!</li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel! OZ products haven&#x27;t let me down yet. I have really bad dark circles at the inner corner of my eye and the typical under eye area, I really like how it feels on the skin. It has also really helped with the puffiness in my eyes. I have been sick for the past 4 days and this has helped my tired eyes.&lt;br /&gt;With OZ naturals you can&#x27;t go wrong because theyre a cruelty free company , all natural and they WORK.&lt;br /&gt;At this point I have tried their tonic, face Serum and now this eye gel and I really really like them all.</li>
            <li> This is a great product...no stickiness like some eye serums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really seeing a difference, but I do like the natural ingredients and the smooth, absorbent texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been use this product for a while but haven&#x27;t seen the best results yet I like that it smells good and doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily still hoping to see more results</li>
            <li> The same it really works! Just remember to use it every day &amp; night.</li>
            <li> i did not see any results</li>
            <li> I notice fewer lines around my eyes since I&#x27;ve been using this gel for about a month! Also, the lines that are there don&#x27;t appear as deep as they once did. I also use this on my smile lines and have noticed a difference on those as well. This has been the best fine line product I have ever used! I don&#x27;t have dark circles under my eyes so I can&#x27;t speak to the gel&#x27;s effectiveness of combatting those.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of use, noticeable improvement to dark puffy under eyelids. What a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether the product works or not...I can&#x27;t get past the terrible smell!</li>
            <li> I have tried some of the most expensive eye creams on the market for undereye circles and lines, and this is by far THE BEST. Noticed a difference in a week. I will never be without this cream!</li>
            <li> Has done absolutely nothing to reduce swelling under the eye.  Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the good.comments it has. But it didnt work at all at least for me. This was a waste of money and I dont recommend to buy it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about 10 days, but I have to say I&#x27;ve noticed zero improvement on anything it claims to address. No diminished darkness under the eye, no fine line diminishing....nothing. I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> .used it before I LOVE IT the best eye cream give it time you will see the difference in a week  try my bags are diminishing little by little</li>
            <li> Nice product, like the coolness when applied. A little goes a LONG way, dont over use otherwise it tends to get sticky and crease...takes away puffiness and fine lines, gives eyes a bright look.</li>
            <li> I bought this eye gel recently and this is a few days that I&#x27;m using it, this gel is wonderful and absolutely works for me, I have tried many of eye creams and none of them worked, but this one is really kind of miracle. I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase and recommend it to every body with eye concern</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and in no way does this product irritate my skin. I like how soft my eyes feel after applying this gel. This product absorbs easy and fast into my skin. You only need to apply a very tiny bit to your eyes. The eye gel smells like a beauty product. I haven&#x27;t notice the wrinkles under my eyes going away I guess I need to use it for a longer time before seeing results. I will keep you guys posted when after using this product for longer and if I see results. I received this eye gel for free to test and review then give my honest unbiased feedback.</li>
            <li> Once again, I cannot say enough good about OZ Naturals skin care line. This works exactly as advertised and I could not be happier. No skin irritations! Be sure to consider trying these products.  Price is amazing!</li>
            <li> I like this a lot, but I only used half and then I lost it. I think my house cleaner took it? It didn&#x27;t really do anything in the short time period I used it, but it&#x27;s super nice. It feels good under ur eyes, and since it&#x27;s stem cells you can also put it on other places you want to speed up the healing on your face.</li>
            <li> Have not noticed a difference in eye puffiness. Which was the reason for my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great, will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Arived quickly. Soothing gel. Thank you</li>
            <li> I am noticing a difference but not as much as i had hoped</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! It helped relieve dark circles, bags under the eye area.here&#x27;s another area it helped, under the chin, helps with saggy skin, appeared to have tightened the area! Highly recommend to all my friends and family!</li>
            <li> This does reduce the puffiness and dark circles and few products I&#x27;ve tried have done so as effectively as this.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  Iam 83 years old and I doubted that anything would help me with some wrinkles around the eyes; I acquired some of them with another eye cream which left me with blisters, redness and then skin like leather aound my eyes; guess I have a sensitive skin.  After using OZ Natural only a few days I started seeing a big improvement. I am SO glad I found this product!  CT</li>
            <li> great stuff....I love it</li>
            <li> Amazing product worth eery penny</li>
            <li> So far i haven&#x27;t seen any obvious results. But I guess it&#x27;s mainly because I stay up too late all the time :( It does make my skin feel tighter after using though.</li>
            <li> You definitely get a bang for your buck with this little miracle in a bottle. I started to see results in less than a week. On day five I was totally amazed over my dark circles diminishing. I used plenty of products and to no avail, however Oz Natural did the trick.  Thank you Oz Naturals!!!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> It works just as described</li>
            <li> This does seem to be helping with the small lines around my eyes</li>
            <li> I have puffiness and dark circles that unfortunately run in my family.  This gel really helps diminish these blemishes and make me feel younger and brighter.</li>
            <li> USed whole container and no results</li>
            <li> I have just started my second bottle and I can&#x27;t see any difference. I used it on my clean eyes every morning and every night.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference in dark circles at all.</li>
            <li> No tremendous difference.  I prefer a product that firms more.</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome! I have only used for short period of time and see a difference ! I&#x27;m 33 and was just starting to see fine lines and seems to have smoothed out,  I will keep using that&#x27;s for sure and love the price</li>
            <li> Love this product. Keeps my skin moisturized even through the night visible difference</li>
            <li> This is the first time I use this eye cream and since the first day I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, but I&#x27;m the one who is using it. It really takes away puffiness and makes my eyes appear brighter and tighter. It also leaves a nice, cool feeling.</li>
            <li> The jury is still out on this product. I have not seen a reduction of lines around my eyes. Also, I made the mistake, one night, of having slightly wet fingers when applying it, let me warn you do not do that! Even with dry fingers, the product is still sticky before it dries. This is not the miracle product I had read about in the reviews which led to my purchase. Right now I feel like it&#x27;s any other eye product that I have tried and isn&#x27;t working...however....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I will write a follow up review when I&#x27;m half to three quarters of the way through the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One positive note I can say is ot smells.good, it smells like cucumbers.</li>
            <li> This stuff does work!  My dark circles under my eyes are hardly noticeable.  It also takes out the puffiness from my eyes in the morning before I put my make-up on.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> High quality product. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of the effect, like getting off my eye bags. It&#x27;s mild and moisture though. I guess I can&#x27;t ask too much...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to discover a product like this that actually works. Highly recommend OZ Naturals.</li>
            <li> When I received an invitation to try some products from the OZ Naturals range, I did my usual research and read up about the brand and its products before accepting.  I only have one face and my skin has become increasingly sensitive with age, so I have to be very careful about the stuff I put on it.  I was intrigued by the clearly scientific approach, the full disclosure of ingredients and the cruelty-free statement.  Also the active ingredients are exactly those I have so far found most effective:  hyaluronic acid, peptide complex, vitamin E and some plant-based extracts.  Plant stem cells and Matrixyl 3000 were new to me but sounded promising.  As usual, when testing skin care, I started using this eye gel by itself, discontinuing my previous eye cream, and hoping for the best, because I do have problems with dark circles, lines and puffiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye product is an almost clear, medium-textured gel which disappears into my skin after a very short massage, leaving a perfect basis for make-up.  That, in itself, is rare in my experience.  Usually eye-specific preparations are either too light and almost drying, or else they tend to leave a greasy residue which surfaces later through foundation or primer.  This gel can be applied several times a day, so I used it first thing in the morning after washing my face and at night after cleansing, in combination with a serum (also by OZ Naturals) and topped by a night cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, does it work?  The maker suggests that full results can be seen after 60 days of regular use, so I am hopeful for even more, but so far (after three weeks) I can see a definite improvement.  My dark circles are much less evident, my skin is smoother and I can use a bit of concealer without ending up with a caked and lined mess.  Also my eyelids are firmer and less puffy and I like the fact that I can apply this gel to the top of my eye, most products are not recommended for the eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could see a visible difference, especially when looking at photos taken a month ago, but I got the clearest confirmation the other day, when I happened to look at my face mid-afternoon and was dismayed to see that a hint of bags had returned under my eyes.  And then I remembered:  a house guest had disrupted my routine and I had forgotten to put the gel on for two days!  I quickly remedied and was able to reapply foundation without the raccoon-eye look that some other gels produce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle holds ½ fluid ounce or 15 ml of gel, and I have no idea how much there is left, but the pump dispenser works extremely well and it seems I only need a tiny amount each time so it appears to be very good value for money as well.  In any case, this is a product I would not want to be without, so I will be replacing it once it runs out.  As far as eye creams go, it&#x27;s the best specific product I have ever tried and absolutely gentle and non-irritating in this very sensitive area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NB: I received this item for free with a request to fully test and evaluate it.  As usual, my review reflects my own views and experience with the product and was in no way influenced by the manufacturer.ence, especially when looking at photos taken a month ago, but I got the clearest confirmation the other day, when I happened to look at my face mid-afternoon and was dismayed to see that a hint of bags had returned under my eyes.

In any case, this is a product I would not want to be without, so I will be replacing it once it runs out.  As far as eye creams go, it&#x27;s the best specific product I have ever tried and absolutely gentle and non-irritating in this very sensitive area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NB: I received this item for free with a request to fully test and evaluate it.  As usual, my review reflects my own views and experience with the product and was in no way influenced by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> OZ Naturals makes a great eye gel.  This has a perfect weight to it.  It feels light and a little slippery going on and absorbs quickly and easily.  I was surprised by how this feels cooling even when it is going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend a lot of time reading every day, sometimes painfully small print, and my eyes often look tired at the end of the day.  Lately, I have also noticed noticeable bags under my eyes.  It has been a terrible development. After a few weeks of using this eye gel, the bags under my eyes are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye care is so tricky because I don’t like gloppy stuff.  I have thrown out a lot of eye gels in the past few years, because I know if I don’t like how things feel, then I am not going to use them.  They are just a waste of space.  This one is not like those.  It has a light feel and almost no scent.  It is addictive, how nice it feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review.</li>
            <li> It is just soso..... not as good as previous reviews said. I wont buy it again.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a couple of weeks religiously and cannot see much improvement.  Does virtually nothing for puffiness.  The only slight difference I have seen is a little brightening effect but overall not worth the money.  No lifting of the eye whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product.  I noticed a big change in the area under my eyes within a week - skin smooth and lines practically gone. With twice-a-day use, the product lasted a long time because you only need a little with each application.  Reasonable price for an excellent product as well.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is smooth like a serum. It smells great too! I received it within four days. It seems to be moisturizing really well.</li>
            <li> Second bottle...great eye moisturizer..have not seen dark circles fade</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! It goes on smoothly and dries quickly leaving no residue. It flattens my eye bags immediately...Works above on the eyelids too...It&#x27;s like watching a miracle take place!</li>
            <li> Smooth application, skin under eyes feels tighter, silky feeling gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks. I have not really noticed any difference in my under eye bags.</li>
            <li> A Honest Review for Trying products...  AWESOME....I keep mine in the fridge so it is cold when I apply.  Noticeable reduction of fine lines and morning swelling.  Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Started seeing results almost immediately. Now my husband is also using it!</li>
            <li> Great product!! I&#x27;ve seen incredible results.</li>
            <li> Very soothing eye gel - don&#x27;t see much change in wrinkles or reduced puffiness but it feels nice around my eyes esp during allergy season and dry winters.</li>
            <li> It works well and absorbs easily. I just didn&#x27;t see a marked improvement. Maybe I need to give it more time. On a huge positive note, it doesn&#x27;t burn my highly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Sadly, three weeks in, and not the slight bit of lightening in my dark eye circles, which is what I was most hoping for.  I&#x27;ll keep using it and update if there are any improvements, but so far, nothing!</li>
            <li> Have been using that for some weeks, still no different. Sounds like it was a waste of money.  A real waste. .</li>
            <li> Best eye gel ever!! I have allergies and this doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had puffiness and dark circles for most of my life - this product goes a long way towards reducing those. However, what I really don&#x27;t like about it is that it dries to a sticky finish - I mean really sticky, like flypaper. If I scrunch my eyes for a moment, then release, I can feel skin sticking to other skin. I&#x27;m using a very minimal amount of the product so I don&#x27;t know what can be done about this other than wiping off the product, which seems counterproductive. Because of this, I&#x27;ll be trying something different when this runs out.</li>
            <li> Apparently this was not tested on darker skin, because it does not work for me.  Have used it since I got it and i do not see a difference.  oh well money wasted</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Love it!</li>
            <li> First--highly recommend Oz Hyaluronic acid serum. Second, this eye cream I&#x27;m not sure about yet. No problems with it, just not sure if any results yet. I do feel that it tightens the eye area up. I agree with another reviewer about it not great under makeup. I work around this by using a tiny amount of my BareMinerals Primetime---then makeup goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;catch\\&quot; ( can&#x27;t find the right word here) on the eye cream. No noticeable result on my dark hereditary dark circles I&#x27;ve had since I was born--I usually don&#x27;t expect anything to help those anyway. Just like the serum, a little goes a long way. I usually can&#x27;t pump out a small enough amount, so I use the rest on forehead and small lines.  I am not throwing in the towel yet on this product--I&#x27;m guessing a bottle will last a few months--so will try the entire bottle---I am optimistic that I&#x27;ll see improvement in my fine eye wrinkles, as the Oz Hyaluronic serum is working already.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading so many positive reviews and after using it for 30 days, I can add my own positive review.  I am really impressed with this product.  I needs only a small amount to totally cover the full eye area, applies easily and keeps the area moist and supple.  I don&#x27;t have any dark undereye circles, but do have dry and saggy skin due to being 67 years young.  The little bit of wrinkling I have is quickly diminishing as is the looseness of my under and over eye skin...I&#x27;m impressed and will order again when needed.</li>
            <li> i dont see any difference around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It works just ordered it again,helped with the puffiness</li>
            <li> I was sent the Super Youth Eye Gel by Oz Naturals to review. All opinions are my own.  Here is the product description from Oz Naturals: “Experience the most effective eye treatment designed to eliminate dark circles, puffiness and wrinkles! This eye gel is considered to be the most effective and complete eye treatment available. Safe for all skin types, non comedogenic, does not contain parabens, sulfates or alcohol. All active ingredients are 100% natural and 75% organic. Made in the USA in our advanced FDA certified facility. All Oz Naturals products are 100% vegan, cruelty-free, paraben-free, sulfate-free, mineral oil-free, lanolin-free, gluten-free, and GMO-free.”  After using it topically under my eyes to treat under eyes, I will share the results. Before using this gel, my under eye skin was bluish-purple. After using the gel, my the undereye bags and discolouration decreased significantly. After three days, my under eye issues vanished. I know the target demographic is 30+, but I found it really helped with my under eye issues. I used it for seven days and incorporated it into my existing skincare routine. After washing my face with my clarisonic + my Dial acne face wash, I dried my face off and applied the gel on my under eye area.  For me, the only potential negative aspect was the light cucumber scent when I first applied it. I lasted a few seconds, so I wasn’t bothered, but I wanted to mention it.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this product. It does seem to work. Smooths out the fine lines. I have paid a lot more for other products that don&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li> did not work. waste of money</li>
            <li> A little pricey but works well.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this eye gel. I have tried so many high end products over the years. After reading the reviews on this product I was eager to receive it and begin using. Its been two weeks I cannot tell any difference. The company states they will give you your money back if your not completely satisfied. I will continue to use a little longer in hopes of results if I experience none I will be requesting my money back.</li>
            <li> I started using this a couple of days ago.  The results so far are amazing.  I have red eye bags.  Or I used to.  I am amazed.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The gel is lightweight and goes on smoothly. I noticed a change in the puffiness and dark circles within one week. You have to use the gel every day to maximize results.</li>
            <li> Very nice eye gel.  This product does not irritate my eyes or skin.  I will purhase again.</li>
            <li> After finishing this &amp;#34;amazing gel&amp;#34; all I can is that it never worked (not even for the lines). As a young male in his 20s I began to notice that my lifestyle made my dark circles appear. Even though I&#x27;m not drinking caffeine/alcohol anymore, smoking, nor sleeping only 6 hours a night, like a few years back, I&#x27;m still wondering if there&#x27;s any &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; eye-cream out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next quest is to try RoC Multi-Correxion Eye Treatment and wear sun glasses on sunny days (which I neglected for so long). I know the fact that every skin product works differently for each individual but I&#x27;m seriously thinking about using a laser treament.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little bit concious of  lines around my eyes (obviously laugh too much) and I always use an eye cream or serum around my eyes before I put moisturiser on.  This Oz Naturals Eye Gel is a little thicker than the usual creams and goes on clear and smooth.  The fragrance is a delicate cross between cucumber and aloe.  I have been using this in the morning under moisturiser and have been really impressed with the results.  I don&#x27;t sleep well and I often have tired looking eyes and darker areas beneath the eye.  Fine lines become less noticeable and the whole eye area looks younger and brighter.  I feel it&#x27;s made a big difference to my appearance and will certainly purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always a consideration for ladies is whether it crumbles or flakes under make up.  I&#x27;ve used this under Lancome foundation and Boots No 7 foundation and it performs well with no flakiness.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a free trial. I have only been using it for 2 1/2 weeks, but can see some improvement in fine lines around my eyes and some puffiness! It goes on smooth, smells pleasant and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for two weeks and have noticed a difference already. The fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes are starting to diminish. This works well with the rest of my skin care cream. I can still easily apply my makeup over top of it. It is cruelty free. It has a nice smooth texture and no odor. I am happy to recieve this item to review.</li>
            <li> Great eye cream its gentle but works great.</li>
            <li> I work second shift and have trouble sleeping.  This tends to leave me with dark circles and puffiness under my eyes. I have been using OZNaturals Super Youth Eye Gel for the past five days and I have definitely noticed that the puffiness has gone down quite a bit. A younger man I work with even told me that my eyes look brighter and I have been looking less tired.  I have tried many different brands of eye gels that claim to reduce dark circles and puffiness and I have found that for me I get the best overall results with OZNaturals products. The gel is light and clear and absorbs quickly into my skin. A little bit goes a  long way so 5 ounces can last quite a while. I also really like the fact that their products are made in the USA, this eye gel is 97.4% natural and all of their products are cruelty free. I recommend giving  this eye gel a try.</li>
            <li> I really like this. My skin feel tight and my circles have lightened :-)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing in how it helps relax aging lines beneath the eyes, at the corners of the eyes and even on the cheek right below corners of the nostrils. It is easy to apply and is very cost-effective compared to similar products, in other words: it is worth the price! I am familiar with the effects of hyaluronic acid, which is included in two facial skin care products I have used. This is a common ingredient used for overall skin firming which I have used and I know it works. I have been looking for a product to use around the eyes and was very pleased when OZ Naturals offered me a coupon to try this product with option to review. In all honesty I really love it! There is no scent, it has a gel- consistency which prevents wasting and is easy to apply. I do not have dark circles under the eyes and can not address this issue personally but recommend reading other reviews for their results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another important ingredient is &amp;#34;plant stem cells&amp;#34; which are usually harvested from plants grown in labs. I know that the purpose of plant stem cells is to help renew tissue and regenerate growth of plant cells which means they will likely provide some similar benefit to living human skin cells. Other beneficial ingredients in this product are: various amino acids which are the building blocks of proteins and therefore will assist in repairing tissue and smooth the skin. Vitamin E is included which is an antioxidant. There are several other organic plant ingredients: periwinkle, licorice, eye bright, reishi, frankincense and gotu kola which anyone can research on-line to see what benefits they provide.

            <li> Amazing! I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in my skin. I&#x27;ve always had &amp;#34;sunken&amp;#34; eyes because of my bone structure and I inherited my mother&#x27;s dark circles and puffiness. Even as young as middle school I was called a &amp;#34;raccoon&amp;#34; and teased about the darkness under my eyes. Honestly, I love my big brown eyes but I&#x27;d do anything to get rid of the darkness underneath!  I am now in my early 20&#x27;s, I almost always get 9 hours of sleep, drink a lot of water, and eat somewhat healthy so I know that these stressors do not cause my under eye problems, it&#x27;s all natural. So what better to treat my problem WITH something natural?! I love the idea of putting plant stem cells on my face... Anything less than organic/natural will never work for me.  I&#x27;ve been using this product not only underneath my eyes, but on the creases around my mouth and forehead. I have yet to notice a change in the color under my eyes but allover my skin feels soft and radiant. Someone even told me I was glowing! Time and diligence with this product will prove to be more effective. After all, it&#x27;s only been a week!  I take my skin seriously... I doubt these results are psychological or a placebo effect, the results are real! I can&#x27;t wait to try all of the products that OZ Naturals offers :)</li>
            <li> I see some results from using the eye gel. I would recommend it</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping with my aging eyes!</li>
            <li> This product really seemed to keep the puffiness at bay. The texture is very creamy and rich, the scent is very neutral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product in return of my HONEST review.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m starting to see a difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks now, every night. I like the way it feels. I don&#x27;t notice any real difference yet but has only been a short time</li>
            <li> The Best Eye Gel it works, I have been using this product for 2 months now. So far I see good results. THANKS its a life saver, HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> I am a 59 year old male with dark rings below my eyes, and I purchased this product to try to mitigate this effect of aging on my body. I used this product for four weeks. I only applied the product around my right eye and surrounding area. I also took before treatment and after treatment pictures.  After four weeks of treatment, I noticed no difference in the mirror.  I noticed no difference in the before and after photos.  After the four weeks, I told my girlfriend, that I had been doing &amp;#34;treatments&amp;#34; on one side of my face and asked her if she noticed any difference in how I looked (comparing one side of my face to the other), and she did not notice any.  I then asked her to focus on the area surrounding my eyes, and look for any difference.  And again, she did not notice any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not like getting older any more than the next person and this was the first time that I tried a product that promised to slow down the visible effects of aging.  I had some hopes regarding the other reviews that I had read before purchasing the product.  I do have to say that it did not have any effect on my appearance over the four weeks that I tried using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best advice is to not waste your money, time, or hope on this product.</li>
            <li> Made my skin red and itchy</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this product. It dried my skin out &amp; made me look even older. I stayed with it for 2 weeks before I thew it away.</li>
            <li> This eye cream has made a difference in the dark circles under my eyes. You can see the gradual change over time. I have sensitive skin, but this product had no sting, light texture, and I saw a difference in two weeks.</li>
            <li> I had noticed the difference over time, but it wasn&#x27;t until I saw some people who I hadn&#x27;t seen me in a while that I realized how much better I looked.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the eye gel for a few weeks now and have received compliments on how rested I look. My eye puffiness and dark circles are greatly improved. I think that with continued use, they will be gone.  I am very satisfied with the results...am looking forward to continuing and seeing even better results</li>
            <li> This product worked amazing. I was expecting a bigger size but was extremely happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I like this eye gel a lot.It absorbs quickly and have a very light refreshing cucumber scent. The lines around my eyes seems less noticable and also reduces puffiness under my eyes.My skin feels well hydrated yet not greasy. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product,so far is the best one I have ever used. Thanks OZ Naturals!</li>
            <li> I love OZ Naturals Eye Gel !  I have used many eye creams ( high end and low end brands) and nothing compares to this eye gel.refreshed after . I dab a little bit around both of my eyes during my morning and before bed routine and the skin around my eyes looks refreshed and it definitely has helped with my usual puffiness and dark circles.  I have recommended this product to many of my friends and co-workers.  **I received free product to give my honest opinion.**</li>
            <li> Burns! Terrible redness and the burning just killed my undereye. Terrible product. Just awful</li>
            <li> This is the best eye gel I&#x27;ve ever used. I saw immediate results and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Really &amp;#34;wakes up&amp;#34; my eyes in the morning. Have noticed some decrease in under eye puffiness.</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s rid of my puffy eyes somewhat.</li>
            <li> Just arrived. Smells great. Feels good. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> There genuinely does seem to be improvement in under eye wrinkles but not much for the dark circles. Honestly this product is too expensive for the minimal results it provides. Oil of Olay provides the same results for less price.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  I look less like a mummy now.  Rwaaaar.  Seriously though.  It works very well.</li>
            <li> It does not seem to do much for me, time will tell, but I have been using for 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product! It doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I apply the gel on the eye circles daily for a month, but not happy with the result.  So I use it as lotion for my hands.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is simply amazing! It covers up my dark circles so well and helps a lot with wrinkles and puffiness. It works fine with make up also. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> My wife and I have only been using it a few days. Our facial care regimen is very basic. Baking soda paste to wash, alpha hydroxy 8% moisturizer daily and retin-A a couple of time a week with regular use of sunscreen. We&#x27;ll see if this gives any additional benefit.</li>
            <li> Immediate tightening, absorbs quick, &amp;amp; I love the new pump tube!</li>
            <li> Works great at tightening up the eyes but not so great at removing dark circles around the eyes. Still very good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month. I didn&#x27;t want to write a review until I had actually been using it for awhile. The scent is amazing, like a very soft floral fragrance. The first few nights I used it it did sort of sting, not bad, but I could tell I was a bit sensitive. That didn&#x27;t last past just a couple of uses though. I&#x27;m very impressed with this product overall. I don&#x27;t see huge changes, but my under eyes are not as dark when I wake up anymore. And they are only puffy now if I have not gotten a full nights sleep, unlike before I started using it they were puffy regardless. I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> In fairness, I have only used the product for three days.&lt;br /&gt;I will post a follow-up after 30 days.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand. What are you trying to do? Or maybe I do!  Never bought ANYTHING from OZ Naturals. Always believed you are trying to capitalize on Dr Oz&#x27;s name. There have been warnings about this kind; insinuating that Dr. Oz is advertizing products that sound like he is endorsing that product</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all for me. The gel doesn&#x27;t absorb to your skin as you would like. I found that you can only wear this product at night because you see the gel under makeup and makes it look even drier. I wore it every night for a month and did not see any difference.</li>
            <li> When I used this product it caused the skin under my eyes to crepe. It looked like I had dirt in the lines of my skin.... Scary, I&#x27;ll never by this product again.</li>
            <li> This eye gel is fantastic! It goes on so smoothly, dries quickly, and works wonders! I have been dabbing a small amount of the clear gel under my eyes before bed each night, and when I wake up the skin under my eyes looks smooth, refreshed, with no dark circles and less puffiness.  Plus, I can tell it&#x27;s definitely working on smoothing out those pesky crows feet!  This eye gel is gentle but potent!  My only complaint is the smell - it has a very strong smell initially.  It reminded me of cucumbers, so it could be quite pleasant to some.  Either way, it does dissipate very quickly, so it&#x27;s really a non issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I was provided this eye gel free of cost for my 100% honest opinion.  Receiving this product did not sway my thoughts on it one way or another.</li>
            <li> Results were none existentant.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have dark circles under my eyes and after reading the reviews of this product I was excited to try it. So far I&#x27;ve been using the product for almost 2 weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. The dark circles haven&#x27;t gone down or gotten lighter. Doesn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
            <li> This gel works on my dark circles. I will definitely try their other products even it costs a lot for me.  I&#x27;m from the Philippines</li>
            <li> my black cycles are still on my face for two weeks</li>
            <li> This  product works!!!  The lines, dark circles and puffiness  with my eyes  have lessen inthe two weeks  I have  used the product. Definitely will be repurchasing .</li>
            <li> This really does make a difference in the puffiness...haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference in the dark circles but concealer fixes those..</li>
            <li> I have seen some improvement in fine lines around the eye area.  I apply it all over the face and it leaves my skin soft and dewy.</li>
            <li> This is okay.  I have stopped using it as it is to greasy.</li>
            <li> She loves it and says it helps the wrinkles around her eyes and I agree so perhaps I will use it also,</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;ve only used it for about a week, and my fine lines(not that I had many to begin with) have all but disappeared. My eyes look more awake! Four stars instead of five because it&#x27;s done nothing for my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a short time. So far no new results to report.</li>
            <li> It has taken some time, but my dark circles have gotten lighter. Great product and I love the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this a few months and have been onward with the results.  A little goes a long way.  I use it under my eyes and on my eye lids.  I love the feeling when it&#x27;s drying you can almost feel it firming up the eye area!  I also really love that it has a cooling feeling.</li>
            <li> Very good. Thank goodness I am not allergy to it like the rest of Dr Oz products.</li>
            <li> It has helped but not as I expected. But maybe with note use.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best eye creams I&#x27;ve ever used. Very light, yet extremely effective. Does everything it says it does. Better then all the other expensive department store products I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Bought March 2015.  Product expired February 2015.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for it much</li>
            <li> Kind of sticky once it&#x27;s on. I have relatively young skin so I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet but I&#x27;m hoping this will help prevent them.</li>
            <li> I’ve used other eyelid moisturizers before but have had problems with them: I’ve either had to apply too much gel or I’ve had mildly allergic reactions to them once applied.  The Super Youth Eye Gel is a find!  I’ve had neither of these problems with it and although with 78-year-old eyelids, I still have my share of wrinkles and bags, using the Super Youth Eye Gel, they seem minimized and my lids feel soft. If I don’t look young, I do look younger.&lt;br /&gt;How much gel does it take? A tiny dab on one finger applied around each eye does it. I can’t judge comparative cost on the basis of two weeks’ use but I suspect that this gel will end up costing less than the product I most recently used and discarded.</li>

            <li> THIS IS TOO GOOD A PRODUCT. MY DARK CIRCLES, PUFFINESS BELOW HAVE REDUCED CONSIDERABLY. BEST EYE CARE PRODUCT USED SO FAR!!</li>
            <li> I think this works.  I use it only at night.</li>
            <li> Love the Oz Naturals review product for free program! Tried the eye serum this time. I&#x27;m very happy with it so far. Been using it about a week now. Love how it tightens the skin around the eyes without drying. The puffiness under my eyes has disappeared. Can&#x27;t wait to try more wonderful products from Oz Naturals.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product.  It may work for some but it did not help me.  I will not purchase it again.  I much prefer Smart Fix Smart Eye for myself.</li>
            <li> My biggest aging issues are my eyes. I&#x27;m actually pretty lucky in the genetics department, but when it rains, it pours. I get both dark circles AND eye bags, plus lines in the corners. So the OZ Naturals Eye Gel caught my attention, because it handles ALL of that. I normally use two different products, so I gave it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels SO soothing when I apply it...I can practically feel the puffiness going down. I can certainly see it...I had bright eyes after about ten minutes. The dark circles were still there, but I wanted to give it a good test, so I kept using it. After a week, I saw the circles fading, and after two, they were almost completely gone. It doesn&#x27;t take much to apply, either, so it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides working wonderfully and feeling fabulous, it&#x27;s also vegan, 100% natural and 75% organic. So it&#x27;s good for your mind and conscience as well. This gel is a new fave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received product for review purposes. My opinions and comfy eyes are my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice a day since February and haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my dark circles, lines, or puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this products and the whole OZ naturals line! Please check out my full review here on YouTube! Click on this link:[...]</li>
            <li> Little did I know that I am allergic to something in this eye gel.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this and was EXTREMELY pleased with it being so natural! However, it did nothing for my dark circles and thats the only reason I bought it. I cant comment on wrinkles or anything. I bought it after i read there was a 90 day guarantee but after seeing no change after a little over a month, I wanted to return it, but was told it was too late...I was over the 30 days. I wrote to Amazon and they took care of it for me. I hope this works for others, but it just didnt for me. too bad.</li>
            <li> Honestly, do not see much of a difference. Maybe my eyes do not look as bad as I thought it did for being a FTM. I&#x27;ve been using this product consecutively for months now. I suggest taking a photo of yourself for a before and after to compare because I honestly can not tell the difference. I will continue to use until the product is empty. On average, I do like that it&#x27;s a gel. I apply it onto my forehead as well as my neck. This product goes a long way. I just turned 28 years old and have a one year old.</li>
            <li> Whenever I wake up, no matter how long I slept, my undereyes are sunken in and dark and the lids are puffy and red, so I have to wake up really early to try to increase the circulation and let the darkness fade and cover it with makeup before I go! But since using this, the puffy eyelids have decreased significantly and the lower eyelids are less sunken in. There&#x27;s still some darkness, which is hereditary, but it&#x27;s easier to cover with minimal concealer and I don&#x27;t look like a zombie if I go without makeup. I always recommend using an organic/natural product around the eyes because the skin is so thin and you never want to risk any alcohol, fragrance, or other questionable ingredients that will give you wrinkles in the long run. I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> Feels nice and cool around the eyes.  I have noticed a definite improvement around my eyes...less lines and a lightening of dark circles.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and the astringent together, used both of them twice a day for about three months and i have seen absolutely no results. I even took a before photo to monitor my problem areas. I&#x27;m sorry to say but i was fooled by all those who were bribed to write a good review.</li>
            <li> I am 32 years old and already have crows feet and dark circles under my eyes. I purchased this cream after having my 2nd child, knowing I would need something that really worked. Let&#x27;s just say I cannot live without this product. It really has transformed the look of my crows feet and dark circles. I give 4 stars because they are not completely gone, but are noticeably better.</li>
            <li> This was bought for me from my wishlist. I used it for two months and didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all. I used it morning and night until the whole bottle was gone. Worthless. Waste of money</li>
            <li> Product worked well.Tried others but this seemed to be the best ...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see It do anything I still see darkness under my eyes !</li>
            <li> This is amazing. Relieves your eyes immediately.  I have very sensitive skin. When I applied this... I instantly wanted to use it all over my face. On the bottle it states that you. So, if you want just do it. Lol.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this a few days ago and have been using it for a few days. It feels really, really good on my baggy eyes and that is a plus. It is soothing and somehow comforting. I like using it. Quite honestly, I have not seen a difference yet but I think it is way too soon. I will keep on using this product and add to my review at a later date. But for now I can say that I do like the product and am hopeful for some nice results.</li>
            <li> This has a nice consistency and moisturizers quite well. I&#x27;m looking for the holy grail of eye creams and this isn&#x27;t it but if you only need a moisturizing eye cream it&#x27;s a nice product for a decent price.</li>
            <li> First time using this product and so far I love it! You can actually use this anywhere on your face, it has a light, pleasant, cucumber scent, and feels cooling on the skin.</li>
            <li> I was an esthetician for over 4 years and have used my fair share of high end products (innovative skincare, skin ceuticals, pca, etc.).  I was a little skeptical at first, but just decided to give it a shot and I am so glad I did because this stuff great!  I use it all over my face and see wonderful results.  Highly recommended by someone who doesn&#x27;t waste time on a bunch of crappy products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure about this product.  I have been using it for over a month now and do not see a difference.</li>
            <li> Love that its a clean approach to puffiness. My eyes look brighter and more alive when I use this. Wish it came in a bigger bottle. Appreciate the price, though.</li>
            <li> She states her dark circles disappeared after using.</li>
            <li> I admit, I tried many regiments before and was skeptical that anything could produce such results as they claimed.  I purchased this product about 3 wks ago and have been using it daily.  I bought the OZ line of the vitamin C serum, eye gel, retinol moisturizer, and spray toner.  I have been using all 4 of these products as part of my morning and nighttime cleansing ritual. In just this short time, I have gotten noticeable results.  I am  41 years old with combination normal/oily skin and uneven skin tones.  I had horrible blackheads on my nose and forehead which have drastically shrunk in size and my face looks great!  The dark rings under my eyes have faded a lot, my uneven tones are starting to even out and I am happier than I thought I would be.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what my skin looks like in another 3 wks.  I have tried others and noticed they caused stinging or burning - I thought that meant they are working and was I wrong!  This didn&#x27;t cause stinging and actually felt great!  What impressed me the most was the follow up email I received from the selling company OZ!  they emailed me with directions for use, what to expect, and gave me their contact information.  I mean, what company does that these days?  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love OZ Eye Cream for Dark Circles! I was using a nationally known and expensive eye cream, but still had dark circles. I decided to give this brand a try. I was amazed at the improvement in just a day or two. It has worked consistently on my dark circles, made worse by allergies and bone structure. I use it each day, and feel much happier when I look in the mirror and do not see those dark circles. What can one say, it works.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few weeks. I have tried it with make up and without makeup. There was minimal change. So much so that neither I or my husband could tell a difference. Paired with makeup I did feel like there was a slight difference compared to my previous usage of the makeup alone.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!! My dark circles have noticeably diminished. Not gone, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle  :)</li>
            <li> This eye gel works pretty good! I have been using it now for a few weeks and my eyes are looking fresh and rested and my bags are hardly noticeable anymore! I was given this eye gel from Oz Naturals for testing purposes to try and review on my blog and it&#x27;s wonderful! I&#x27;m liking the results I&#x27;m seeing in just a few weeks! I can&#x27;t wait to see when the bottle is gone!</li>
            <li> The eye-cream did not cause any reaction, which is really important to me when picking any kind of cream, especially products I use on my face. I have sensitive skin that tends to react to over-perfumed products.&lt;br /&gt;The eye-cream is aimed at dark circles, wrinkles and puffiness around the eyes. My review is based on daily usage over a period of a month.&lt;br /&gt;Whilst the effect on the wrinkles is minimal as yet, although certainly noticeable, the real eye-opener has been the dark circles and puffiness. I get very dark circles under my eyes and am very fair skinned, so concealer is a must. I have found that the cream refreshes the skin to such a extent that I am using less concealer, because the dark circles are improving or appear less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an easy to use dispenser, so you are really only using a drop each time, which means no wasted product and no mess like other tubes. It has no odour, which I personally prefer, so it doesn&#x27;t sting the eye. Most noticeable is the the way the cream cools the skin and it turn that cooling action helps reduce puffiness. Most of the creams I have used do not have what I call &#x27;a cucumber action or feeling&#x27; to them, so this certainly is one of the most positive elements of the cream.&lt;br /&gt;It has a gel like texture but isn&#x27;t sticky.&lt;br /&gt;After I had been using it for a few weeks one of my adult daughters asked to try it out (she is 23), and she is so pleased with the results she has already said she will be buying her own bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I have been very pleased with this products and the results.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free review sample of this product courtesy of OZ naturals.</li>
            <li> Really lightened the dark circles under my eyes!!</li>
            <li> I have lived in very sunny places for over 30 years which translates to many little wrinkles around my eyes. Laughing has contributed to that too! As luck would have it, I came across this little gem.  The texture of the gel is silky. I had extra so I put some on the rest of my face. Within 3 days I could see a difference. The lines don&#x27;t appear as deep and the areas where I have applied it in addition to my eyes are looking great! I honestly can&#x27;t say enough great things about the Eye Gel. I also love that OZ Naturals does not test on animals (yay!!!) Do yourself a favor and order some.</li>
            <li> This eye gel works fantastic to reduce puffiness and dark circles.  The bags under my eyes in the morning were getting so bad and everything I tried wasn&#x27;t helping.  I noticed a dramatic difference in the first few applications.  We were out of state visiting family, and they all wanted to know what I was using.  I started using it before I went to bed and now wake up bag free.  Because I was so impressed with how well this worked, I purchased other Oz Naturals products and have been very pleased with them as well.  Great products and great price!</li>
            <li> I have noticed some fine lines around my eyes now that I am in my 30&#x27;s.  What do you use to help get rid of these?  I think that young looking skin, and eyes are important.  OZ Naturals offers a Super Youth Eye Gel.  This is a great product diminish the signs of aging around your eyes.  The product is made to be used on the sensitive skin around the eye area.  I really like that this can be used to help dark circles too.  I love how easy the product is to use too.  You just dab a small amount around the eye area.  This can also be used all over your face under makeup.  It is great to use on fine lines around your mouth or forehead.  free sample provided for blog review</li>
            <li> Bought this based on being a top seller. I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the fact that it&#x27;s a gel and not a cream. Really don&#x27;t like the gel texture. But think it works? The verdict is still out. Give it 3 stars based on what I&#x27;ve seen/experienced so far.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for the night time as it might leave a little sticky film feeling, i wouldn&#x27;t recommend to use it before make up. I have been using it for a while and while I don&#x27;t see huge significant changes, it is a decent cream.</li>
            <li> No noticeable changes in my dark circles unfortunately..... i bought it twice just to give the product time to work. On to something new.</li>
            <li> I have dark Circles and it did NOT work at all for me. You can feel it firming around your eyes which is great but no difference with the dark circles</li>
            <li> Feel a small tightening effect when applied.  Still to soon to see true results.  Will write another review in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Its&#x27; a good eye cream, but not better than some brands I&#x27;ve tried that were more expensive.  This is a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> After using an entire bottle, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have done anything. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Smells good, goes on light and helps reduce puffiness and a little goes a long way.  I have seen a lot of improvement.  My bags are less pronounced and not as dark as before.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a about a week--the puffiness is definitely better. I still have some dark circles but I think over time this will improve. I would buy again!</li>
            <li> This feels real nice as it absorbs into the skin around my eyes. Not sticky or oily. Just started using it, so don&#x27;t know yet what the long term will be as far as smoothing, tightening, lightening...? But as far as daily use goes... I like it!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this eye gel. It glides on my skin nice and smooth and my skin soaks it up right away. For being a gel I was worried it would be too heavy or greasy but it&#x27;s not at all. It feels amazing on my skin and dries quickly so hair don&#x27;t have to worry about it rubbing off on my pillow when I go to bed at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the few weeks that I have used it, my eyes look more awake and my skin looks more supple and my crows feet seem to be a bit less pronounced as well. I feel like this is a really amazing eye gel perfect for any skin type and I plan on purchasing this product again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product for the purpose of review. However all thoughts and opinions expressed are solely my own.</li>
            <li> Does not do anything for dark circles.  It Does hydrate.</li>
            <li> did not do as it promised...</li>
            <li> I am amazed how many people rave about this gel because it doesn&#x27;t do anything at all for me for some reason</li>
            <li> Feels very refreshing. Works a little to reduce puffy eyes. Does leave a smooth feeling and great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Tried this eye gel after reading all the amazing reviews. I was having a real problem with very dark under-eye circles that I couldn&#x27;t even cover with concealor + foundation + powder. It didn&#x27;t matter what I did, how much I slept, or what I put on to hide them, I still constantly looked exhausted, unhealthy, and much older than I wanted to look. So I tried this eye gel and within a week, I looked significantly better. The dark circles are so much improved, now it just takes a bit of concealor and I&#x27;m out the door, looking 5-10 years younger than I did before. Plus, although I didn&#x27;t expect this and didn&#x27;t think it was a problem I had yet, my skin is much more firm. I&#x27;ve even been putting the gel on the furrows I was getting between my eyebrows (which were beginning to show even when I wasn&#x27;t actually furrowing) and on my naso-labial lines, which I had begun to notice but didn&#x27;t think were too bad. Now my brow is unfurrowed (unless I&#x27;m purposefully furrowing) and the naso-labial lines are essentially gone. I&#x27;ve spent a bundle trying many other eye creams and such to help the dark circles (and the few fine (hopefully) lines I had under my eyes as well) and this eye gel not only did that but helped the skin all over my face, and for such a great price! I think, considering the cost, you&#x27;re nuts if you have these issues and don&#x27;t give this eye gel a try. It&#x27;s truly amazing. Plus it&#x27;s guaranteed to work, which makes it an even better deal!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month now. I do not have under eye circles so I cannot say how well it works on those, but it does make my eyes look more refreshed. I was given this product for a review.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 weeks now and although my dark circles are not completely gone my husband and I notice I am much brighter around the eyes and lines are less noticeable. I have used eye products before for 2 months and never saw the slightest results, however with OZ Naturals I can see the product working and that makes the investment well worth it. Thank you OZ Naturals.</li>
            <li> I tried the Oz naturals, vit.c amniotic blend hyaluronic acid, I like it and would love some free products!</li>
            <li> I was actually bought this as part of a christmas present from my daughter-in-law . I have now been using oz for about 3 weeks &amp; I have used religiously night &amp; morning &amp; have seen a significant improvement in my eye condition . The bags under my eyes have almost gone and I am sure the crows feet have really softened . I also hade used the gel down the sides of my nose , laughter lines I suppose , I think this is where I have seen the most improvement in the condition of my skin .&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use oz products , the eye gel feels so lovely and soft and dries very quickly .&lt;br /&gt;Thanks oz</li>
            <li> It smells and feels good on my skin  but no visible results after using it for almost a month. I am returning this eye gel.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best eye cream I have ever purchased! My look young, alert and my skin is super hydrated!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough if this product. So lucky I came across it.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Feels super moist on my eyes after using it. Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky AT ALL which I had the most problem with a lot of other eye gel products.</li>
            <li> I am really in love with this brand.  I am a picky, 42, smoker (unfortunately).  I&#x27;ve been using the products for a month with my Clarisonic and really do see that my skin has brightened.  My sun spots have faded, too.  They are still there, but truly faded.  I love actually being about the recommend a brand!</li>
            <li> I was a bit dubious at first.  It has a gel consistency and seemed to light a texture to do much.  Boy, was I wrong.  This stuff almost immediately refreshed the skin around my eyes, and a week into using it the dark circles were considerably lighter!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product works great - helped with the dark rings under my eyes.  Common sense - you can&#x27;t burn the candle at both ends and expect this product to fix it - but for allergy shiners and folks with dark circles under the eyes - this product for me really seems to work!  I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> This gel gave me an eye allergy, which is really weird since I have never had any problems with any products before. This was the first item that gave me any difficulties.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on in the evening and on the first day, it made my eyes look funny. Sure, they got &amp;#34;tighter&amp;#34;, but it looked extremely unnatural as if my eyes were pinched closed. I tried it again and after the second day, there was a noticeable swelling on my left upper eyelid. It got worse the third day. It was so puffy that my eyelids disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, ceasing use of the product returned my eyelids to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product. Many of the reviews here were from people who were given the product for free.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this eye cream.  Will reorder again.</li>
            <li> Amazing Eye Gel.  Helping to hydrate my eyes and making me look younger.</li>
            <li> I saw some visible results less puffy eyes. No matter how much sleep I got, drank gallons of water, eat clean healthy food ... couldn&#x27;t get rid of under eye bags. Using this gel for a week showed visible improvement. Hopefully thing will improve further.</li>
            <li> Definitely helped with fine lines! My skin is very sensitive and I&#x27;ve had no allegeric or negative reactions to this product. Only complaint is that I haven&#x27;t seen reduction of dark circles. Good moisturizer otherwise.</li>
            <li> Came in a smaller bottle than I expected, but it&#x27;s fine. It felt really light and refreshing when I applied it under my eyes. It has only been about a week yet I&#x27;ve seen significant improvement with my dark eye circles due to lack of sleep. I really do recommend this! (Small and handy, easy to carry around even when travelling.)</li>
            <li> I just starting using, to soon to know if the product works.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Is not a &#x27;miracle&#x27; by any stretch, but it works well enough for aging (old) skin.</li>
            <li> I have really bad dark circles under the eye and this product really helped in just 2 days I could tell a difference. Then I decided to try it on my entire face. My pores shrunk and my skin was radiant. Definitely will be buying this from now on.</li>
            <li> This took me a long time to appreciate. I saw NO results initially. Now, I use it with another cream (any probably) because it is a gel and soaks right in and so it did not seem to work by itself. Now, I use with a cream and it seems to be having miraculous results. I know it is this stuff, because my cream has changed several times; this is the only constant. I use it at least once a day an have noticed a difference in my eye wrinkles! It has been MONTHS since I started using it. I am still on the same container of it-glad it lasts!!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for about a week now and I like this product.  It seems to reduce puffiness in the mornings.  I have not noticed it has done anything for dark circles though but maybe that will come later.  Overall good product!</li>
            <li> I see no effect on my bags under the eyes.</li>
            <li> Love this product! My eyes look brighter and dark circles are going  away! Finally,  something that works!!</li>
            <li> Honestly cannot say enough good things about this amazing product. So happy to have found OZ Naturals and am excited to try the many other products which the company offers! Finally, products that actually WORK and that benefit your skin.... :)</li>
            <li> Have only been using a couple of weeks.  Like to give products at least 30 days. Too early to tell, but am hopeful.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. When I run out is when I really know.  Immediately my eyes are puffier and wrinkles more apparent.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for about 3 weeks now, I think its the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  The puffiness hasn&#x27;t gone completely but I think 1 month is a good marker of a ptoducts efficiency.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 9 days...no noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> This product really does seem to calm down the area below my eyes--helps with pugffiness and with darkening.</li>
            <li> Oz naturals is one if my preferred brand in skincare. They have a wide variety of products pertaining to every skin care needs. This eye gel is no less in its functions.&lt;br /&gt;This is said to be one of the best eye gels that is out there in the market. It really works efficiently. I can see the difference and puffiness reduced in just about a week. It is not greasy or runny so its not uncomfortable to apply and sleep overnight.&lt;br /&gt;It is safe for all skin types. infact it is so mild that you can apply all over your face to keep it moisturized. I was lucky to get this product during promotion but my opinions are unbiased.</li>
            <li> Have been using for about three weeks now.  No significant change but will keep using and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> It is for real. Good product.</li>
            <li> does not help dark circles or puffiness</li>
            <li> I am 64 ! My wrinkles r nonexistent !</li>
            <li> Really nice product; feels cool and refreshing and doesn&#x27;t bother my very sensitive eyes.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Within just a few days of beginning use of this product I noticed a difference.  Bags were almost gone, discoloration had lightened and my eyes looked overall bigger as the puffiness went away.  I use this prior to moisturizing the rest of my face.  There is no greasy or gross residue left after drying.  I would definitely refer anyone with puffiness or dark circles to try this product.</li>
            <li> So far this gel has been a great buy. the smallest amount equals a lot of coverage, and It&#x27;s easy to apply. I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars yet as I&#x27;ve just begun using it and will have to wait and see the results. It does feel good on-- not too heavy and seems to make the skin under my eyes brighter.</li>
            <li> My eyes always look tired. I have horrible dark circles and fine lines under neath my eyes. I have tried so many products, serums, eye gel etc but nothing seems to work. This product is amazing and start showing result after 3-5 uses. I apply this gel underneath my eyes daily. Just want to mention this is a gel not a serum or  a lotion so it will not absorb as quickly as lotion or serum do. It have noticed big difference in my dark circles and my eyes look much better and less tired. Another important thing is you should take enough sleep so see noticeable change in your eyes. I really like this eye gel. It works great on my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% satisfied with this eye gel. I would highly recommend it. I received this eye gel in exchange of my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for last 2 weeks and so far I like it. It does help with my under eye darkness and bagginess in the morning. I use just a tiny drop of it and dab under the eyes and let it dry which takes like a minute. My makeup goes on fine on top of it and I don&#x27;t know if it is placebo but it makes me feel refreshed in the morning.</li>
            <li> I was really happy to receive this product free to review! I absolutely LOVE that this eye gel is cruelty free. I find myself gravitate towards those types of products more and more recently. I love the pump it has since a lot of eye gels or creams have a dropper lately and things can get a bit messy. This is not like that. Its very easy to use and gives you just the right amount of product needed for each use. The last eye gel I tested smelled like cucumber, this one however, does not. It has a fresh aloe smell but that&#x27;s it and I love that! Its not tacky once applied either. It goes on smoothly and sinks into the skin fast. They do not have a lot of additives in their product and it makes me feel safe to use it! I see a huge decrease in my eye puffiness which is one of the worst things about my eyes. My dark circles have changed to a lighter shade. They are no longer black and green. I also like that this product was made in the USA in an advanced FDA certified facility. It makes you know the products you are putting on your face are safe and have followed every USA and FDA guideline so there are no hidden ingredients.</li>
            <li> This goes on really smooth.  The gel feels light and cool.  It&#x27;s been a couple weeks and I think I am noticing an improvement in circles and puffiness, but not wrinkles yet.  You have to be careful pumping it out as it will squirt out much more than you need.  I think I have noticed that the sides of my outer eyes near my cheeks is getting drier.  I&#x27;ve started using more moisturizer there to counter-balance it.</li>
            <li> I like that it is organic.  It has helped reduce undereye swelling and dropping lids.You don&#x27;t have to spend a fortune to get great results.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel. You do not need much at all. It absorbed into my skin very well. I just gently patted the gel around my eyes. It felt cool and refreshing. I have only been using it a week but I like it so far. I do not notice any scent and it feels gentle. It is a clear gel and comes in a small bottle. It is a pump dispenser, which I really like. I was thrilled to get the opportunity to try this product for quality and testing purposes. However, I do not have to give a positive review and I would not if I did not like this eye gel. I have only been using it a week and so far, I like it. I am hoping to see more benefits as I use it longer. I like that this product is all natural. It is non greasy and absorbs quickly into my skin. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product from a customer’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> Cheap...but don&#x27;t  believe the hype!!!! The seller describes it as &amp;#34; The Best Eye Gel&amp;#34; Spend a little more go to the drugstore and you will be much happier than if you waste your money on this product and the shipping costs.</li>
            <li> This does nothing for my dark circle (I have one only haha).  I&#x27;m not sure if it improves the wrinkles.  But I do feel like it improves the texture of the area and it makes it feel great and soothed.  It is good for puffiness.  I enjoy the experience of putting it on and its great under make up.</li>
            <li> I like amazon and OZ Naturals ,,&lt;br /&gt;I always see Amazon،</li>
            <li> I use this around my eyes and have seen slight changes in puffiness and dark circles, mine are genetic so I didn&#x27;t expect them to completely disappear. The biggest reason I love this product is that it is a PERFECT moisturizer for around my eyes. I used to use expensive eye cream and would always get little whiteheads under my eyes, or it would melt down and cause me to break out on my cheeks. I have been using this for over a month straight now and I only have good things to say. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I literately must be new to the good eye gel market, or this product is really awesome. Who am I kidding its the later I love researching eye creams because at the ripe old age of 28 my vanity and waning youth is starting to weigh heavily... especially on my dark circles. It is called the best for a reason. It leaves my under eyes feeling tight post use, and that means its working.</li>
            <li> Same as my review for the SANO EYE CREAM. Waste of time unless you want to receive and be billed for stuff you do not want.</li>
            <li> I like OZ Naturals eye cream.  I see a difference in my skin around the eye area in terms of wrinkles and puffiness.  The dark circles under my eyes don&#x27;t seem to be as dark as they were before beginning my OZ Naturals daily regimen.</li>
            <li> ][ASIN:B00GYF65TK OZNaturals Eye Gel - Eye Cream For Dark Circles, Puffiness, Wrinkles - This Anti Wrinkle Eye Gel Was Voted ALLURE MAGAZINE&#x27;S Best In Beauty - The Most Effective Anti Aging Eye Cream Available!]]I am a firm believer in OZNaturals Eye Gel - so much so that I have put this product on my monthly subscription list so I never run out! It is truly effective in delivering results for dark circles and that sunken look under my eyes. I have had 3 sinus surgeries and have purple discoloring under my eyes. It effectively helps to reduce the discoloring and plump up that area. I also travel a lot and take this product with me on the planes to put it around my eyes so they look bright and lively - not sunken and dark, which was the case prior to using the product flying. I will also use it throughout the day if I think I need a little boost. I just love OZNaturals Eye Gel and will not be without it.</li>
            <li> Really saw no difference after use.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews of this eye gel I was expecting miraculous results. I have been using this for about two months now and really don&#x27;t see any crazy changes in my skin. I am 29 years old, fair skinned, and have dark/purple discoloration under my eyes. I also have pretty dry skin all around my eyes. The gel has really improved the overall texture of my skin and made little creases less noticeable. Very happy with that. However, I dont notice any difference in the color of my under-eyes. I will buy it again, but if you are thinking of getting this to lighten the color of your under-eye region, I would say pass.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Very nice!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye gel once a day for a little over a month now. Some of the reviews said they used it twice per day, but I can&#x27;t imagine how one can use this except at night. The consistency is like one of those old peel-off masks. It&#x27;s very slimy and very wet-looking. It smells like cucumbers, though, which is nice. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve noticed absolutely no difference in my under-eye circles, surrounding wrinkles, or puffiness. I wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and certain ingredients will cause me to break out or develop a rash. I developed a horrible rash with this product and so my dark circles persist. Hope someone else has better results.</li>
            <li> I really love this eye gel. It provides great moisture and makes my eyes look less wrinkled.</li>
            <li> It is so neat and light. It is absorbed quickly into the skin.</li>
