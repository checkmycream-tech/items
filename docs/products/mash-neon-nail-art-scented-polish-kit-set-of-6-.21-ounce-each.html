            <li>But still good</li>
            <li>They are so very cute.  </li>
            <li>and i stumbled across ths polish &amp; Love it!</li>
            <li>Since my skin looks better with warm colors, I wasn&#x27;t sure about it.  </li>

            <li>Over all I am pleased with this purchase and would buy again.</li>
            <li>so I used one coat of that on top just before my top coat</li>
            <li>but u can build them up so that ok</li>
            <li>they are in smaller bottles but are a perfect size to try out.</li>
            <li>so make sure u check the size before u complain about ths product.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S OK</li>
            <li>A great Christmas present, easy shoping Grandaughter loved it.</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;re perfect because polish always has a tendency to dry up on me before I use it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The HD kinda of changes color depending on the light it&#x27;s viewed in, which I really love.  </li>
            <li>the color chips off easily but your nails smell like the color you choose.</li>
            <li>did my manicure yesterday with the blue color - very bright and very much a cool type of color.  </li>
            <li>THE POLISH SMELLS GREAT NICE GIFT FOR LITTLE GIRLS WHEN POLISH DRIES</li>
            <li>Smells SO yummy, great brushes, good colors, not cheap like I would have assumed, they&#x27;re pretty opaque after two coats.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get these.  </li>
            <li>It is really cool.</li>
            <li>as far as the scent they just smell like super potent nail polish.</li>
            <li>The bright colors are fairly opaque with two coats, with the exception of the blue and green.  </li>
            <li>These are kind of sheer polishes</li>
            <li>These were fun to use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just right for them</li>
            <li>Also, the colors are very vibrant!</li>
            <li>Amazingly, they are scented after they dry.  </li>
            <li>The colors are fun and look fantastic with only 2 coats!</li>
            <li>The brushes are the normal nail polish brushes, thank goodness.  </li>
            <li>These are cute, but they came in a package with VERY little padding and 2 of the bottles exploded.</li>
            <li>I just love these I recommend them for anyone.the bottles are small but</li>
            <li>All of them smell exactly like they&#x27;re supposed to, except the blue which is supposed to be fruit punch.</li>
            <li>These polishes are the same pretty colors you see in the picture.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the scents.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it for young girls or teens as I bought this for my 11 year old daughter</li>
            <li>They are small but thats fine</li>
            <li>These are mini bottles, but still large enough for several uses.  </li>
            <li>but when I got them they were all half empty and a huge mess to clean up.</li>
            <li>and wow!  Turned a sort of sky blue color into a purple-ly blue with lots of shimmer and sparkle.  </li>
            <li>I lost out on money with these the most cuz every single bottle was either half empty or completely empty.</li>

            <li> I lost out on money with these the most cuz every single bottle was either half empty or completely empty.</li>
            <li> The bottles are not the normal fingernail polish size, they are a little smaller.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just enough red in the pink that my skin doesn&#x27;t look quite as pasty as it did with just the blue</li>
            <li> AND IT STAYS ON A LONG TIME.  </li>
            <li> The red is cherry, the pink is strawberry, the yellow is banana, the green is lime and the blue is fruit punch.  </li>
            <li> I have bought 2 other different collections and all have arrived with half empty bottles and a big mess.</li>
            <li> Tiny little bottles, though, not full size so be warned.  </li>
            <li> I hate returning things, lost most of the yellow and some green but cleaned it up.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;ll take a few coats to become opaque - at least the blue did.  </li>
            <li> Not hugely knowledgeable on the polish front</li>
            <li> Just too small.</li>
            <li> if u read the print it is small bottles</li>
            <li> but they are a little on the thin side</li>
            <li> I had  a bottle of Sally Hanson&#x27;s HD colors in Byte (a duo chrome in a magenta base with pink and sky blue sparkles)</li>
            <li> At least I didn&#x27;t pay alot for it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, just not much like fruit punch.</li>
            <li> Those would need 3 thin coats.  </li>
            <li> I hate that paddle brush thing.  </li>

            <li> I LOVE THE MASH NEON NAIL ART SCENTED POLISH KIT.  IT SMELLS GREAT.  I LOVE IT AND IT STAYS ON A LONG TIME.  I GIVE THIS A 5 STAR RATING.  ENJOY!</li>

            <li> I was excited to get these.  They are so very cute.  Tiny little bottles, though, not full size so be warned.  I think they&#x27;re perfect because polish always has a tendency to dry up on me before I use it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my manicure yesterday with the blue color - very bright and very much a cool type of color.  Since my skin looks better with warm colors, I wasn&#x27;t sure about it.  I had  a bottle of Sally Hanson&#x27;s HD colors in Byte (a duo chrome in a magenta base with pink and sky blue sparkles) so I used one coat of that on top just before my top coat and wow!  Turned a sort of sky blue color into a purple-ly blue with lots of shimmer and sparkle.  The HD kinda of changes color depending on the light it&#x27;s viewed in, which I really love.  My nails go from the purple-ly blue color to almost a navy blue at times. There&#x27;s just enough red in the pink that my skin doesn&#x27;t look quite as pasty as it did with just the blue polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish formula is descent. These are kind of sheer polishes so it&#x27;ll take a few coats to become opaque - at least the blue did.  I imagine the others will as well.  The brushes are the normal nail polish brushes, thank goodness.  I hate that paddle brush thing.  No control with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are also scented to match the color.  The red is cherry, the pink is strawberry, the yellow is banana, the green is lime and the blue is fruit punch.  As I said, I used the blue yesterday and the scent is still with me even today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good deal at five bucks.  They arrived well ahead of schedule.  I would definitely deal with this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Smells SO yummy, great brushes, good colors, not cheap like I would have assumed, they&#x27;re pretty opaque after two coats. Would reccommend to anyone (:</li>
            <li> Great in theory but when I got them they were all half empty and a huge mess to clean up. MASH needs to check their bottle before shipping. I have bought 2 other different collections and all have arrived with half empty bottles and a big mess. I lost out on money with these the most cuz every single bottle was either half empty or completely empty.</li>
            <li> These are cute, but they came in a package with VERY little padding and 2 of the bottles exploded. I hate returning things, lost most of the yellow and some green but cleaned it up. What&#x27;s up with the packaging???</li>
            <li> They are small but thats fine they smell great but they are a little on the thin side but u can build them up so that ok</li>
            <li> Good polish, but I thought it was for stamp art and it was not.  Oh well, my daughter uses it.  At least I didn&#x27;t pay alot for it.</li>
            <li> I just love these I recommend them for anyone.the bottles are small but the price it&#x27;s just right for them</li>
            <li> Not hugely knowledgeable on the polish front but my wife loves these. Very bright and fragrant, I will buy these again.</li>
            <li> these are really bright colors! they are in smaller bottles but are a perfect size to try out. as far as the scent they just smell like super potent nail polish. we could smell mine in the package before we even opened the box.</li>
            <li> A great Christmas present, easy shoping Grandaughter loved it. would recommend this product to others. Used this product for two months.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and they work great but the color chips off easily but your nails smell like the color you choose. It is really cool. I recommend it for young girls or teens as I bought this for my 11 year old daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> The colors are fun and look fantastic with only 2 coats! All of them smell exactly like they&#x27;re supposed to, except the blue which is supposed to be fruit punch. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, just not much like fruit punch.</li>
            <li> These polishes are the same pretty colors you see in the picture.  Amazingly, they are scented after they dry.  The bottles are not the normal fingernail polish size, they are a little smaller.  These were fun to use.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It actually smells like the actually fruits. An the scent lasts for about 2-3 days. Also, the colors are very vibrant!</li>
            <li> It was a good price for all the nail polishes. And they smell good which I didn&#x27;t expect. Just too small. But still good</li>
            <li> order from my hubbys account alot and i stumbled across ths polish &amp; Love it! if u read the print it is small bottles so make sure u check the size before u complain about ths product.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S OK THE POLISH SMELLS GREAT NICE GIFT FOR LITTLE GIRLS WHEN POLISH DRIES IT SMELLS LIKE FRUITS..N POLISH WAS REALLY TINY</li>
