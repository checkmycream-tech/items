            <li>Just love this gel, my hair looks and feels great with it</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I have used Aquage&#x27;s products for 10 or more years now.</li>
            <li>that I have used for many years as they stopped making it</li>
            <li>My favorite styling gel.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Aquage is weightless and adds a healthy shine to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Great for soft curls with no crunch.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Aquage&#x27;s products I use are fragrant free a must for me because of scent allergies.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look calm and wavy :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years but am having difficulty finding it in local hair salons - happy to find it online -</li>
            <li>The gel is off color, more of a blue grey, and more watery than I&#x27;ve experienced before.  </li>
            <li>Another person who reviewed this gel used the same one as I had used and gave it a good rating</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>This is a lite gel and when used on wet hair provides good hold for the hair.</li>
            <li>Bought originally in hair salon out of town, easy to buy through Amazon, price was similar.</li>
            <li>After you work out the crunch, hair is soft, not at all sticky, and frizz free.</li>
            <li>I first tried this gel while I was at a day spa (they had some in the bathroom)</li>
            <li>Holds hair very well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try the defining gel next time &amp; see if that one works better for me.</li>
            <li>Was more expensive on amazon but a good product for the money.</li>
            <li>The cost is a high, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>Best gel for non treated hair; put on when slightly wet, leave for a short while, then use dryer to finish; will last all day.</li>
            <li>Nice hold with transparency in your hair - no residue or sticky film to mess with.  </li>
            <li>Now I have to start looking for another hair gel which will be challenging since I live in the middle of nowhere.  </li>
            <li>This gel really works well</li>
            <li>and it holds very well.</li>
            <li>I really like using this product  with the Aquage Defining Gel.  </li>
            <li>It really holds your style, including the volume, all day.</li>
            <li>Aquage is working very well for me.</li>
            <li>I really like Aquage products.  </li>
            <li>It dries crunchy, but the crunch is easily \\&quot;scrunched\\&quot; out after it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li>Better than average gel</li>
            <li>Together the two of them really hold my natural curls.</li>
            <li>I have found that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, nor does it make my scalp itch, which I have found to be true about store bought hair products.</li>
            <li>We recently moved and I ordered it from Amazon for the first time.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and limp so this product was a godsend.  </li>
            <li>With store products you have to use more gel to get the hold, with Aquage&#x27;s gel a little goes a long way, which balance&#x27;s out the cost of this product.</li>
            <li>I live in Southern Florida and have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>After chemo my hair is fine, fragile and limp.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but not great.  </li>
            <li>Some don&#x27;t like when products dry crunchy, but I strongly believe (from lots of experimentation) that the initial hard hold of the gel is what maintains curls.  </li>

            <li> I live in Southern Florida and have naturally curly hair. This is the only gel I have found that prevents frizz and keeps my curls throughout the day.  This gel causes NO buildup because it has no silicone, and no polyquats.  It dries crunchy, but the crunch is easily \\&quot;scrunched\\&quot; out after it&#x27;s dry.  After you work out the crunch, hair is soft, not at all sticky, and frizz free. Some don&#x27;t like when products dry crunchy, but I strongly believe (from lots of experimentation) that the initial hard hold of the gel is what maintains curls.  I also like Aquage Healing Conditioner.</li>
            <li> This gel really works well,it won&#x27;t dry out your hair like some other gels can do.I had the hair relaxed treatment on my hair so it was great to find this product that I can use.</li>
            <li> I have used Aquage&#x27;s products for 10 or more years now. I have very thick hair that doesn&#x27;t like to keep a style. This hair gel is the only gel I have found that holds my hair style all day long. I have found that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, nor does it make my scalp itch, which I have found to be true about store bought hair products. The cost is a high, but well worth it. With store products you have to use more gel to get the hold, with Aquage&#x27;s gel a little goes a long way, which balance&#x27;s out the cost of this product. I also use Aquage&#x27;s hair spray for the same reasons. Aquage&#x27;s products I use are fragrant free a must for me because of scent allergies. I recommend these products, a good buy for your money.</li>
            <li> Best Gel on the market. Great for soft curls with no crunch. It&#x27;s a bummer you can&#x27;t find this anywhere except Amazon and few select hair salons.</li>
            <li> Aquage is the best hair cair line I&#x27;ve ever had experience with.  You&#x27;ll pay for it, but you&#x27;ll get results.  If you truly want to look your best this is the stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used Aquage Molding Mega Gel for years and absolutely loved the product.  It gave my hair hold without leaving gunk behind.  My hair is fine and limp so this product was a godsend.  We recently moved and I ordered it from Amazon for the first time.  Never again.  The gel is off color, more of a blue grey, and more watery than I&#x27;ve experienced before.  It also has a vinegary smell.  I find that it tends to leave my hair feeling gunky.  I assume the formula changed.  Now I have to start looking for another hair gel which will be challenging since I live in the middle of nowhere.  I am very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Best gel for non treated hair; put on when slightly wet, leave for a short while, then use dryer to finish; will last all day.</li>
            <li> Just love this gel, my hair looks and feels great with it and it holds very well. Addicted to it.</li>

            <li> Quick delivery. Great product. It really holds your style, including the volume, all day.</li>

            <li> Nice hold with transparency in your hair - no residue or sticky film to mess with.  Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I had to replace my get that I have used for many years as they stopped making it and when I can find it the price is exorbitant. Another person who reviewed this gel used the same one as I had used and gave it a good rating so I decided to try it and I am happy I did. Aquage is working very well for me.</li>
            <li> This is a lite gel and when used on wet hair provides good hold for the hair. If you feel like it&#x27;s too stiff just rub your hands through your hair and it will disapate.</li>
            <li> My favorite styling gel.</li>
            <li> I do really like this jell, it is just so expensive!</li>
            <li> This is the best styling gel I have ever used. It works very good on fine hair. I have used this product for several years.</li>
            <li> This was delivered earlier than expected.  The product is great.  It really gives thin hair a lot of body.  It is easy to use.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Good gel. The only one I use on my curls.</li>
            <li> After chemo my hair is fine, fragile and limp.  Aquage was recommended by an elite hair salon in Atlanta for my hair.  It holds without making my hair dull and brittle.  Believe me.  I had tried every product I could find. Aquage is weightless and adds a healthy shine to my hair.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> My hair is in between wavy and curly.  I&#x27;ve always hated how it was neither and ended up looking messy.  I first tried this gel while I was at a day spa (they had some in the bathroom) and I&#x27;m now hooked!  It makes my hair look calm and wavy :)</li>
            <li> Was more expensive on amazon but a good product for the money. Better than average gel but still prefer that paste.</li>
            <li> Holds hair very well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years but am having difficulty finding it in local hair salons - happy to find it online - it works well for my short hair - doesn&#x27;t &#x27;gum&#x27; it up.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this helps give my hair some body.  A lot of products weigh your hair down and leave it sticky but this one does not.</li>
            <li> I really like Aquage products.  I have curly hair &amp; was hoping this gel would be &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s okay, but not great.  I&#x27;ll try the defining gel next time &amp; see if that one works better for me.</li>
            <li> It is great, have used it for years.</li>
