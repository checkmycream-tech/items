            <li>words can&#x27;t express my love for this perfume.</li>
            <li>I love this parfum and you can&#x27;t get it in the stores anymore.  </li>
            <li>i love, my loves it</li>

            <li>I love this perfume</li>
            <li>I am more than pleased about the size of the perfume and</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Favorite perfume ever.</li>
            <li>Love it the smell stays on all day</li>
            <li>and I just love the softness of the scent.  </li>
            <li>This is def a grown and sexy perfume.</li>
            <li>I was glad to see one on line for sale.</li>
            <li>I love the Halle.</li>
            <li>I love Halle&#x27;s perfumes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments for this perfume.</li>
            <li>I dont think I have smelled a perfume as wonderful as this in a long time.  </li>
            <li>It has a very sweet scent</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that I re-oredered it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite scents and I was so happy to find it in a large size for such a good price.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not too strong either.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s huge.</li>
            <li>Smells cheap.</li>
            <li>it was like I was in withdrawal for the first couple months!!</li>
            <li>I FIRST PURCHASED IT BECAUSE MY FRIEND&#x27;S GRAND DAUGHTER IS NAMED HALLE.</li>
            <li>I originally had a bottle of Halle that I bought from Target on clearance.  </li>
            <li>It smells sweet  and stays 24\7.</li>
            <li>and I just love it so much.</li>
            <li>When I first opened it and tried it, it was VERY warm (overwhelmingly so), and smelled VERY spicy (I smelled mostly the bergamot, amber, and fig, with slight whispers of vanilla).</li>
            <li>Packed secure and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>the price was worth it too.</li>
            <li>I decided that I was going to make this my own Christmas present to myself this year &amp; its world&#x27;s cheaper on here than at the store also.</li>
            <li>It is still warm, but in a comfortable, vanilla, sort-of-way, and not as sharply spicy.</li>
            <li>Much better price; bought previously at Kohl&#x27;s for lots more $$$.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted,...</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, this is my third time buying it.</li>
            <li>The first time I ever smelled this perfume, I knew I had to have it.</li>
            <li>Certainly met my expectations and pleased my wife as a Christmas Present.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll order it again for a future gift.</li>
            <li>It has lasted a very long time with more to go.  </li>
            <li>Really like this perume</li>
            <li>Shipped fast too</li>
            <li>It seemed very diluted.</li>
            <li>like my previous perfume favorite.</li>
            <li>classic scents.</li>
            <li>the only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would wish, but it smells so good that I will continue buying it, my boyfriend loves it also.</li>
            <li>It is not as potent or long lasting as the &amp;#34;REAL&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I bought this a little over a year ago and it is by far my favorite perfume I have ever used.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A NEW FRAGRANCE FOR ME.</li>
            <li>I do have to reapply more than I would with some of my more expensive brands, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li>This HUGE bottle I got, it watered down.</li>
            <li>The drydown does become somewhat drier and woodsier, with frankincense and sandalwood, but to my nose this fragrance doesn&#x27;t evolve much from its initial impression.</li>
            <li>wow, this is so buttery, creamy, yummy.  </li>
            <li>Lovely subtle smell...</li>
            <li>Halle is still plenty sweet, with topnotes that unfortunately ring rather cheap-- like a scented-candle interpretation of fig and caramel.</li>
            <li>It has a little bit of a sweet smell to it.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to buy it for months because I am a single mom with 4 little boys with no money</li>
            <li>Came quick and seems bigger then expected</li>
            <li>But then, I generally prefer &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I know I sound ridiculous but just trust me...</li>
            <li>I was wondering if it was an imitation parfum and that it may not have been the real Halle Berry brand</li>
            <li>its thick and sweet and the scent i like.</li>
            <li>However, as the day wore on, and I sprayed it again, the vanilla blossomed and fused very well with the amber and bergamot, with slight undertones of fig.</li>

            <li> This frangace is long lasting and every time it wear it I get lots of complement.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as when you buy it in the department store.</li>
            <li> It is long lasting.</li>
            <li> I have spent more money on other expensive fragrances that do not last all day.</li>
            <li> I have three now, but I wish I could find a bigger size for her other two.  </li>
            <li> But when a few years back i got a tiny tester for Christmas</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected</li>
            <li> Item was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Holy cow</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a big bottle.</li>
            <li> Definitely not as potent and not very sure this is &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> I have bought it a couple times at a store but always hated paying so freaking much!!</li>
            <li> Too sugary and too shallow for my tastes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the hint of vanilla and the subtle jasmine that is intoxicating.</li>
            <li> And really failed at it?</li>
            <li> I hate the lid; it&#x27;s not practical and is for looks only; I threw the stupid lid away.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it sparked up conversation between my now fiance and I. Men go crazy over it.</li>
            <li> I HATE perfumes.</li>
            <li> HATE THEM.</li>
            <li> before some idiot discontinues it,...</li>
            <li> very disappointed with Amazon!</li>

            <li> THIS IS A NEW FRAGRANCE FOR ME. I FIRST PURCHASED IT BECAUSE MY FRIEND&#x27;S GRAND DAUGHTER IS NAMED HALLE.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances ever.</li>
            <li> Really like this perume</li>
            <li> This is an unbeatable price for the 3.4-ounce size of Halle, if you really love it. I don&#x27;t. I read reviews describing this as &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;sophisticated.&amp;#34; Well, yeah, compared to various Britney Spears and Paris Hilton sugarbombs, it is. But that&#x27;s relative. Halle is still plenty sweet, with topnotes that unfortunately ring rather cheap-- like a scented-candle interpretation of fig and caramel. The drydown does become somewhat drier and woodsier, with frankincense and sandalwood, but to my nose this fragrance doesn&#x27;t evolve much from its initial impression. The overall effect is of a wood plank doused in candy. Too sugary and too shallow for my tastes. But then, I generally prefer &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; classic scents.</li>
            <li> Smells sweet and beautiful!</li>
            <li> love this parfum and its cheaper on amazon</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected</li>
            <li> Have liked this perfume since it came out great price and nice size</li>
            <li> my favorite perfume! always..</li>
            <li> &amp;#34; Christmas and good perfumes &amp;#34;, just makes  the Holidays nicer...</li>
            <li> I HATE perfumes. HATE THEM. But when a few years back i got a tiny tester for Christmas I actually liked this one. its thick and sweet and the scent i like.</li>
            <li> Much better price; bought previously at Kohl&#x27;s for lots more $$$.  I hate the lid; it&#x27;s not practical and is for looks only; I threw the stupid lid away.  Everything else is great.</li>
            <li> wow, this is so buttery, creamy, yummy.  I dont think I have smelled a perfume as wonderful as this in a long time.  highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Very Good!  I ordered one for a gift and one for myself.  The shipping time was amazing!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It is my go to perfume warm and sensual for winter!. I couldn&#x27;t believe the price for a 3.4 oz of it! It has lasted a very long time with more to go.  the only downfall is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would wish, but it smells so good that I will continue buying it, my boyfriend loves it also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my go to daily scent . It&#x27;s a must have!!!! It smells sweet  and stays 24\7. My bf says it makes anyone want to pounce on u.😘 words can&#x27;t express my love for this perfume. Trust me.</li>
            <li> amazing for my taste!</li>
            <li> Everytime I smelt I was wondering if it was an imitation parfum and that it may not have been the real Halle Berry brand so I just gave it away.</li>
            <li> Certainly met my expectations and pleased my wife as a Christmas Present.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll order it again for a future gift.</li>
            <li> Love this scent! Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. So happy to have found it on here! I will be back!</li>
            <li> I love this parfum and you can&#x27;t get it in the stores anymore.  The bottle is a lot bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Great value.  Item was just what I expected.</li>
            <li> It didnt smell the same.  I took it with me to the store and compared the aromas, they did not match.</li>
            <li> It smells great and I recommended it to my friend and she already shopped hers. This frangace is long lasting and every time it wear it I get lots of complement.</li>
            <li> I originally had a bottle of Halle that I bought from Target on clearance.  I loved it so much that I re-oredered it from Amazon. Well what I got is a knock off!!! I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s authentic!!! I won&#x27;t take the chance again... very disappointed with Amazon!</li>
            <li> i love, my loves it and my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> wife has been using this perfume for a couple of years. she loves it.</li>
            <li> The perfume I received from this seller is a knock-off. I have had and purchased this fragrance mannnyyyyy times and although this perfume resembles the scent. It is not as potent or long lasting as the &amp;#34;REAL&amp;#34; Halle Berry perfume. Will not use this vendor again or advise others to either unless you are ok with KNOCK-OFF scents,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it... Smells cheap. Not my thing.... It&#x27;s ok if u like that musky vanilla</li>
            <li> I always buy this perfume. It&#x27;s the hint of vanilla and the subtle jasmine that is intoxicating. In fact, it sparked up conversation between my now fiance and I. Men go crazy over it. It lingers, it lasts.. it&#x27;s just amazing. I would always buy the tiny bottle from walmart of kholes for $20. Not paying attention to the size of it here, just assuming it was the smaller size because of the prize. Holy cow it&#x27;s huge. For $16!!!!? So happy about this. HOWEVER.. This HUGE bottle I got, it watered down. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as when you buy it in the department store. I have to re-apply it mid-day.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted,...so I got a lifetime supply,...before some idiot discontinues it,...like my previous perfume favorite.</li>
            <li> Great price, delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Halle and I am a big fan of this perfume. This one is my favorite by her, because of the pleasant scent it has.</li>
            <li> I like halle and the smell. I had this before so knew what to expect.</li>
            <li> Ever wanted to smell like a troll making an attempt to be presentable at an interview? And really failed at it? Then this perfume is for you. Ditch this. No one will compliment you. Not even your mother.</li>
            <li> Great price. This was a gift for my mom and she loved it.  Shipped fast too</li>
            <li> I bought this a little over a year ago and it is by far my favorite perfume I have ever used. I wear it every day and it smells amazing! Mine is starting to run low so I will be buying another!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, great price, love this perfume.</li>
            <li> This is a good smelling perfume to me.  I probably will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> mmmmmm the smell is out of this world and the price is equally amazing</li>
            <li> Definitely not as potent and not very sure this is &amp;#34;authentic&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> my wife really loved it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Tried and tested, and still using!</li>
            <li> I bought one two months ago and it was great. Recently bought it again and it was not the same. It seemed very diluted.</li>
            <li> I love this!  It has a nice smell that lasts but isn&#x27;t too strong, becoming one of my favorite scents!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and I could not believe the size of the bottle that came in the mail! I love it!</li>
            <li> Best price I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents and I was so happy to find it in a large size for such a good price.</li>
            <li> I am more than pleased about the size of the perfume and the price was worth it too. Packed secure and fast delivery. Overall, my expectations were exceeded.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, this is my third time buying it. A lot of people complement me too! I will definitely continue to buy it!</li>
            <li> The first time I ever smelled this perfume, I knew I had to have it. I have bought it a couple times at a store but always hated paying so freaking much!! I have not been able to buy it for months because I am a single mom with 4 little boys with no money &amp; I HAVE MISSED IT!! it mixes so well with the *wonderful* scent of my own body that I had gotten so used to it like it had become part of me!! it was like I was in withdrawal for the first couple months!! I decided that I was going to make this my own Christmas present to myself this year &amp; its world&#x27;s cheaper on here than at the store also. I finally received it in the mail today &amp; immediately put it on! now I feel like me again :D re-reading my post I know I sound ridiculous but just trust me...its good stuff :P</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. It is long lasting. I receive compliments every time I wear it. I have spent more money on other expensive fragrances that do not last all day. This is an excellent buy because it lasts all day. The fragrance is not too strong either.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on this all the time.  It smells heavenly.  I do have to reapply more than I would with some of my more expensive brands, but that&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Favorite perfume ever. Love it, good price for the size. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Came quick and seems bigger then expected</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance for fall and winter.  Knew it would smell nice hoping Halle would not allow her name to be put on a perfume that didn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this! It has a little bit of a sweet smell to it.</li>
            <li> Love it the smell stays on all day</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so good. It has a very sweet scent and I just love it so much.</li>
            <li> I am on my third bottle and purchased one for my sister.  The price is so great and I just love the softness of the scent.  Very&lt;br /&gt;easy to wear.  Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Lovely subtle smell...</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and was a great price.</li>
            <li> This is def a grown and sexy perfume. Im always complimented when I wear it. Its a romantic scent.</li>
            <li> When I first opened it and tried it, it was VERY warm (overwhelmingly so), and smelled VERY spicy (I smelled mostly the bergamot, amber, and fig, with slight whispers of vanilla). However, as the day wore on, and I sprayed it again, the vanilla blossomed and fused very well with the amber and bergamot, with slight undertones of fig. It is still warm, but in a comfortable, vanilla, sort-of-way, and not as sharply spicy. I would definitely recommend wearing this in the nighttime for summers, and all around for the fall and winter months.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a big bottle.I was glad to see one on line for sale.I love the Halle.Get complements every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great! I love Halle&#x27;s perfumes. I have three now, but I wish I could find a bigger size for her other two.  As you see in the picture, this one is much bigger.</li>
            <li> This has a pleasant smell and I always get compliments on it.  It is a staple product for me and I always have a back up.</li>
            <li> this is my fav n will always be!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments for this perfume. I will purchase again.</li>
