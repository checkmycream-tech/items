            <li>Amazon cost factor was good and it arrived in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>I love Red, I have been using it for many years</li>
            <li>I used to wear &amp;#34;Red&amp;#34; back in the day (early &amp;#34;90&#x27;s) and loved it!</li>
            <li>Quick, fast and easy.</li>
            <li>I purchased this fragrance when it was first introduced back in the 80&#x27;s and was very glad to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Particularly liked the larger bottle..</li>
            <li>It has always been hard for me to find the right fragrance and sure am glad I found this!</li>
            <li>Glad to have found Red by G thru Amazon and at a very reasonable price to boot.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase for Red by Georgio through Amazon.com, and it was one of the most easiest, efficient purchases I&#x27;ve made.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what</li>
            <li>I wanted(have been using it for years,but bought it from you for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;Speedy,no problems,thank you</li>
            <li>I have been using Red for years and love it.</li>
            <li>After having read most of the reviews of Giorgio&#x27;s Red, a fragrance I&#x27;ve been wearing since it first came out,  I was hesitant to purchase it, thinking it might be a knock-off.</li>
            <li>I LOVE GIORGIO RED.</li>
            <li>I have been using Red for so many years</li>
            <li>Price was right and shipping was fast</li>
            <li>Red is a strong fragrance when first applied</li>
            <li>I am a very satisified customer.</li>
            <li>It was packaged very well</li>
            <li>and it was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only fragrance I where so its so important that I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>But for some reason, when I ran out of it, I didn&#x27;t purchase it again, probably due to the fact I was sampling so many scents.</li>
            <li>I HAVE TRIED MANY OTHER PERFUMES</li>
            <li>This is and has been my favorite fragrance for sometime, and it is hard to fine now in the major stores in my area.</li>
            <li>I had not been able to use any other fragrance until now!  </li>
            <li>Tried different fragrances but always go back to this favorite one.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone thinking about it.</li>
            <li>I was very suprised to get it so early since i just order it on Friday.</li>
            <li>This is one of my all time favorite perfumes and it is not available in stores like it was years ago.  </li>
            <li>A perfume can smell great on one individual and not particularly pleasant on someone else but Red by Giorgio Beverly Hills was the right scent for me and still is.</li>
            <li>Been using this for many years, why mess with something that works??!  </li>
            <li>This was bought for a gift, has been very hard to find and the recipient was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Just love this perfume, not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>; After burning through a progression of other perfumes and tiring of those, I thought I&#x27;d go back to my old favorite.</li>
            <li>and it really wears well&lt;br /&gt;thanks amazon for Red by Giorgio and</li>
            <li>Soft scent.</li>
            <li>So I ordered the 3 ounce size, (perfume) not knowing how HUGE it is, but I am glad because I will have it for a while, and the price was unbelievable, that&#x27;s why I thought it was a small size, but it&#x27;s not!</li>
            <li>This product is hard to fine</li>
            <li>Now, since my body lotion is so small, I have to go back in and get a bigger size, but I don&#x27;t mind because just like the perfume, it is a very reasonable price for the size!</li>

            <li> I HAVE TRIED MANY OTHER PERFUMES</li>
            <li> This is and has been my favorite fragrance for sometime, and it is hard to fine now in the major stores in my area.</li>
            <li> I had not been able to use any other fragrance until now!  </li>
            <li> Tried different fragrances but always go back to this favorite one.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to anyone thinking about it.</li>
            <li> I was very suprised to get it so early since i just order it on Friday.</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite perfumes and it is not available in stores like it was years ago.  </li>
            <li> A perfume can smell great on one individual and not particularly pleasant on someone else but Red by Giorgio Beverly Hills was the right scent for me and still is.</li>
            <li> Been using this for many years, why mess with something that works??!  </li>
            <li> This was bought for a gift, has been very hard to find and the recipient was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Just love this perfume, not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> ; After burning through a progression of other perfumes and tiring of those, I thought I&#x27;d go back to my old favorite.</li>
            <li> and it really wears well&lt;br /&gt;thanks amazon for Red by Giorgio and</li>
            <li> Soft scent.</li>
            <li> So I ordered the 3 ounce size, (perfume) not knowing how HUGE it is, but I am glad because I will have it for a while, and the price was unbelievable, that&#x27;s why I thought it was a small size, but it&#x27;s not!</li>
            <li> This product is hard to fine</li>
            <li> Now, since my body lotion is so small, I have to go back in and get a bigger size, but I don&#x27;t mind because just like the perfume, it is a very reasonable price for the size!</li>
            <li> Common sense told me that Amazon wouldn&#x27;t sell knock-offs as the real thing, so I ordered it.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time too.  </li>
            <li> One day I was cleaning out my drawers and came across a little sample body lotion of Red (that I had forgotten all about) smelled it, and HAD to have it again!</li>
            <li> Received sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I  had been having trouble finding this item in the local department stores.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is wonderful--sexy and only need a small amt.  </li>
            <li> I was down to my last drop and not sure it was even sold anymore.  </li>
            <li> Tried on line at Amazon and it was quick and less expensive!  </li>
            <li> unfortunately it was old perfume</li>
            <li> The only reason I stopped was that I became tired of the &amp;#34;same-old same-old.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s heavy, powdery, cloying.</li>
            <li> I have been a Shalimar wearer since the late 60&#x27;s and</li>
            <li> I am not the least bit sorry.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this perfume!  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Red is awful -</li>
            <li> Giorgio knew what he was doing, or at least his nose did, when he invented this!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid they are going to discontinue it some day</li>
            <li> A lot of women can not wear this fragrance and I think thst is why there are some bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I wore this it drove my man insane with passion.</li>

            <li> My wife has has used this perfume for years and was very satisfied with the service and the perfume!</li>
            <li> unfortunately it was old perfume</li>
            <li> I purchased this fragrance when it was first introduced back in the 80&#x27;s and was very glad to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Had read some reviews that this product had been discontinued; some said it was now being marketed by Elizabeth Arden.  H-m-m-m . . . I have found that Red by Giorgio Beverly Hills is still sold as it always has been (Yay!  It&#x27;s my favorite scent.).  Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s product is called RED DOOR and is not the same product as RED, nor does it pretend to be.  Glad to have found Red by G thru Amazon and at a very reasonable price to boot.</li>
            <li> exceeded expectations</li>
            <li> This is the best perfume for me.  I just love it!  I&#x27;ve compared this to a lot of perfumes, but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I boarded a plane in Cali and a fellow passenger said,  that&#x27;s red by Giorgio!&amp;#34;  Upon arrival at my destination, another passenger u smell so good!  Is that red?  I was elated!  I have always loved red and felt good that it was recognized.</li>
            <li> THIS CONTINUES TO BE AN ALL-TIME FAVORITE OF MINE.  THE PRICING WAS GREAT AS WAS DELIVERY RATE.  I WILL PROBABLY TO CONTINUED TO ORDER THIS PRODUCT AS NEEDED.</li>
            <li> Just love this perfume, not overwhelming.  Have been looking for a perfume and anytime i smell one and inquire, it is Red by Giorgio Bererly Hills.  LOVE it</li>
            <li> Great perfume the only one I use and it was reasonably priced. Amazon cost factor was good and it arrived in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I used to wear &amp;#34;Red&amp;#34; back in the day (early &amp;#34;90&#x27;s) and loved it! But for some reason, when I ran out of it, I didn&#x27;t purchase it again, probably due to the fact I was sampling so many scents. One day I was cleaning out my drawers and came across a little sample body lotion of Red (that I had forgotten all about) smelled it, and HAD to have it again! So I ordered the 3 ounce size, (perfume) not knowing how HUGE it is, but I am glad because I will have it for a while, and the price was unbelievable, that&#x27;s why I thought it was a small size, but it&#x27;s not! Now, since my body lotion is so small, I have to go back in and get a bigger size, but I don&#x27;t mind because just like the perfume, it is a very reasonable price for the size!</li>
            <li> great price and great stuff</li>

            <li> Great price on women&#x27;s perfume without the hassle of going to the mall and fighting all the crowds and high prices.  Prompt delivery and the best price around hands down!</li>
            <li> LOVE THE SMELL OF IT .SEXY</li>
            <li> I get lots and lots of compliments when wearing this fragrance. Evidently this is the smell for me!! This product is hard to fine so I now have to buy online. I hope there will be plenty available.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the kind my wife likes. And if she&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy. Besides, I&#x27;ve always like the way she smells.</li>

            <li> great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Great gift for my wife and daughter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for about 30 years. I&#x27;m afraid they are going to discontinue it some day so I&#x27;m beginning to hoard it. I get a lot of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Loved it and it smells so good</li>
            <li> This came on time and was packaged perfectly. A gift well appreciate by my wife for a very special occassion.</li>

            <li> This was bought for a gift, has been very hard to find and the recipient was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Exceeded my wife&#x27;s expectations.  Particularly liked the larger bottle..</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and good price</li>
            <li> Get many compliments. Nice packaging too. Received sooner than expected. Will continue to buy over and over again. Soft scent.</li>
            <li> Excellent price, smell great on my wife.</li>
            <li> I have been ordering Red by Giorgio Beverly Hills on line for several years.  Have always been please with the orders.  It sure is better than paying the much higher prices in the department stores.</li>
            <li> great fragrance...clean scent. Nice evening scent.</li>
            <li> This perfume is a favorite of the woman it was for. I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne, someone always comments about the great smell. It&#x27;s a oldie but a goodie.Try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Price was right and shipping was fast</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mom - she loves it!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted(have been using it for years,but bought it from you for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;Speedy,no problems,thank you</li>
            <li> Have worn Red for years an years. Price was best ever except when I find it at Ross. Great service as well , thank you!!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this!  I had not been able to use any other fragrance until now!  It has always been hard for me to find the right fragrance and sure am glad I found this!</li>
            <li> Was disappointed with this product.  After spraying it on, after my shower, the scent disappeared within minutes.  No one could smell the scent at all.  Maybe it&#x27;s my skin?  Who knows.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume;I&#x27;m always complimented whenever I wear it and I&#x27;ve been wearing it for many years. I was down to my last drop and not sure it was even sold anymore.  Found out it was, ordered it, delivery was prompt so I&#x27;m set.  A perfume can smell great on one individual and not particularly pleasant on someone else but Red by Giorgio Beverly Hills was the right scent for me and still is.</li>
            <li> This is my mother&#x27;s favorite fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for carrying it.</li>
            <li> The item arrived in good condition and was as advertised.  I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I have been using Red for years and love it.</li>
            <li> After having read most of the reviews of Giorgio&#x27;s Red, a fragrance I&#x27;ve been wearing since it first came out,  I was hesitant to purchase it, thinking it might be a knock-off. Common sense told me that Amazon wouldn&#x27;t sell knock-offs as the real thing, so I ordered it. I am not the least bit sorry. Red is a strong fragrance when first applied but it then mellows. A lot of women can not wear this fragrance and I think thst is why there are some bad reviews. Ladies, please keep in mind that if you can smell your own fragrance, you have put too much on.</li>
            <li> Very pleased will buy again</li>
            <li> I LOVE GIORGIO RED. I HAVE TRIED MANY OTHER PERFUMES BUT NOTHING COMPARES TO THIS. I HAVE ALWAYS GOT COMPLIMENTS ON THE WAY IT SMELLS ON ME.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and at a Great Price</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!!!!!!!  It&#x27;s fabulous. I don&#x27;t like being without it. It&#x27;s the only fragrance I where so its so important that I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> This perfume emits the best aroma.  Guaranteed to allure that special someone.  Giorgio knew what he was doing, or at least his nose did, when he invented this!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my all time favorite perfumes and it is not available in stores like it was years ago.  When I have found it it was over priced.  As always Amazon provides the best source for hard to find item at the best price.</li>
            <li> My mom is oldschool and loves this so everytime she runs out I order it for her, just to make her smile!</li>
            <li> Great scent.  Have used it for more than 25 years and is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I  had been having trouble finding this item in the local department stores.  Tried on line at Amazon and it was quick and less expensive!  I have used the scent for several years and always get compliments on it!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using Red for so many years I can&#x27;t even remember when I started (25 - 30 years).  I receive so many compliments when wearing Red.&lt;br /&gt; Love wearing it.</li>
            <li> Whenever I wore this it drove my man insane with passion. So worth the spritz!</li>
            <li> I wore Red exclusively for over ten years beginning in the &#x27;90&#x27;s (Okay, I&#x27;m dating myself...). The only reason I stopped was that I became tired of the &amp;#34;same-old same-old.&amp;#34; After burning through a progression of other perfumes and tiring of those, I thought I&#x27;d go back to my old favorite. What a mistake! I don&#x27;t know if my preferences in scents has changed, or the perfume&#x27;s formulation has. Red is awful - it&#x27;s heavy, powdery, cloying. What I received smelled like something I would expect my grandmother to have from twenty-five years ago and still be wearing.</li>
            <li> Been using this for many years, why mess with something that works??!  Love this scent, and get many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I am really very pleased with the cost of the perfume. I can&#x27;t find this low price in the stores.</li>
