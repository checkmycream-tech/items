            <li>The tool works great heaven sent!</li>
            <li>This is the greatest tool I&#x27;ve found for dreading hair...</li>
            <li>LOL  </li>
            <li>i wish shank was longer but its a great tool for the cost and shipping in one i would buy again</li>
            <li>Very strong even though it&#x27;s very dainty.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really very happy with it, and in addition, it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>So good luck getting a refund.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I splurged on it!</li>
            <li>my son dreads came out nice</li>
            <li>and I liked it because it makes it easier to grab just the amount of hair you need.</li>
            <li>If you are buying this for a wig or hair pieces it might be awesome, I simply don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>Love this tool</li>
            <li>Functionality being more important than looks</li>
            <li>n was easy to use.</li>
            <li>First off, despite the pictures and description, this didn&#x27;t come with any kind of storage tube.</li>
            <li>For my texture of hair (mixed, but on the finer side) that works great.</li>
            <li>It is useful for tending to sweater snaps, though.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast, too!</li>
            <li>I like the wooden grip of this tool which makes it handy to use, particularly with slippery fingers.</li>
            <li>it was my first time interlocking</li>
            <li>and when I started working on some of the tougher locks in the back the top broke off...</li>
            <li>Tip broke off with first use.</li>
            <li>I received my tool so fast I couldn&#x27;t believe it!</li>
            <li>It needs careful storage, as it doesn&#x27;t have a cover case on its own.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t real study and and the latch would get stuck in my dreads.</li>
            <li>You can tell whoever put the packaging together really appreciates their business.</li>
            <li>The needle/hasp design simply catches on too much hair passing through the lock &amp; could very well sabotage your work.</li>
            <li>Seeing as how the shipping cost more than the actual product, I should have just gone down the street.  </li>
            <li>I needed something that could fit into tight spaces to pull thread</li>
            <li>Thanks Doctored Locks, I will definitely order from you again.</li>
            <li>Experimental purchase, intended it for rooting curly wool locks into a wig cap.  </li>
            <li>:/ either be very gentle or invest in something a little more hardy....</li>
            <li>When pulling it through it catches &amp; snags the hairs within the inner portion of the dread-lock pulling them out along with the tool which results in clumps of previously dreaded hair being pulled free.</li>
            <li>Essential trends apparently doesn&#x27;t answer emails either, and can&#x27;t be contacted by Amazon.</li>
            <li>While you are at it get the other sizes as well, which can come in useful for other things.</li>

            <li> Wish I could get money back but spent under five dollars</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much smaller than I expected and just flimsy.</li>

            <li> It is SOOO small like a centimeter, using it for my dreads</li>

    <ol>
            <li> First off, despite the pictures and description, this didn&#x27;t come with any kind of storage tube. Which was my entire reason for purchasing here, so that it didn&#x27;t get snagged on everything in my pocket. You can get a crochet hook anywhere. Seeing as how the shipping cost more than the actual product, I should have just gone down the street.  Essential trends apparently doesn&#x27;t answer emails either, and can&#x27;t be contacted by Amazon. So good luck getting a refund. Shame.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful that I even needed this- but it works great!! I&#x27;m glad I splurged on it! LOL  Shipping was super fast, too!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t real study and and the latch would get stuck in my dreads. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it but I made it work.</li>
            <li> my son dreads came out nice n it was my first time interlocking and it came out perfect n was easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with crochet and needle tatting crafts. I needed something that could fit into tight spaces to pull thread and/or yarn through. It works like a charm. I&#x27;m really very happy with it, and in addition, it arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Broke in my hair. Flimsy metal and the needle actually just snapped on half in my hair. Wish I could get money back but spent under five dollars so I&#x27;m not too heartbroken</li>
            <li> i wish shank was longer but its a great tool for the cost and shipping in one i would buy again</li>
            <li> Very strong even though it&#x27;s very dainty.</li>
            <li> I used it on my front 5-6 locks and when I started working on some of the tougher locks in the back the top broke off...:/ either be very gentle or invest in something a little more hardy....</li>
            <li> Tip broke off with first use.</li>
            <li> This ones locking tip is tiny tiny.</li>
            <li> this is the tool! I received my tool so fast I couldn&#x27;t believe it! You can tell whoever put the packaging together really appreciates their business. it was neat and just overall THEY care about what they sell.The tool works great heaven sent! Everything described came in my package. Thanks Doctored Locks, I will definitely order from you again.</li>
            <li> It is SOOO small like a centimeter, using it for my dreads and I&#x27;m like DAAAMMMNNNN</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t come with the case, totally different style handle, and the hook and hatch SNAPPED off after 2 pulls of hair. cheap crap, get solid metal ones.</li>
            <li> Not what I had hope for when I bought this. It&#x27;s much smaller than I expected and just flimsy. It makes maintaining my locks a horrendous task and it is not something I would recommend others to buy</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a dread-lock maintenance tool. Unfortunately it&#x27;s worthless. The hasp is horribly difficult to keep closed on even a few strands of hair. When pulling it through it catches &amp; snags the hairs within the inner portion of the dread-lock pulling them out along with the tool which results in clumps of previously dreaded hair being pulled free. Also, the microneedle that arrived didn&#x27;t look quite like the one in the picture, instead having a cut out image around the gold toned base of the needle. Functionality being more important than looks it was unimportant. If you are buying this for a wig or hair pieces it might be awesome, I simply don&#x27;t know. However, if you&#x27;re buying it for dread maintenance I would beware. The needle/hasp design simply catches on too much hair passing through the lock &amp; could very well sabotage your work.</li>
            <li> Got here just in time and I liked it because it makes it easier to grab just the amount of hair you need.</li>
            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s small and can grab those tiny stray hairs. Love this tool</li>
            <li> It needs careful storage, as it doesn&#x27;t have a cover case on its own.  Experimental purchase, intended it for rooting curly wool locks into a wig cap.  I have not yet used it for that.  It is useful for tending to sweater snaps, though.</li>
            <li> I may get yet another to stash around the house. Just a few weeks using and I notice the packing and tightening in my loc quality, Instead of having the frays cut, I pull them back in. For my texture of hair (mixed, but on the finer side) that works great.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest tool I&#x27;ve found for dreading hair... Thank you!</li>
            <li> I like the wooden grip of this tool which makes it handy to use, particularly with slippery fingers. While you are at it get the other sizes as well, which can come in useful for other things.</li>
