            <li>I bought this since it was a good deal and had good</li>
            <li>It was good at the beginning but after two weeks of use, this shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair oily.</li>

            <li>Great shampoo for my VERY curly hair!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed a lot more hair breakage than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>with most things, this may work for others, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>And, if you&#x27;re looking for something with a potent fragrance, this is not for you.</li>
            <li>since I start using it my hair looks much better.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is better (I still use it sometimes)</li>
            <li>yay :)</li>
            <li>Love these products.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s like buy one get one free!  </li>
            <li>The Shampoo was okay</li>
            <li>It is sulfate-free and keeps my hair feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried top of the line salon products but nothing beats Joico line.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>liked it at first - the scent is kind of nice and clean, not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel silky and combs through easily.</li>
            <li>These are huge bottles.</li>
            <li>I purchased this set as a replacement for L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s fantastic sulfate-free &amp;#34;Ever-&amp;#34; brand.</li>
            <li>The pump bottle is also fantastic.</li>
            <li>Both shampoo &amp; conditioner work great not only cleanses &amp; detangles hair bur</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner came super quick!  </li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean after I&#x27;ve washed it.</li>
            <li>and after i wash my hair with the shampoo I feel like it doesn&#x27;t clean the oil out of my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair does not feel clean at all.</li>
            <li>I have been using Joico products for many years and realized that they are so much cheaper on Amazon</li>
            <li>Since switching to L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s sulfate free system for about a year, I noticed a VERY positive change in my hair.</li>
            <li>The conditioner isn&#x27;t as heavy as I would prefer, so I use a bit more than I normally would, but it&#x27;s still a very good system.</li>
            <li>This shampoo/conditioner does wonders for my hair, I got my items quickly and in the condition they should be.</li>
            <li>I used to use the moisture Joico shampoo and conditioner, but now this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>It is nice and does not dry out my hair</li>
            <li>This is the third time I purchase this shampoo I love it!</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t lather!!</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell amazing</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>My hair is much more oily now than it naturally is....</li>
            <li>I love that its sulfate free because I&#x27;ve dyed my hair multiple times</li>
            <li>I love how it smells and after each wash my hair feels super clean unlike regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to see a lot of peptides in the system and NO parabens, definitely a step in the right direction.</li>
            <li>then i take more shampoo and apply to the back of my head and massage for it clean fully.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair greasy right after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The only products I like better are Aveeda</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never had such healthy hair until I used this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Exactly what is anounced.</li>
            <li>I have to shampoo twice first the front of my head</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used Joico Shampoo and Conditioner, I have used their styling products, so</li>
            <li>A young lady who worked there suggested I try Joico Smooth Cure Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.</li>
            <li>Thank you for offering such an outstanding product.</li>
            <li>And this is sulfur free and your hair feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner left my hair nice and soft though!</li>
            <li>Okay, so a few weeks ago I was at a beauty supply store (in the mall) looking for yet another shampoo and conditioner that would smooth &amp; detangle my hair</li>
            <li>I purchased this Shampoo/Conditioner combo, one because of all the positive reviews, and two because my friend wouldn&#x27;t stop raving about it.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is great, it is not harsh at all, and I&#x27;ve actually noticed an improvement on my scalp since switching from L&#x27;Oreal to this brand, so I prefer Joico&#x27;s shampoo currently.</li>
            <li>Aveeno makes a much better sulfate-free product, and while it isn&#x27;t sulfate-free, the Herbal Essences Naked line is also preferable to this particular brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if its just this formula, but it certainly didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>but I love it when it&#x27;s wavy minus the firzz.</li>
            <li>very tick.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and hair</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shampoo for people with a very oily scalp like me who have to wash their hair every day.</li>
            <li>My hair really needed a boost so my hair stylist recommended this product.</li>
            <li>I switched to Joico and started with the color protector type but moved to smooth cure and will never go back.</li>
            <li>My hair is also very oily</li>
            <li>In detangling by hand, it leaves a really greasy substance on my fingers.</li>
            <li>I used it for a whole month wondering if my hair just needed to &amp;#34;get used to it,&amp;#34; but it never did.</li>
            <li>After two months, my wifes hair started falling out much more than it had been, so she went back to our old stuff and her hair has returned to where it had been before.</li>
            <li>This is the only Shampoo and Conditioner product line that leaves my scalp healthy, hair manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this because I have curly hair and love their other products</li>
            <li>The shampoo isn&#x27;t as strong a surfactant as L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s (which ISN&#x27;T a bad thing), so I&#x27;m also using a more than of the shampoo than I normally would, but it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever used equal amounts of shampoo and conditioner from any system, so that&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>I have purchased two duo sets, and will likely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>The combo leaves my hair feeling really clean, but not overly dry, and it doesn&#x27;t get greasy after a day of playing with it.</li>
            <li>I think people with oily hair generally need a sulfate shampoo because that is the only way to fully clean our hair from the residue and grease that our hair naturally creates in just one day.</li>
            <li>(I usually use a LOT more conditioner).</li>
            <li>It also messes with the texture of my hair - typically, my hair is pretty smooth and soft and after washing with this shampoo/conditioner, it feels very coarse.</li>
            <li>Firstly, it leaves a weird residue on my hair, which feels kind of greasy.</li>
            <li>The shampoo left my hair clean but feeling dry and brittle (I have stopped using it).</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t really done anything different to my hair</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair feels just after days of using this Shampoo.</li>
            <li>but it makes my curly hair so soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling heavy and greasy, not something that should be happening with sulfate free products.</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair feeling soft and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, as a fashionable chemist who cares for her thick curly hair: The Joico system is more than satisfactory.</li>
            <li>But as I continue to use it, I&#x27;m more and more disappointed with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s economical, less wasteful, and very soothing to my naturally dry scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>I decided I wanted to try a different brand, for economic reasons mainly, and for being less wasteful as far as the packaging goes, so I purchased Joico&#x27;s sulfate-free system.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good experiences with Joico before, and I thought I would try their sulfate-free stuff since I hear it&#x27;s gentler on the hair, and my hair is quite delicate in general - dry, very fine, prone to breakage, tangles like crazy.</li>
            <li>I CAN FINALLY COMB THRU MY NATURAL HAIR</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice to see less complex alcohols in the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>naturally curly/wavy hair and want my curls to be loose and not frizzy.</li>

            <li> I think people with oily hair generally need a sulfate shampoo because that is the only way to fully clean our hair from the residue and grease that our hair naturally creates in just one day.</li>
            <li> (I usually use a LOT more conditioner).</li>
            <li> It also messes with the texture of my hair - typically, my hair is pretty smooth and soft and after washing with this shampoo/conditioner, it feels very coarse.</li>
            <li> Firstly, it leaves a weird residue on my hair, which feels kind of greasy.</li>
            <li> The shampoo left my hair clean but feeling dry and brittle (I have stopped using it).</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t really done anything different to my hair</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair feels just after days of using this Shampoo.</li>
            <li> but it makes my curly hair so soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling heavy and greasy, not something that should be happening with sulfate free products.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair feeling soft and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, as a fashionable chemist who cares for her thick curly hair: The Joico system is more than satisfactory.</li>
            <li> But as I continue to use it, I&#x27;m more and more disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s economical, less wasteful, and very soothing to my naturally dry scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> I decided I wanted to try a different brand, for economic reasons mainly, and for being less wasteful as far as the packaging goes, so I purchased Joico&#x27;s sulfate-free system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good experiences with Joico before, and I thought I would try their sulfate-free stuff since I hear it&#x27;s gentler on the hair, and my hair is quite delicate in general - dry, very fine, prone to breakage, tangles like crazy.</li>
            <li> I CAN FINALLY COMB THRU MY NATURAL HAIR</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice to see less complex alcohols in the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> naturally curly/wavy hair and want my curls to be loose and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is a different story, my hair didn&#x27;t feel clean, it left a filmy grease behind when my hair would dry.</li>
            <li> The shampoo made my African and Filipino mixed hair dry</li>
            <li> I actually was surprised that it cleansed my hair and scalp but without making it dry because with other moisturizing shampoos I could feel even as Im washing it that its dry even under water.</li>
            <li> Am African and my hair is very long n</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for 4 months and it helps tame my natural curl (especially in humidity).</li>
            <li> You would think this would help reduce tangles, but it makes my hair tangle up MUCH worse than it usually does, leading to even more breakage...</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found less expensive conditioners that work better for me.  </li>
            <li> This works very well, not weighting hair down as bad as many other brands.  </li>
            <li> Going back to my other shampoo&#x27;s that I have.</li>
            <li> I also have very long hair</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what it is about this shampoo/conditioner, but it leaves a very strange residue in my hair.</li>
            <li> It made my scalp dry and hair seemed life-less.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product as it is sulfate free and moisturizing that it will leave residue</li>
            <li> product appears to be watered down.</li>
            <li> After some experimentation, i&#x27;ve been mixing the shampoo with another one and the conditioner with another one and that seems to cut down on the film.</li>
            <li> She will not use any other shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> if you have normal-to-oily heavy hair,  don&#x27;t consider this one.</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to, because it&#x27;s not the &amp;#34;squeaky-clean&amp;#34; that I was accustomed to; but after a few washes, my hair is shinier, healthier and keeps its curl longer.</li>
            <li> Had to chuck it in the trash and buy my usual over the counter stuff.</li>
            <li> The packaging was not smart at all, put in thin packaging so the pump on the conditioner broke.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that I usually straighten, and really hard water at home.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair dull and greasy looking.</li>
            <li> I have used it once, but am not &#x27;thrilled&#x27; with it.  </li>
            <li> NO MORE HAIR IN THE SINK!....</li>
            <li> Well when it finally arrived and I tried it, I was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair, and I&#x27;m a chemist.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it though, not sure if I would purchase it again!!</li>
            <li> I have thin curly hair</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> A THING OF THE PAST!!!</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my hair has some weird chemical reaction to this brand, but this stuff did NOT work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Not impressed, and would not recommend anyone buy this.</li>
            <li> NO MORE SPENDING HOURS TRYING TO DETANGLE!!!!  </li>
            <li> Wanted to like it so bad.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very bad shampoo.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had a giftcard and I&#x27;d been wanting to switch to sulfate-free shampoo again, so I bought this since it was a good deal and had good review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it at first - the scent is kind of nice and clean, not overpowering at all. But as I continue to use it, I&#x27;m more and more disappointed with it. Firstly, it leaves a weird residue on my hair, which feels kind of greasy. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean after I&#x27;ve washed it. It also messes with the texture of my hair - typically, my hair is pretty smooth and soft and after washing with this shampoo/conditioner, it feels very coarse. I&#x27;ve also noticed a lot more hair breakage than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with most things, this may work for others, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. Aveeno makes a much better sulfate-free product, and while it isn&#x27;t sulfate-free, the Herbal Essences Naked line is also preferable to this particular brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks this shampoo/condition is going to be hanging out in the cupboard for awhile...</li>
            <li> Put lots of moisture in my hair (which I needed).. Smells super yummy too!!</li>
            <li> It was good at the beginning but after two weeks of use, this shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair oily.</li>
            <li> good product...good value !!!</li>
            <li> great product! fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Best bang for the buck!</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t really done anything different to my hair but maybe I need to use it for a longer period of time. I have wavy hair but it tends to be frizzy so I try not to iron it too often but I love it when it&#x27;s wavy minus the firzz. I didn&#x27;t see the difference in the frizz when I used this product maybe I&#x27;m just doomed with frizzy hair for life. I&#x27;ve tried everything you can think of.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best product line that my wife has found for thinning hair!  She will not use any other shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make any difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo &amp; conditioner quite a bit.  It&#x27;s a great value.  The only products I like better are Aveeda and that&#x27;s expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the third time I purchase this shampoo I love it! I have thin curly hair and I&#x27;ve never had such healthy hair until I used this shampoo. I give it a 5 star it&#x27;s worth it the price is awesome😉</li>
            <li> I purchased this set as a replacement for L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s fantastic sulfate-free &amp;#34;Ever-&amp;#34; brand. I have very thick curly hair, and I&#x27;m a chemist. Since switching to L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s sulfate free system for about a year, I noticed a VERY positive change in my hair. I decided I wanted to try a different brand, for economic reasons mainly, and for being less wasteful as far as the packaging goes, so I purchased Joico&#x27;s sulfate-free system. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks, and I&#x27;m mostly very pleased with the product. The conditioner isn&#x27;t as heavy as I would prefer, so I use a bit more than I normally would, but it&#x27;s still a very good system. The shampoo isn&#x27;t as strong a surfactant as L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s (which ISN&#x27;T a bad thing), so I&#x27;m also using a more than of the shampoo than I normally would, but it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever used equal amounts of shampoo and conditioner from any system, so that&#x27;s nice (I usually use a LOT more conditioner). The shampoo is great, it is not harsh at all, and I&#x27;ve actually noticed an improvement on my scalp since switching from L&#x27;Oreal to this brand, so I prefer Joico&#x27;s shampoo currently. It&#x27;s nice to see a lot of peptides in the system and NO parabens, definitely a step in the right direction. It&#x27;s also nice to see less complex alcohols in the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, as a fashionable chemist who cares for her thick curly hair: The Joico system is more than satisfactory. I have purchased two duo sets, and will likely purchase more in the future. It&#x27;s economical, less wasteful, and very soothing to my naturally dry scalp and hair. The pump bottle is also fantastic.</li>
            <li> Nice set at a very nice price.  This works very well, not weighting hair down as bad as many other brands.  And, being sulfate-free, ideal for color-treated hair.  Note that the shampoo in this formula does not lather as well as others from this brand, but it is still just as effective.  And, if you&#x27;re looking for something with a potent fragrance, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Like the shampoo but I like it to have a stronger fragrance. It is nice and does not dry out my hair</li>
            <li> Joico makes very good products. These are huge bottles.</li>
            <li> if you have normal-to-oily heavy hair,  don&#x27;t consider this one. It didn&#x27;t give you smooth hair but will make hair condition worse. My hair is much more oily now than it naturally is....</li>
            <li> Great price for the size. I look forward to using this brand. I have heard a lot of great things about this product</li>
            <li> It is a very good product. Exactly what is anounced. I would buy another in the future. Bye. Bye. Bye</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner I ever have. I am so happy that i give it a try!! I&#x27;m telling all my friends to start using this shampoo and conditioner. Am African and my hair is very long n very tick. since I start using it my hair looks much better.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and hair and after i wash my hair with the shampoo I feel like it doesn&#x27;t clean the oil out of my hair. I have to shampoo twice first the front of my head then i take more shampoo and apply to the back of my head and massage for it clean fully. I also have very long hair and it makes my hair dull and greasy looking. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shampoo for people with a very oily scalp like me who have to wash their hair every day. I think people with oily hair generally need a sulfate shampoo because that is the only way to fully clean our hair from the residue and grease that our hair naturally creates in just one day.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used Joico Shampoo and Conditioner, I have used their styling products, so I though I would give it a try. I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair feels just after days of using this Shampoo. Such a difference in just days. Love the smell of it, really light smell but very delightful, I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The shampoo left my hair clean but feeling dry and brittle (I have stopped using it). The conditioner is better (I still use it sometimes) but I&#x27;ve found less expensive conditioners that work better for me.  I have naturally curly/wavy hair and want my curls to be loose and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing Joico shampoo and conditioner for awhile now and I have mixed reviews on it. I love that its sulfate free because I&#x27;ve dyed my hair multiple times but whenever I wash my hair with the conditioner my hair is just so oily after. I would probably purchase another conditioner next time. Can&#x27;t beat the price though (compared to Pureology).</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner does wonders for my hair, I got my items quickly and in the condition they should be. yay :)</li>
            <li> I saw rave reviews for this shampoo and conditioner, so thought I&#x27;d try it.  It made my scalp dry and hair seemed life-less. Going back to my other shampoo&#x27;s that I have.</li>
            <li> Love these products.  Has been using it for years and it still does the trick.</li>
            <li> Very bad shampoo. No difference between joico and $5 shampoo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a shampoo and conditioner that leaves my hair like this.  It took some getting used to, because it&#x27;s not the &amp;#34;squeaky-clean&amp;#34; that I was accustomed to; but after a few washes, my hair is shinier, healthier and keeps its curl longer.</li>
            <li> My hair really needed a boost so my hair stylist recommended this product. Not only does it smell amazing but it makes my curly hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Just what I need it!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my hair has some weird chemical reaction to this brand, but this stuff did NOT work for me at all. It made my hair feel all gunky and gross. Had to chuck it in the trash and buy my usual over the counter stuff.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Shampoo/Conditioner combo, one because of all the positive reviews, and two because my friend wouldn&#x27;t stop raving about it. Well when it finally arrived and I tried it, I was very disappointing. My hair does not feel clean at all. I wash and condition it only for it to feel like I just put water in it. It leaves my hair feeling heavy and greasy, not something that should be happening with sulfate free products. Not impressed, and would not recommend anyone buy this.</li>
            <li> I used to use the moisture Joico shampoo and conditioner, but now this is my new favorite. It makes my hair feel silky and combs through easily.</li>
            <li> Great price, it&#x27;s like buy one get one free!  I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for 4 months and it helps tame my natural curl (especially in humidity).</li>
            <li> Wanted to like it so bad. The packaging was not smart at all, put in thin packaging so the pump on the conditioner broke. The shampoo made my African and Filipino mixed hair dry</li>
            <li> Both shampoo &amp; conditioner work great not only cleanses &amp; detangles hair bur also smells great.</li>
            <li> Started out seeming to be O.K.. After two months, my wifes hair started falling out much more than it had been, so she went back to our old stuff and her hair has returned to where it had been before.</li>
            <li> The Shampoo was okay that is why I gave it 2 stars. The conditioner is a different story, my hair didn&#x27;t feel clean, it left a filmy grease behind when my hair would dry. I would NOT recommend the conditioner to anyone, I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Great product. I love how it smells and after each wash my hair feels super clean unlike regular shampoo. Definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Great price.  This is what my hairdresser uses and I trust her.  I like it.  It is sulfate-free and keeps my hair feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> This works great on my hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner came super quick!  I have used it once, but am not &#x27;thrilled&#x27; with it.  It really didn&#x27;t lather!! The conditioner left my hair nice and soft though! I will continue to use it though, not sure if I would purchase it again!!</li>
            <li> Okay, so a few weeks ago I was at a beauty supply store (in the mall) looking for yet another shampoo and conditioner that would smooth &amp; detangle my hair (I&#x27;m African American w/thick, coarse hair).  A young lady who worked there suggested I try Joico Smooth Cure Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. While I&#x27;m no stranger to Joico hair products, they worked on my hair when it was relaxed, but I was hesitant about it working on my un relaxed hair. Let me just say that not only did the shampoo cleansed my hair but the conditioner? THE CONDITIONER MADE THE  KNOTS, KINKS......OR WHATEVER, A THING OF THE PAST!!! I CAN FINALLY COMB THRU MY NATURAL HAIR WITH NO PROBLEM WHAT SO EVER!!!!  NO MORE HAIR IN THE SINK!....NO MORE SPENDING HOURS TRYING TO DETANGLE!!!!  YES!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Joico products for many years and realized that they are so much cheaper on Amazon then I can get them locally.  This leaves my hair feeling soft and not frizzy.  Has a good scent as well.</li>
            <li> product appears to be watered down.</li>
            <li> My son at college. has wirey, curly, fuzzy  hair. He LOVES this smoothing shampoo &amp; conditioner.  I do recommend it...!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for my VERY curly hair!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I have curly hair and love their other products but this is for ethnic hair. It leaves my hair greasy right after I&#x27;ve used it. Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens and dozens of different shampoos and conditioners. I have wavy hair that I usually straighten, and really hard water at home. I used Pureology for the longest time and loved it until it started to make my hair kind of brittle, then switched to another type of Pureology and that made my hair too greasy. I switched to Joico and started with the color protector type but moved to smooth cure and will never go back. It&#x27;s perfect. The combo leaves my hair feeling really clean, but not overly dry, and it doesn&#x27;t get greasy after a day of playing with it. It smells nice too! Would suggest this set to everyone.</li>
            <li> This is the only Shampoo and Conditioner product line that leaves my scalp healthy, hair manageable and soft.  I&#x27;ve tried top of the line salon products but nothing beats Joico line.  Thank you for offering such an outstanding product.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product as it is sulfate free and moisturizing that it will leave residue and I have recently did an ombre. I actually was surprised that it cleansed my hair and scalp but without making it dry because with other moisturizing shampoos I could feel even as Im washing it that its dry even under water.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I&#x27;m allergic to sulfur.  And this is sulfur free and your hair feel so soft.  And smells good to.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo..the best so far for my curly hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s the shampoo or conditioner, but this product leaves a greasy film on my hair. After some experimentation, i&#x27;ve been mixing the shampoo with another one and the conditioner with another one and that seems to cut down on the film. I can say though that it does help with the frizziness of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good experiences with Joico before, and I thought I would try their sulfate-free stuff since I hear it&#x27;s gentler on the hair, and my hair is quite delicate in general - dry, very fine, prone to breakage, tangles like crazy. My hair is also very oily so I shampoo on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what it is about this shampoo/conditioner, but it leaves a very strange residue in my hair. In detangling by hand, it leaves a really greasy substance on my fingers. You would think this would help reduce tangles, but it makes my hair tangle up MUCH worse than it usually does, leading to even more breakage...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell if all sulfate-free formulas are like this or if its just this formula, but it certainly didn&#x27;t work for me. I used it for a whole month wondering if my hair just needed to &amp;#34;get used to it,&amp;#34; but it never did. Disappointed.</li>
