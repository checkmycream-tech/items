            <li>My search for the best After Shave has ended!</li>

            <li>It feels great going on the skin.</li>
            <li>Great aftershave.</li>
            <li>A great summer choice.</li>
            <li>but it is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Feels great.</li>
            <li>Has a great citrusy smell but doesn&#x27;t have any alcohol.</li>
            <li>The close shave does irritate the skins a bit and this tonic makes your face feel great after a shave.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and doesn&#x27;t sting since there&#x27;s no alcohol in it.</li>
            <li>Great citrus-orange smell that fades away after about 30 seconds by design.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still great as intro intended, post shave.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great</li>
            <li>Great Combo.  </li>
            <li>Amazing on my skin and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Stuff is soothing, very nice.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice premium product in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Feels nice on the face!</li>
            <li>Good after shave for great feeling skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff is a pleasant finishing touch to a morning shave.</li>
            <li>Pleasant scent, will not over power</li>
            <li>Very Pleasant and refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve always steered towards the Bay Rum aftershaves-but you know sometimes change is a good thing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but needs something else.</li>
            <li>It was all good until you added this.</li>
            <li>If you like a splash but don&#x27;t want the burn of an alcohol based aftershave then this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>My suggestion would be to follow up with some good cologne or maybe even throw on some stronger aftershave after words.</li>
            <li>but for those that don&#x27;t this is also a good alternative.</li>
            <li>It has just the amount of scent and feels really good on the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to like it, now, maybe because I associate it with the good results.  </li>
            <li>Lack of stinging indicates fewer burns and cuts meaning that I&#x27;ve given myself a good shave.</li>
            <li>Smells good but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Shipping and packaging were on time and good as well.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, at all, so that&#x27;s good for me because I have an oily face</li>
            <li>Good product at a fair price.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s a good thing as it allows you to apply cologne if that&#x27;s what you want.  </li>
            <li>oh so good...</li>
            <li>This good for using cologne</li>
            <li>Good product; timely shipping.</li>
            <li>It may be good for your skin according to label.</li>
            <li>I would like to try a good bay rum w/ lime aftershave.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
            <li>This stuff is good for your face and doesn&#x27;t burn when applied.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a cologne kind of guy, but it makes my face feel great after a shave</li>
            <li>This a good tonic and aftershave.</li>
            <li>Wakes your skin up, and just makes it feel good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll do good things for your face.</li>
            <li>Felt so good on my face I doubled up.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>Seller did good job in its description of product.</li>
            <li>Also perfect every day wear that dissipates quickly and</li>
            <li>Very light lemon scent, does a great job of healing your face after shaving.</li>
            <li>It is very refreshing</li>
            <li>Very refreshing after the shave.</li>
            <li>I love topping off this with a great premium scent.</li>
            <li>This is a great aftershave for people that don&#x27;t like the overpowering smell of most aftershaves.</li>
            <li>This stuff is very refreshing.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.. not as great as some of the reviews i read.</li>
            <li>It does leave the face looking and feeling good after a shave, but it kind of leaves my mug asking, &amp;#34;Where&#x27;s the tingle?&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I love this after shave!</li>
            <li>One of my all time favorite after shaves!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered two more bottles!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Excellent product - painless, soothing tonic that doesn&#x27;t strip out moisture, leaves my face feeling clean and hydrated for most of the day.</li>
            <li>Great stuff if you don&#x27;t like a strong smell or burning of alcohol.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>Great, light, citrusy aroma.</li>
            <li>If you use a quality shave cream or paste, you have yourself a nice combination.</li>
            <li>Nice packaging</li>
            <li>My husband uses this and it has a nice, non-over powering scent while providing relief from razor burn.</li>
            <li>It has a nice mellow citrus scent.</li>
            <li>It has a nice citrus smell.  </li>
            <li>In all honestly it looked quite ghastly and it stung quite a bit.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a bummer if you like the orange smell (and why wouldn&#x27;t you?), but it&#x27;s nice in that it won&#x27;t clash with any cologne you want to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The scent is nice.</li>
            <li>Really the best after shave ever!</li>
            <li>It does smell nice</li>
            <li>But the bottle looks nice.</li>
            <li>Buy the stuff and then buy a nice perfume bottle to hold it</li>
            <li>Moisturizes the skin nicely after shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 and for most of my life I have usually favored a mainstream but nice after shave most of my life but</li>
            <li>Nice toning effect.</li>
            <li>Does a nice job cooling the face after shaving though.</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased with mostly everything about this aftershave.</li>
            <li>I will use it fairly often, but my druthers is for a more bracing aftershave most of the time.</li>
            <li>a good product maybe just not for me, it doesn&#x27;t really have that &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; that makes something great for me, it leaves me looking at it</li>
            <li>Lucky Tiger  works great.  </li>
            <li>It very easily rubs in and leaves no oily residue.</li>
            <li>Good Lucky Tiger!</li>
            <li>This is a nice, refreshing astringent, but if you&#x27;re looking for a scent that lasts a while, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect and my my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Lucky Tiger has a very pleasant, very light scent that dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am new(er) to straight razor shaving and have had my fair share of nicks and fairly good cuts.</li>
            <li>Great alcohol free aftershave at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, very refreshing after a 3-pass shave.</li>
            <li>extremely light citrus scent, very refreshing.</li>
            <li>Fine after shave, no alcohol!</li>
            <li>This is a very light liquid aftershave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very smooth, no burn, aftershave tonic that does what it&#x27;s meant to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soothing, very light not oily consistency.</li>
            <li>Very light lemony fragrance.</li>
            <li>Very good smell of sweet and fresh orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lucky Tiger is a good toner that soothes my face after a shave.</li>
            <li>Good choice for those looking for mild aftershave products.</li>
            <li>of the products are marvelous, very gentle and fine quality, making my morning shaving routine a special treat</li>
            <li>Has a citrus mandarin scent which I love.</li>
            <li>Love this product for post-shave and have made it part of my routine.  </li>
            <li>The stuff is magic.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels after the shave.</li>
            <li>Has a nice fragrance to it and is light.</li>
            <li>Refreshing and no burn, will be keeping in stock.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know if you can get any better.  </li>
            <li>I love citrus notes and this is packed with it.</li>
            <li>Though, it doesn&#x27;t feel any better than the AoS, which is just as soothing.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m on the search for an aftershave that is more like AoS but with a cheaper price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably the most like a skin conditioner.</li>
            <li>Its aloe vera plus I suspect witch hazel are what make me say it is most like a skin conditioner.</li>
            <li>I would say that Pinaud Clubman is the most astringent and cooling, followed by Proraso, Clubman&#x27;s Bay Rum, and Clubman&#x27;s Sandalwood.</li>
            <li>even if another after shave might help them heal better without your feeling anything.</li>
            <li>So, the more astringency the better for me.</li>
            <li>So I guess I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect when I purchased this.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a more invigorating feeling on my face; one that I&#x27;d expect from an alcohol-based product or a menthol-based product.</li>
            <li>my favorite of all aftershaves</li>
            <li>There is a nice citrus scent that is light and does not linger.</li>
            <li>do a bit better of a job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, if you are looking for a soothing, non-alcoholic aftershave, you will probably love this one.</li>
            <li>have been using this for about 2 years and it is my favorite aftershave period.  </li>
            <li>love this after shave.</li>
            <li>I then apply it to my face for a soothing and refreshing finish to my morning shave.</li>
            <li>I did put it in 2 oz spray bottle for better distribution.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better things I have bought online.</li>
            <li>The scent is just so refreshing, reminds me of a tropical breeze blowing in my face.</li>
            <li>I love the smell when applied</li>
            <li>-all, one of my favorite aftershaves I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>but if it was a bit more potent it would be better, just my opinion though.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite aftershave.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Eh..., there are better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would you like your favorite Whiskey to arrive in a plastic bottle?</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Why so many after-shave makers go for these plastic bottles is something I just don&#x27;t understand.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>but I have to admit that it feels more like a tonic to apply to heal your face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Better like the smell.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to make sure anyone who is buying it to know what it smells</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews wanted to go on and on about how fresh it smells and how good it is for their skin</li>
            <li>(plus I get to remember the lovely lady to gave them to me).</li>
            <li>I love the safety razor.  </li>
            <li>However, for me, the product is just ok.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth product made with plant extracts.  </li>
            <li>I plan to buy more when needed.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love with it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>it is  a refreshing face soother and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased that I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff...</li>
            <li>things to know:&lt;br /&gt;-Alcohol free!  </li>
            <li>If it was a bit stronger and had more &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34; (i.e. lasted longer) that would be preferable.&lt;br /&gt;-Big</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure</li>
            <li>but rather a nice clean non biting aftershave.  </li>
            <li>Great citrus scent, sooths fresh razor irritation quickly with zero burning.</li>
            <li>It has a very light citrus fragrance that fades away very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This was saddening at first because it smells so darn good.</li>
            <li>First this is not a product with alcohol, which is good because it dries the skin.</li>
            <li>This feels good when first applied but that is all.  </li>
            <li>great, little orange and citrus splash after a shave really a great way to start the day</li>
            <li>Smells great, but that smell goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of citrusy and disperses after about ten minutes, so this is a great product if you don&#x27;t like strong scents.  </li>
            <li>I really love Lucky Tiger after shave and tonic!</li>
            <li>Great light citrus smell, provide a nice post-shave refreshment and definitely soothes the skin and reduce irritation.</li>
            <li>I love the bottle and the light orange scent this product has.</li>
            <li>The smell is classic and pleasant.</li>
            <li>I have tried many types of shaving balms but Lucky Tiger is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This is a great after-shave I have used for probably ten years or more.</li>
            <li>Trust me, you do not want a strong smell for your after shave, cologne, deodorant, soap, and everything else you put on your body.</li>
            <li>It is strongly citrusy, yet the scent goes away within minutes.</li>
            <li>Leaves no overly strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>My wife says it is &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34;, but not too strong.</li>
            <li>that strong of a scent.  </li>
            <li>I love it, my wife has never sniffed and rubbed up on me more right after a shave.  </li>
            <li>Not oily at all, which is great for me because I live in a VERY hot, humid climate, and am outdoors quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>Along with a Badger Hair brush &amp; good shaving soap, this is a new must-have for my shaving routine now.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I find myself reaching for it more and more in hot weather.</li>
            <li>But Lucky Tiger now is probably my favorite aftershave.</li>
            <li>and I love that the smell goes away quickly so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my cologne.</li>
            <li>But this suff works well to help it heal more quickly.</li>
            <li>It is Vegan safe, it smells like citrus, it dries relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>It is extremely refreshing and leaves your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Just a light scent that goes away in a short time and your face feels great and of course no burn at all..</li>
            <li>It is filled with soothing organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This has an extremely light scent.  </li>
            <li>I was taken aback at how light it is.  </li>
            <li>and it does leave your face feeling smooth and moist.   </li>
            <li>Gets rid of residue and has light moisturisation.  </li>
            <li>I squirt some in the palm of my hand, rub them together and smooth it on my face.  </li>
            <li>If I put it on straight, it sometimes feels a bit sticky after a while, in warm weather anyway.  </li>
            <li>Do you like an instant cooling effect after a not so great shave?</li>
            <li>I liked this so much</li>
            <li>It has a light orange smell.</li>
            <li>really enjoy this product, and so will you.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and goes away in minutes, literally.</li>
            <li>but  would like a version that the great smell last.</li>
            <li>A bit light for my liking.</li>
            <li>Almost fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>Great on face, not much of a lasting smell, bets this is Dean Martin used it.</li>
            <li>I have to say this has really helped my complexion and does a nice job with Clubman product in toning and moisturizing my face after shaving and washing.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the way my face feels after using the product.</li>
            <li>*enjoy</li>
            <li>Lightly scented (citrus) and soothing upon application.</li>
            <li>It has a light aroma but isn&#x27;t a cologne.</li>
            <li>No alcohol, and paraben free.</li>
            <li>Nice scent, although it would be nice if it would last longer!</li>
            <li>In contrast, I love the lavender smell of AoS, but more importantly it lasts for probably an hour (haven&#x27;t paid too much attention to when it stops smelling).  </li>
            <li>whenever I think of shaving, I look forward most to applying Lucky Tiger on my fresh, clean face!</li>
            <li>I also love the very light and easy to live with scent.  </li>
            <li>It smells very fresh</li>
            <li>The scent is very fresh and citrus.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and the clean, fresh feeling it leaves me with.  </li>
            <li>zero reactions, mild and semi-citrus scent, alcohol free, great ingredients, packaging, 8 oz will last awhile  </li>
            <li>But if you want to use something that makes your face feel smooth and clean, this is for you.</li>
            <li>Nice change from the 4711 I normally use.</li>
            <li>I generally switch between this and Clubman, an equally good aftershave.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a shot!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great quality, as I said, and the company has a rich heritage judging from the included literature.</li>
            <li>I use this almost everyday, and its great for anyone who likes a very light aftershave.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get any better than this for that clean crisp finish.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Lucky Tiger after shave.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy how my Lucky Tiger shave tonic leaves my face feeling.</li>
            <li>The light herbal fragrance fades quickly so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with any scent you might wish to wear.</li>
            <li>It goes on light and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fortunate to have made the Lucky Tiger&#x27;s acquaintance.</li>
            <li>Light &amp;#34;orange/citrus&amp;#34; smell that fades fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I certainly don&#x27;t wish to have more of that on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shave tonic takes me to my special place when I splash it on my face after shaving.  </li>
            <li>I really like it, mild fruit scent, and is very light..</li>
            <li>Actually really liked this for a nearly non scented aftershave.</li>
            <li>Feels good and soothing on your face, the smell is naturally citrus,very nice, and fades away in five or ten minutes.  </li>
            <li>It helps cool and comfort your skin with its aloe formula.</li>
            <li>preference is Pinaud Clubman because I like a cool feeling on my face after a shave.</li>
            <li>I was in need of a good after shave and after extensive research I purchased this one.  </li>
            <li>I will buy this again, and agin probably then all you will now how cool it is and I will have to use something else.</li>
            <li>By definition, true witch hazel contains 14% alcohol.</li>
            <li>Excellent for the summer as it is not greasy or thick.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, but just doesn&#x27;t suit my tastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lucky Tiger is very soothing and refreshing on the face after a shave.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and refreshing, a natural product that is absorbed quickly without residue of any kind.</li>
            <li>Great product, as with other users I wish it came in a glass bottle.</li>
            <li>others all have alcohol and give you that familiar cooling, fresh, astringent sensation.</li>
            <li>Its got a fresh clean citrus smell that I find invigorating</li>
            <li>It leaves a clean feeling and helps to calm and soothe skin after shaving.  </li>
            <li>After reading a bunch of glowing reviews, I decided to give Lucky Tiger</li>
            <li>I use this in combination with the Lucky Tiger shaving lotion.</li>
            <li>If you read Lucky Tiger&#x27;s promotional material, the smell is meant to dissipate.</li>
            <li>I received my bottle of Lucky Tiger</li>
            <li>but my wife remembers seeing Lucky Tiger when she was a child.  </li>
            <li>I have used Lucky Tiger (LT) and the Art of Shaving (AoS)(Lavender scent).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Lucky Tiger for about four months now.</li>
            <li>how Lucky Tiger</li>
            <li>I shave with a DE razor and Lucky Tiger</li>
            <li>The fragrance is gone quickly, allowing one to apply cologne without worry of the odors clashing.</li>
            <li>I use Lucky Tiger Head to Tail Deodorant and Body Spray.  </li>
            <li>If you just want your aftershave to sooth you and then not smell, you have found it in Lucky Tiger.</li>
            <li>but the scent disappears quickly so if you don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li>This tonic/aftershave is great, it smells great,helps heal the nicks and cools and heals the razor burn and slowly goes away and is not a overpowering smell, I love it and would recommend</li>
            <li>Lucky Tiger takes those preconceived notions a throws them out</li>
            <li>I have used Lucky Tiger</li>
            <li>and she is often quick to judge my aftershaves.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the fact that this tonic has a mild scent that dissipates quickly so it doesn&#x27;t clash with any cologne.</li>
            <li>The reason for four stars is the scent dies away quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t fulfill the Lucky Tiger brand promise at all.</li>
            <li>Would you expect a plastic bottle from Lucky Tiger?  </li>
            <li>Lucky Tiger....</li>
            <li>I purchased the Lucky Tiger</li>
            <li>While I like the feel of the Lucky Tiger</li>
            <li>Try this with the Lucky Tiger liquid cream shave.  </li>
            <li>Although it dissipates rather quickly, the pungent odor is a wake up in itself.</li>
            <li>There is a very pleasant and light orange aroma that doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling cool and fresh.</li>
            <li>The scent does not linger long which could be a good thing depending on what you are looking for.</li>
            <li>1bottle lasts quite a long time and it smells good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the orange fragrance, but it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>smell reminds me exactly of Mr. Clean floor cleaner or Pine-Sol.</li>
            <li>Clean, moisturizing and exactly what I had read about here.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately lucky tiger (as great of a product as I think it is) doesn&#x27;t really cut it for me, but for those who just want a very minimal quality tonic to slap on their face it might be your jam.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and really soothes your face after a shave.  </li>
            <li>I love this natural after shave&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>but it is quickly absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Both of those complaints are true, which is exactly why I like this</li>
            <li>well worth it IMO.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s by far the most skin calming aftershave product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It tightens up my skin, beats razor burn and leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Not much else to say - the results are just darn good.</li>
            <li>For the price, this is far better than the Khiels and TOBS after shaves that I have been paying for.</li>
            <li>This product is an old barber shop favorite, and I can see why.</li>
            <li>Has a nice, mild citrus fragance that doesn&#x27;t linger too long,  </li>
            <li>This product got good reviews and some said that the scent was very light and did not last long</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying Lucky Tiger</li>
            <li>It is soothing to put on your face right after you shave, and it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol so it doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li>They were right.  </li>
            <li>Use it after every shave, right after alum block, and before TOBS Mr. Taylor&#x27;s Aftershave  Balm.</li>
            <li>Delivery right on time.</li>
            <li>for razor burn, but not necessarily ingrowns (First Aid Beauty Radiance Pads is amazing for that).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve started using baxter of california which for me provides more moisture and a stronger scent as well as a cooling action that burns at first but provides relief to razor</li>
            <li>I am seventy years of age, and remember the barbershop tonics of years back, my favorite was Lucky Tiger.....</li>
            <li>others have said, the pleasant citrus aroma is only temporary, so if you or someone close to you is sensitive to smells, no worries.</li>
            <li>was I ever surprised and pleasantly taken back when it arrived</li>
            <li>my face look great and no more irritation from the razor blade&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The scent is so clean and pleasant, but it only lasts a very short time.  </li>
            <li>The smell is great but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t whether it actually physically does any good, but I do know that a small splash of this product on my face and neck after shaving really feels good</li>
            <li>However, the smell is intiatly very suttle and pleasent but it fades quickly.</li>
            <li>Since, I retired a couple of years ago, I have made shaving a passion, only recently throwing away my canned shave gel in favor of a great brush and quality shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I just recently got into wet shaving again after many years of fighting with an electric razor and am in the process of sampling many products to find the optimal set for myself; also because it&#x27;s fun, I actually enjoy shaving nowadays.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, precondition your facial skin on a daily basis or after a shave</li>
            <li>If you want something mostly natural and easy on the skin, try this.</li>
            <li>Between the Anthony Logistics Rush shower gel, and Lucky Tiger, you&#x27;re alert and ready to tackle the day.</li>
            <li>A non-alcohol based aftershave splash... not a strong fragrance, but it&#x27;s pleasant.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re most concerned about keeping your face smooth and soft over the long run, you might prefer Lucky</li>
            <li>I INTENSELY don&#x27;t like it!  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says: soothe and refresh.</li>
            <li>Overall, they are all excellent, however, they are naturally different in various ways, so one&#x27;s taste may cause a preference for one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I truly love starting my mornings with a close shave finished with a splash of this.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love this after shave following shaving my head</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried dozens of different aftershaves and this now my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It smells to me exactly like Goo Gone</li>
            <li>First time I have tried this</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would have minded the smell when you first apply it lingering, but it does not.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I use this when my wife doesn&#x27;t want me smelling like an old man or a cheap whore.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned at first</li>
            <li>First time I used it</li>
            <li>Lucky Tiger is a classic.</li>
            <li>After Shave when my first bottle of Clubman Bay Rum was almost finished.  </li>
            <li>like is fully aware that it is just lemon scented aftershave.  </li>
            <li>Great scent,  doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fresh and leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>so far from the truth!!!!</li>
            <li>Other reviews say that there is a very light smell and that it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m using C.O. Bigelow shave cream along with Proraso pre-shave for sensitive skin and then finishing with Lucky Tiger.  </li>
            <li>this smells like oranges and is so far from the original &amp;#34;barbershop smell&amp;#34; that I remember.  </li>
            <li>I love the light citrus smell and it fades away very quickly not interfering with aftershaves.</li>
            <li>while it is not a scent that will last all day, it does feels very cool on my skin.</li>
            <li>if this is supposed to do anything positive to your face after a shave, it does not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I really needed a little more moisture and immediate face tingle than lucky tiger is giving me right now.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been using long, but glad I went with this: low-fragrance, soothing after-shave.</li>
            <li>The sweet scent is unexpected but I like it a lot.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d say if you are looking for a new product this is worth a try.</li>
            <li>To say, according to the manufacturer, that they copied the old recipe for the Lucky Tiger</li>
            <li>But, PLEASE, don&#x27;t advertise this product as a copy of the OLD Lucky Tiger.....</li>
            <li>Personally, I do not want a strong smell to irritate my skin or clash with my cologne.</li>
            <li>Large amount for the price.</li>
            <li>The witch hazel and other ingredients calms any mild irritation very quickly without stinging.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a manly old school after shave, Lucky Tiger is not a Proraso or Musgo Real.</li>
            <li>One of the main complaints people had about this aftershave was its lack of scent, which is exactly what my husband likes about the smell.  </li>
            <li>I still love how it feels right after a shave, and after a half hour or so, I then put on my aftershave that will carry me through the day for smell.</li>
            <li>If you are one of those guys, you really should consider picking just one smell (your office mates</li>
            <li>/&gt;Clearly, this is not for everybody, but I really like it.</li>
            <li>The ingredients in this are very healing and soothing.</li>
            <li>I mention this because the review will really be helped by their contrast.   </li>
            <li>The semi-dryness of the face causes the cuts to hurt when you move your face since the skin isn&#x27;t very stretchable.</li>
            <li>Really does help with nicks or razor burn.</li>
            <li>It is practically odorless, so it doesn&#x27;t preclude the use of cologne, and I&#x27;ve never had razor burn after using this and my Merkel straight blade.</li>
            <li>Mod: no stinging  Con: doesn&#x27;t work as an aftershave  </li>
            <li>It really smooths and refreshes my skin and calms the irritation and razor bumps.</li>
            <li>I like using this after shave because it sooths the skin really well and does not leave a sent.</li>
            <li>Also, seller processed / shipped item very promptly.</li>
            <li>To tell you the truth I was actually really disapointed when I opened the box</li>
            <li>it just doesnt really have that wake up kick in the pants to get you</li>
            <li>This is a very soothing aftershave.  </li>
            <li>glue remover (very orange),</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a wet shaver and this is my favorite aftershave.  </li>
            <li>really does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blend of organics really keeps my face feeling comfy after a shave.</li>
            <li>I would rather that it soothes my face after a close shave and completes the whole process.</li>
            <li>It also last a lot and leaves the silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it is doing all that much for my skin after shaving.  </li>
            <li>It really helps with razor burn.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to any shaver!</li>
            <li>I use a badger hair brush, Proraso shave soap, and a Feather straight razor.</li>
            <li>You will not be that one guy at work that, embarrassingly, wears way too much cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really?  </li>
            <li>no matter how much you use....within reason.  </li>
            <li>It would be soooo much cooler.</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>It is gentle.</li>
            <li>and I really like how it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think this does much of anything.</li>
            <li>One was exotic sounding and amazingly had some good reviews but turned out to be the worst smelling &amp;#34;anything&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever made opened in my house!</li>
            <li>All I can say is I wish this after shave was readily available in my local area.</li>
            <li>So when you normally get that &amp;#34;clean/fresh&amp;#34; (some of you may call it &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34;) sensation</li>
            <li>or if it really does anything.</li>
            <li>It is nice an soothing for my face and the orange scent dissapates after just a few minutes.</li>
            <li>and I so far am enjoying the smell but am not totally sold on this yet.</li>
            <li>A little goes along ways, smooths over your face easily with no greasy, oily feeling, absorbs in quickly leaving no trace..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this aftershave a couple of times but so far I enjoy it very much.  </li>
            <li>husband likes this better than any other aftershave balm</li>
            <li>It smells mostly like oranges, but there is also a hint of other citrus/floral.</li>
            <li>At first, it didn&#x27;t appeal to me and I was glad it dissipated in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I got a bottle for my brother who also uses a straight razor like I do,, highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>only complaint is that the wonderful smell doesn&#x27;t last too much.</li>
            <li>A pleasant (though weak) citrus scent.  </li>
            <li>Nowhere near the old Lucky Tiger</li>
            <li>scent is light and doesn&#x27;t linger too long</li>
            <li>my favorite aftershave there is no second place, its ingredients are just what you need after a shave, a smaller presentation would be appreciated</li>
            <li>But even if I liked the smell, you get approximately 2 minutes to enjoy it until it&#x27;s completely gone.</li>
            <li>There is a moisterizer in this product, but my face is usually pretty dry in the winter time, so I use a moisterizer after applying Lucky Tiger.  </li>
            <li>so the whole process in new to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using Proraso (when I&#x27;m paying for it) and The Gentlemens Refinery (when I receive it as a gift), and put the Lucky Tiger back on the shelf.</li>
            <li>I, personally, prefer the alcohol based splashes, they calm my skin very well.</li>
            <li>Not only does it spread more evenly, it goes further, and I prefer it \\&quot;thinned down\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>will definitely still use the rest of this product, but may search for something a bit more invigorating the next time I&#x27;m shopping for an aftershave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However if you want your aftershave to have a scent, Lucky Tiger is likely not for you.</li>
            <li>I have read about Lucky Tiger for years on shaving forums and finally decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>Not very pungent, but does provide a nice initial citrus smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through more bottles and tubes of more expensive aftershaves, balms, and whatnot, looking for something I like</li>
            <li>This aftershave has absolutely no burn to it thanks to the alcohol free formula.</li>
            <li>This is one of this products main ingredients.</li>
            <li>To get the original after shave one has to know where to go to get the original, now made over seas by a small company who has the rights to make it.</li>
            <li>high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I must be highly allergic to this potion.  </li>
            <li>Also the price is too high in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like the burn of some AS.  </li>
            <li>but i just wish it had more oomph, maybe a liitle tingle of a bit of a burn or a little stronger scent, its just a prefference thing but because it has a fruit/sweet scent to it</li>
            <li>little to no burn after applying, doesn&#x27;t smell half-bad,  and clears up most razor burn and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>The first part of this review is to basically sate how this tonic has saved me on two major occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Today my arm looks a lot better with little to no redness or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Witch hazel is a natural skin treatment whose benefits were known before the advent of modern medicine.  </li>
            <li>I use this product everyday after I shave, and I love how it soothes my skin.  </li>
            <li>Most people hear &amp;#34;after shave&amp;#34; and they immediately think Old Spice or Brut (I&#x27;m not much of a Brut fan, but if you don&#x27;t like Old Spice</li>
            <li>Only downside is the cost, but still well worth it.</li>
            <li>Wakes up your skin, and your senses, with it&#x27;s scent and fresh feeling (on my 3rd bottle)</li>
            <li>No complaint about the product itself give it a try</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant fragrance that is very subtle.</li>
            <li>: You&#x27;ll need to apply a balm in addition to this, because it has no moisturizing qualities, the smell doesn&#x27;t last long, and although clears up most skin irritation, it doesn&#x27;t clear it ALL up - at least in my experience, but if we&#x27;re honest nothing</li>
            <li>Hardly any scent and the good feeling does not last more than a few moments.  </li>
            <li>The effectiveness of this product is pretty decent, the scent mild and unobtrusive and dissipates within a few minutes of application.  </li>
            <li>This has found a new home in my shave den and will be a staple of it for years to come.</li>
            <li>Lucky Tiger actually seems to make small nicks and cuts bleed more, not less.  </li>
            <li>The orange smell dissipates nearly immediately, which is fine because I wanted it for other reasons then smell.  </li>
            <li>I like the smell very much although it disappears in several minutes.</li>
            <li>The bottle is plastic but looks very classy.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I usually do not have the patience to prepare for my shave.</li>
            <li>After Shave for the past 5 years, and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>This is a simple review, I tried Lucky Tiger based on the other reviews I read, they were right.</li>
            <li>The smell fades almost as fast as it dries so you can use a cologne or other fragrance right over it no problem.</li>
            <li>It has a light citrus scent that doesn&#x27;t last too long and won&#x27;t clash with your cologne.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-It is a bit too mild for me, its not really a con</li>
            <li>During the summer I will probably just dust a little clubman talc on my chest and neck and be fine after applying this.  </li>
            <li>And I would know if it would, I live in Alabama and we are currently experiencing very humid, 90+ degree evenings.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>After Shave Balm works even better, but is way too expensive compared to Proraso or Lucky Tiger.  </li>
            <li>Over the last year or so, I have bought and used five different after shave lotions - Lucky Tiger, Proraso, Pinaud Clubman, and Captain&#x27;s Choice (Bay Rum and Sandalwood).</li>
            <li>I prefer aftershaves with a little more of a burn and lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>It does leave the face feeling smooth and does not dry the face out (due to lack of alcohol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It soothes my skin, It has almost no aroma which I like, and it makes your skin soft, besides it does not sting.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>is by far</li>
            <li>Old school label.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always prefered Aqua Velva, Old Spice, and the Bay Rum&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>not like grandpa&#x27;s Old Spice.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it uses all natural ingredients and the smell echoes that.  </li>
            <li>The biggest thing is that, it being made of natural oils and ingredients, doesn&#x27;t burn your face when you apply it.</li>
            <li>Since I got old as the hills, I thought I would try this old-fashioned product</li>
            <li>Aloe is another well-known natural healer for the skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product since I was seven years old.  </li>
            <li>I like the scent, the performance and the style of the packaging as it has that old fashioned medicine look to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Natural.</li>
            <li>If you like citrus, and you are conscious of what you put on and in your body buy it.</li>
            <li>I have never been one with frequent ingrown or irritations, but I haven&#x27;t had ANY since using this.</li>
            <li>Without the witch hazel, it would not heal nearly as well.&lt;br /&gt;2:</li>
            <li>I have found that it is very oily, initially.</li>
            <li>All natural ingredients, replaces witch hazel for me.</li>
            <li>I prefer Clubman products over this by far.</li>
            <li>But for me, Clubman product far exceed Luck Tiger shave and face</li>
            <li>Nice- not great or anything-</li>
            <li>Always thought that I would need more of a thick lotion for this job but</li>
            <li>This aftershave tonic is one of the more gentle ones I&#x27;ve found, very little or no alcohol content to burn and dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>Aside from that minor issue, this is a fantastic aftershave oil to use if you&#x27;re fed up with alcohol-based aftershaves burning your face and leaving it dry.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, Luck Tiger now markets many of their products in the smaller bottle, not the original 8 oz.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is true for all non-lotion aftershaves, but Lucky Tiger has no moisturizing component to it, so a half hour down the road</li>
            <li>An after shave that has graced many an old fashioned barber shop and rockabilly&#x27;s routine since 1935.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell has a solid citrus base and is very refreshing.</li>
            <li>, if i am on a fresh blade i find that my face feels pretty dry by about lunch where some other after shave products</li>
            <li>No alcohol, is light and not oily at all, Only need very little as it applies very well.</li>
            <li>Also, when an after shave causes any razor burns and minor cuts to sting, I feel like I am doing something positive to treat them,</li>
            <li>I love that there is a subtle smell that does not carry through the day.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t claim one thing on the packaging and then do the exact opposite in the actual ingredients.</li>
            <li>That is actually the main reason I DO like it.</li>
            <li>This is a must if you are getting into classic safety razor shaving such as myself.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as a gift for any male in your family.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why it is not more available in drug stores.  </li>
            <li>To soon to leave product info other then saying scent is nice and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>new part of my aftershave rotation and a definite reorder</li>
            <li>I never had a shave so close before and will never go back to the new razors.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m male, early 30s, combination, olive-toned skin that isn&#x27;t sensitive or acne prone.   </li>
            <li>The only problem is it&#x27;s too expensive like all of the AoS products (they are good though).</li>
            <li>(The way I generally prefer my aftershave products to be.)  </li>
            <li>I especially like the fact that it uses natural ingredients to do its job.  </li>
            <li>The initial scent is an orange/citrus but is all but undetectable after about 3 or 4 minutes, so it will never interfere with a cologne, or to keep you completely unscented if that is your thing.</li>
            <li>This smells barely like citrus on application, then fades</li>
            <li>I just started wet shaving with a straight razor</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soothing and smells nice even if it&#x27;s faint.</li>
            <li>Every after shave I used prior to this would really irritate my skin and cause it to dry.  </li>
            <li>This product is alright - in my opinion not worthy of all the hype and stellar 5-star reviews.  </li>
            <li>For comparison, Proraso After Shave Balm soothes the skin as well as Lucky Tiger, but also tends to stop small weeping nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>Even though I knew before making the purchase that the scent is very fast to dissipate, I still wish that the scent would like a little longer.</li>
            <li>bottle for the price though, larger than a $5 thing of Old Spice, it would probably last me 6 mo - 1 yr.</li>
            <li>Love the feel and the citrus smell but very subtle and in 15 to 20 minutes, the fragrance is gone gone gone.</li>
            <li>second major save</li>
            <li>It is a very light and subtle orange smell that won&#x27;t cause other people to block their nose when you enter the room.</li>
            <li>I use this from November to April when sensitive skin gets dry and unruly.</li>
            <li>This is good or bad.</li>

            <li> It feels great going on the skin.</li>
            <li> Great aftershave.</li>
            <li> A great summer choice.</li>
            <li> but it is a great product.  </li>
            <li> Feels great.</li>
            <li> Has a great citrusy smell but doesn&#x27;t have any alcohol.</li>
            <li> The close shave does irritate the skins a bit and this tonic makes your face feel great after a shave.  </li>
            <li> It smells great and doesn&#x27;t sting since there&#x27;s no alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> Great citrus-orange smell that fades away after about 30 seconds by design.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still great as intro intended, post shave.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great</li>
            <li> Great Combo.  </li>
            <li> Amazing on my skin and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Stuff is soothing, very nice.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice premium product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on the face!</li>
            <li> Good after shave for great feeling skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a pleasant finishing touch to a morning shave.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent, will not over power</li>
            <li> Very Pleasant and refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve always steered towards the Bay Rum aftershaves-but you know sometimes change is a good thing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but needs something else.</li>
            <li> It was all good until you added this.</li>
            <li> If you like a splash but don&#x27;t want the burn of an alcohol based aftershave then this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> My suggestion would be to follow up with some good cologne or maybe even throw on some stronger aftershave after words.</li>
            <li> but for those that don&#x27;t this is also a good alternative.</li>
            <li> It has just the amount of scent and feels really good on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to like it, now, maybe because I associate it with the good results.  </li>
            <li> Lack of stinging indicates fewer burns and cuts meaning that I&#x27;ve given myself a good shave.</li>
            <li> Smells good but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Shipping and packaging were on time and good as well.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy, at all, so that&#x27;s good for me because I have an oily face</li>
            <li> Good product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s a good thing as it allows you to apply cologne if that&#x27;s what you want.  </li>
            <li> oh so good...</li>
            <li> This good for using cologne</li>
            <li> Good product; timely shipping.</li>
            <li> It may be good for your skin according to label.</li>
            <li> I would like to try a good bay rum w/ lime aftershave.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good for your face and doesn&#x27;t burn when applied.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a cologne kind of guy, but it makes my face feel great after a shave</li>
            <li> This a good tonic and aftershave.</li>
            <li> Wakes your skin up, and just makes it feel good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll do good things for your face.</li>
            <li> Felt so good on my face I doubled up.</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> Seller did good job in its description of product.</li>
            <li> Also perfect every day wear that dissipates quickly and</li>
            <li> Very light lemon scent, does a great job of healing your face after shaving.</li>
            <li> It is very refreshing</li>
            <li> Very refreshing after the shave.</li>
            <li> I love topping off this with a great premium scent.</li>
            <li> This is a great aftershave for people that don&#x27;t like the overpowering smell of most aftershaves.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very refreshing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.. not as great as some of the reviews i read.</li>
            <li> It does leave the face looking and feeling good after a shave, but it kind of leaves my mug asking, &amp;#34;Where&#x27;s the tingle?&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love this after shave!</li>
            <li> One of my all time favorite after shaves!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered two more bottles!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product - painless, soothing tonic that doesn&#x27;t strip out moisture, leaves my face feeling clean and hydrated for most of the day.</li>
            <li> Great stuff if you don&#x27;t like a strong smell or burning of alcohol.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> Great, light, citrusy aroma.</li>
            <li> If you use a quality shave cream or paste, you have yourself a nice combination.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging</li>
            <li> My husband uses this and it has a nice, non-over powering scent while providing relief from razor burn.</li>
            <li> It has a nice mellow citrus scent.</li>
            <li> It has a nice citrus smell.  </li>
            <li> In all honestly it looked quite ghastly and it stung quite a bit.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a bummer if you like the orange smell (and why wouldn&#x27;t you?), but it&#x27;s nice in that it won&#x27;t clash with any cologne you want to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The scent is nice.</li>
            <li> Really the best after shave ever!</li>
            <li> It does smell nice</li>
            <li> But the bottle looks nice.</li>
            <li> Buy the stuff and then buy a nice perfume bottle to hold it</li>
            <li> Moisturizes the skin nicely after shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 and for most of my life I have usually favored a mainstream but nice after shave most of my life but</li>
            <li> Nice toning effect.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job cooling the face after shaving though.</li>
            <li> and I was very pleased with mostly everything about this aftershave.</li>
            <li> I will use it fairly often, but my druthers is for a more bracing aftershave most of the time.</li>
            <li> a good product maybe just not for me, it doesn&#x27;t really have that &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; that makes something great for me, it leaves me looking at it</li>
            <li> Lucky Tiger  works great.  </li>
            <li> It very easily rubs in and leaves no oily residue.</li>
            <li> Good Lucky Tiger!</li>
            <li> This is a nice, refreshing astringent, but if you&#x27;re looking for a scent that lasts a while, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect and my my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Lucky Tiger has a very pleasant, very light scent that dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am new(er) to straight razor shaving and have had my fair share of nicks and fairly good cuts.</li>
            <li> Great alcohol free aftershave at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, very refreshing after a 3-pass shave.</li>
            <li> extremely light citrus scent, very refreshing.</li>
            <li> Fine after shave, no alcohol!</li>
            <li> This is a very light liquid aftershave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very smooth, no burn, aftershave tonic that does what it&#x27;s meant to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soothing, very light not oily consistency.</li>
            <li> Very light lemony fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very good smell of sweet and fresh orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lucky Tiger is a good toner that soothes my face after a shave.</li>
            <li> Good choice for those looking for mild aftershave products.</li>
            <li> of the products are marvelous, very gentle and fine quality, making my morning shaving routine a special treat</li>
            <li> Has a citrus mandarin scent which I love.</li>
            <li> Love this product for post-shave and have made it part of my routine.  </li>
            <li> The stuff is magic.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after the shave.</li>
            <li> Has a nice fragrance to it and is light.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and no burn, will be keeping in stock.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know if you can get any better.  </li>
            <li> I love citrus notes and this is packed with it.</li>
            <li> Though, it doesn&#x27;t feel any better than the AoS, which is just as soothing.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m on the search for an aftershave that is more like AoS but with a cheaper price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably the most like a skin conditioner.</li>
            <li> Its aloe vera plus I suspect witch hazel are what make me say it is most like a skin conditioner.</li>
            <li> I would say that Pinaud Clubman is the most astringent and cooling, followed by Proraso, Clubman&#x27;s Bay Rum, and Clubman&#x27;s Sandalwood.</li>
            <li> even if another after shave might help them heal better without your feeling anything.</li>
            <li> So, the more astringency the better for me.</li>
            <li> So I guess I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect when I purchased this.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a more invigorating feeling on my face; one that I&#x27;d expect from an alcohol-based product or a menthol-based product.</li>
            <li> my favorite of all aftershaves</li>
            <li> There is a nice citrus scent that is light and does not linger.</li>
            <li> do a bit better of a job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, if you are looking for a soothing, non-alcoholic aftershave, you will probably love this one.</li>
            <li> have been using this for about 2 years and it is my favorite aftershave period.  </li>
            <li> love this after shave.</li>
            <li> I then apply it to my face for a soothing and refreshing finish to my morning shave.</li>
            <li> I did put it in 2 oz spray bottle for better distribution.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better things I have bought online.</li>
            <li> The scent is just so refreshing, reminds me of a tropical breeze blowing in my face.</li>
            <li> I love the smell when applied</li>
            <li> -all, one of my favorite aftershaves I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> but if it was a bit more potent it would be better, just my opinion though.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite aftershave.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Eh..., there are better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Would you like your favorite Whiskey to arrive in a plastic bottle?</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> Why so many after-shave makers go for these plastic bottles is something I just don&#x27;t understand.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> but I have to admit that it feels more like a tonic to apply to heal your face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Better like the smell.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to make sure anyone who is buying it to know what it smells</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews wanted to go on and on about how fresh it smells and how good it is for their skin</li>
            <li> (plus I get to remember the lovely lady to gave them to me).</li>
            <li> I love the safety razor.  </li>
            <li> However, for me, the product is just ok.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth product made with plant extracts.  </li>
            <li> I plan to buy more when needed.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love with it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> it is  a refreshing face soother and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased that I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff...</li>
            <li> things to know:&lt;br /&gt;-Alcohol free!  </li>
            <li> If it was a bit stronger and had more &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34; (i.e. lasted longer) that would be preferable.&lt;br /&gt;-Big</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure</li>
            <li> but rather a nice clean non biting aftershave.  </li>
            <li> Great citrus scent, sooths fresh razor irritation quickly with zero burning.</li>
            <li> It has a very light citrus fragrance that fades away very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This was saddening at first because it smells so darn good.</li>
            <li> First this is not a product with alcohol, which is good because it dries the skin.</li>
            <li> This feels good when first applied but that is all.  </li>
            <li> great, little orange and citrus splash after a shave really a great way to start the day</li>
            <li> Smells great, but that smell goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of citrusy and disperses after about ten minutes, so this is a great product if you don&#x27;t like strong scents.  </li>
            <li> I really love Lucky Tiger after shave and tonic!</li>
            <li> Great light citrus smell, provide a nice post-shave refreshment and definitely soothes the skin and reduce irritation.</li>
            <li> I love the bottle and the light orange scent this product has.</li>
            <li> The smell is classic and pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have tried many types of shaving balms but Lucky Tiger is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> This is a great after-shave I have used for probably ten years or more.</li>
            <li> Trust me, you do not want a strong smell for your after shave, cologne, deodorant, soap, and everything else you put on your body.</li>
            <li> It is strongly citrusy, yet the scent goes away within minutes.</li>
            <li> Leaves no overly strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> My wife says it is &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34;, but not too strong.</li>
            <li> that strong of a scent.  </li>
            <li> I love it, my wife has never sniffed and rubbed up on me more right after a shave.  </li>
            <li> Not oily at all, which is great for me because I live in a VERY hot, humid climate, and am outdoors quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> Along with a Badger Hair brush &amp; good shaving soap, this is a new must-have for my shaving routine now.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I find myself reaching for it more and more in hot weather.</li>
            <li> But Lucky Tiger now is probably my favorite aftershave.</li>
            <li> and I love that the smell goes away quickly so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my cologne.</li>
            <li> But this suff works well to help it heal more quickly.</li>
            <li> It is Vegan safe, it smells like citrus, it dries relatively quickly.</li>
            <li> It is extremely refreshing and leaves your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Just a light scent that goes away in a short time and your face feels great and of course no burn at all..</li>
            <li> It is filled with soothing organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> This has an extremely light scent.  </li>
            <li> I was taken aback at how light it is.  </li>
            <li> and it does leave your face feeling smooth and moist.   </li>
            <li> Gets rid of residue and has light moisturisation.  </li>
            <li> I squirt some in the palm of my hand, rub them together and smooth it on my face.  </li>
            <li> If I put it on straight, it sometimes feels a bit sticky after a while, in warm weather anyway.  </li>
            <li> Do you like an instant cooling effect after a not so great shave?</li>
            <li> I liked this so much</li>
            <li> It has a light orange smell.</li>
            <li> really enjoy this product, and so will you.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and goes away in minutes, literally.</li>
            <li> but  would like a version that the great smell last.</li>
            <li> A bit light for my liking.</li>
            <li> Almost fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> Great on face, not much of a lasting smell, bets this is Dean Martin used it.</li>
            <li> I have to say this has really helped my complexion and does a nice job with Clubman product in toning and moisturizing my face after shaving and washing.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the way my face feels after using the product.</li>
            <li> *enjoy</li>
            <li> Lightly scented (citrus) and soothing upon application.</li>
            <li> It has a light aroma but isn&#x27;t a cologne.</li>
            <li> No alcohol, and paraben free.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, although it would be nice if it would last longer!</li>
            <li> In contrast, I love the lavender smell of AoS, but more importantly it lasts for probably an hour (haven&#x27;t paid too much attention to when it stops smelling).  </li>
            <li> whenever I think of shaving, I look forward most to applying Lucky Tiger on my fresh, clean face!</li>
            <li> I also love the very light and easy to live with scent.  </li>
            <li> It smells very fresh</li>
            <li> The scent is very fresh and citrus.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell and the clean, fresh feeling it leaves me with.  </li>
            <li> zero reactions, mild and semi-citrus scent, alcohol free, great ingredients, packaging, 8 oz will last awhile  </li>
            <li> But if you want to use something that makes your face feel smooth and clean, this is for you.</li>
            <li> Nice change from the 4711 I normally use.</li>
            <li> I generally switch between this and Clubman, an equally good aftershave.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a shot!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great quality, as I said, and the company has a rich heritage judging from the included literature.</li>
            <li> I use this almost everyday, and its great for anyone who likes a very light aftershave.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get any better than this for that clean crisp finish.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Lucky Tiger after shave.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy how my Lucky Tiger shave tonic leaves my face feeling.</li>
            <li> The light herbal fragrance fades quickly so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with any scent you might wish to wear.</li>
            <li> It goes on light and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fortunate to have made the Lucky Tiger&#x27;s acquaintance.</li>
            <li> Light &amp;#34;orange/citrus&amp;#34; smell that fades fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I certainly don&#x27;t wish to have more of that on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shave tonic takes me to my special place when I splash it on my face after shaving.  </li>
            <li> I really like it, mild fruit scent, and is very light..</li>
            <li> Actually really liked this for a nearly non scented aftershave.</li>
            <li> Feels good and soothing on your face, the smell is naturally citrus,very nice, and fades away in five or ten minutes.  </li>
            <li> It helps cool and comfort your skin with its aloe formula.</li>
            <li> preference is Pinaud Clubman because I like a cool feeling on my face after a shave.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a good after shave and after extensive research I purchased this one.  </li>
            <li> I will buy this again, and agin probably then all you will now how cool it is and I will have to use something else.</li>
            <li> By definition, true witch hazel contains 14% alcohol.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the summer as it is not greasy or thick.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, but just doesn&#x27;t suit my tastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lucky Tiger is very soothing and refreshing on the face after a shave.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and refreshing, a natural product that is absorbed quickly without residue of any kind.</li>
            <li> Great product, as with other users I wish it came in a glass bottle.</li>
            <li> others all have alcohol and give you that familiar cooling, fresh, astringent sensation.</li>
            <li> Its got a fresh clean citrus smell that I find invigorating</li>
            <li> It leaves a clean feeling and helps to calm and soothe skin after shaving.  </li>
            <li> After reading a bunch of glowing reviews, I decided to give Lucky Tiger</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with the Lucky Tiger shaving lotion.</li>
            <li> If you read Lucky Tiger&#x27;s promotional material, the smell is meant to dissipate.</li>
            <li> I received my bottle of Lucky Tiger</li>
            <li> but my wife remembers seeing Lucky Tiger when she was a child.  </li>
            <li> I have used Lucky Tiger (LT) and the Art of Shaving (AoS)(Lavender scent).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lucky Tiger for about four months now.</li>
            <li> how Lucky Tiger</li>
            <li> I shave with a DE razor and Lucky Tiger</li>
            <li> The fragrance is gone quickly, allowing one to apply cologne without worry of the odors clashing.</li>
            <li> I use Lucky Tiger Head to Tail Deodorant and Body Spray.  </li>
            <li> If you just want your aftershave to sooth you and then not smell, you have found it in Lucky Tiger.</li>
            <li> but the scent disappears quickly so if you don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> This tonic/aftershave is great, it smells great,helps heal the nicks and cools and heals the razor burn and slowly goes away and is not a overpowering smell, I love it and would recommend</li>
            <li> Lucky Tiger takes those preconceived notions a throws them out</li>
            <li> I have used Lucky Tiger</li>
            <li> and she is often quick to judge my aftershaves.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the fact that this tonic has a mild scent that dissipates quickly so it doesn&#x27;t clash with any cologne.</li>
            <li> The reason for four stars is the scent dies away quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t fulfill the Lucky Tiger brand promise at all.</li>
            <li> Would you expect a plastic bottle from Lucky Tiger?  </li>
            <li> Lucky Tiger....</li>
            <li> I purchased the Lucky Tiger</li>
            <li> While I like the feel of the Lucky Tiger</li>
            <li> Try this with the Lucky Tiger liquid cream shave.  </li>
            <li> Although it dissipates rather quickly, the pungent odor is a wake up in itself.</li>
            <li> There is a very pleasant and light orange aroma that doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your face feeling cool and fresh.</li>
            <li> The scent does not linger long which could be a good thing depending on what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> 1bottle lasts quite a long time and it smells good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the orange fragrance, but it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> smell reminds me exactly of Mr. Clean floor cleaner or Pine-Sol.</li>
            <li> Clean, moisturizing and exactly what I had read about here.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately lucky tiger (as great of a product as I think it is) doesn&#x27;t really cut it for me, but for those who just want a very minimal quality tonic to slap on their face it might be your jam.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and really soothes your face after a shave.  </li>
            <li> I love this natural after shave&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> but it is quickly absorbed.  </li>
            <li> Both of those complaints are true, which is exactly why I like this</li>
            <li> well worth it IMO.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s by far the most skin calming aftershave product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It tightens up my skin, beats razor burn and leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say - the results are just darn good.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is far better than the Khiels and TOBS after shaves that I have been paying for.</li>
            <li> This product is an old barber shop favorite, and I can see why.</li>
            <li> Has a nice, mild citrus fragance that doesn&#x27;t linger too long,  </li>
            <li> This product got good reviews and some said that the scent was very light and did not last long</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying Lucky Tiger</li>
            <li> It is soothing to put on your face right after you shave, and it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol so it doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> They were right.  </li>
            <li> Use it after every shave, right after alum block, and before TOBS Mr. Taylor&#x27;s Aftershave  Balm.</li>
            <li> Delivery right on time.</li>
            <li> for razor burn, but not necessarily ingrowns (First Aid Beauty Radiance Pads is amazing for that).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using baxter of california which for me provides more moisture and a stronger scent as well as a cooling action that burns at first but provides relief to razor</li>
            <li> I am seventy years of age, and remember the barbershop tonics of years back, my favorite was Lucky Tiger.....</li>
            <li> others have said, the pleasant citrus aroma is only temporary, so if you or someone close to you is sensitive to smells, no worries.</li>
            <li> was I ever surprised and pleasantly taken back when it arrived</li>
            <li> my face look great and no more irritation from the razor blade&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The scent is so clean and pleasant, but it only lasts a very short time.  </li>
            <li> The smell is great but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t whether it actually physically does any good, but I do know that a small splash of this product on my face and neck after shaving really feels good</li>
            <li> However, the smell is intiatly very suttle and pleasent but it fades quickly.</li>
            <li> Since, I retired a couple of years ago, I have made shaving a passion, only recently throwing away my canned shave gel in favor of a great brush and quality shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I just recently got into wet shaving again after many years of fighting with an electric razor and am in the process of sampling many products to find the optimal set for myself; also because it&#x27;s fun, I actually enjoy shaving nowadays.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, precondition your facial skin on a daily basis or after a shave</li>
            <li> If you want something mostly natural and easy on the skin, try this.</li>
            <li> Between the Anthony Logistics Rush shower gel, and Lucky Tiger, you&#x27;re alert and ready to tackle the day.</li>
            <li> A non-alcohol based aftershave splash... not a strong fragrance, but it&#x27;s pleasant.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re most concerned about keeping your face smooth and soft over the long run, you might prefer Lucky</li>
            <li> I INTENSELY don&#x27;t like it!  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says: soothe and refresh.</li>
            <li> Overall, they are all excellent, however, they are naturally different in various ways, so one&#x27;s taste may cause a preference for one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I truly love starting my mornings with a close shave finished with a splash of this.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this after shave following shaving my head</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried dozens of different aftershaves and this now my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It smells to me exactly like Goo Gone</li>
            <li> First time I have tried this</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would have minded the smell when you first apply it lingering, but it does not.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I use this when my wife doesn&#x27;t want me smelling like an old man or a cheap whore.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned at first</li>
            <li> First time I used it</li>
            <li> Lucky Tiger is a classic.</li>
            <li> After Shave when my first bottle of Clubman Bay Rum was almost finished.  </li>
            <li> like is fully aware that it is just lemon scented aftershave.  </li>
            <li> Great scent,  doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fresh and leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> so far from the truth!!!!</li>
            <li> Other reviews say that there is a very light smell and that it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m using C.O. Bigelow shave cream along with Proraso pre-shave for sensitive skin and then finishing with Lucky Tiger.  </li>
            <li> this smells like oranges and is so far from the original &amp;#34;barbershop smell&amp;#34; that I remember.  </li>
            <li> I love the light citrus smell and it fades away very quickly not interfering with aftershaves.</li>
            <li> while it is not a scent that will last all day, it does feels very cool on my skin.</li>
            <li> if this is supposed to do anything positive to your face after a shave, it does not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I really needed a little more moisture and immediate face tingle than lucky tiger is giving me right now.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using long, but glad I went with this: low-fragrance, soothing after-shave.</li>
            <li> The sweet scent is unexpected but I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d say if you are looking for a new product this is worth a try.</li>
            <li> To say, according to the manufacturer, that they copied the old recipe for the Lucky Tiger</li>
            <li> But, PLEASE, don&#x27;t advertise this product as a copy of the OLD Lucky Tiger.....</li>
            <li> Personally, I do not want a strong smell to irritate my skin or clash with my cologne.</li>
            <li> Large amount for the price.</li>
            <li> The witch hazel and other ingredients calms any mild irritation very quickly without stinging.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a manly old school after shave, Lucky Tiger is not a Proraso or Musgo Real.</li>
            <li> One of the main complaints people had about this aftershave was its lack of scent, which is exactly what my husband likes about the smell.  </li>
            <li> I still love how it feels right after a shave, and after a half hour or so, I then put on my aftershave that will carry me through the day for smell.</li>
            <li> If you are one of those guys, you really should consider picking just one smell (your office mates</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clearly, this is not for everybody, but I really like it.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this are very healing and soothing.</li>
            <li> I mention this because the review will really be helped by their contrast.   </li>
            <li> The semi-dryness of the face causes the cuts to hurt when you move your face since the skin isn&#x27;t very stretchable.</li>
            <li> Really does help with nicks or razor burn.</li>
            <li> It is practically odorless, so it doesn&#x27;t preclude the use of cologne, and I&#x27;ve never had razor burn after using this and my Merkel straight blade.</li>
            <li> Mod: no stinging  Con: doesn&#x27;t work as an aftershave  </li>
            <li> It really smooths and refreshes my skin and calms the irritation and razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I like using this after shave because it sooths the skin really well and does not leave a sent.</li>
            <li> Also, seller processed / shipped item very promptly.</li>
            <li> To tell you the truth I was actually really disapointed when I opened the box</li>
            <li> it just doesnt really have that wake up kick in the pants to get you</li>
            <li> This is a very soothing aftershave.  </li>
            <li> glue remover (very orange),</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a wet shaver and this is my favorite aftershave.  </li>
            <li> really does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blend of organics really keeps my face feeling comfy after a shave.</li>
            <li> I would rather that it soothes my face after a close shave and completes the whole process.</li>
            <li> It also last a lot and leaves the silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it is doing all that much for my skin after shaving.  </li>
            <li> It really helps with razor burn.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to any shaver!</li>
            <li> I use a badger hair brush, Proraso shave soap, and a Feather straight razor.</li>
            <li> You will not be that one guy at work that, embarrassingly, wears way too much cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really?  </li>
            <li> no matter how much you use....within reason.  </li>
            <li> It would be soooo much cooler.</li>
            <li> Very soothing.</li>
            <li> It is gentle.</li>
            <li> and I really like how it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think this does much of anything.</li>
            <li> One was exotic sounding and amazingly had some good reviews but turned out to be the worst smelling &amp;#34;anything&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever made opened in my house!</li>
            <li> All I can say is I wish this after shave was readily available in my local area.</li>
            <li> So when you normally get that &amp;#34;clean/fresh&amp;#34; (some of you may call it &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34;) sensation</li>
            <li> or if it really does anything.</li>
            <li> It is nice an soothing for my face and the orange scent dissapates after just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> and I so far am enjoying the smell but am not totally sold on this yet.</li>
            <li> A little goes along ways, smooths over your face easily with no greasy, oily feeling, absorbs in quickly leaving no trace..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this aftershave a couple of times but so far I enjoy it very much.  </li>
            <li> husband likes this better than any other aftershave balm</li>
            <li> It smells mostly like oranges, but there is also a hint of other citrus/floral.</li>
            <li> At first, it didn&#x27;t appeal to me and I was glad it dissipated in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I got a bottle for my brother who also uses a straight razor like I do,, highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the wonderful smell doesn&#x27;t last too much.</li>
            <li> A pleasant (though weak) citrus scent.  </li>
            <li> Nowhere near the old Lucky Tiger</li>
            <li> scent is light and doesn&#x27;t linger too long</li>
            <li> my favorite aftershave there is no second place, its ingredients are just what you need after a shave, a smaller presentation would be appreciated</li>
            <li> But even if I liked the smell, you get approximately 2 minutes to enjoy it until it&#x27;s completely gone.</li>
            <li> There is a moisterizer in this product, but my face is usually pretty dry in the winter time, so I use a moisterizer after applying Lucky Tiger.  </li>
            <li> so the whole process in new to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using Proraso (when I&#x27;m paying for it) and The Gentlemens Refinery (when I receive it as a gift), and put the Lucky Tiger back on the shelf.</li>
            <li> I, personally, prefer the alcohol based splashes, they calm my skin very well.</li>
            <li> Not only does it spread more evenly, it goes further, and I prefer it \\&quot;thinned down\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> will definitely still use the rest of this product, but may search for something a bit more invigorating the next time I&#x27;m shopping for an aftershave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However if you want your aftershave to have a scent, Lucky Tiger is likely not for you.</li>
            <li> I have read about Lucky Tiger for years on shaving forums and finally decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> Not very pungent, but does provide a nice initial citrus smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through more bottles and tubes of more expensive aftershaves, balms, and whatnot, looking for something I like</li>
            <li> This aftershave has absolutely no burn to it thanks to the alcohol free formula.</li>
            <li> This is one of this products main ingredients.</li>
            <li> To get the original after shave one has to know where to go to get the original, now made over seas by a small company who has the rights to make it.</li>
            <li> high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I must be highly allergic to this potion.  </li>
            <li> Also the price is too high in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like the burn of some AS.  </li>
            <li> but i just wish it had more oomph, maybe a liitle tingle of a bit of a burn or a little stronger scent, its just a prefference thing but because it has a fruit/sweet scent to it</li>
            <li> little to no burn after applying, doesn&#x27;t smell half-bad,  and clears up most razor burn and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> The first part of this review is to basically sate how this tonic has saved me on two major occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Today my arm looks a lot better with little to no redness or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Witch hazel is a natural skin treatment whose benefits were known before the advent of modern medicine.  </li>
            <li> I use this product everyday after I shave, and I love how it soothes my skin.  </li>
            <li> Most people hear &amp;#34;after shave&amp;#34; and they immediately think Old Spice or Brut (I&#x27;m not much of a Brut fan, but if you don&#x27;t like Old Spice</li>
            <li> Only downside is the cost, but still well worth it.</li>
            <li> Wakes up your skin, and your senses, with it&#x27;s scent and fresh feeling (on my 3rd bottle)</li>
            <li> No complaint about the product itself give it a try</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant fragrance that is very subtle.</li>
            <li> : You&#x27;ll need to apply a balm in addition to this, because it has no moisturizing qualities, the smell doesn&#x27;t last long, and although clears up most skin irritation, it doesn&#x27;t clear it ALL up - at least in my experience, but if we&#x27;re honest nothing</li>
            <li> Hardly any scent and the good feeling does not last more than a few moments.  </li>
            <li> The effectiveness of this product is pretty decent, the scent mild and unobtrusive and dissipates within a few minutes of application.  </li>
            <li> This has found a new home in my shave den and will be a staple of it for years to come.</li>
            <li> Lucky Tiger actually seems to make small nicks and cuts bleed more, not less.  </li>
            <li> The orange smell dissipates nearly immediately, which is fine because I wanted it for other reasons then smell.  </li>
            <li> I like the smell very much although it disappears in several minutes.</li>
            <li> The bottle is plastic but looks very classy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I usually do not have the patience to prepare for my shave.</li>
            <li> After Shave for the past 5 years, and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> This is a simple review, I tried Lucky Tiger based on the other reviews I read, they were right.</li>
            <li> The smell fades almost as fast as it dries so you can use a cologne or other fragrance right over it no problem.</li>
            <li> It has a light citrus scent that doesn&#x27;t last too long and won&#x27;t clash with your cologne.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-It is a bit too mild for me, its not really a con</li>
            <li> During the summer I will probably just dust a little clubman talc on my chest and neck and be fine after applying this.  </li>
            <li> And I would know if it would, I live in Alabama and we are currently experiencing very humid, 90+ degree evenings.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> After Shave Balm works even better, but is way too expensive compared to Proraso or Lucky Tiger.  </li>
            <li> Over the last year or so, I have bought and used five different after shave lotions - Lucky Tiger, Proraso, Pinaud Clubman, and Captain&#x27;s Choice (Bay Rum and Sandalwood).</li>
            <li> I prefer aftershaves with a little more of a burn and lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> It does leave the face feeling smooth and does not dry the face out (due to lack of alcohol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It soothes my skin, It has almost no aroma which I like, and it makes your skin soft, besides it does not sting.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> is by far</li>
            <li> Old school label.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always prefered Aqua Velva, Old Spice, and the Bay Rum&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> not like grandpa&#x27;s Old Spice.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it uses all natural ingredients and the smell echoes that.  </li>
            <li> The biggest thing is that, it being made of natural oils and ingredients, doesn&#x27;t burn your face when you apply it.</li>
            <li> Since I got old as the hills, I thought I would try this old-fashioned product</li>
            <li> Aloe is another well-known natural healer for the skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since I was seven years old.  </li>
            <li> I like the scent, the performance and the style of the packaging as it has that old fashioned medicine look to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Natural.</li>
            <li> If you like citrus, and you are conscious of what you put on and in your body buy it.</li>
            <li> I have never been one with frequent ingrown or irritations, but I haven&#x27;t had ANY since using this.</li>
            <li> Without the witch hazel, it would not heal nearly as well.&lt;br /&gt;2:</li>
            <li> I have found that it is very oily, initially.</li>
            <li> All natural ingredients, replaces witch hazel for me.</li>
            <li> I prefer Clubman products over this by far.</li>
            <li> But for me, Clubman product far exceed Luck Tiger shave and face</li>
            <li> Nice- not great or anything-</li>
            <li> Always thought that I would need more of a thick lotion for this job but</li>
            <li> This aftershave tonic is one of the more gentle ones I&#x27;ve found, very little or no alcohol content to burn and dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Aside from that minor issue, this is a fantastic aftershave oil to use if you&#x27;re fed up with alcohol-based aftershaves burning your face and leaving it dry.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Luck Tiger now markets many of their products in the smaller bottle, not the original 8 oz.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is true for all non-lotion aftershaves, but Lucky Tiger has no moisturizing component to it, so a half hour down the road</li>
            <li> An after shave that has graced many an old fashioned barber shop and rockabilly&#x27;s routine since 1935.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell has a solid citrus base and is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> , if i am on a fresh blade i find that my face feels pretty dry by about lunch where some other after shave products</li>
            <li> No alcohol, is light and not oily at all, Only need very little as it applies very well.</li>
            <li> Also, when an after shave causes any razor burns and minor cuts to sting, I feel like I am doing something positive to treat them,</li>
            <li> I love that there is a subtle smell that does not carry through the day.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t claim one thing on the packaging and then do the exact opposite in the actual ingredients.</li>
            <li> That is actually the main reason I DO like it.</li>
            <li> This is a must if you are getting into classic safety razor shaving such as myself.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as a gift for any male in your family.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it is not more available in drug stores.  </li>
            <li> To soon to leave product info other then saying scent is nice and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> new part of my aftershave rotation and a definite reorder</li>
            <li> I never had a shave so close before and will never go back to the new razors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m male, early 30s, combination, olive-toned skin that isn&#x27;t sensitive or acne prone.   </li>
            <li> The only problem is it&#x27;s too expensive like all of the AoS products (they are good though).</li>
            <li> (The way I generally prefer my aftershave products to be.)  </li>
            <li> I especially like the fact that it uses natural ingredients to do its job.  </li>
            <li> The initial scent is an orange/citrus but is all but undetectable after about 3 or 4 minutes, so it will never interfere with a cologne, or to keep you completely unscented if that is your thing.</li>
            <li> This smells barely like citrus on application, then fades</li>
            <li> I just started wet shaving with a straight razor</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soothing and smells nice even if it&#x27;s faint.</li>
            <li> Every after shave I used prior to this would really irritate my skin and cause it to dry.  </li>
            <li> This product is alright - in my opinion not worthy of all the hype and stellar 5-star reviews.  </li>
            <li> For comparison, Proraso After Shave Balm soothes the skin as well as Lucky Tiger, but also tends to stop small weeping nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li> Even though I knew before making the purchase that the scent is very fast to dissipate, I still wish that the scent would like a little longer.</li>
            <li> bottle for the price though, larger than a $5 thing of Old Spice, it would probably last me 6 mo - 1 yr.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and the citrus smell but very subtle and in 15 to 20 minutes, the fragrance is gone gone gone.</li>
            <li> second major save</li>
            <li> It is a very light and subtle orange smell that won&#x27;t cause other people to block their nose when you enter the room.</li>
            <li> I use this from November to April when sensitive skin gets dry and unruly.</li>
            <li> This is good or bad.</li>
            <li> I have read some reviews lamenting the absence of long lasting, overpowering fragrance.</li>
            <li> If you can get past that, you&#x27;ll probably really like this.</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last too long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different brands over the last year as I&#x27;ve picked up wet shaving, and each has its ups and downs.  </li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> Not that it smells bad, quite the opposite (it kind of has an orangeish, citrusy scent), but that it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> This spring I started wet shaving with a traditional double edged razor.  </li>
            <li> The baxter (sadly) has some ingredients in it that sound less natural</li>
            <li> Long Term Feel :</li>
            <li> This is in contrast to AoS which is a lotion based aftershave and so moisturizes your face for a long time.</li>
            <li> The scent does not linger long after applied</li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;present owner&amp;#34; of the long time and valued recipe has...  </li>
            <li> Also, the scent if very subtle and will dissipate quickly so you can wear whatever cologne you want.    </li>
            <li> Wow, so to start, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of smelling like an orange.</li>
            <li> The witch hazel base tightens up my skin, helps it heal, has a cooling effect on my skin, and my skin feels good afterwards.   </li>
            <li> like that it has quality minimal amount of ingredients and a nice smell faintly of cucumbers, but there&#x27;s really very little relief or moisture provided to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only wish that the scent would be a little bit stronger and last longer.  </li>
            <li> my face is somewhat dry.</li>
            <li> This aftershave doesn&#x27;t include oil and the skin remains dry.</li>
            <li> I like this because I can put on my scented alcohol based aftershaves after I let this dry, or some cologne.</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much dry skin after shaving as I used to.</li>
            <li> Not enough to replace a moisturising lotion, but definitely a nice base.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit so the bottle lasts a long, long time.</li>
            <li> and I still have about half of the bottle left to use.</li>
            <li> over a half hour.&lt;br /&gt;3.) Alcohol free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this same bottle for over a year now.  </li>
            <li> In the summer I stick with a different product that&#x27;s a little sharper on application.</li>
            <li> only takes a little to cover your face after a shave.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell you how disappointing it is to receive my new bottle of this classic in a plastic</li>
            <li> Long lasting, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a problem for me, as a wet shaver.  </li>
            <li> I wet my hands and leave my face damp after rinsing it.  </li>
            <li> i have never really used after shave before</li>
            <li> If your a manly man and you want it to burn and be made from the souls of a thousand dead third world sweat shop workers stick to using 91 octane.</li>
            <li> If you are a wet shaver or DE enthuiast then you should try this product.  </li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Not much scent, no sting at all.</li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, just a little bit of this tonic will go a long ways.</li>
            <li> This is an after shave with very little fragrance, use only when you want to refresh.</li>
            <li> long bottle, narrow neck, and</li>
            <li> Soothes the razor burn; initially feels slick like it is oily</li>
            <li> You get one star for using Trisodium EDTA in the product and other cancer causing chemicals. .  </li>
            <li> Depending on my mood, I used one or the other, so my comparison has been somewhat continuous.</li>
            <li> Although its label says &amp;#34;with Aloe Vera&amp;#34;, its other ingredients are not listed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I have had an issue with some other aftershave lotions, splashes and tonics either drying my skin out or leaving a noticable film on my face, this does not do either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using this product for a while I would like to say I was wrong with my first review.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot compared to other products I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Just not same as my usual brand.</li>
            <li> as it&#x27;s dispense method can easily waste a bit (but...a little goes long way).</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s light and disappears rapidly - too bad.</li>
            <li> This has a doubly bad effect if I have any cuts from shaving (trying to learn on a double edge razor for the first time, though it&#x27;ll happen every once in a while to anyone).</li>
            <li> I use this as a toner after a shave and then, once it dries (about 2 minutes or so) I follow up with an alcohol based splash, I find that helpful during dry seasons when my skin gets really dry and tense.</li>
            <li> Calms the redness, especially if you&#x27;ve hit an area a little too hard.</li>
            <li> works gently, but I think this is little bit expensive.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing this product again, but I may test a few other after shaves out as well.  </li>
            <li> If it lasted even half a day, I would give it five stars and use nothing else.  </li>
            <li> Slight citrus and clove smell.</li>
            <li> It goes on with the consistency of water, but dries cleanly - no gel/sticky feeling afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The coolness of Proraso is minty and lingers a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells a little like oranges to me.  </li>
            <li> So if you like a little burn you won&#x27;t get it from this.  </li>
            <li> The solution is very thin and doesn&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Only thing that i find disappointing is tat the time that it lasts, which is very short.</li>
            <li> As in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t believe in giving a product a poor review because it doesn&#x27;t meet a personal preference (for example scent or astringency in an after shave).</li>
            <li> So no need to splash off the burning stuff and then moisturize, just leave on the skin for a few minutes, then follow up with moisturizer/</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand heavily perfumed or petroleum based products.</li>
            <li> While methylparaben is one of the &amp;#34;safer&amp;#34; ones and isn&#x27;t that big of a deal, I dislike the false advertising.</li>
            <li> No sting, very subtle scent that comes on citrusy at first, then slowly fades into a subtle scent which is what I want in an aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually squeeze a generous amount into the palm of my hand and rub to create a slight lather.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not miraculous or anything, it just plain works.  </li>
            <li> No strong overpowering smells like some</li>
            <li> not strong effect.</li>
            <li> Very slight fragrance-</li>
            <li> A little expensive, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> After Shave in the hand prior to application and on the face when applied, I HATE the taste it leaves behind on my upper lip, especially when drinking coffee.</li>
            <li> is that after a few uses the blade becomes dull.</li>
            <li> The shave cream, while it appears to be a small bottle, lasts for months--</li>
            <li> So I put it in a small spray bottle and spritz it on.</li>
            <li> Chamomile, I&#x27;m not sure about.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t put it on \\&quot;straight\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure why I was expecting a glass bottle</li>
            <li> usually use it about 4 times per week and 1 bottle has lasted about 1 year.  </li>
            <li> I had razor burn on my neck, which usually takes 3-4 days to heal with me.</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to say there is a difference between the two Clubman&#x27;s varieties.</li>
            <li> using a dull shavette blade, or any dull blade, you will probably encounter razor burn if you do not lather and prepare well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lucky Tiger is the least astringent.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use this product every time you shave, your life probably sucks.  </li>
            <li> needed an after shave with no scent (or at least not an overpowering one) and this fits the bill.  </li>
            <li> At least for me.</li>
            <li> I mean like freshly-peeled oranges.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would have a similar very faint smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to see what happens when the air gets cold and dry.</li>
            <li> seriously wonder how I ever shaved without this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is subtle, with just a hint of sweetness and spice.</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t bad and it has a ton of ingredients that should be in all aftershaves like witch hazel, aloe, and such.</li>
            <li> You will be disappointed if you are looking for a lasting (or fleeting) fragrance.</li>
            <li> Unlike other users, I find the initial smell terrible.</li>
            <li> It is a non-oily, thin consistency, aftershave \\&quot;splash\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It is a fairly thin liquid.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an outdated fragrance...</li>
            <li> My bad down the sink it goes..</li>
            <li> I like the scent, which is very subtle.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Not the fancy expensive stuff, but it works well for me.</li>
            <li> something is wrong with you).</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all with the outcome after using when done shaving.</li>
            <li> all wrong</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comes out of the bottle very thin in consistency, and smells of oranges.</li>
            <li> Bad, bad, bad chemical.</li>
            <li> There is a reason parabens are bad and you want to avoid them.</li>
            <li> However, I can appreciate that alcohol-based products are considered bad for your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I applied this product along my forearm, which looked like I gave myself a bad razor burn, and went to sleep.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a bad thing because after it dries it is not oily whatsoever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product, bad execution.</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate smelling chemicals under my nose all day.  </li>
            <li> bad has happened, but i might as well have just put water on my face and called it a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;waste of 14 bucks!</li>
            <li> Husband hated it, said it smelled terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This will get you all the ladies.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my husband, he loves it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and doesn&#x27;t linger too long and it isn&#x27;t overly strong.&lt;br /&gt;I apply it from neck to hairline and feel my skin thank me.  This has found a new home in my shave den and will be a staple of it for years to come.</li>
            <li> Best aftershave I&#x27;ve ever used.smooth and invigorating</li>
            <li> It soothes my skin, It has almost no aroma which I like, and it makes your skin soft, besides it does not sting.&lt;br /&gt;This is by far my favorite aftershave there is no second place, its ingredients are just what you need after a shave, a smaller presentation would be appreciated</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve always steered towards the Bay Rum aftershaves-but you know sometimes change is a good thing. So I opted to try the Tiger out. No sting, very subtle scent that comes on citrusy at first, then slowly fades into a subtle scent which is what I want in an aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my use, it does soften the skin after shaving. Large amount for the price. Old school label. Great smell.</li>
            <li> I love this natural after shave&lt;br /&gt;Made my face look great and no more irritation from the razor blade&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked on this stuff for life</li>
            <li> I recall seeing this in barber shops 50 years ago, but I had never used it until last week.  I&#x27;m very impressed with it as an aftershave.  A pleasant (though weak) citrus scent.  No alcohol so it does not sting.  Expensive but a little goes a long way.  It is filled with soothing organic ingredients.  An excellent product.  I don&#x27;t know why it is not more available in drug stores.  Amazon is the only place I&#x27;ve seen it.  I&#x27;ve always prefered Aqua Velva, Old Spice, and the Bay Rum&#x27;s.  But Lucky Tiger now is probably my favorite aftershave.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the word &amp;#34;hate&amp;#34;...I INTENSELY don&#x27;t like it!  Nowhere near the old Lucky Tiger face tonic....this smells like oranges and is so far from the original &amp;#34;barbershop smell&amp;#34; that I remember.  To say, according to the manufacturer, that they copied the old recipe for the Lucky Tiger After Shave/Face Tonic, is TOTALLY UNTRUE.  I am seventy years of age, and remember the barbershop tonics of years back, my favorite was Lucky Tiger.....long bottle, narrow neck, and a drip spout on the end....what a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not return the item, will definitely NOT use it....will pass it on to someone who likes a citrus(y) smell.  But, PLEASE, don&#x27;t advertise this product as a copy of the OLD Lucky Tiger.....so far from the truth!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good after shaving with a blade.</li>
            <li> No body will sit by me on the bus now.</li>
            <li> Has a citrus mandarin scent which I love. It doesn&#x27;t burn when you put it on and soothes your skin. Definitely a keeper and has moved in front of the line of my aftershaves.</li>
            <li> Love this product for post-shave and have made it part of my routine.  Soothes the razor burn; initially feels slick like it is oily but it is quickly absorbed.  Nice scent, although it would be nice if it would last longer!</li>
            <li> This has an extremely light scent.  I was taken aback at how light it is.  But it is citrusy.</li>
            <li> I love this after shave! It is very refreshing and I love that the smell goes away quickly so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my cologne.</li>
            <li> After reading a bunch of glowing reviews, I decided to give Lucky Tiger After Shave a try.  Smells great and soothes the skin, but that&#x27;s about it.  Lucky Tiger actually seems to make small nicks and cuts bleed more, not less.  That&#x27;s a problem for me, as a wet shaver.  For comparison, Proraso After Shave Balm soothes the skin as well as Lucky Tiger, but also tends to stop small weeping nicks and cuts.  The Gentlemens Refinery After Shave Balm works even better, but is way too expensive compared to Proraso or Lucky Tiger.  I&#x27;ll keep using Proraso (when I&#x27;m paying for it) and The Gentlemens Refinery (when I receive it as a gift), and put the Lucky Tiger back on the shelf.</li>
            <li> I use this from November to April when sensitive skin gets dry and unruly. The stuff is magic. In the summer I stick with a different product that&#x27;s a little sharper on application.</li>
            <li> My search for the best After Shave has ended!</li>
            <li> I remember seeing this on the shelves at the barber shop as a kid. It works well to soothe after a shave. No alcohol, no burn. The citrus-like scent is very pleasant without being overpowering.  It doesn&#x27;t have an outdated fragrance... not like grandpa&#x27;s Old Spice. Someone across the room isn&#x27;t going to smell you before they see you walk into the room. It is a non-oily, thin consistency, aftershave \\&quot;splash\\&quot;. It is a no-brainer purchase for any man that enjoys shaving!</li>
            <li> I can tell it is helping my skin when I shave.  I like the fact that it uses all natural ingredients and the smell echoes that.  I only wish that the scent would be a little bit stronger and last longer.  It&#x27;s a good product, but needs something else.</li>
            <li> This is a simple review, I tried Lucky Tiger based on the other reviews I read, they were right. I love the way my skin feels after the shave. However, the smell is intiatly very suttle and pleasent but it fades quickly. I use this in combination with the Lucky Tiger shaving lotion.</li>
            <li> A citrusy fragrance without any cloying sweetness. Long lasting, but not overwhelming. No alcohol means no sting.&lt;br /&gt;a new part of my aftershave rotation and a definite reorder</li>
            <li> It seems two of the biggest complaints with this product are that (1) it does not provide a lasting smell, and (2) it does not moisturize. Both of those complaints are true, which is exactly why I like this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a face tonic. If you are looking for a moisturizer, get an after shave lotion or cream. It works well for me because it does not leave my skin feeling oily. If you need extra moisturizing, this product is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a lasting smell, get an after shave cologne. If you read Lucky Tiger&#x27;s promotional material, the smell is meant to dissipate. Personally, I do not want a strong smell to irritate my skin or clash with my cologne. Trust me, you do not want a strong smell for your after shave, cologne, deodorant, soap, and everything else you put on your body. If you are one of those guys, you really should consider picking just one smell (your office mates agree).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, this is not for everybody, but I really like it. It does exactly what it says: soothe and refresh.</li>
            <li> Actually really liked this for a nearly non scented aftershave. The orange smell dissipates nearly immediately, which is fine because I wanted it for other reasons then smell.  You get one star for using Trisodium EDTA in the product and other cancer causing chemicals. .  It was all good until you added this. Bad, bad, bad chemical. I should have read the label before ordering. My bad down the sink it goes..</li>
            <li> Lucky Tiger is a good toner that soothes my face after a shave. The price isn&#x27;t bad and it has a ton of ingredients that should be in all aftershaves like witch hazel, aloe, and such. If you like a splash but don&#x27;t want the burn of an alcohol based aftershave then this is a good choice. Also, the scent if very subtle and will dissipate quickly so you can wear whatever cologne you want.    I, personally, prefer the alcohol based splashes, they calm my skin very well. I use this as a toner after a shave and then, once it dries (about 2 minutes or so) I follow up with an alcohol based splash, I find that helpful during dry seasons when my skin gets really dry and tense.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Has a nice fragrance to it and is light. Only thing that i find disappointing is tat the time that it lasts, which is very short. As in a few minutes. Refreshing and no burn, will be keeping in stock.</li>
            <li> Great product. high quality.&lt;br /&gt;It works gently, but I think this is little bit expensive. I like it. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received my bottle of Lucky Tiger and I was very pleased with mostly everything about this aftershave. The biggest thing is that, it being made of natural oils and ingredients, doesn&#x27;t burn your face when you apply it. It is extremely refreshing and leaves your skin nice and soft. Nothing to complain about there. The ONLY thing that I would mention as a Con would be the scent. Not that it smells bad, quite the opposite (it kind of has an orangeish, citrusy scent), but that it doesn&#x27;t last very long. My suggestion would be to follow up with some good cologne or maybe even throw on some stronger aftershave after words. Aside from that minor issue, this is a fantastic aftershave oil to use if you&#x27;re fed up with alcohol-based aftershaves burning your face and leaving it dry. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Luck Tiger now markets many of their products in the smaller bottle, not the original 8 oz.</li>
            <li> Fine after shave, no alcohol! No burning, soothing comfort.</li>
            <li> Nice- not great or anything- but rather a nice clean non biting aftershave.  Very slight fragrance- and it does leave your face feeling smooth and moist.   I will use it fairly often, but my druthers is for a more bracing aftershave most of the time.</li>
            <li> It goes on kinda oily.  It seems to have no alcohol at all in it.</li>
            <li> Great citrus scent, sooths fresh razor irritation quickly with zero burning. A bit pricey but well worth it IMO. If you use a quality shave cream or paste, you have yourself a nice combination.</li>
            <li> Great product, as with other users I wish it came in a glass bottle. Nice change from the 4711 I normally use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never seen after shave but my wife remembers seeing Lucky Tiger when she was a child.  Since, I retired a couple of years ago, I have made shaving a passion, only recently throwing away my canned shave gel in favor of a great brush and quality shaving cream.  Since I got old as the hills, I thought I would try this old-fashioned product and I don&#x27;t know if you can get any better.  Feels good and soothing on your face, the smell is naturally citrus,very nice, and fades away in five or ten minutes.  It&#x27;s perfect and my my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Not a lingering scent. This was saddening at first because it smells so darn good. But as I&#x27;ve found sometimes you shave and need something to soothe but having a scent to stay at home and watch tv isn&#x27;t a necessity. So this makes an excellent alternative to a scented after shave or in conjunction with a cologne of choice. I am new(er) to straight razor shaving and have had my fair share of nicks and fairly good cuts. The ingredients in this are very healing and soothing. No sting whatsoever with this stuff, which I like sting a la Pinaud but for those that don&#x27;t this is also a good alternative.</li>
            <li> I love citrus notes and this is packed with it. For a splash, it will not burn your face. It helps cool and comfort your skin with its aloe formula. One of my favorites!</li>
            <li> I use this every day after DE shaving with a merkur Mergress shaver or a slant. It cools the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using LuckyTiger brand products for years.  The shave cream, while it appears to be a small bottle, lasts for months--all you need is 2-3 pea sized drops on the palm of your hand if you use a shaving brush like I do, or just lather it in your palms and then into yor beard.  The face tonic is great.  It has just the amount of scent and feels really good on the skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is a pleasant finishing touch to a morning shave. Gets rid of residue and has light moisturisation.  Not enough to replace a moisturising lotion, but definitely a nice base. Your moisturiser will go on quite nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Nice for razor burn, but not necessarily ingrowns (First Aid Beauty Radiance Pads is amazing for that).&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like splashing and don&#x27;t have the time for cotton balls. So I put it in a small spray bottle and spritz it on. It does a great job and lasts longer that way.&lt;br /&gt;And the citrus smell, I believe, comes from an extract and not perfume. So that&#x27;s a plus for anyone who&#x27;s not a fan of perfume on the face.</li>
            <li> Husband hated it, said it smelled terrible.</li>
            <li> I just recently got into wet shaving again after many years of fighting with an electric razor and am in the process of sampling many products to find the optimal set for myself; also because it&#x27;s fun, I actually enjoy shaving nowadays. I have used Lucky Tiger (LT) and the Art of Shaving (AoS)(Lavender scent). I mention this because the review will really be helped by their contrast.   Short Term Feel : This is the only category where LT performs well as an aftershave. It is soothing to put on your face right after you shave, and it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol so it doesn&#x27;t burn. Though, it doesn&#x27;t feel any better than the AoS, which is just as soothing.  Long Term Feel : Two stars off for this. I don&#x27;t know if this is true for all non-lotion aftershaves, but Lucky Tiger has no moisturizing component to it, so a half hour down the road my face is somewhat dry. This has a doubly bad effect if I have any cuts from shaving (trying to learn on a double edge razor for the first time, though it&#x27;ll happen every once in a while to anyone). The semi-dryness of the face causes the cuts to hurt when you move your face since the skin isn&#x27;t very stretchable. This is in contrast to AoS which is a lotion based aftershave and so moisturizes your face for a long time. I don&#x27;t even notice the cuts after I&#x27;ve shaved and used AoS.  Scent : Another star off for this. Wow, so to start, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of smelling like an orange. But that&#x27;s what the smell is supposed to be, can&#x27;t hold it against LT. Maybe some others are into it and that&#x27;s fine. But even if I liked the smell, you get approximately 2 minutes to enjoy it until it&#x27;s completely gone. In contrast, I love the lavender smell of AoS, but more importantly it lasts for probably an hour (haven&#x27;t paid too much attention to when it stops smelling).  For these reasons I would definitely go with AoS. The only problem is it&#x27;s too expensive like all of the AoS products (they are good though). So I&#x27;m on the search for an aftershave that is more like AoS but with a cheaper price.  Hope this helps!  Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lucky Tiger for about four months now. It&#x27;s not miraculous or anything, it just plain works.  I use it, not as a scent (that&#x27;s what colognes are for), but to help condition my skin after I shave, especially if I have razor burn.  The witch hazel base tightens up my skin, helps it heal, has a cooling effect on my skin, and my skin feels good afterwards.   I especially like the fact that it uses natural ingredients to do its job.  Witch hazel is a natural skin treatment whose benefits were known before the advent of modern medicine.  Aloe is another well-known natural healer for the skin.  Chamomile, I&#x27;m not sure about.  It&#x27;s supposed to be calming, and I know that chamomile is calming when made into a tea, but I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s effect when applied to the skin.    About the scent. At first, it didn&#x27;t appeal to me and I was glad it dissipated in a few minutes.  I&#x27;ve come to like it, now, maybe because I associate it with the good results.  Just a note about application-- I usually don&#x27;t put it on \\&quot;straight\\&quot;.  I wet my hands and leave my face damp after rinsing it.  I squirt some in the palm of my hand, rub them together and smooth it on my face.  Not only does it spread more evenly, it goes further, and I prefer it \\&quot;thinned down\\&quot;.  If I put it on straight, it sometimes feels a bit sticky after a while, in warm weather anyway.  I&#x27;ll have to see what happens when the air gets cold and dry.</li>
            <li> I love the light citrus smell and it fades away very quickly not interfering with aftershaves. Really does help with nicks or razor burn.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, just a little bit of this tonic will go a long ways. It is practically odorless, so it doesn&#x27;t preclude the use of cologne, and I&#x27;ve never had razor burn after using this and my Merkel straight blade. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m male, early 30s, combination, olive-toned skin that isn&#x27;t sensitive or acne prone.   Pro: zero reactions, mild and semi-citrus scent, alcohol free, great ingredients, packaging, 8 oz will last awhile  Mod: no stinging  Con: doesn&#x27;t work as an aftershave  It did nothing for post-shaving bleeding or lip sweating. My skin also doesn&#x27;t appear any different than pre-use. I&#x27;ll finish this bottle and not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Over the last year or so, I have bought and used five different after shave lotions - Lucky Tiger, Proraso, Pinaud Clubman, and Captain&#x27;s Choice (Bay Rum and Sandalwood). Depending on my mood, I used one or the other, so my comparison has been somewhat continuous. Overall, they are all excellent, however, they are naturally different in various ways, so one&#x27;s taste may cause a preference for one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucky Tiger is the least astringent. You don&#x27;t get that cooling sensation. It&#x27;s probably the most like a skin conditioner. Although its label says &amp;#34;with Aloe Vera&amp;#34;, its other ingredients are not listed. Its aloe vera plus I suspect witch hazel are what make me say it is most like a skin conditioner. I don&#x27;t think it has any alcohol. So if you&#x27;re most concerned about keeping your face smooth and soft over the long run, you might prefer Lucky Tiger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The others all have alcohol and give you that familiar cooling, fresh, astringent sensation. I would say that Pinaud Clubman is the most astringent and cooling, followed by Proraso, Clubman&#x27;s Bay Rum, and Clubman&#x27;s Sandalwood. It&#x27;s hard to say there is a difference between the two Clubman&#x27;s varieties. The coolness of Proraso is minty and lingers a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe in giving a product a poor review because it doesn&#x27;t meet a personal preference (for example scent or astringency in an after shave). Therefore, I would rate them all as five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My preference is Pinaud Clubman because I like a cool feeling on my face after a shave. Also, when an after shave causes any razor burns and minor cuts to sting, I feel like I am doing something positive to treat them, even if another after shave might help them heal better without your feeling anything. Lack of stinging indicates fewer burns and cuts meaning that I&#x27;ve given myself a good shave. So, the more astringency the better for me. As a bonus, Pinaud Clubman is the lowest cost.</li>
            <li> I was in need of a good after shave and after extensive research I purchased this one.  Every after shave I used prior to this would really irritate my skin and cause it to dry.  This product smells great and I don&#x27;t require any extra moisturizer after my shave.  Nice packaging as well I think.</li>
            <li> Smells good but not overpowering. My face feels great after using it.</li>
            <li> I truly love starting my mornings with a close shave finished with a splash of this. It really smooths and refreshes my skin and calms the irritation and razor bumps. The smell is classic and pleasant. Along with a Badger Hair brush &amp; good shaving soap, this is a new must-have for my shaving routine now.</li>
            <li> I like using this after shave because it sooths the skin really well and does not leave a sent. It&#x27;s great if you use cologne, the debts won&#x27;t be battling it out on your face.</li>
            <li> It says &amp;#34;Paraben Free&amp;#34; on the container and then you read the ingredients..... Methylparaben. That is a paraben. Don&#x27;t claim one thing on the packaging and then do the exact opposite in the actual ingredients. There is a reason parabens are bad and you want to avoid them. While methylparaben is one of the &amp;#34;safer&amp;#34; ones and isn&#x27;t that big of a deal, I dislike the false advertising.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product since I was seven years old.  It&#x27;s amazing how Lucky Tiger After Shave can truly change your life.  If you don&#x27;t use this product every time you shave, your life probably sucks.  This is not my opinion, it&#x27;s a fact.</li>
            <li> if this is supposed to do anything positive to your face after a shave, it does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have yet to see any effects from using this product for about 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nothing bad has happened, but i might as well have just put water on my face and called it a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;waste of 14 bucks!</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. I have read some reviews lamenting the absence of long lasting, overpowering fragrance. That is actually the main reason I DO like it. I think it is perfect in that respect. I have also read the reviews complaing of the lack of an astringent. I have to say I agree with this crowd (hence the three stars). It does leave the face looking and feeling good after a shave, but it kind of leaves my mug asking, &amp;#34;Where&#x27;s the tingle?&amp;#34;. If you can get past that, you&#x27;ll probably really like this.</li>
            <li> needed an after shave with no scent (or at least not an overpowering one) and this fits the bill.  It is nice an soothing for my face and the orange scent dissapates after just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have tried many types of shaving balms but Lucky Tiger is my favorite.  No alcohol means no sting.  There is a very pleasant and light orange aroma that doesn&#x27;t last long.  There is no moisturizer however....  Good Lucky Tiger!</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday after I shave, and I love how it soothes my skin.  I also love the very light and easy to live with scent.  I would give it five stars except for the one thing I don&#x27;t like about it.  The scent is so clean and pleasant, but it only lasts a very short time.  If it lasted even half a day, I would give it five stars and use nothing else.  I still love how it feels right after a shave, and after a half hour or so, I then put on my aftershave that will carry me through the day for smell.</li>
            <li> Stuff is soothing, very nice. Also, seller processed / shipped item very promptly. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, precondition your facial skin on a daily basis or after a shave</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Very light lemon scent, does a great job of healing your face after shaving.</li>
            <li> So I guess I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect when I purchased this. I was expecting a more invigorating feeling on my face; one that I&#x27;d expect from an alcohol-based product or a menthol-based product. However, I can appreciate that alcohol-based products are considered bad for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell reminds me exactly of Mr. Clean floor cleaner or Pine-Sol. It is strongly citrusy, yet the scent goes away within minutes. It does leave the face feeling smooth and does not dry the face out (due to lack of alcohol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely still use the rest of this product, but may search for something a bit more invigorating the next time I&#x27;m shopping for an aftershave.</li>
            <li> Do you like the smell of citrus?  Do you like an instant cooling effect after a not so great shave? Do you like nourishing your skin? Well this is for you!  I shave with a DE razor and Lucky Tiger is a staple product. There&#x27;s no burn at all and it&#x27;s by far the most skin calming aftershave product I have ever used. Plus, this is an 8 ounce bottle. It only takes a little bit so the bottle lasts a long, long time. Buy this. Your face will thank you.</li>
            <li> I just got this today and I so far am enjoying the smell but am not totally sold on this yet.</li>
            <li> Calms razor burn and refreshes your skin without burning.  The fragrance is gone quickly, allowing one to apply cologne without worry of the odors clashing.</li>
            <li> I use Lucky Tiger Head to Tail Deodorant and Body Spray.  I thought this product would have a similar very faint smell.  I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I love this after shave following shaving my head</li>
            <li> A non-alcohol based aftershave splash... not a strong fragrance, but it&#x27;s pleasant. I find myself reaching for it more and more in hot weather.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best aftershave I tried!! No messy/sticky feeling, does not burn. Highly recommended!!&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again!! Lucky Tiger thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product for after shaving.  My husband uses this and it has a nice, non-over powering scent while providing relief from razor burn.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, I wanted an non- alcohol or witch hazel aftershave.. I really like it, mild fruit scent, and is very light.. A little goes along ways, smooths over your face easily with no greasy, oily feeling, absorbs in quickly leaving no trace.. Just a light scent that goes away in a short time and your face feels great and of course no burn at all.. And any razor burn is gone... I liked this so much I got a bottle for my brother who also uses a straight razor like I do,, highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, refreshing astringent, but if you&#x27;re looking for a scent that lasts a while, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> This is a very light liquid aftershave.  It has a citrusy scent that fades away after several minutes.  I&#x27;m told that this is to not override any cologne or scents that one might want to wear.  Or if you prefer to not wear any colognes or scents this will not leave a scent.  It is not like a balm, and you will almost not feel anything on your face after it dries.  Not oily at all, which is great for me because I live in a VERY hot, humid climate, and am outdoors quite a bit.  I don&#x27;t like the oily aftershaves and balms in the summer.  Makes my face feel great after a shave, and with no alcohol.  Somehow soothes my face without even feeling like I put anything on after it dries.  I use this almost everyday, and its great for anyone who likes a very light aftershave.</li>
            <li> my favorite of all aftershaves</li>
            <li> This is a must if you are getting into classic safety razor shaving such as myself. This is a very nice premium product in my opinion. There is a nice citrus scent that is light and does not linger. Very refreshing after the shave.</li>
            <li> husband likes this better than any other aftershave balm</li>
            <li> I heard this is the aftershave Elvis used.  It&#x27;s very fresh and leaves my skin soft.  There is no burn like a Bay Rhum, but I use it quite often.  It seems to leave a different type of coat to my skin.  It has a nice mellow citrus scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a liquid not a gel or balm so splash it on and pat it around.  It tightens up my skin, beats razor burn and leaves my skin feeling fresh and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried dozens of different aftershaves and this now my favorite.  Its got a fresh clean citrus smell that I find invigorating but it doesn&#x27;t stick with you or leave you smelling like an orange.</li>
            <li> This is good or bad. If you just want your aftershave to sooth you and then not smell, you have found it in Lucky Tiger. Soothing is the big draw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However if you want your aftershave to have a scent, Lucky Tiger is likely not for you.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Lucky Tiger after shave.  It has no alcohol, or there is no burning.  It has a nice citrus smell.  The smell doesn&#x27;t last too long.  It doesn&#x27;t always hydrate the skin like I&#x27;d like, but no complaints overall.</li>
            <li> To tell you the truth I was actually really disapointed when I opened the box and it was a plastic bottle. I am not sure why I was expecting a glass bottle but man would that have been classy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Smells great, little orange and citrus splash after a shave really a great way to start the day&lt;br /&gt;-I have had an issue with some other aftershave lotions, splashes and tonics either drying my skin out or leaving a noticable film on my face, this does not do either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-It is a bit too mild for me, its not really a con but but i just wish it had more oomph, maybe a liitle tingle of a bit of a burn or a little stronger scent, its just a prefference thing but because it has a fruit/sweet scent to it it just doesnt really have that wake up kick in the pants to get you going.&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t moisterize all that well, if i am on a fresh blade i find that my face feels pretty dry by about lunch where some other after shave products do a bit better of a job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a good product maybe just not for me, it doesn&#x27;t really have that &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; that makes something great for me, it leaves me looking at it saying &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Smells great, but that smell goes away pretty quickly. Doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel great or anything. I just splash it on because I bought and may as well use it.</li>
            <li> I prefer aftershaves with a little more of a burn and lasting fragrance. However, if you are looking for a soothing, non-alcoholic aftershave, you will probably love this one. The smell fades almost as fast as it dries so you can use a cologne or other fragrance right over it no problem.</li>
            <li> This is a very soothing aftershave.  It smells to me exactly like Goo Gone glue remover (very orange), but the scent disappears quickly so if you don&#x27;t like it it&#x27;s not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about 2 years and it is my favorite aftershave period.  I like the scent, the performance and the style of the packaging as it has that old fashioned medicine look to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use it about 4 times per week and 1 bottle has lasted about 1 year.  I use about a quarter sized puddle in my palm to cover my entire face and neck, not just the shaved area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> love this after shave. i have never really used after shave before but this is now my necessary go to after shave. leaves my face moisturized and nourished. great stuff</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Does not burn because there&#x27;s no alcohol in it. It calms and soothes my face even after an aggressive shave. Shipping and packaging were on time and good as well.</li>
            <li> This is an after shave with very little fragrance, use only when you want to refresh. It is not a cologne. It does have soothing oils in it, and it works well for what it was intended to be.</li>
            <li> But this suff works well to help it heal more quickly. Not the fancy expensive stuff, but it works well for me.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Soothing, non-alcohol based aftershave tonic.  Has a nice, mild citrus fragance that doesn&#x27;t linger too long,  I&#x27;m a wet shaver and this is my favorite aftershave.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> great product! sooth&#x27;s instantly</li>
            <li> I have read about Lucky Tiger for years on shaving forums and finally decided to give it a shot. It&#x27;s a very smooth, no burn, aftershave tonic that does what it&#x27;s meant to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: little to no burn after applying, doesn&#x27;t smell half-bad,  and clears up most razor burn and irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: You&#x27;ll need to apply a balm in addition to this, because it has no moisturizing qualities, the smell doesn&#x27;t last long, and although clears up most skin irritation, it doesn&#x27;t clear it ALL up - at least in my experience, but if we&#x27;re honest nothing really does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product and truly lives up to its reputation.</li>
            <li> This tonic has quite the utility use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently started to use a shavette and one problem with them is that after a few uses the blade becomes dull. The first part of this review is to basically sate how this tonic has saved me on two major occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With using a dull shavette blade, or any dull blade, you will probably encounter razor burn if you do not lather and prepare well. Unfortunately I usually do not have the patience to prepare for my shave. This soothes irritated skin/razor burn quite well. It doesn&#x27;t have a quite a bite and it doesn&#x27;t give off a pungent smell; however, it does give the user a delightful citrus smell whilst placing the product on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second major save this product did for me was yesterday when I fell of my longboard. When i fell the brunt of the damage was a scrape along the exterior of my left forearm. In all honestly it looked quite ghastly and it stung quite a bit. As soon as I got home, I cleaned the wounds and took a shower. Afterwards I saw the bottle of this tonic and thought about how it soothes my razor burn/nicks whenever I shave incorrectly. So I applied this product along my forearm, which looked like I gave myself a bad razor burn, and went to sleep. Today my arm looks a lot better with little to no redness or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this product again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tl;dr - This product is great for soothing razor burn and some types of irritated skin. Not very pungent, but does provide a nice initial citrus smell.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on the face! No alcohol either so it doesn&#x27;t sting. The blend of organics really keeps my face feeling comfy after a shave.</li>
            <li> Being that I shave my head, I use this rather than regular aftershave because it doesn&#x27;t burn or chap my skin. Good product.</li>
            <li> There is no alcohol in this product. It has a light orange smell. It supposed to be some sort of face tonic but it&#x27;s no aftershave. It doesn&#x27;t do anything for me but make me smell like an orange for an hour or so. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I&#x27;ve gone through more bottles and tubes of more expensive aftershaves, balms, and whatnot, looking for something I like than I care to admit. Lucky Tiger is very soothing and refreshing on the face after a shave. No bite at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, the pleasant citrus aroma is only temporary, so if you or someone close to you is sensitive to smells, no worries. I actually like the smell and almost wish it would stick around longer. I generally switch between this and Clubman, an equally good aftershave.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy how my Lucky Tiger shave tonic leaves my face feeling. Other reviews say that there is a very light smell and that it dissipates quickly. I personally, do not buy an aftershave for the smell. I would rather that it soothes my face after a close shave and completes the whole process. This stuff does just that. It is a fairly thin liquid. I usually squeeze a generous amount into the palm of my hand and rub to create a slight lather. I then apply it to my face for a soothing and refreshing finish to my morning shave.</li>
            <li> First time I have tried this but it serves its purpose with no lingering smell. I don&#x27;t think I would have minded the smell when you first apply it lingering, but it does not.</li>
            <li> This tonic/aftershave is great, it smells great,helps heal the nicks and cools and heals the razor burn and slowly goes away and is not a overpowering smell, I love it and would recommend</li>
            <li> First this is not a product with alcohol, which is good because it dries the skin. It also last a lot and leaves the silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I must be highly allergic to this potion.  I wanted to scratch my face off.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Most people hear &amp;#34;after shave&amp;#34; and they immediately think Old Spice or Brut (I&#x27;m not much of a Brut fan, but if you don&#x27;t like Old Spice something is wrong with you). Lucky Tiger takes those preconceived notions a throws them out the window.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes out of the bottle very thin in consistency, and smells of oranges. When I say oranges I mean like freshly-peeled oranges. Natural. Nothing like Tang. No burn when applied, and the orange smell is gone about 2 minutes later. That&#x27;s a bummer if you like the orange smell (and why wouldn&#x27;t you?), but it&#x27;s nice in that it won&#x27;t clash with any cologne you want to wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously wonder how I ever shaved without this stuff. GREAT product.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works great.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - painless, soothing tonic that doesn&#x27;t strip out moisture, leaves my face feeling clean and hydrated for most of the day.</li>
            <li> This is a great after-shave I have used for probably ten years or more. Very soothing and refreshing, a natural product that is absorbed quickly without residue of any kind. The light herbal fragrance fades quickly so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with any scent you might wish to wear. A little goes a long way too.</li>
            <li> I bought this after shave tonic in November 2011 and I still have about half of the bottle left to use. I shave about twice or once a week. It smells very fresh and it&#x27;s a bit tangy, while it is not a scent that will last all day, it does feels very cool on my skin. It is not greasy, at all, so that&#x27;s good for me because I have an oily face and I certainly don&#x27;t wish to have more of that on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy this product, and so will you.</li>
            <li> I really like this. The scent is nice. I did put it in 2 oz spray bottle for better distribution.</li>
            <li> Good product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better things I have bought online. It is Vegan safe, it smells like citrus, it dries relatively quickly. I would give it a 42 out of 50. If you like citrus, and you are conscious of what you put on and in your body buy it. You should know, its lacks some of the sting that you might associate with after shave as well, so if your ... meek, this will work for you. If your a manly man and you want it to burn and be made from the souls of a thousand dead third world sweat shop workers stick to using 91 octane. I will buy this again, and agin probably then all you will now how cool it is and I will have to use something else. ;-)</li>
            <li> This shave tonic takes me to my special place when I splash it on my face after shaving.  The scent is just so refreshing, reminds me of a tropical breeze blowing in my face. That experience only lasts about 30 seconds then it&#x27;s gone along with the scent.  I guess that&#x27;s a good thing as it allows you to apply cologne if that&#x27;s what you want.  There&#x27;s no alcohol in it so no burn just soothing ingredients to make your face feel oh so good...</li>
            <li> I like the smell very much although it disappears in several minutes. This aftershave doesn&#x27;t include oil and the skin remains dry. Also the price is too high in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I use this a lot. Doesn&#x27;t sting. No strong overpowering smells like some</li>
            <li> Fantastic, very refreshing after a 3-pass shave.</li>
            <li> I love the smell when applied but I don&#x27;t think it is doing all that much for my skin after shaving.  I could take it or leave it.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and the citrus smell but very subtle and in 15 to 20 minutes, the fragrance is gone gone gone.</li>
            <li> Really the best after shave ever!</li>
            <li> I have used Lucky Tiger After Shave for the past 5 years, and absolutely love it.  I highly recommend this product as a gift for any male in your family.  Only downside is the cost, but still well worth it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff if you don&#x27;t like a strong smell or burning of alcohol.  It smells a little like oranges to me.  I use this when my wife doesn&#x27;t want me smelling like an old man or a cheap whore.  She can&#x27;t even notice a smell.  It leaves your face feeling cool and fresh.</li>
            <li> I love it, my wife has never sniffed and rubbed up on me more right after a shave.  I have never been one with frequent ingrown or irritations, but I haven&#x27;t had ANY since using this.</li>
            <li> This product got good reviews and some said that the scent was very light and did not last long but I had to see for myself.  They were right.  This feels good when first applied but that is all.  Hardly any scent and the good feeling does not last more than a few moments.  I will stay with Florida Water and Pinaud products.</li>
            <li> This aftershave has absolutely no burn to it thanks to the alcohol free formula. It feels great going on the skin. The only downside is the scent. Though I don&#x27;t mind, the scent is very similar to orange citrus cleaner/degreaser. I was concerned at first but the scent goes away within minutes. My wife did not notice the scent soon after I applied it and she is often quick to judge my aftershaves.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the fact that this tonic has a mild scent that dissipates quickly so it doesn&#x27;t clash with any cologne. Soothing, without the alcohol to burn.</li>
            <li> Great aftershave. First time I used it I had razor burn on my neck, which usually takes 3-4 days to heal with me. Popped it on after my bedtime shave (I shave at night) and it was gone in the morning. 2 things I&#x27;ve noticed people saying that I would like to clarify.&lt;br /&gt;1: People are saying there is no astringent in this product. Alcohol is not the only astringent in the world. Witch hazel is an astringent, which does not burn. By definition, true witch hazel contains 14% alcohol. No added alcohol, but yes, there is witch hazel. Does not burn whatsoever. This is one of this products main ingredients. Without the witch hazel, it would not heal nearly as well.&lt;br /&gt;2: Oily. People are stating that this product is not oily at all. I have found that it is very oily, initially. This isn&#x27;t a bad thing because after it dries it is not oily whatsoever. The oiliness of this product helps it penetrate and soothe. I noticed that it was oily when I realized I had to wash my hands. It&#x27;s almost balm-like in this fashion, yet still a liquid. It very easily rubs in and leaves no oily residue. Does not bead up when sweating either. And I would know if it would, I live in Alabama and we are currently experiencing very humid, 90+ degree evenings.&lt;br /&gt;Over-all, one of my favorite aftershaves I&#x27;ve ever used. The scent is light and goes away in minutes, literally. I like this because I can put on my scented alcohol based aftershaves after I let this dry, or some cologne. I love topping off this with a great premium scent. There is no AS I&#x27;ve found yet, balm, splash, what-have-you, that tops the healing qualities of this one. Forget thayers, forget Baxter, forget Castle Forbes, this stuff rocks. I just might order a surplus just so I don&#x27;t have to buy anymore for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Good after shave for great feeling skin. Has excellent citrus fragrance. The reason for four stars is the scent dies away quickly. This good for using cologne but  would like a version that the great smell last. It really helps with razor burn.</li>
            <li> A bit light for my liking. It does smell nice but if it was a bit more potent it would be better, just my opinion though.</li>
            <li> Good product; timely shipping.</li>
            <li> It may be good for your skin according to label. Week unimpressive scent. But the bottle looks nice.</li>
            <li> All natural ingredients, replaces witch hazel for me. A little expensive, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It has come to my attention that this product has been re-formulated to eliminate the paraben preservatives, although the ingredient list on Amazon for this product is still listing parabens.  The effectiveness of this product is pretty decent, the scent mild and unobtrusive and dissipates within a few minutes of application.  The initial scent is an orange/citrus but is all but undetectable after about 3 or 4 minutes, so it will never interfere with a cologne, or to keep you completely unscented if that is your thing. (The way I generally prefer my aftershave products to be.)  The witch hazel and other ingredients calms any mild irritation very quickly without stinging.  If you like that \\&quot;alcohol burn\\&quot;, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This product is alright - in my opinion not worthy of all the hype and stellar 5-star reviews.  The solution is very thin and doesn&#x27;t last as long as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> One of my all time favorite after shaves!  I highly recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like the burn of some AS.  It goes on smooth and really soothes your face after a shave.  It has a very pleasant orangy scent.  Highly recommend this to any shaver!</li>
            <li> Has all three things I look for in an aftershave:&lt;br /&gt;1.) Lightweight.  No clogged pores or greasy face.&lt;br /&gt;2.) Almost fragrance free.  I hate smelling chemicals under my nose all day.  This smells barely like citrus on application, then fades over a half hour.&lt;br /&gt;3.) Alcohol free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this same bottle for over a year now.  This is my favorite aftershave.  I use a badger hair brush, Proraso shave soap, and a Feather straight razor.</li>
            <li> If you are a wet shaver or DE enthuiast then you should try this product.  It has a light citrus scent that doesn&#x27;t last too long and won&#x27;t clash with your cologne.  There is no alcohol in this product, so it doesn&#x27;t burn.  I will be purchasing this product again, but I may test a few other after shaves out as well.  I would like to try a good bay rum w/ lime aftershave.  There is a moisterizer in this product, but my face is usually pretty dry in the winter time, so I use a moisterizer after applying Lucky Tiger.  During the summer I will probably just dust a little clubman talc on my chest and neck and be fine after applying this.  I purchased this aftershave because of all the rave reviews it got.  After trying it for myself I see why.  Right now I&#x27;m using C.O. Bigelow shave cream along with Proraso pre-shave for sensitive skin and then finishing with Lucky Tiger.  If you don&#x27;t have these three products, get them.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Great light citrus smell, provide a nice post-shave refreshment and definitely soothes the skin and reduce irritation. Not much else to say - the results are just darn good. Definitely worth a shot!</li>
            <li> Eh..., there are better.  Did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Lucky Tiger is a classic. An after shave that has graced many an old fashioned barber shop and rockabilly&#x27;s routine since 1935.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell has a solid citrus base and is very refreshing. A great summer choice. Also perfect every day wear that dissipates quickly and won&#x27;t leave your co-workers offended. You will not be that one guy at work that, embarrassingly, wears way too much cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t tell you how disappointing it is to receive my new bottle of this classic in a plastic bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t fulfill the Lucky Tiger brand promise at all. In fact it disrespects the brand promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would you like your favorite Whiskey to arrive in a plastic bottle? Would you expect your barber to splash anything out in a plastic bottle? Would you expect a plastic bottle from Lucky Tiger?  Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, bad execution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this aftershave a couple of times but so far I enjoy it very much.  It goes on light and absorbs quickly.  It leaves a clean feeling and helps to calm and soothe skin after shaving.  I like the scent it has...sort of a citrus scent, like an orange.  Even though I knew before making the purchase that the scent is very fast to dissipate, I still wish that the scent would like a little longer.</li>
            <li> Lucky Tiger....really?  I am almost embarrassed by the name...but it is a great product.  Pleasant scent, will not over power no matter how much you use....within reason.  It is at its beast if you have a sunburn, windburn, etc on your face....soothes without feeling greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Very Pleasant and refreshing scent. Good choice for those looking for mild aftershave products.</li>
            <li> Soothing, very light not oily consistency. Love the smell. Why so many after-shave makers go for these plastic bottles is something I just don&#x27;t understand. Buy the stuff and then buy a nice perfume bottle to hold it and you&#x27;ll be good to go. But they should still change the bottle to glass. It would be soooo much cooler.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff but I have to admit that it feels more like a tonic to apply to heal your face.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has quality minimal amount of ingredients and a nice smell faintly of cucumbers, but there&#x27;s really very little relief or moisture provided to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using baxter of california which for me provides more moisture and a stronger scent as well as a cooling action that burns at first but provides relief to razor burn after a couple minutes.  Unfortunately lucky tiger (as great of a product as I think it is) doesn&#x27;t really cut it for me, but for those who just want a very minimal quality tonic to slap on their face it might be your jam.  The baxter (sadly) has some ingredients in it that sound less natural but I really needed a little more moisture and immediate face tingle than lucky tiger is giving me right now.</li>
            <li> Feels great. Better like the smell. Stays with you for a while.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get any better than this for that clean crisp finish. Love it!</li>
            <li> This spring I started wet shaving with a traditional double edged razor.  I purchased the Lucky Tiger After Shave when my first bottle of Clubman Bay Rum was almost finished.  While I like the feel of the Lucky Tiger After Shave in the hand prior to application and on the face when applied, I HATE the taste it leaves behind on my upper lip, especially when drinking coffee.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good for your face and doesn&#x27;t burn when applied.  Also, you won&#x27;t stink up any room you enter for hours.  I just wanted to make sure anyone who is buying it to know what it smells like is fully aware that it is just lemon scented aftershave.  Most of the reviews wanted to go on and on about how fresh it smells and how good it is for their skin but no one ever actually bothered to describe the scent.</li>
            <li> Has a great citrusy smell but doesn&#x27;t have any alcohol. So if you like a little burn you won&#x27;t get it from this.  The smell doesn&#x27;t last very long but I don&#x27;t want it to anyway so that was a plus for me.  Very soothing.</li>
            <li> extremely light citrus scent, very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I received this in a gift pack of cleanser, shave cream, aftershave tonic, and moisturizer. Hey, where&#x27;s the cologne?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the products are marvelous, very gentle and fine quality, making my morning shaving routine a special treat (plus I get to remember the lovely lady to gave them to me). This aftershave tonic is one of the more gentle ones I&#x27;ve found, very little or no alcohol content to burn and dry out your skin. As it should be. So no need to splash off the burning stuff and then moisturize, just leave on the skin for a few minutes, then follow up with moisturizer/balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great quality, as I said, and the company has a rich heritage judging from the included literature. I&#x27;m fortunate to have made the Lucky Tiger&#x27;s acquaintance.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a manly old school after shave, Lucky Tiger is not a Proraso or Musgo Real. It is gentle. It has chamomile. It has a pleasant fragrance that is very subtle. It is best used as a skin toner on a cotton ball, not as a splash.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to discourage him from stealing my face toner.  One of the main complaints people had about this aftershave was its lack of scent, which is exactly what my husband likes about the smell.  It&#x27;s kind of citrusy and disperses after about ten minutes, so this is a great product if you don&#x27;t like strong scents.  My husband also says this is the best stuff he&#x27;s ever used to prevent razor burn and breakouts from shaving.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few years now. No reactions. I can&#x27;t stand heavily perfumed or petroleum based products. If you want something mostly natural and easy on the skin, try this.</li>
            <li> I purchased a safety razor and bought a bottle of this at the same time.  I love the safety razor.  I never had a shave so close before and will never go back to the new razors.  The close shave does irritate the skins a bit and this tonic makes your face feel great after a shave.  It has a very light citrus fragrance that fades away very quickly.  This is a plus in my book as it does not conflict with your cologne.</li>
            <li> Great on face, not much of a lasting smell, bets this is Dean Martin used it.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I really like how it makes my skin feel.  It smells great and doesn&#x27;t sting since there&#x27;s no alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> Very good smell of sweet and fresh orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the wonderful smell doesn&#x27;t last too much.</li>
            <li> I love the bottle and the light orange scent this product has. However, for me, the product is just ok. Not impressed at all with the outcome after using when done shaving. I really don&#x27;t think this does much of anything. At least for me. I prefer Clubman products over this by far. I will give it a try in the summer to see if there is any difference with the change in weather. But for me, Clubman product far exceed Luck Tiger shave and face tonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** After using this product for a while I would like to say I was wrong with my first review. I have to say this has really helped my complexion and does a nice job with Clubman product in toning and moisturizing my face after shaving and washing. I will continue to use this product as it has done wonders for my skin. I have have changed my rating from 3 stars to 5.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
            <li> I love that there is a subtle smell that does not carry through the day. I&#x27;m not a cologne kind of guy, but it makes my face feel great after a shave and then doesn&#x27;t linger</li>
            <li> This is a face tonic, not a traditional aftershave. The sweet scent is unexpected but I like it a lot. The scent does not linger long after applied (so this doesn&#x27;t double as a scent or cologne like some face treatments do). I enjoy the way my face feels after using the product. I don&#x27;t notice a film or any residual tonic after it drys/evaporates. The bottle is plastic but looks very classy.</li>
            <li> Great citrus-orange smell that fades away after about 30 seconds by design. Moisturizes the skin nicely after shaving.</li>
            <li> This is a great aftershave for people that don&#x27;t like the overpowering smell of most aftershaves. It is a very light and subtle orange smell that won&#x27;t cause other people to block their nose when you enter the room.</li>
            <li> After shaving my big bald head - this stuff soothes!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I saw it for sale on Amazon and thought, &amp;#34;I remember this from barber shops when I was a boy&amp;#34;. Since I was a boy I never used it, of course. But I do now and I love it. Every like product claims to soothe your face, but this one actually does. If you want a lot of scent, try something else. But if you want to use something that makes your face feel smooth and clean, this is for you.</li>
            <li> Always thought that I would need more of a thick lotion for this job but Lucky Tiger  works great.  Soothes my face and doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li> Face was sore from shaving and winter wind-burn. Healed within two days.  Nice smooth product made with plant extracts.  I plan to buy more when needed.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This a good tonic and aftershave. I splash it on my face after shaving. I also pour some on a cotton pad or ball and run it over my forehead and nose to take off the excess oil. I&#x27;m not crazy about the orange fragrance, but it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> You will be disappointed if you are looking for a lasting (or fleeting) fragrance. It does smell like oranges for about all of 10 seconds, then nothing. I&#x27;m using it after I wash up at night. Jury is still out on moisturizing properties. Based on the reviews, I would classify as overrated.</li>
            <li> I really love Lucky Tiger after shave and tonic! No alcohol, is light and not oily at all, Only need very little as it applies very well. Skin feel is wonderful. Has a an excellent fragrance - but it&#x27;s light and disappears rapidly - too bad. I&#x27;d buy a bottle of just the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;In every sense of the word, I *enjoy* using the after shave and whenever I think of shaving, I look forward most to applying Lucky Tiger on my fresh, clean face!</li>
            <li> Great scent,  doesn&#x27;t last very long. Some may like that, some may not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 and for most of my life I have usually favored a mainstream but nice after shave most of my life but the &amp;#34;present owner&amp;#34; of the long time and valued recipe has...  yes, diluted it. To get the original after shave one has to know where to go to get the original, now made over seas by a small company who has the rights to make it. It&#x27;s expensive but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;In my search to find this aftershave I came across 3-4 after shaves which intrigued me. One was exotic sounding and amazingly had some good reviews but turned out to be the worst smelling &amp;#34;anything&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever made opened in my house! I threw it out. Carefully!&lt;br /&gt;So I was nervous about the next experiment: this &amp;#34;Lucky Tiger&amp;#34; after shave.&lt;br /&gt;Wow was I ever surprised and pleasantly taken back when it arrived and I tried it. I&#x27;ve used this after shave for 3-4 days now and I&#x27;m in love with it!&lt;br /&gt;It is subtle, with just a hint of sweetness and spice. Leaves no overly strong fragrance. Feels wonderful on the skin and has the textures of a splash lotion&amp;#34;. If that were to exist... it has both at moments.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered two more bottles! Of course everyone is different so recommending after shaves is something I won&#x27;t do. All I can say is I wish this after shave was readily available in my local area. I love it!</li>
            <li> Lightly scented (citrus) and soothing upon application. Helps to moisturize after a shave and prevent razor burn.</li>
            <li> Use it after every shave, right after alum block, and before TOBS Mr. Taylor&#x27;s Aftershave  Balm. Great, light, citrusy aroma. Wakes your skin up, and just makes it feel good. Gave 4, instead of 5, as it&#x27;s dispense method can easily waste a bit (but...a little goes long way). I shave at night, but this is the 1st thing I grab after morning shower. Wakes up your skin, and your senses, with it&#x27;s scent and fresh feeling (on my 3rd bottle)......I love this stuff. Between the Anthony Logistics Rush shower gel, and Lucky Tiger, you&#x27;re alert and ready to tackle the day. But it&#x27;s still great as intro intended, post shave. Calms the redness, especially if you&#x27;ve hit an area a little too hard.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great only takes a little to cover your face after a shave. It&#x27;s soothing and smells nice even if it&#x27;s faint. The only thing I was hoping for was that it came in a timeless glass bottle, but it was plastic, oh well. No complaint about the product itself give it a try it&#x27;ll do good things for your face.</li>
            <li> Try this with the Lucky Tiger liquid cream shave.  Great Combo.  Excellent for the summer as it is not greasy or thick.</li>
            <li> My wife says it is &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34;, but not too strong. I like the scent, which is very subtle. I recommend that if you are thinking about giving it a try, do so with out hesitation.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying Lucky Tiger After Shave/Face Tonic and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It smells mostly like oranges, but there is also a hint of other citrus/floral. The scent does not linger all day which I like. It lasts maybe 30 minutes to 1 hour. It won&#x27;t burn you at all when you apply it, and I&#x27;ve noticed that the face tonic claim isn&#x27;t just a gimmick. My face doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much dry skin after shaving as I used to. I like it a lot compared to other products I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;d say if you are looking for a new product this is worth a try.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very refreshing.  It comforts and soothes your face after a close shave,  without leaving a greasy or oily film.  The scent is very fresh and citrus.  I would like for the scent to last longer.  However.  this is not a cologne  product it is  a refreshing face soother and conditioner.  I am pleased that I purchased it.  I agree with the 4 and 5 star reviews...</li>
            <li> Great product!!! I just started wet shaving with a straight razor so the whole process in new to me. I used this stuff after I shaved and it was amazing!!! The smell is great but not overwhelming. Felt so good on my face I doubled up. You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...I&#x27;ve been trying every after shave product I could find for 30 years and finally found this.  Can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t try it before.  I love the smell and the clean, fresh feeling it leaves me with.  The best part of shaving!</li>
            <li> Smells good. Not overwhelming. Doesn&#x27;t burn like others containing alcohol. The scent does not linger long which could be a good thing depending on what you are looking for. Give it a try. I like it</li>
            <li> Amazing on my skin and smells wonderful. For the price, this is far better than the Khiels and TOBS after shaves that I have been paying for.</li>
            <li> Very light lemony fragrance. Nice toning effect. Just not same as my usual brand.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, but just doesn&#x27;t suit my tastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main things to know:&lt;br /&gt;-Alcohol free!  So when you normally get that &amp;#34;clean/fresh&amp;#34; (some of you may call it &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34;) sensation when using aftershave, you won&#x27;t get it with this!  For me, that&#x27;s a big drawback, but maybe a bonus to someone else.&lt;br /&gt;-Not that strong of a scent.  If it was a bit stronger and had more &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34; (i.e. lasted longer) that would be preferable.&lt;br /&gt;-Big bottle for the price though, larger than a $5 thing of Old Spice, it would probably last me 6 mo - 1 yr.</li>
            <li> Unlike other users, I find the initial smell terrible. Although it dissipates rather quickly, the pungent odor is a wake up in itself. Does a nice job cooling the face after shaving though.</li>
            <li> This product is an old barber shop favorite, and I can see why. I don&#x27;t whether it actually physically does any good, but I do know that a small splash of this product on my face and neck after shaving really feels good helps me get going in the morning. It has a light aroma but isn&#x27;t a cologne.</li>
            <li> Seller did good job in its description of product. Delivery right on time. No issues. To soon to leave product info other then saying scent is nice and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Light &amp;#34;orange/citrus&amp;#34; smell that fades fairly quickly.  No-burn skin &amp;#34;tonic&amp;#34;.  Use it like you would a Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this with an order, and decided to buy a bottle.  I&#x27;ve tried several different brands over the last year as I&#x27;ve picked up wet shaving, and each has its ups and downs.  Lucky Tiger has a very pleasant, very light scent that dissipates quickly.  It goes on with the consistency of water, but dries cleanly - no gel/sticky feeling afterwards.  No alcohol, and paraben free.</li>
            <li> Not much scent, no sting at all. I&#x27;m not too sure if I like it or not... I&#x27;m used to my aftershave stinging when I apply it, this makes me wonder if I&#x27;ve been doing it all wrong or if it really does anything. Slight citrus and clove smell.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using long, but glad I went with this: low-fragrance, soothing after-shave. Clean, moisturizing and exactly what I had read about here.</li>
            <li> Did not feel like aftershave.</li>
            <li> Great alcohol free aftershave at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.. not as great as some of the reviews i read. not strong effect.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband who LOVES this.  The after shave was packaged well and arrived promptly.  1bottle lasts quite a long time and it smells good and he won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
