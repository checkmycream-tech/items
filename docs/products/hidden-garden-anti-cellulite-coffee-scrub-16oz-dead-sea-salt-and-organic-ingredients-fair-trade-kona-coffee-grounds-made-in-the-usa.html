            <li>It leaves my skin feeling fresh!</li>
            <li>but it bothers specially when I wear shorts, skirts and bathing suits.</li>
            <li>Many scrubs can be really oily/greasy.</li>
            <li>The product was received quickly.  </li>
            <li>The new product arrived quickly and was packed appropriately with no leaking.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I love how this scrub smells and how soft it makes my skin!</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I am hoping for some stellar results</li>
            <li>I tried it on parts of my body first to see if I could tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>so glad I got this &amp;def plan on buying in the future.  </li>
            <li>This bottle will last a long time because it is a good sized jar.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference this scrub does make my skin feel smooth and super soft.</li>
            <li>This one not so much.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t even need lotion after applying.</li>
            <li>I really like this scrub.</li>
            <li>I really like this scrub because it makes my skin smoother</li>
            <li>I dont know how good it actually is, but for now, this was my first impression, just messy.</li>
            <li>and boy oh boy do i have cellulite specially under my bottom upper thigh area.</li>
            <li>i dont know EXACTLY what i was expecting, but so far i havent seen results.</li>
            <li>When I first got it, there was oil all over the jar, so I wish it was packed a little better, but it wasn&#x27;t really a big deal.</li>
            <li>After using it, your skin feels very smooth and moisturized, I don&#x27;t even feel the need to put on lotion after my bath or shower (which I usually do).</li>
            <li>I love all scrubs in general, and I recently started dry brushing</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin few smooth, soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no trouble with the shower getting slippery after use either.</li>
            <li>I emailed the company directly immediately.  </li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I checked product for dryness level and it was pretty dry.  </li>
            <li>First off i just had a baby a year and a half ago</li>
            <li>and I actually noticed that some of my cellulite is not as apparent as before.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really big jar and should last a while, which is good because I use scrubs like crazy.</li>
            <li>I like how this scrub is not too greasy, although you have to be careful and not scoop too much at once since it does not stay clumped for long.</li>
            <li>when I opened the package, everything was oily and really it was a mess..</li>

            <li> This was purchased for my wife for exfoliating specifically and she says it works great. She says it&#x27;s perfectly gritty, smells good, and washes off easily. A tub of this size should last a couple of months if used once a week.  She plans on buying more.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try this product at a discounted price. If you like the smell of coffee, you will LOVE this scrub. This is a fairly big jar, so it should last you awhile. Many scrubs can be really oily/greasy. This one not so much. There is a slight slick feeling, but I barely notice it. I&#x27;ve had no trouble with the shower getting slippery after use either. The texture is large-grained and sugary. It feels good when you rub it in and really seems to exfoliate the skin. I really don&#x27;t even need lotion after applying. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference to the dimply texture of my skin, but I have noticed the skin does seem to be tightening a little and is definitely softer after using about 2 weeks. You won&#x27;t find a miracle cure in a jar, but this scrub does help with the tone of your skin. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because when I received the product, though it was in heavy bubble wrap, there was some leakage into my box. If you&#x27;re going to order, you might want to order separately from any other items. Again, this has a strong smell of coffee. If that&#x27;s not your thing, this isn&#x27;t the scrub for you.</li>
            <li> omg it smells soooooo good&lt;br /&gt;- big tub so you can use enough of it&lt;br /&gt;- I could smell it before even opening it&lt;br /&gt;- smells seriously good, just like yummy fresh coffee mmmmmm&lt;br /&gt;- so happy with this product, it just makes me happy using it, aromatherapy is powerful&lt;br /&gt;- I use it in the shower with a cellulite massager and combined with eating healthy, drinking a gallon of water a day and working out 6 times a week I am hoping for some stellar results&lt;br /&gt;- look at that list of ingredients, all amazing for your skin&lt;br /&gt;- so happy they used organic fair trade kona coffee for this&lt;br /&gt;received a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> i dont know EXACTLY what i was expecting, but so far i havent seen results. i know it takes time so im fine with that. there is a strong coffee smell and it is a good exfoliator. it is not too rough on my skin. it doesnt leave heavy residue in my shower. ill update about the cellulite !</li>
            <li> The product was received quickly.  When the package arrived it had leaked all over the inside and outside of the packing box.  I emailed the company directly immediately.  They responded very quick and told me to check the product for moisture.  I checked product for dryness level and it was pretty dry.  Emailed the company again to let them know.  They were very kind and informed me that they would send new product immediately.  The new product arrived quickly and was packed appropriately with no leaking.&lt;br /&gt;This product smells like coffee so if you don&#x27;t like the smell of coffee you should not buy it.  The product has a great scrubbing and moisturizing ability.  Your skin feels tighter after use.  I tried it on parts of my body first to see if I could tell a difference.  The parts I used this product on were tighter and more moisturized than the parts I did not use it on.  I think this is a great product with excellent customer service.  I will continue to use this product and would definitely recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Love this it feels great and smells like a delicous cup of coffee. I notice a difference in my skin. It is definately tighter</li>
            <li> I love this. Smells just like coffee. Yum</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Does just what it says!</li>
            <li> Smells great! When I got mine it was leaking. It had busted open during shipping. Not enough to lose the product, but enough for the oil to seep out everywhere. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times. Not sure how good it works, but love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I love how this scrub smells and how soft it makes my skin! Overall a great exfoliant!</li>
            <li> I really like this scrub. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review and was so happy to be able to try it. I love all scrubs in general, and I recently started dry brushing so I figured I could add this into my routine. When I first got it, there was oil all over the jar, so I wish it was packed a little better, but it wasn&#x27;t really a big deal. It&#x27;s a really big jar and should last a while, which is good because I use scrubs like crazy. It has a strong coffee smell, which I could smell as soon as opening up the package. So if you don&#x27;t like the smell of coffee, this scrub probably isn&#x27;t for you. After using it, your skin feels very smooth and moisturized, I don&#x27;t even feel the need to put on lotion after my bath or shower (which I usually do). With the dry brushing and using this scrub I can definitely see an improvement in skin texture.</li>
            <li> Very nice scrub, hopefully it will help my cellulite.</li>
            <li> I really like this scrub because it makes my skin smoother</li>
            <li> First off i just had a baby a year and a half ago and boy oh boy do i have cellulite specially under my bottom upper thigh area. Ive tried i think every cream and wash on the shelf at the store nothing worked. So when i saw this i thought shoot why not. It works. Its all slowly fading and tightening. The smell of this is also amazing. And it exfoliates at the same time. My skin has never looked better. This is worth every penny. It saved me from getting lipo.</li>
            <li> One of my favs by fa from Amazon Elite deal Club.  Im so glad I got this &amp;def plan on buying in the future.  Its a great mix of coffee &amp; sea salt &amp; feels great to the skin</li>
            <li> Great scrub. I used to use the apricot facial scrub but I found that to be a little too harsh for my skin. I was given the opportunity to try out this scrub at a discount in exchange for my honest review. This bottle will last a long time because it is a good sized jar. Also it smells like coffee (so delicious). I like how this scrub is not too greasy, although you have to be careful and not scoop too much at once since it does not stay clumped for long. I use it on stretch marks on my body and I do see it diminishing after a couple weeks of use. I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> First impression wasnt that great to be honest. when I opened the package, everything was oily and really it was a mess.. I dont know how good it actually is, but for now, this was my first impression, just messy.</li>
            <li> Feels really refreshing and is a great body scrub in general.  This product makes my skin few smooth, soft and I actually noticed that some of my cellulite is not as apparent as before.  Good stuff but hoping that I get to see less cellulite after continued use.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT WITH BLISS ELECTRIC MASSAGER SKIN FEELS SMOOTHER WILL UPDATE LATER ON CELLUITE JUST GOT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> It is a nice scrub and smells great!</li>
            <li> I have cellulite in the back of my legs it&#x27;s not too bad but it bothers specially when I wear shorts, skirts and bathing suits. I&#x27;ve been using this anti cellulite along with a cellulite cream for a couple of weeks now and I haven&#x27;t really noticed a big difference this scrub does make my skin feel smooth and super soft. The scrub does smell like coffee I love coffee so the scent doesn&#x27;t bother me I only use this scrub 3 times a week I have somewhat sensitive skin but this scrub doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I love the way this scrub smells! And I love the wait it leaves my skin feeling. I can&#x27;t wait to start seeing the results (I&#x27;ve only been using for 2 days). I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy after feel which drives me nut. It leaves just the right kind of moisture.</li>
            <li> I received this product a few days ago and just started using it. The smell is wonderful; like a fresh cup of coffee. The feeling the scrub is nice and smooth. It leaves my skin feeling fresh!</li>
