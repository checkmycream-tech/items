            <li>I love my Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I was so upset not being able to find the brush replacement for my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Price Gouging, and (2) E-Series Brush Heads perform better than the A-Series Brush Heads.</li>
            <li>Each brush stroke on the E-Series thus covers and cleans more teeth area.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;The A-Series brush head does a phenomenal job of cleaning your teeth and gum line.</li>
            <li>/&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;The A-Series brush head does a phenomenal job of cleaning your teeth and gum line.</li>
            <li>I never have bleeding gums any more.</li>
            <li>, MANY cavities before using it.</li>

            <li>I love my Sonicare Toothbrush and the replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li>: they&#x27;re good quailty, they last a good amount of time and they&#x27;re effective.</li>

            <li>Satisfied with the product and delivery time.  </li>
            <li>I cannot even begin to tell you how much I love using the Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I bought my son the Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush for Christmas many years ago and every year since then I have bought him the replacement brushheads</li>
            <li>needed replacement brushes and wasn&#x27;t sure which to get.</li>
            <li>A Series is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I love the Sonicare toothbrush system.  </li>

            <li>Love Love Love these replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Have replaced the 4100 many times and also replace the heads every three months.</li>
            <li>I bought a genuine Sonicare factory sealed retail package!</li>
            <li>Arrived timely, and more importantly, the description in the online listing was sufficient that we got what we needed/wanted!</li>
            <li>but you must replace the heads alot more often.  </li>
            <li>Sonicare is just better.  </li>
            <li>I love the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Favorite Books:</li>
            <li>The person I talked with could not have been more helpful in seeing that it worked</li>
            <li>I still have my Sonicare toothbrush from years back and still consider it the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>You will never be able to see the difference...</li>
            <li>These are pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I was able to find the replacement heads easily on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My wife loves the older form of Sonicare electronic toothbrush with a thicker handle, and it was great to surprise her that I found it still available.</li>
            <li>This price is better than Wal*mart&#x27;s, and with the free shipping option, it makes a lot of sense to not use the gas to get them.</li>
            <li>This was the first product of this type and as far as I am concerned, the best.  </li>
            <li>Excellent brush heads that are straight and not slanted as the new ones are.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Intrigued, I tried popping the E-Series brush head into my Sonicare Advance - it&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li>Good price for replacement heads and delivery was fast and accurate.</li>
            <li>It fits the A-Series toothbrush and is easy to replace.</li>
            <li>As a long-time user of both the A-Series and the E-Series brush heads, I strongly recommend the E-Series brush heads instead.uildup</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve had my sonicare for 9 years and still going strong.  </li>
            <li>her&#x27;s is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>(the Sonicare Healthy White) requires different heads), I just wanted to put my two cents in for how great I thought they were for the great number of years</li>
            <li>Mine still works fine.  </li>
            <li>Works fine,  </li>
            <li>I have not opened the one from Amazon but see no reason it want be fine.</li>
            <li>My family was extremely happy to have a fresh new toothbrush head.</li>
            <li>I wear braces and the sonicare toothbrush is wonderful for keeping all those little crannies cleaned out...</li>
            <li>Sonicare made a huge difference in the way my teeth and gums feel.</li>
            <li>Product is discontinued -  so I was fortunate to find it.  </li>
            <li>Sure, the refills are pricey, but in what you save at the dentist, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>6 months before obviously needing to be replaced (bristles start to splay out) and the subscription program is great as I don&#x27;t need to remember to order them</li>
            <li>I was really happy to find these replacement brush heads recently for my Philips Sonicare Advance.  </li>
            <li>I just read that the E replacement will fit on the Advance toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love my sonic care....never, ever had such good visits with my dentist.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean and it has made a huge difference in my dentist appointments.  </li>
            <li>For the cost of buying a pair of halfway decent disposable brushes every month, I get replacement heads for my own Sonicare Advance brush and for my husband&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Since I started using my Sonicare over four years ago my dentist has consistently conmmented about my healthy gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>and they are original equipment.</li>
            <li>Since we&#x27;d purchased the original ( a replacement unit for one that had expired), at Costco, had hoped that Costco would still carry the replacement heads.</li>
            <li>well worth the money!</li>
            <li>have the original unit.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth look and feel.</li>
            <li>However, despite some dentists saying you don&#x27;t have to use brushing movements, my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean if I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>They  could feel that their teeth were getting clean easier.</li>
            <li>Great, knew it would perform as expected.</li>
            <li>And being able to buy replacement heads at Amazon makes the whole business easier.</li>
            <li>But received quickly and AOK so 5 stars.</li>
            <li>These tooth brushes fit in my mouth comfortable and they are very efficient at cleaning my teath.  </li>
            <li>I get them quickly.</li>
            <li>We had a hard time finding the right replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s Sonic toothbrush but we found them at a good price on Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>ok - would recommend highly this business that handles the replacements.  </li>
            <li>Great brushes, because they are big enough to cover more area.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more than I paid for the whole thing in the first place.  </li>
            <li>Product is exactly as promised!</li>
            <li>These heads are hard to find, so am grateful to be able to get them on Amazon at a good price.</li>
            <li>The E-Series brush heads has several improvements over the A-Series brush heads - the most important of which is the improved cleaning ability of the E-Series.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare Advance for a couple of years now and been satisfied so far.</li>
            <li>It was worth the wait during transit.</li>
            <li>I like that they come with different colors so everyone gets their own.  </li>
            <li>shipment was quick and arrived fast</li>
            <li>The replacement heads are quite expensive, so I try to buy them where I can get the best price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Smaller Brush Head - Better Reach&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Sonicare toothbrushes are among the best you can buy although the replacement heads are rather expensive</li>
            <li>These replacement brushes do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>We purchased the smaller head ones for our toddlers who love using \\&quot;mommy and daddy&#x27;s toothbrush!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Extremely fast shipping of this product!  </li>
            <li>In fact, the brush heads that I was replacing which were 8 months old had more firmness to them than the brand new brush heads that I ordered here.  </li>
            <li>Since most of my teeth are capped the brush is really for my gums, and it does a great job; hardly any cleaning necessary every six months.</li>
            <li>my old (original \\&quot;standard\\&quot;) sonicare is still vibrating and shaking them plaques off my teeth -</li>
            <li>Combined with Colgate Total toothpaste (which has active anti-gingivitis ingredients) my gums stopped bleeding in two weeks and feel great ever since.  </li>
            <li>e-Series Standard Replacement Brush Heads, 2-Pack]] work just fine on our A-Series toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Sonicare makes a decent toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Wide Angle of Brush Movement - Better Cleaning</li>
            <li>really like my Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>My wife thinks I&#x27;m a bit too much like \\&quot;Monk\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Thanks for listening.</li>
            <li>When brushing your teeth the brush head is gentle on your gums.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery...easy to find on your site and no stress</li>
            <li>Thanks you so much.    </li>
            <li>Thanks Heavens Amazon Sellers still sell these.</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and the cost was reasonable.</li>
            <li>The battery did die and I had to replace the whole thing.  </li>
            <li>These brush heads work very well with my Philips Sonicaire brush.</li>
            <li>I never had any sorts of problems with the heads and felt that they cleaned really well</li>
            <li>The everyday price was a good value and there was no trouble of having to search for the brushes to go on sale.  </li>
            <li>Since this is an ancient Sonicare unit I own, it&#x27;s not easy to find these replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>I came online to buy brush heads for my Sonicare toothbrush because I own an older version and have trouble finding the correct replacements in stores.  </li>
            <li>The improvements that Sonic care has made is evident in the more expensive models, like more compact head, and slimmer design.  </li>
            <li>The only replacement head that lets you clean the moisture that accumulates inside.</li>
            <li>(My teeth don&#x27;t feel clean when the head goes bad; it still looks like new, just doesn&#x27;t clean as good.)</li>
            <li>We live in Alaska, and this was received within a week of placing the order!</li>
            <li>The smaller brush head provides a better reach on the back teeth</li>
            <li>Sonicare makes a great product; my only complaint is that the head comes loose---from the vibrations, I suppose.</li>
            <li>Our recent order of replacement brushes through Amazon went through quickly and without any fuss.  </li>
            <li>Needed to replace our older (A-Series)</li>
            <li>Have been a Philips Sonicare user for over 2 decades now, and believe that the very first one created is the one that was made to last.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brush heads.</li>
            <li>All the new ones get gross quickly.</li>
            <li>Luckily my old standby Amazon had them and the price was much lower than what sonicare said I would find them for, (if I found them at all).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to get that old toothpaste out of there no matter how much I soak it.</li>
            <li>The thinner shaft not only makes it easier to reach the back teeth, it is less invasive and much more friendly to your mouth</li>
            <li>So I go online to order new A-Series brushes from Amazon like I always to</li>
            <li>Your Sonicare tooithbrush is new again.  </li>
            <li>Brand new product at a discounted price.  </li>
            <li>Please advise Sonicare that when we received the toothbrushes, we pluged in the Sonicare Unit and it will not start, so we must cancel the every 6 month contract to send new toothbrushes, until we can purchase a new Sonicare Unit.    </li>
            <li>I decided it was time to purchase a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>These replacement brushes fit our unit perfectly and my only complaint is after every use you have to take off the plastic screw piece or mold will start growing due to the trapped water underneath.  </li>
            <li>As usual with Amazon we are extremely pleased with both pricing and speed of shipping.</li>
            <li>and I waited many days past the est day of arrival before I contacted someone about not receiving my toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>The same exact replacement sells for $29 at Sears.   </li>
            <li>Its the first one on the left.</li>
            <li>Puchased new heads for a 10 year old sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It is getting difficult to find the replacement tooth brushes for the earlier Sonic Care models, the brushes I purchased through Amazon are great.</li>
            <li>The brushes were so soft</li>
            <li>Please advise how I can contact them direct or if you can let them know for us.    </li>
            <li>I prefer the Compact Brush Heads which have only 5 rows of bristles; Standard has 8 rows of bristles; MY fault; Buyers be more careful than I was.</li>
            <li>Plus the brush action won&#x27;t wear away sensitive teeth at the receding gum line (if you have that problem.)  </li>
            <li>(Proust Complete)]],   </li>
            <li>Make cleaning teeth at least feel more efficient.</li>
            <li>Spent $50 on two of these because our original A series heads last 18 months.</li>
            <li>The standard size head is a bit large to get to the backside of the teeth in smaller mouths on this model.</li>
            <li>It comes in a one or two pack so you can save money and only have to purchase a new brush head once every 6 months.</li>
            <li>Once you use one there is no other.</li>
            <li>I could find them from no other source, on the web or otherwise</li>
            <li>Usually when I buy these they are two different colors in one package - this makes it easy for my husband and I to know which is which.</li>
            <li>I purchased my model 2 years ago and it has been discontinued and/or updated, and replacement brushes are no longer available in stores nor on the Philips Sonicare site (at least when I looked.)  </li>
            <li>Amazon has these priced considerably lower than the local drugstores.</li>
            <li>My old toothbrush will last forever!  </li>
            <li>Product and condition were as expected at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The instructions are clear and it&#x27;s true that an entire cleaning should take no more than a minute or so (in sections).  </li>
            <li>Alas, the latest model they carry is the E-series.</li>
            <li>Worth the few extra bucks.</li>
            <li>recently got a brush head replacement for my Sonicare Elite and noticed that it is stated right on the package of the E-Series brush head replacements - in black and white - that the E-Series brush head replacements are now compatible with Sonicare Advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apparently, Amazon is the only source, can&#x27;t find them elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Getting harder to find the standard head for the older model.  </li>
            <li>Returning it was more of a hassle than it was worth, so I kept the brushes, but still I was disappointed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Thinner Shaft&lt;br /&gt;The shaft of the E-Series is also much thinner and slightly flexible.</li>

            <li> I am very happy with the service on all my orders.</li>
            <li> Excellent web site.</li>
            <li> Sonicare makes one of the best ways to care for your teeth.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is excellent, and it is recommended to replace the brush heads every 3-6 months.</li>
            <li> These are great!</li>

            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I was so upset not being able to find the brush replacement for my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Price Gouging, and (2) E-Series Brush Heads perform better than the A-Series Brush Heads.</li>
            <li> Each brush stroke on the E-Series thus covers and cleans more teeth area.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;The A-Series brush head does a phenomenal job of cleaning your teeth and gum line.</li>
            <li> /&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;The A-Series brush head does a phenomenal job of cleaning your teeth and gum line.</li>
            <li> I never have bleeding gums any more.</li>
            <li> , MANY cavities before using it.</li>
            <li> Better price and easier to order on line than traipsing around stores looking for them.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare Toothbrush and the replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> : they&#x27;re good quailty, they last a good amount of time and they&#x27;re effective.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is the best thing next to a dentist.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the product and delivery time.  </li>
            <li> I cannot even begin to tell you how much I love using the Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I bought my son the Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush for Christmas many years ago and every year since then I have bought him the replacement brushheads</li>
            <li> needed replacement brushes and wasn&#x27;t sure which to get.</li>
            <li> A Series is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare toothbrush system.  </li>
            <li> This was a great buy that shipped fast</li>
            <li> My dentist and I love</li>
            <li> Love Love Love these replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Have replaced the 4100 many times and also replace the heads every three months.</li>
            <li> I bought a genuine Sonicare factory sealed retail package!</li>
            <li> Arrived timely, and more importantly, the description in the online listing was sufficient that we got what we needed/wanted!</li>
            <li> but you must replace the heads alot more often.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare is just better.  </li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Favorite Books:</li>
            <li> The person I talked with could not have been more helpful in seeing that it worked</li>
            <li> I still have my Sonicare toothbrush from years back and still consider it the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> You will never be able to see the difference...</li>
            <li> These are pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I was able to find the replacement heads easily on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the older form of Sonicare electronic toothbrush with a thicker handle, and it was great to surprise her that I found it still available.</li>
            <li> This price is better than Wal*mart&#x27;s, and with the free shipping option, it makes a lot of sense to not use the gas to get them.</li>
            <li> This was the first product of this type and as far as I am concerned, the best.  </li>
            <li> Excellent brush heads that are straight and not slanted as the new ones are.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Intrigued, I tried popping the E-Series brush head into my Sonicare Advance - it&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li> Good price for replacement heads and delivery was fast and accurate.</li>
            <li> It fits the A-Series toothbrush and is easy to replace.</li>
            <li> As a long-time user of both the A-Series and the E-Series brush heads, I strongly recommend the E-Series brush heads instead.uildup</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had my sonicare for 9 years and still going strong.  </li>
            <li> her&#x27;s is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> (the Sonicare Healthy White) requires different heads), I just wanted to put my two cents in for how great I thought they were for the great number of years</li>
            <li> Mine still works fine.  </li>
            <li> Works fine,  </li>
            <li> I have not opened the one from Amazon but see no reason it want be fine.</li>
            <li> My family was extremely happy to have a fresh new toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> I wear braces and the sonicare toothbrush is wonderful for keeping all those little crannies cleaned out...</li>
            <li> Sonicare made a huge difference in the way my teeth and gums feel.</li>
            <li> Product is discontinued -  so I was fortunate to find it.  </li>
            <li> Sure, the refills are pricey, but in what you save at the dentist, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> 6 months before obviously needing to be replaced (bristles start to splay out) and the subscription program is great as I don&#x27;t need to remember to order them</li>
            <li> I was really happy to find these replacement brush heads recently for my Philips Sonicare Advance.  </li>
            <li> I just read that the E replacement will fit on the Advance toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love my sonic care....never, ever had such good visits with my dentist.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean and it has made a huge difference in my dentist appointments.  </li>
            <li> For the cost of buying a pair of halfway decent disposable brushes every month, I get replacement heads for my own Sonicare Advance brush and for my husband&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Since I started using my Sonicare over four years ago my dentist has consistently conmmented about my healthy gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> and they are original equipment.</li>
            <li> Since we&#x27;d purchased the original ( a replacement unit for one that had expired), at Costco, had hoped that Costco would still carry the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> well worth the money!</li>
            <li> have the original unit.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth look and feel.</li>
            <li> However, despite some dentists saying you don&#x27;t have to use brushing movements, my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean if I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> They  could feel that their teeth were getting clean easier.</li>
            <li> Great, knew it would perform as expected.</li>
            <li> And being able to buy replacement heads at Amazon makes the whole business easier.</li>
            <li> But received quickly and AOK so 5 stars.</li>
            <li> These tooth brushes fit in my mouth comfortable and they are very efficient at cleaning my teath.  </li>
            <li> I get them quickly.</li>
            <li> We had a hard time finding the right replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s Sonic toothbrush but we found them at a good price on Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> ok - would recommend highly this business that handles the replacements.  </li>
            <li> Great brushes, because they are big enough to cover more area.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s more than I paid for the whole thing in the first place.  </li>
            <li> Product is exactly as promised!</li>
            <li> These heads are hard to find, so am grateful to be able to get them on Amazon at a good price.</li>
            <li> The E-Series brush heads has several improvements over the A-Series brush heads - the most important of which is the improved cleaning ability of the E-Series.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare Advance for a couple of years now and been satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> It was worth the wait during transit.</li>
            <li> I like that they come with different colors so everyone gets their own.  </li>
            <li> shipment was quick and arrived fast</li>
            <li> The replacement heads are quite expensive, so I try to buy them where I can get the best price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Smaller Brush Head - Better Reach&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Sonicare toothbrushes are among the best you can buy although the replacement heads are rather expensive</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> We purchased the smaller head ones for our toddlers who love using \\&quot;mommy and daddy&#x27;s toothbrush!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping of this product!  </li>
            <li> In fact, the brush heads that I was replacing which were 8 months old had more firmness to them than the brand new brush heads that I ordered here.  </li>
            <li> Since most of my teeth are capped the brush is really for my gums, and it does a great job; hardly any cleaning necessary every six months.</li>
            <li> my old (original \\&quot;standard\\&quot;) sonicare is still vibrating and shaking them plaques off my teeth -</li>
            <li> Combined with Colgate Total toothpaste (which has active anti-gingivitis ingredients) my gums stopped bleeding in two weeks and feel great ever since.  </li>
            <li> e-Series Standard Replacement Brush Heads, 2-Pack]] work just fine on our A-Series toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Sonicare makes a decent toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Wide Angle of Brush Movement - Better Cleaning</li>
            <li> really like my Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> My wife thinks I&#x27;m a bit too much like \\&quot;Monk\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Thanks for listening.</li>
            <li> When brushing your teeth the brush head is gentle on your gums.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery...easy to find on your site and no stress</li>
            <li> Thanks you so much.    </li>
            <li> Thanks Heavens Amazon Sellers still sell these.</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and the cost was reasonable.</li>
            <li> The battery did die and I had to replace the whole thing.  </li>
            <li> These brush heads work very well with my Philips Sonicaire brush.</li>
            <li> I never had any sorts of problems with the heads and felt that they cleaned really well</li>
            <li> The everyday price was a good value and there was no trouble of having to search for the brushes to go on sale.  </li>
            <li> Since this is an ancient Sonicare unit I own, it&#x27;s not easy to find these replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> I came online to buy brush heads for my Sonicare toothbrush because I own an older version and have trouble finding the correct replacements in stores.  </li>
            <li> The improvements that Sonic care has made is evident in the more expensive models, like more compact head, and slimmer design.  </li>
            <li> The only replacement head that lets you clean the moisture that accumulates inside.</li>
            <li> (My teeth don&#x27;t feel clean when the head goes bad; it still looks like new, just doesn&#x27;t clean as good.)</li>
            <li> We live in Alaska, and this was received within a week of placing the order!</li>
            <li> The smaller brush head provides a better reach on the back teeth</li>
            <li> Sonicare makes a great product; my only complaint is that the head comes loose---from the vibrations, I suppose.</li>
            <li> Our recent order of replacement brushes through Amazon went through quickly and without any fuss.  </li>
            <li> Needed to replace our older (A-Series)</li>
            <li> Have been a Philips Sonicare user for over 2 decades now, and believe that the very first one created is the one that was made to last.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brush heads.</li>
            <li> All the new ones get gross quickly.</li>
            <li> Luckily my old standby Amazon had them and the price was much lower than what sonicare said I would find them for, (if I found them at all).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get that old toothpaste out of there no matter how much I soak it.</li>
            <li> The thinner shaft not only makes it easier to reach the back teeth, it is less invasive and much more friendly to your mouth</li>
            <li> So I go online to order new A-Series brushes from Amazon like I always to</li>
            <li> Your Sonicare tooithbrush is new again.  </li>
            <li> Brand new product at a discounted price.  </li>
            <li> Please advise Sonicare that when we received the toothbrushes, we pluged in the Sonicare Unit and it will not start, so we must cancel the every 6 month contract to send new toothbrushes, until we can purchase a new Sonicare Unit.    </li>
            <li> I decided it was time to purchase a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes fit our unit perfectly and my only complaint is after every use you have to take off the plastic screw piece or mold will start growing due to the trapped water underneath.  </li>
            <li> As usual with Amazon we are extremely pleased with both pricing and speed of shipping.</li>
            <li> and I waited many days past the est day of arrival before I contacted someone about not receiving my toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> The same exact replacement sells for $29 at Sears.   </li>
            <li> Its the first one on the left.</li>
            <li> Puchased new heads for a 10 year old sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It is getting difficult to find the replacement tooth brushes for the earlier Sonic Care models, the brushes I purchased through Amazon are great.</li>
            <li> The brushes were so soft</li>
            <li> Please advise how I can contact them direct or if you can let them know for us.    </li>
            <li> I prefer the Compact Brush Heads which have only 5 rows of bristles; Standard has 8 rows of bristles; MY fault; Buyers be more careful than I was.</li>
            <li> Plus the brush action won&#x27;t wear away sensitive teeth at the receding gum line (if you have that problem.)  </li>
            <li> (Proust Complete)]],   </li>
            <li> Make cleaning teeth at least feel more efficient.</li>
            <li> Spent $50 on two of these because our original A series heads last 18 months.</li>
            <li> The standard size head is a bit large to get to the backside of the teeth in smaller mouths on this model.</li>
            <li> It comes in a one or two pack so you can save money and only have to purchase a new brush head once every 6 months.</li>
            <li> Once you use one there is no other.</li>
            <li> I could find them from no other source, on the web or otherwise</li>
            <li> Usually when I buy these they are two different colors in one package - this makes it easy for my husband and I to know which is which.</li>
            <li> I purchased my model 2 years ago and it has been discontinued and/or updated, and replacement brushes are no longer available in stores nor on the Philips Sonicare site (at least when I looked.)  </li>
            <li> Amazon has these priced considerably lower than the local drugstores.</li>
            <li> My old toothbrush will last forever!  </li>
            <li> Product and condition were as expected at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The instructions are clear and it&#x27;s true that an entire cleaning should take no more than a minute or so (in sections).  </li>
            <li> Alas, the latest model they carry is the E-series.</li>
            <li> Worth the few extra bucks.</li>
            <li> recently got a brush head replacement for my Sonicare Elite and noticed that it is stated right on the package of the E-Series brush head replacements - in black and white - that the E-Series brush head replacements are now compatible with Sonicare Advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apparently, Amazon is the only source, can&#x27;t find them elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Getting harder to find the standard head for the older model.  </li>
            <li> Returning it was more of a hassle than it was worth, so I kept the brushes, but still I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Thinner Shaft&lt;br /&gt;The shaft of the E-Series is also much thinner and slightly flexible.</li>
            <li> have the original Sonicare rechargeable tooth brush and these replacement heads a very hard to find.</li>
            <li> This product is not available in stores for my older model that still works well.  </li>
            <li> but they last a long time.</li>
            <li> I believe the reason it lasted so long was replacing the head on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Must be made in American, nothing from China lasts this long.</li>
            <li> Worked fine, but too expensive.</li>
            <li> You can go a LONG time between replacements, but eventually (months and months)</li>
            <li> My teeth have been around for a long time.    </li>
            <li> I always purchase from Amazon if the item is reasonably similar to other websites.</li>
            <li> The head of the brush is a little big, but they come in smaller models, so you may prefer that.  </li>
            <li> so it is less likely to trigger gagging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s $10 less than I can buy them locally, and you can&#x27;t beat the convenience.</li>
            <li> You get 2 replacemant brushes that last for 1 year for less than $30.</li>
            <li> I have been ordering this from Amazon for several years and questioned whether this # would work on my handle - a bit different from past ones I&#x27;d ordered.  </li>
            <li> The much cheaper Crest Spinbrush feels like it does at least as well, but I&#x27;m not the expert, so I listen to my dentist!</li>
            <li> My dentist says this is the single reason for my improved dental health!</li>
            <li> However, it has some problems such as a relatively big and clumsy brush head and shaft.</li>

            <li> The replacement heads came as quickly as I expected.</li>
            <li> Sonicare has stopped making these about 6 years ago, so they are getting harder to get</li>
            <li> These brushes will last a long time even tho they should be replaced at least every 6 months.  </li>
            <li> It was not worth the trouble to try to glue the magnet back in place; it was disgarded.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy two regular sized toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li> I conducted Amazon, but received no response, other than to give me authorization to return the product.</li>
            <li> Sonicare did tell me the name of the other model that replaced this</li>
            <li> There are other options for sonic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> After years of bad reports about his poor brushing habits, he now gets good reports.      </li>
            <li> The product is half of what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like the idea of 6 months with the same brush, but they are too expensive to switch out frequently.</li>
            <li> improved design of the E-Series helps to reduce the problem of backflow from brush head running down the shaft and seeping into the recessed part of the brush handle that connects to the brush</li>

            <li> Hey - no - that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;ve got a big mouth - stop that!</li>
            <li> My hygenist gets frustrated when she cleans my teeth because they are already so clean.  </li>
            <li> Improved Design - Less Gunk Buildup&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> And typically, I brush for 4 mins, so I go two rounds.    </li>
            <li> Since using the Sonicare brush, I have significantly less plaque build up (ie--less scraping and pain)</li>
            <li> The dentist reports that I have less plaque on my teeth since using the Sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have previously used electric toothbrushes, with what I thought were satisfactory results.  </li>
            <li> And buying replacement heads from Amazon keeps the price down a little, plus convenience.  </li>
            <li> I have to hold the nub to keep it tight.</li>
            <li> It feels a bit expensive but last a long time.</li>
            <li> E-Series brush head has a few improvements over the A-Series brush head:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for over 10 years and buying the brush heads at retail outlets and have never bought a pair of brush heads of such poor quality.  </li>
            <li> I should have returned it but didn&#x27;t want to take the trouble.    </li>
            <li> and if it does not fit, I can return it.</li>
            <li> One of the few places you can get these anymore</li>
            <li> In the past year and a half, Sonicare has ended my problems with plaque buildup.  </li>
            <li> Based on previous experiences, I would have thought Amazon would have permitted me to exchange them, or at least offer me a credit for the difference in price.</li>
            <li> Yes I knew I would find it no better place than amazon.  </li>
            <li> However, one of the brushes failed after a short time.  </li>
            <li> They are usually sold out.  </li>
            <li> I was fooled a few times because I have an A Series - but no more!  </li>
            <li> Just hard to find the replacement brush sets</li>
            <li> PLEASE BUY THIS PRODUCT AND SAVE HUNDREDS OF YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY.</li>
            <li> I say at least I&#x27;m not harvesting and re-planting crud.</li>
            <li> The 1st lasted at least 5-6 years.</li>
            <li> Prices have jumped dramatically in the past year, so when I saw the offer on Amazon, I returned the one I had purchased for $21 and bought two for $25!</li>
            <li> As long as we&#x27;re at it, I was disappointed in my previous (a while ago now) purchase of the toothbrush through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Are they serious?  </li>
            <li> Either I just got a bad pair (yes, both were the same), or someone is scamming people.  </li>
            <li> The new brush that they introduced is terrible (E Series).</li>
            <li> I hate the other ones that are not made for men.</li>
            <li> I found them to be almost useless.  </li>
            <li> Also, the heads are somewhat expensive and you are \\&quot;supposed\\&quot; to change them out every six months.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m wrong</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I don&#x27;t remember,however Amazon also carries that one.</li>
            <li> I am shocked at the price of this at Amazon...</li>
            <li> but I am disappointed.    </li>
            <li> : [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> but it gets all yukie around the greenish part of the toothbruse at the base.</li>
            <li> The magnet at the base of the brush separated from the unit.  </li>

            <li> Great Product and Great Prices, Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> A-Series Phillips Sonicare Advance replacement brush head is just what I was looking for.  It is like the one that came on my original toothbrush and works great.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush.  The replacement heads are quite expensive, so I try to buy them where I can get the best price.</li>
            <li> I was so upset not being able to find the brush replacement for my toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve been looking for over 6 months and it&#x27;s been discontinued here on Kauai.  Yes I knew I would find it no better place than amazon.  Again Mahalo(thankyou)  :)</li>
            <li> The product is half of what I expected.  I usually buy two regular sized toothbrush heads.  My order contained only one regular sized head and one smaller one.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t you heard? The [[ASIN:B00008BFXL Philips Sonicare E-Series Brush Heads]] are now compatible with Sonicare Advance -- so don&#x27;t bother getting the A-Series Brush Heads (on this product page); get the E-Series Brush Heads instead. Why? (1) Two Words: Price Gouging, and (2) E-Series Brush Heads perform better than the A-Series Brush Heads. Read on for details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Sonicare Advance Toothbrush and the A-Series brush head replacement for over 10 years before I switched over to the Sonicare Elite, which uses the E-Series brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently got a brush head replacement for my Sonicare Elite and noticed that it is stated right on the package of the E-Series brush head replacements - in black and white - that the E-Series brush head replacements are now compatible with Sonicare Advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intrigued, I tried popping the E-Series brush head into my Sonicare Advance - it&#x27;s true! The E-Series brush head was a perfect fit for the Sonicare Advance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SWEET!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E-Series vs. A-Series&lt;br /&gt;---------------------&lt;br /&gt;Right about now, you&#x27;re probably thinking - yeah, yeah, so what&#x27;s the big deal?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The E-Series brush head has a few improvements over the A-Series brush head:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Smaller Brush Head - Better Reach&lt;br /&gt;The E-Series has the same amount of bristles but the size of the brush head has been reduced. The smaller brush head provides a better reach on the back teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Thinner Shaft&lt;br /&gt;The shaft of the E-Series is also much thinner and slightly flexible. The thinner shaft not only makes it easier to reach the back teeth, it is less invasive and much more friendly to your mouth so it is less likely to trigger gagging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Wide Angle of Brush Movement - Better Cleaning&lt;br /&gt;The angle of sweep of the brush strokes is wider on the E-Series than it is on the A-Series. Each brush stroke on the E-Series thus covers and cleans more teeth area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Improved Design - Less Gunk Buildup&lt;br /&gt;The improved design of the E-Series helps to reduce the problem of backflow from brush head running down the shaft and seeping into the recessed part of the brush handle that connects to the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;The A-Series brush head does a phenomenal job of cleaning your teeth and gum line. However, it has some problems such as a relatively big and clumsy brush head and shaft. The E-Series brush heads has several improvements over the A-Series brush heads - the most important of which is the improved cleaning ability of the E-Series. Now that the E-Series brush heads are compatible with the Sonicare Advance, I see no reason why anyone should continue using the A-Series brush heads! As a long-time user of both the A-Series and the E-Series brush heads, I strongly recommend the E-Series brush heads instead.uildup&lt;br /&gt;The improved design of the E-Series helps to reduce the problem of backflow from brush head running down the shaft and seeping into the recessed part of the brush handle that connects to the brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;The A-Series brush head does a phenomenal job of cleaning your teeth and gum line.

            <li> I came online to buy brush heads for my Sonicare toothbrush because I own an older version and have trouble finding the correct replacements in stores.  I found them to be almost useless.  The brushes were so soft I doubt they would last two weeks.  In fact, the brush heads that I was replacing which were 8 months old had more firmness to them than the brand new brush heads that I ordered here.  Either I just got a bad pair (yes, both were the same), or someone is scamming people.  These brush heads appeared to be the used ones that people throw out after using them for the recommended six months.  If I knew how to request a refund, I would do it.  These people should be ashamed of themselves.  I have been using Sonicare for over 10 years and buying the brush heads at retail outlets and have never bought a pair of brush heads of such poor quality.  Beware of these brush heads!  Anyone else have a similar experience with these brush heads?</li>
            <li> I have been brushing with a sonicare for 18 months. My dentist recommended it to me, especially because I was getting braces. I can&#x27;t believe how clean my teeth look and feel. I never have bleeding gums any more. My orthodontist and dentist have both commented on the suprub shape of my gums. I couldn&#x27;t be more happy! Defenitely worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> .&lt;br /&gt;I really like my Sonicare toothbrush.  Just hard to find the replacement brush sets</li>
            <li> Since I started using my Sonicare over four years ago my dentist has consistently conmmented about my healthy gums and teeth. It&#x27;s been an easy way to maintain good oral care.</li>
            <li> No problem - this is just replacement heads for unit I already have</li>
            <li> This is the entry level standard replacement brush head for the sonic care line of toothbrushes.  Medium firmness.  Works great.  Lasts about 6 months which is what sonic care says it should.      The improvements that Sonic care has made is evident in the more expensive models, like more compact head, and slimmer design.  But this works just as well.</li>
            <li> I received this product on time. I am very happy with the service on all my orders. Every thing so far has been in excellent condition when it arived. I will order these replacement tooth brushes again. Excellent web site.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 20 years.  Every 7 or 8 years I replace it with the same product.  Cavities zero since using it, MANY cavities before using it. [[ASIN:B000EHNDD0 Philips Sonicare Elite e9500 Custom Care Power Toothbrush]]  I use the Sonicare Advance (A Series)and have never been tempted to try the newer products.</li>
            <li> SIZE &amp; UTILITY: The standard size head is a bit large to get to the backside of the teeth in smaller mouths on this model. But the Sonicare toothbrush, even the basic one like this, does seem to get teeth cleaner.      MOTION &amp; TIMING: However, despite some dentists saying you don&#x27;t have to use brushing movements, my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean if I don&#x27;t. And typically, I brush for 4 mins, so I go two rounds.    I also don&#x27;t like the idea of 6 months with the same brush, but they are too expensive to switch out frequently. So I soak them in boiling water quite often, cleaning out the cap too.  My wife thinks I&#x27;m a bit too much like \\&quot;Monk\\&quot;. I say at least I&#x27;m not harvesting and re-planting crud.</li>
            <li> My wife uses these heads on her sonicare toothbrush and she loves them. Definitely take advantage of Amazons subscribe and save program and receive an additional discount!</li>
            <li> Sonicare makes a great product; my only complaint is that the head comes loose---from the vibrations, I suppose. I have to hold the nub to keep it tight. Also, the heads are somewhat expensive and you are \\&quot;supposed\\&quot; to change them out every six months. I doubt I would use this if my dentist hadn&#x27;t recommended it. The much cheaper Crest Spinbrush feels like it does at least as well, but I&#x27;m not the expert, so I listen to my dentist!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product thinking it was the compact head, because that was the picture item. But when I received the product I found it was the standard size head. I also discovered the product was priced $8 lower after I received the product.    I conducted Amazon, but received no response, other than to give me authorization to return the product. I was not offered an opportunity to exchange the product, nor even receive a refund for the difference in price.    Returning it was more of a hassle than it was worth, so I kept the brushes, but still I was disappointed. Based on previous experiences, I would have thought Amazon would have permitted me to exchange them, or at least offer me a credit for the difference in price.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell from the pics if this was the smaller, travel, compact version.  I didn&#x27;t want that.  It&#x27;s the full size, and I am very happy...my teeth and gums are too!</li>
            <li> Sonicare makes one of the best ways to care for your teeth. My dental checkups have greatly improved over time by consistant use of this device.</li>
            <li> I looked all over northern Nevada and could not find the replacement heads for my Philips Sonicare Advance (A-Series) toothbrush. I was able to find the replacement heads easily on Amazon. o&lt;{8^D}</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare (A Series) has been discontinued in the stores and difficult to find the replacement heads I love.  Found them through Amazon and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Product is exactly as promised!</li>
            <li> Getting harder to find the standard head for the older model.  Mine still works fine.  Better price and easier to order on line than traipsing around stores looking for them.</li>
            <li> Since this is an ancient Sonicare unit I own, it&#x27;s not easy to find these replacement heads.  I received them promptly and as ordered.</li>
            <li> I like my Sonicare and replace the brushes every 6 months.  So I go online to order new A-Series brushes from Amazon like I always to and I see Amazon doesn&#x27;t carry them, but an Amazon seller does ... for $70.  Are they serious?  That&#x27;s more than I paid for the whole thing in the first place.  How does the seller sleep at night?  Does he feel any guilt?</li>
            <li> Sonicare toothbrushes are among the best you can buy although the replacement heads are rather expensive but they last a long time.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is excellent, and it is recommended to replace the brush heads every 3-6 months.</li>
            <li> If you want to trade price for expedient delivery, get this replacement product elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Received them in good time.  I love my Sonicare Toothbrush and the replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li> I have these replacement heads on Amazon&#x27;s subscription plan for delivery every 3 months. For the cost of buying a pair of halfway decent disposable brushes every month, I get replacement heads for my own Sonicare Advance brush and for my husband&#x27;s. It&#x27;s $10 less than I can buy them locally, and you can&#x27;t beat the convenience.</li>
            <li> These replacement brushes do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to: they&#x27;re good quailty, they last a good amount of time and they&#x27;re effective. &lt;br /&gt;Some people recommend the compact brushes for reaching all the way to the back of the mouth, but frankly I have no problem with this one.  Hey - no - that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;ve got a big mouth - stop that! &lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, brushing teeth doesn&#x27;t get easier than this. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Happy shopping &lt;br /&gt;JB</li>
            <li> Usually when I buy these they are two different colors in one package - this makes it easy for my husband and I to know which is which. But this came both the same colors. I feel cheated! Had I known, I would not have bought them and feel the ocmpany took advantage of knowing I would not see them. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong but I am disappointed.    As long as we&#x27;re at it, I was disappointed in my previous (a while ago now) purchase of the toothbrush through Amazon. It does not beep every 20 secs. like it&#x27;s supposed to. I should have returned it but didn&#x27;t want to take the trouble.    Thanks for listening.</li>
            <li> These are great! My teeth never felt cleaner and I wouldn&#x27;t go back to a regular brush.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say, they&#x27;re replacement heads for my toothbrush. I ordered, they came, I replaced....happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare Advance for a couple of years now and been satisfied so far. If brushed as instructed you will see the difference.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare unit has proven to be so valuable in our dental care I want to have extra heads on hand for ease of replacement when the time comes to do that. This price is better than Wal*mart&#x27;s, and with the free shipping option, it makes a lot of sense to not use the gas to get them.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is the best thing next to a dentist. These heads are hard to find, so am grateful to be able to get them on Amazon at a good price.</li>
            <li> Sonicare made a huge difference in the way my teeth and gums feel. Combined with Colgate Total toothpaste (which has active anti-gingivitis ingredients) my gums stopped bleeding in two weeks and feel great ever since.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Puchased new heads for a 10 year old sonicare toothbrush.  Good price for replacement heads and delivery was fast and accurate.</li>
            <li> Sonicare Brush Heads are an excellent product. My dentist recommened the Sonicare Electric Toothbrush to help with brushing my gums. When brushing your teeth the brush head is gentle on your gums. I highly recommend these brush heads.</li>
            <li> It is getting difficult to find the replacement tooth brushes for the earlier Sonic Care models, the brushes I purchased through Amazon are great.</li>
            <li> We had a hard time finding the right replacement heads for my husband&#x27;s Sonic toothbrush but we found them at a good price on Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Product is discontinued -  so I was fortunate to find it.  Works fine,  shipment was quick and arrived fast</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the product and delivery time.  As a matter of fact the product delivered two day before its predicted delivery date.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have found our Sonicare toothbrushes to be great and our dentists have told us our teeth and gums are in very good shape.  Our recent order of replacement brushes through Amazon went through quickly and without any fuss.  The everyday price was a good value and there was no trouble of having to search for the brushes to go on sale.  As usual with Amazon we are extremely pleased with both pricing and speed of shipping.</li>
            <li> I cannot even begin to tell you how much I love using the Sonicare toothbrush.  I will never go back to regular toothbrushes.  My teeth feel so clean and it has made a huge difference in my dentist appointments.  Since using the Sonicare brush, I have significantly less plaque build up (ie--less scraping and pain) when I get my cleanings done.  My hygienist was amazed at the difference.  I have also had no cavities since using the Sonicare for about 4 years. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I love this toothbrush.  Sure, the refills are pricey, but in what you save at the dentist, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The heads oin a sonicare tooth brush may seem alright but it is best to replace every 6 months.   You notice the difference immediately when you replace the head.  Your Sonicare tooithbrush is new again.  I had my last sonicare toothbrush for 10 years.  I believe the reason it lasted so long was replacing the head on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I bought my son the Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush for Christmas many years ago and every year since then I have bought him the replacement brushheads so they can be changed every six months as recommended.  It&#x27;s a great way to keep him on schedule!</li>
            <li> Good replacement head for a good brushing system, at a good price. It feels a bit expensive but last a long time.</li>
            <li> Very Good product. I thought about the price of the replacement heads as being expensive at one time, but had to think about the value more. I need my teeth!! Anyway, think about it.You get 2 replacemant brushes that last for 1 year for less than $30. (change every 6 months) I am on my 2nd toothbrush. The 1st lasted at least 5-6 years. Good investment!!</li>
            <li> The items are always in stock, and I receive them in a timely manner..  Apparently, Amazon is the only source, can&#x27;t find them elsewhere.</li>
            <li> My husband an I both have Sonicare toothbrushes .  They are wonderful.  Once you use one there is no other.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the replacement brushes.  I have used them before and this is strictly a replacement of the existing brushes on my Electric Sonicare Toothbrush. &lt;br /&gt;It is a very good product and always happy.</li>
            <li> These heads are great but every one that know sonic care knows this.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this equipment for several years. Excellent results! Must use for maximum prevention from gum related problems.</li>
            <li> Great merchandise and great value</li>
            <li> happy w/ my replacement head purchases. 2 packs for $30 w/ free shipping was a great deal imo.</li>
            <li> This product is not available in stores for my older model that still works well.  Thank you Amazon for carrying them and helping me save money by not having to invest in a newer model.</li>
            <li> needed replacement brushes and wasn&#x27;t sure which to get. called Sonicare and they recommended these brushheads but told me that I may have difficulty finding them as they have been replaced with another model.Luckily my old standby Amazon had them and the price was much lower than what sonicare said I would find them for, (if I found them at all). Sonicare did tell me the name of the other model that replaced this but unfortunately I don&#x27;t remember,however Amazon also carries that one.Just loooooove my Amazon.  PS brushes work great,great for your gums and plaque?  what is that? I haven&#x27;t had any in years!!!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes need replacement every six months, so I am always looking for a means of keeping the cost as low as possible.  Amazon has provided me this time and time again.  Brand new product at a discounted price.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize you have to replace these heads as often as 6 months (recommended). I always purchase from Amazon if the item is reasonably similar to other websites. So I bought 4 at a discount, with no shipping and no sales tax. Now those are used up, and my old (original \\&quot;standard\\&quot;) sonicare is still vibrating and shaking them plaques off my teeth - I&#x27;m stoked! Must be made in American, nothing from China lasts this long. And it hasn&#x27;t become obsolete either - the original is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> This is a good price for these replacement brush heads.  Sonicare makes a decent toothbrush!  -kd5-</li>
            <li> Amazon has these priced considerably lower than the local drugstores. It was worth the wait during transit.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery...easy to find on your site and no stress I did not have to go to several stores.  Love the auto ship!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s toothbrush heads, they get the job done. I bought it here because the price beats any I&#x27;ve seen in local stores.</li>
            <li> I could no longer purchase the item from Costco. I found it at the Amazon web-site. I was very pleased to have the correct toothbrush head for my sonicare toothbrush. The replacement heads came as quickly as I expected. My family was extremely happy to have a fresh new toothbrush head. They  could feel that their teeth were getting clean easier. Their breath was fresher and their smiles were brighter.</li>
            <li> PLEASE BUY THIS PRODUCT AND SAVE HUNDREDS OF YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY. BU USING THIS PRODUCT YOU SELDOM SEE YOUR DENTIST.</li>
            <li> Years ago my dentist recommended we get a Sonicare and we did and I was immediately impressed with the difference.  These replacement brushes fit our unit perfectly and my only complaint is after every use you have to take off the plastic screw piece or mold will start growing due to the trapped water underneath.  The brushes last approx. 6 months before obviously needing to be replaced (bristles start to splay out) and the subscription program is great as I don&#x27;t need to remember to order them they just arrive at my door!  We purchased the smaller head ones for our toddlers who love using \\&quot;mommy and daddy&#x27;s toothbrush!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was really happy to find these replacement brush heads recently for my Philips Sonicare Advance.  I purchased my model 2 years ago and it has been discontinued and/or updated, and replacement brushes are no longer available in stores nor on the Philips Sonicare site (at least when I looked.)  They were priced reasonably and arrived within a few days.</li>
            <li> Happy to find these replacement heads.  My old toothbrush will last forever!  Product and condition were as expected at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The new brush that they introduced is terrible (E Series). This \\&quot;old\\&quot; style (A Series) should not have been replaced, and that is why I purchased this item.&lt;br /&gt;The A Series is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare toothbrush system.  The 2 pack replacement heads here at Amazon are the lowest price I have found.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Sonic toothbrush system.  The dentist reports that I have less plaque on my teeth since using the Sonic toothbrush.  I have been using it for about 5 years now, and I hope it doesn&#x27;t get discontinued.</li>
            <li> Please advise Sonicare that when we received the toothbrushes, we pluged in the Sonicare Unit and it will not start, so we must cancel the every 6 month contract to send new toothbrushes, until we can purchase a new Sonicare Unit.    Please advise how I can contact them direct or if you can let them know for us.    Thanks you so much.    Donna Wright</li>
            <li> This was a great buy that shipped fast and I got two brushes for about what WalMart charged for one.</li>
            <li> The package is resistant, the product with the same quality than the ones you buy at any store for 30% more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best price you can find for this product.</li>
            <li> I am a newcomer to this service and I waited many days past the est day of arrival before I contacted someone about not receiving my toothbrushes.  I got an immediate and very courteous response.  In 2 days I had my toothbrushes!!  I am as pleased with the service as I am with the merchandise!</li>
            <li> My dentist and I love the Sonicare toothbrush and Amazon has the best prices for replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my sonicare for 9 years and still going strong.  Everytime I change heads as recommended I feel like I&#x27;ve been for a cleaning.  I haven&#x27;t had one problem with my teeth since.  And yes I do get chedkups.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say about Sonicare replacement brushes.  They last a year and keep away the plack.</li>
            <li> Great, knew it would perform as expected.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love these replacement heads. Have been a Philips Sonicare user for over 2 decades now, and believe that the very first one created is the one that was made to last. Have replaced the 4100 many times and also replace the heads every three months. It also has a nice plastic cap to put over the head when not in use to prevent germs from getting on it. Thanks Heavens Amazon Sellers still sell these.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00008BQVM Philips Sonicare Advance (A-Series) Replacement Brush Head, Standard (2-Pack)]]  Great product. Fast service.</li>
            <li> This was the first product of this type and as far as I am concerned, the best.  Has kept my teeth and gums in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I am shocked at the price of this at Amazon...Over $60. The same exact replacement sells for $29 at Sears.   Just google \\&quot;sonicare replacement toothbrush\\&quot; and you will see a picture of the replacement for Advance. Its the first one on the left. I just read that the E replacement will fit on the Advance toothbrush. With that said, I may try the E which is sold at Walmart and if it does not fit, I can return it. I do like the Advance brush but it gets all yukie around the greenish part of the toothbruse at the base. I can&#x27;t seem to get that old toothpaste out of there no matter how much I soak it. Good luck people</li>
            <li> My wife loves the older form of Sonicare electronic toothbrush with a thicker handle, and it was great to surprise her that I found it still available.</li>
            <li> The only replacement head that lets you clean the moisture that accumulates inside. All the new ones get gross quickly.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Compact Brush Heads which have only 5 rows of bristles; Standard has 8 rows of bristles; MY fault; Buyers be more careful than I was. But received quickly and AOK so 5 stars.</li>
            <li> One of the few places you can get these anymore and they are original equipment.</li>
            <li> My dentist says this is the single reason for my improved dental health!</li>
            <li> Great brushes, because they are big enough to cover more area.  I hate the other ones that are not made for men.</li>
            <li> Spent $50 on two of these because our original A series heads last 18 months. (My teeth don&#x27;t feel clean when the head goes bad; it still looks like new, just doesn&#x27;t clean as good.) Since most of my teeth are capped the brush is really for my gums, and it does a great job; hardly any cleaning necessary every six months.</li>
            <li> I bought a genuine Sonicare factory sealed retail package! Sonicare has stopped making these about 6 years ago, so they are getting harder to get and expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only buy unopened packaged brushes since others may be used or counterfeit.</li>
            <li> I was fooled a few times because I have an A Series - but no more!  70 bucks?  are you kidding me?&lt;br /&gt;These: [[ASIN:B00008BFXL Philips Sonicare HX7002/62 e-Series Standard Replacement Brush Heads, 2-Pack]] work just fine on our A-Series toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Needed to replace our older (A-Series) Advance Sonicare toothbrush heads. Since we&#x27;d purchased the original ( a replacement unit for one that had expired), at Costco, had hoped that Costco would still carry the replacement heads. Alas, the latest model they carry is the E-series. Found the heads we needed here at Amazon - not necessarily the lowest price, but I knew we&#x27;d get what we needed from a reliable source. Worth the few extra bucks. Arrived timely, and more importantly, the description in the online listing was sufficient that we got what we needed/wanted!</li>
            <li> I have used these for years.  I have not opened the one from Amazon but see no reason it want be fine.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good.  I like that they come with different colors so everyone gets their own.  The head of the brush is a little big, but they come in smaller models, so you may prefer that.  The part inside the sleeve gets \\&quot;gunky\\&quot; after a while, but you can throw it into the dishwasher (silverware tray) if that happens.  You can go a LONG time between replacements, but eventually (months and months) one of the magnets in the bottom will get unglued.</li>
            <li> I wear braces and the sonicare toothbrush is wonderful for keeping all those little crannies cleaned out...but you must replace the heads alot more often.  Can&#x27;t beat the price for the replacement heads on Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> I love my sonic care....never, ever had such good visits with my dentist.  These brushes will last a long time even tho they should be replaced at least every 6 months.  well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping of this product!  We live in Alaska, and this was received within a week of placing the order!</li>
            <li> I got two for the price of one at our neighborhood pharmacy.  Prices have jumped dramatically in the past year, so when I saw the offer on Amazon, I returned the one I had purchased for $21 and bought two for $25!</li>
            <li> Sonicare toothbrushes are great.  And buying replacement heads from Amazon keeps the price down a little, plus convenience.  My hygenist gets frustrated when she cleans my teeth because they are already so clean.  And she comments on the health of my gums.  Plus the brush action won&#x27;t wear away sensitive teeth at the receding gum line (if you have that problem.)  My teeth have been around for a long time.    I bought a sonicare for my son.  After years of bad reports about his poor brushing habits, he now gets good reports.      I wouldn&#x27;t want to go back to a regular toothbrush.  And being able to buy replacement heads at Amazon makes the whole business easier.</li>
            <li> These tooth brushes fit in my mouth comfortable and they are very efficient at cleaning my teath.  This is the brush that fits in my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Worked fine, but too expensive. There are other options for sonic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Just what I was expecting.  Arrived on time and the cost was reasonable.</li>
            <li> Dentist recommend. Been using for the last 10 years.I have replaced the brushes when needed and&lt;br /&gt;still have the original unit.</li>
            <li> In the past year and a half, Sonicare has ended my problems with plaque buildup.  This product delivers performance as advertized.  My dentist has also noticed the difference.  I have previously used electric toothbrushes, with what I thought were satisfactory results.  Sonicare is just better.  The instructions are clear and it&#x27;s true that an entire cleaning should take no more than a minute or so (in sections).  There&#x27;s no need to overdo it.</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare.  The battery did die and I had to replace the whole thing.  I&#x27;d like a way to replace just the battery.  However, I like the unit enough to replace it and then buy the replacement heads.  I bought my daughters at the same time as mine and her&#x27;s is still going strong.  I think it is because I travel a lot and it is often out of the charger for a week or two at a time.  Her&#x27;s is in the charger every day.  If you travel, plan on a shorter battery life.  If at home, keep it in the charger.</li>
            <li> Item performs as indicated by manufacturer.  However, one of the brushes failed after a short time.  The magnet at the base of the brush separated from the unit.  It was not worth the trouble to try to glue the magnet back in place; it was disgarded.  If this problem returns, we will not purchase any part of the product again.</li>
            <li> I always seem to have problems finding this product in stores.  They are usually sold out.  Ordering through Amazon.com I get them quickly.</li>
            <li> Amazon had the best price for this item which was why I purchased it here!!! I used a discount code and because I signed up for automatic shipments the shipping charge was eliminated. I need these brushheads anyway so why not go the automatic route!!! My next shipment is not for a year so if I decide to replace the unit in the interim  I can always cancel my standing order.</li>
            <li> The Philips Conicare Advanced Replacement Brush Head is a great product. It fits the A-Series toothbrush and is easy to replace. It comes in a one or two pack so you can save money and only have to purchase a new brush head once every 6 months.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied.  I&#x27;ve used the Phillips Brush Heads for a good many years</li>
            <li> I know there are newer, more expensive Sonicare models, but mine has worked for me for years. My dentist is happy, I&#x27;m happy.

            <li> [[ASIN:B00008BQVM Philips Sonicare Advance (A-Series) Replacement Brush Head, Standard (2-Pack)]]    You have to try the Sonicare Tooth Brush.  It is the best thing on the market.  After brushing, it feels like you have just had your teeth cleaned.  It is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have been ordering this from Amazon for several years and questioned whether this # would work on my handle - a bit different from past ones I&#x27;d ordered.  The person I talked with could not have been more helpful in seeing that it worked ok - would recommend highly this business that handles the replacements.  EXCELLENT - Debbie</li>
            <li> These brush heads work very well with my Philips Sonicaire brush. I could find them from no other source, on the web or otherwise</li>
            <li> I was using these brushheads until this December when I upgraded my Sonicare toothbrush! I never had any sorts of problems with the heads and felt that they cleaned really well and I also had many good check ups!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a number of years, (somewhere around 10) I decided it was time to purchase a new toothbrush. Even though I don&#x27;t use these heads anymore (the Sonicare Healthy White) requires different heads), I just wanted to put my two cents in for how great I thought they were for the great number of years I used them...</li>
            <li> I was so psyched to find these replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;I have the original Sonicare rechargeable tooth brush and these replacement heads a very hard to find.</li>
            <li> Excellent brush heads that are straight and not slanted as the new ones are.  I still have my Sonicare toothbrush from years back and still consider it the best I have ever used.  I hope this seller will continue to distribute this product.</li>
            <li> Came the next day. Make cleaning teeth at least feel more efficient. You will never be able to see the difference...but your dentist will.</li>
            <li> I received the item, but have not used them yet.  They seem correct</li>
