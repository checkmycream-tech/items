            <li>Works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many..</li>
            <li>I love Batiste.  </li>
            <li>Simply the best, better than all the rest ♫</li>
            <li>Best and most affordable dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried, and</li>
            <li>Best dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, oily at the roots, and this stuff has been a life-saver.</li>
            <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t leave hair white</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves my hair looking clean and definitely adds body!</li>
            <li>This shampoo can keep your hair clean for another two days or so.  </li>
            <li>Especially if you&#x27;re a guy since most of the others tend to have overwhelming perfume.</li>
            <li>I like the fresh scent, too.</li>
            <li>Tropical, Cherry, and Sweetie are my favorite scents; they&#x27;re more clean/less perfumey than a few of the others.</li>
            <li>Worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>This works as well as any I&#x27;ve tried, even at higher prices.</li>
            <li>I love the original Batiste Dry Shampoo more than any of their other types!</li>
            <li>They all worked okay, but this is the first dry shampoo I heartily recommend!  </li>
            <li>:) I no longer have to wash my hair every single day.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite dry shampoo, and I&#x27;ve literally tried dozens of them!</li>
            <li>Love this dry shampoo!!</li>
            <li>No more grease, looks like I just washed my hair and blow dried it in 5 seconds :D</li>
            <li>However this stuff helps me very two days out of a wash, trick is to put it in before you go to bed and put your hair up on a high ponytail.</li>
            <li>The only one that comes close are Redken and Big Sexy Hair which are around $20; more than I want to spend since I use this stuff every other day instead of shampooing.</li>
            <li>(High end and lower end - under $7.)</li>
            <li>It just plain works better.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair which gets oily by the end of the first wash day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten the original scent a few times, the tropical scent which is nasty and my new favorite is the &#x27;fresh&#x27; scent.</li>

            <li> I just recently learned about dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I use it several times a week  on dry hair, and it keeps me from having to shampoo too often.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t leave white flakes in my dark auburn hair</li>
            <li> My fave dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used --</li>
            <li> I have dark hair, I massage this product into my hair before bed to keep it from showing the next morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve trried lots of dry shampoos in my dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li> There is some white residue sometimes, but you can usually brush it out.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few other brands (Tressame&#x27;, Suave, etc.)</li>
            <li> The trick is spraying the product onto your roots and letting it sit for a few minutes before working it in (like you might when shampooing your hair in the shower) and then brushing out.</li>
            <li> I still have to wear my hair up the next day but this stuff doesn&#x27;t leave weird white residue and doesn&#x27;t feel gritty or dirty.</li>
            <li> I have very dark hair and no powdery spots after application and working it through to get the oily parts of my scalp!</li>
            <li> I like that it is not overwhelming in fragrance, too.</li>
            <li> seriously, it soaks up all the grease and makes my hair smell</li>

            <li> Works surprisingly well. Like the feel of my hair after using the product.</li>
            <li> Worked pretty well. I have very dark hair and no powdery spots after application and working it through to get the oily parts of my scalp! I like that it is not overwhelming in fragrance, too. I don&#x27;t like any perfumes to clash with my lotions!</li>
            <li> How did I not know about this before!? I love this!!! I just recently learned about dry shampoo and I decided to give it a try, I just wish I had known about this earlier. I put this stuff on my greasy hair and ta-da! No more grease, looks like I just washed my hair and blow dried it in 5 seconds :D</li>
            <li> It works well but I don&#x27;t like the powder residue it leaves.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve trried lots of dry shampoos in my dark brown hair.  They all worked okay, but this is the first dry shampoo I heartily recommend!  It leaves your hair shiny and bouncy.  There is some white residue sometimes, but you can usually brush it out.  This shampoo can keep your hair clean for another two days or so.  I love it!</li>

This is one of the only dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t leave white flakes in my dark auburn hair (I don&#x27;t care for the brunette version since it can stain hands and hairlines, especially if you sweat.) The trick is spraying the product onto your roots and letting it sit for a few minutes before working it in (like you might when shampooing your hair in the shower) and then brushing out. Tropical, Cherry, and Sweetie are my favorite scents; they&#x27;re more clean/less perfumey than a few of the others.</li>

            <li> My fave dry shampoo. Works great and doesn&#x27;t leave hair white</li>
            <li> I love Batiste.  I have tried a few other brands (Tressame&#x27;, Suave, etc.) that were cheaper but always end up coming back to this one.  It just plain works better.  I like the fresh scent, too.</li>
