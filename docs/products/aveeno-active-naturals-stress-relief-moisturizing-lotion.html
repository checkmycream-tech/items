            <li>I love this product and how it smells.  </li>
            <li>I made sure to smell it when I was in the store to make sure I enjoyed the smell.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the way this stress relief smells...</li>
            <li>I love it and recemmend it</li>
            <li>ok i dont think it relieves stress</li>
            <li>Love the aroma and feel of Aveeno Stress Relief.  </li>
            <li>THIS SELLER WAS VERY FAST AND RESPONSIBLE WITH THE SHIPPING... AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT AND SERVICE.</li>
            <li>This gentle lotion with its pleasant aroma serves many purposes.  </li>
            <li>I try to use most Aveeno products and I think it&#x27;s great for my babies sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am an avid user or lotions and found this product pretty good, though it is not my favorite kind.</li>
            <li>The product  itself is great but a larger bottle with a cheaper price would be better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong, but if you prefer hypoallergenic lotions, this may not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>And, while nurturing your skin, you can enjoy the scent of lavender, chamomile and ylang-ylang, all embraced in aromatherapy for their calming, stress reducing, properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its smooth and doesnt have that oily feeling.  </li>
            <li>just different scent lol.</li>
            <li>was already enjoying Aveeno&#x27;s Stress Relief formula for overall body moisturizing, becoming increasingly impressed that it actually DID moisturize for 24 hours, as advertised.</li>
            <li>I have serious skin issues (eczema and allergies) and have been through many products and this one seems to work best for me.  </li>
            <li>The smell is so good, not so strong and comfort enough.</li>
            <li>Instead, I got a strong floral scented lotion with a texture that&#x27;s almost as good as Aveeno&#x27;s Daily Moisturing Lotion, but not quite.</li>
            <li>The Colloidal Oatmeal in the Aveeno Products is the reason I keep buying them, even if I&#x27;m not overly excited about smoothing petrolatum over my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this brand for a long time and it smells great without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>At first I enjoyed the products consistency</li>
            <li>not to oily and just right!</li>
            <li>this smells good and is good for serious relaxation therapy but if you use too much it can be overwhelming</li>
            <li>Your skin becomes calm, soothed and smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>It is good for smoothing skin; acting as a stress buster and softening your skin.  </li>
            <li>The scent is lovely and the lotion moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to excema breakouts and this lotions works great on my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t flare up my excema.</li>
            <li>BUT THIS IS SERIOUSLY THE BEST STUFF</li>
            <li>I have mild acne and it doesn&#x27;t cause additional breakouts.</li>
            <li>This product shipped quickly and was just in time for some stressful days.</li>
            <li>Sent this to my daughter while she was pregnant, now she doesn&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d say it definitely makes my mornings more relaxed!</li>
            <li>This is a nice moisturizing lotion but the smell is a little overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Her pediatrician recommended Aveeno so we tried it and her rashes went away (and pretty quickly too); I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno on her ever since.  </li>
            <li>This has led me to believe that it is not as good of a quality as some of their other products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll moisturize everything just the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would not suggest this lotion to anyone who is sensitive to strong scents.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little on the spendy side, but it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>is that it is reasonably priced and you will get your money&#x27;s worth each time you use this.</li>
            <li>I´ll buy again, THANKS!</li>
            <li>i absolutely love this brand especially with the lavender.</li>
            <li>The products smell is described as “lavender, chamomile and ylang-ylang” in which smells pretty pleasing at first but begins to wear on my senses a bit.</li>
            <li>I switched to Aveeno several yrs ago and have love the change.</li>
            <li>so I do not know if that&#x27;s why I think it lasts longer then other lotions I own.</li>
            <li>Other than that I liked the lotion.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer and subtle scent</li>
            <li>It does a good job moisturizing my dry skins and is non-sticky... Will definitely buy more in the future</li>
            <li>which doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it relieves stress, but it leaves the skin soft and hydrated w/ a nice light scent.</li>
            <li>Every time I put this lotion on I feel a little bit more calm and collected.</li>
            <li>I applied it liberally to my feet, put on some light socks, and left them on overnight.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely astonished at the difference in just one night.  </li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.  </li>
            <li>but it was a gift for someone who really likes this product.  </li>
            <li>I find that it is really calming and does go on my skin well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon price comparable to Walmart and Target.. not too much difference&lt;</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but I have come to realize that I feel like my hands are coated in an odd substance and wash it off my hands after application though overall consistency is good.</li>
            <li>After a few more overnight applications, my feet are almost brand new, for the first time, in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mainly use this on my kids.  </li>
            <li>The cost of the product is good for its the amount and it tends to last long though I do not use this daily</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>I have been using the original non-scented version for a very long time.</li>
            <li>I feel that over time the smell begins to border on baby powdery and is overpowering so much so that it has triggered headaches in which is a major downside.</li>
            <li>Those little pinkies just scream to be free from the confinement of those,</li>
            <li>My feet were soft, and the cracked heels began to heal.  </li>
            <li>this lotion can moisturize neglected feet/heels resulting in this much difference, it is a no-brainer, that it can moisturize the rest of the body with ultimate efficiency.  </li>
            <li>wish these products were all natural.</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if that was the &amp;#34;stress relief&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This lotion is marketed as having scents akin to essential oils, but really it almost has no scent.</li>
            <li>It keeps skin soothed and soft.</li>
            <li>i also use it on my 1 year old son it helps to protect him against eczema.</li>
            <li>is gentle enough to also use on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Soft skin.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and for the results received, the cost is fabulous!</li>
            <li>seriously though, I&#x27;ve used this stuff for around 5 years now and my skin has never felt better.</li>
            <li>I tried it a number of times, in a variety of environments (putting it on before bed, before work, immediately following a shower) because I liked the scent so much, but unfortunately, I just felt sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, to summarize, I recommend all the other Aveeno products, but this one, as good as it smells, is no good.</li>
            <li>The scent last a long time and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Finally get this one with no parabens(threw away my old lotions because of this).</li>
            <li>The lotion is still working in the morning as my skin stays soft for 24 hours until my next application.</li>
            <li>Its packaging though is pretty bland and lacks basic appeal</li>
            <li>So I suppose it is a little better than average but definitely not my first choice.</li>
            <li>Just use a little bit and it will treat your skin as gently as a well fitted glove.  </li>

            <li> The lotion is light yet tough enough to deal with almost any skin condition, especially dry skin.</li>
            <li> Another downside is the Aveeno line typically boasts about the natural ingredients in their product in which is lost here.</li>
            <li> I will say that when you first put it on, it smells weird (old lady ish), but after a minute it smells just like the body wash.</li>
            <li> Bought this one after a long time research on body lotions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light but still moisturizing, and isn&#x27;t like other body lotions that are heavy with scent or feel too thick to slather on your cheeks.</li>
            <li> It soaks in and protects my dry skin.</li>
            <li> In the winter months, my legs get really dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> I now use this every night after a shower and my legs haven&#x27;t been as dry and the lotion also calms the itching.</li>
            <li> When my daughter was a baby she had dry skin and rashes..</li>
            <li> My feet become very dry and calloused</li>
            <li> i kinda regret not buying a plain bigger bottle bc</li>
            <li> Unlike the other Aveeno products I used, this lotion just stayed sticky and tacky.  </li>
            <li> I have tried every remedy out there from, &#x27;Miracle Foot Cream,&#x27; to cow udder cream, all to no avail.</li>
            <li> The only adverse side effects I have gotten from the product have been minor headaches and irritating feeling when applied on damp skin.</li>
            <li> Not a pretty sight!  </li>
            <li> I say it moisturizes everywhere, I mean to say it&#x27;s a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have to use it at night when my body will be under the covers to tone down the scent a little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little rebellion, I think, from all the wear and tear my feet and legs</li>
            <li> like I usually do from other body lotions).</li>
            <li> The moment I enter my humble abode, or anywhere else where bare-feet are tolerated, off come the shoes.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves the smell too and he doesn&#x27;t usually notice little things like that.</li>
            <li> I USUALLY DON&#x27;T SHOUT IN MY REVIEWS</li>
            <li> Anyway, I was just really disappointed because I thought I was getting Aveeno lotion with actual essential oil in it.</li>
            <li> very necessary, athletic shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going barefoot has its bad side, though.  </li>
            <li> i feel like its the same crap</li>
            <li> This is my go-to lotion for everywhere: the gaps between your toes, behind your ears, and your elbows.</li>
            <li> Not too crazy about the smell though.</li>
            <li> I also hate the greasy feeling.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This gentle lotion with its pleasant aroma serves many purposes.  It is good for smoothing skin; acting as a stress buster and softening your skin.  It is ideal if you have corns and calluses.  Just use a little bit and it will treat your skin as gently as a well fitted glove.  Add to it is that it is reasonably priced and you will get your money&#x27;s worth each time you use this.</li>
            <li> Bought this one after a long time research on body lotions. Finally get this one with no parabens(threw away my old lotions because of this). The smell is so good, not so strong and comfort enough. It does a good job moisturizing my dry skins and is non-sticky... Will definitely buy more in the future</li>
            <li> I have serious skin issues (eczema and allergies) and have been through many products and this one seems to work best for me.  It is not greasy or oily and it has a very light scent.  Great price, fast shipping and it works for me!</li>
            <li> I love to go barefoot!  The moment I enter my humble abode, or anywhere else where bare-feet are tolerated, off come the shoes.  It&#x27;s a little rebellion, I think, from all the wear and tear my feet and legs have had to endure as an RN. Those little pinkies just scream to be free from the confinement of those, very necessary, athletic shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going barefoot has its bad side, though.  My feet become very dry and calloused (yep, I can walk on rocks and acorns without flinching), and my heels are prone to cracking. Not a pretty sight!  I have tried every remedy out there from, &#x27;Miracle Foot Cream,&#x27; to cow udder cream, all to no avail. Some seemed to actually make the situation worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was already enjoying Aveeno&#x27;s Stress Relief formula for overall body moisturizing, becoming increasingly impressed that it actually DID moisturize for 24 hours, as advertised. So, I put it to the ultimate test.  I applied it liberally to my feet, put on some light socks, and left them on overnight. I was absolutely astonished at the difference in just one night.  My feet were soft, and the cracked heels began to heal.  After a few more overnight applications, my feet are almost brand new, for the first time, in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this lotion can moisturize neglected feet/heels resulting in this much difference, it is a no-brainer, that it can moisturize the rest of the body with ultimate efficiency.  And, while nurturing your skin, you can enjoy the scent of lavender, chamomile and ylang-ylang, all embraced in aromatherapy for their calming, stress reducing, properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try!  A little goes a long way, and for the results received, the cost is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! Good moisturizer and it smells great! I bought it to help relieve stress and I&#x27;d say it definitely makes my mornings more relaxed!</li>
            <li> my fave lotion. keeps my skin moisturized</li>
            <li> I love the Aveeno Oatmeal lotion and oils, so I was trying this one out because it smelled so good at the store.  Unlike the other Aveeno products I used, this lotion just stayed sticky and tacky.  I tried it a number of times, in a variety of environments (putting it on before bed, before work, immediately following a shower) because I liked the scent so much, but unfortunately, I just felt sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to summarize, I recommend all the other Aveeno products, but this one, as good as it smells, is no good.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, the smell is delicious and I feel my skin very soft after use it. THIS SELLER WAS VERY FAST AND RESPONSIBLE WITH THE SHIPPING... AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT AND SERVICE. I´ll buy again, THANKS!</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.  It smells great and feels nice.  It&#x27;s a little on the spendy side, but it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> The Colloidal Oatmeal in the Aveeno Products is the reason I keep buying them, even if I&#x27;m not overly excited about smoothing petrolatum over my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish these products were all natural. I have noticed the oatmeal has a calming effect on my skin and the addition of Lavender, Chamomile and Ylang-Ylang is emotionally healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The minute you put this cream on your skin, you can feel the difference. Your skin becomes calm, soothed and smooth and silky. Perfect for after a shower or during the day when you need a calming moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
            <li> Fragrance is way too strong for me - I put it on before bed and WHEW !!&lt;br /&gt;I wanted  a different \\&quot;refreshing\\&quot; fragrance that is no longer made.</li>
            <li> I love this product and how it smells.  I put it on my arms and legs before I go to sleep.  The wonderful lavender scent helps with the relaxation process.  The lotion is still working in the morning as my skin stays soft for 24 hours until my next application.</li>
            <li> I USUALLY DON&#x27;T SHOUT IN MY REVIEWS BUT THIS IS SERIOUSLY THE BEST STUFF ON EARTH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay seriously though, I&#x27;ve used this stuff for around 5 years now and my skin has never felt better. The lotion is light yet tough enough to deal with almost any skin condition, especially dry skin. I have mild acne and it doesn&#x27;t cause additional breakouts. The scent is amazing and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if that was the &amp;#34;stress relief&amp;#34; part of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this after shaving, peels, Retin-A, etc. This heals your skin within hours. A 12-ounce bottle lasts 6-8 months. I used to be a Vaseline junkie, and I still like their products, but nothing beats this lotion. NOTHING.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for a long time and it smells great without being overpowering. It soaks in and protects my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it but it was a gift for someone who really likes this product.  I would not buy buy it for myself</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this brand especially with the lavender. it reminds me of the oder from lavender fields during my summer stay in Provence, France. not to oily and just right!</li>
            <li> I adore this lotion! I made sure to smell it when I was in the store to make sure I enjoyed the smell. I find that it is really calming and does go on my skin well. In the winter months, my legs get really dry and itchy. I now use this every night after a shower and my legs haven&#x27;t been as dry and the lotion also calms the itching. With the subscribe and save, the price is cheaper than my local stores as well. I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I thought it would save money by purchasing this item on line but it is cheaper to buy it at Walmart. The product  itself is great but a larger bottle with a cheaper price would be better.</li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion is so relaxing. I absolutely love it. It softens my skin perfectly. I have very sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to excema breakouts and this lotions works great on my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t flare up my excema.</li>
            <li> Its a nice moisturizing and stress relieving lotion.  Soothing and sets my skin at ease.  Works throughout the day.  I use it daily after showers.  Its smooth and doesnt have that oily feeling.  When it gets to the end I break open the bottle so I can get to the lotion all the way at the bottom its so good I love it.</li>
            <li> I am an avid user or lotions and found this product pretty good, though it is not my favorite kind. The products smell is described as “lavender, chamomile and ylang-ylang” in which smells pretty pleasing at first but begins to wear on my senses a bit. I feel that over time the smell begins to border on baby powdery and is overpowering so much so that it has triggered headaches in which is a major downside. At first I enjoyed the products consistency but I have come to realize that I feel like my hands are coated in an odd substance and wash it off my hands after application though overall consistency is good. The cost of the product is good for its the amount and it tends to last long though I do not use this daily so I do not know if that&#x27;s why I think it lasts longer then other lotions I own. Its packaging though is pretty bland and lacks basic appeal hence I do not leave it out in the open. Another downside is the Aveeno line typically boasts about the natural ingredients in their product in which is lost here. This has led me to believe that it is not as good of a quality as some of their other products. The only adverse side effects I have gotten from the product have been minor headaches and irritating feeling when applied on damp skin. So I suppose it is a little better than average but definitely not my first choice.</li>
            <li> This lotion is marketed as having scents akin to essential oils, but really it almost has no scent. In fact, I can&#x27;t identify what the scent is.</li>
            <li> Did anyone else notice that the front of the bottle says \\&quot;with lavender, chamomile, and ylang ylang\\&quot;, but the ingredient list doesn&#x27;t have those things in it at all? In the description on the back, it says, \\&quot;...the calming scents of lavender, [etc.]\\&quot;. Anyway, I was just really disappointed because I thought I was getting Aveeno lotion with actual essential oil in it. Instead, I got a strong floral scented lotion with a texture that&#x27;s almost as good as Aveeno&#x27;s Daily Moisturing Lotion, but not quite. So, if you&#x27;re not getting essential oils anyway and don&#x27;t like scented lotion, I&#x27;d recommend getting the Daily Moisturizing variety which is unscented and has a creamier texture.</li>
            <li> this smells good and is good for serious relaxation therapy but if you use too much it can be overwhelming</li>
            <li> This product shipped quickly and was just in time for some stressful days. Every time I put this lotion on I feel a little bit more calm and collected. It&#x27;s non-greasy and lasts for awhile. It keeps skin soothed and soft.</li>
            <li> I mainly use this on my kids.  When my daughter was a baby she had dry skin and rashes.. I used to use a different baby lotion but the rashes wouldn&#x27;t go away.  Her pediatrician recommended Aveeno so we tried it and her rashes went away (and pretty quickly too); I&#x27;ve been using Aveeno on her ever since.  I love the way this stress relief smells... It&#x27;s a bit flowery so if you don&#x27;t like that scent don&#x27;t get this.  But I use this on my two girls and myself so it saves me from buying different lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon price comparable to Walmart and Target.. not too much difference&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: I love it and recemmend it</li>
            <li> I have been using the original non-scented version for a very long time. I have psoriasis which makes it hard to find a lotion gentle enough and moisturizing enough. I also hate the greasy feeling. This lotion has all of that, and now I found a smell I like which doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin. My husband loves the smell too and he doesn&#x27;t usually notice little things like that.</li>
            <li> i kinda regret not buying a plain bigger bottle bc i feel like its the same crap just different scent lol. but its smells ok i dont think it relieves stress but aveeno is aveeno always feels great on the skin i also use it on my 1 year old son it helps to protect him against eczema.</li>
            <li> The scent is lovely and the lotion moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> I always have a bottle handy on my desk at work. Great moisturizer and subtle scent so it doesn&#x27;t offend anyone in the office</li>
            <li> I have to give this lotion five stars because it&#x27;s the only body lotion that I&#x27;ve found is gentle enough to also use on my face and neck. I put it on at night and after showers, and it&#x27;s kept my skin in great shape (no breaking out like I usually do from other body lotions). It&#x27;s light but still moisturizing, and isn&#x27;t like other body lotions that are heavy with scent or feel too thick to slather on your cheeks. This is my go-to lotion for everywhere: the gaps between your toes, behind your ears, and your elbows. It&#x27;ll moisturize everything just the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned: there is a scent! It&#x27;s not too strong, but if you prefer hypoallergenic lotions, this may not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;When I say it moisturizes everywhere, I mean to say it&#x27;s a daily moisturizer. Don&#x27;t expect this to heal your puffy eyes or hydrate your chapped winter skin.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, like a rose water, light weighted , easy to obsorb but moisture, good stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I will hightly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Love the aroma and feel of Aveeno Stress Relief.  I use it all over.</li>
            <li> This is a nice moisturizing lotion but the smell is a little overwhelming. It triggered a migraine for me. I would not suggest this lotion to anyone who is sensitive to strong scents. Other than that I liked the lotion. May even buy again. I have to use it at night when my body will be under the covers to tone down the scent a little.</li>
            <li> I try to use most Aveeno products and I think it&#x27;s great for my babies sensitive skin. Not too crazy about the smell though.</li>
            <li> I switched to Aveeno several yrs ago and have love the change. Not sure if it relieves stress, but it leaves the skin soft and hydrated w/ a nice light scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go with the stress relief body wash. I will say that when you first put it on, it smells weird (old lady ish), but after a minute it smells just like the body wash. It moisturizes wonderfully. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Aveeno is just a great product. It smells good and I gave to a friend and she loved it. Soft skin.</li>
            <li> Sent this to my daughter while she was pregnant, now she doesn&#x27;t go without it. The scent last a long time and is very moisturizing.</li>
