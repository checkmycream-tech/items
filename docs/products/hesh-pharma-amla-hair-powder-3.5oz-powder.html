            <li>Amla gave my hair a really nice curl!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good in strengthen my hair and make them shiny.</li>
            <li>Maybe once a month is good but not as an ongoing routine.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to scrub a lot to get all the powder out after!</li>
            <li>I mix a tablespoon of this into my favorite DC and it works wonders!</li>
            <li>I love the smell, kind of reminds me of Mcdonalds tea!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love Amla!</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my hair feel after two uses!  </li>
            <li>After using - my hair was nice and healthy looking!</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li>A month ago I tried the 9 herbs \\&quot;Nupur\\&quot; and I liked it too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed by how fast my hair is growing</li>
            <li>very easy to use</li>
            <li>but it is a hassle to clean all that from your hair, I rather to use another product which could give me good results without the aftermath headache of cleaning my hair again and again all over just to wash all that \\&quot;sand\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>You put it on your scalp (very important) and hair and leave it alone.&lt;br /&gt;After washing it off</li>
            <li>but I love seeing my hair on sunlight</li>
            <li>Conditioner don&#x27;t matter, it is more like the carrier for powders and oils.</li>
            <li>sure you use towel over shoulders or better yet, wrap around your hair because it seems that herbal oils react with conditioner and water in it gets separated so it can start running on your face and neck.</li>
            <li>I love how this makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this powder.</li>
            <li>and I continue to love the results.</li>
            <li>I was able to make the treatment for my hair</li>
            <li>it was okay.</li>
            <li>and I had to cut most of it off.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>I will always, always use these hair powders and wish I had found them many, many years ago.</li>
            <li>This takes most of the redness outta pimples.</li>
            <li>I tried it and is seems to be okay</li>
            <li>great for mixing with Henna and Indigo for beautiful dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand for Indian haircare products.</li>
            <li>With the 9 herbs my hair looked lighter; more coppery.</li>
            <li>I love it as a face mask.</li>
            <li>More often than not, there are no strands in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and now I feel more confident.</li>
            <li>I tried the alma powder and I love the results.  </li>
            <li>I have tried this treatment three times and I have found that it works best by simply mixing with water.</li>
            <li>It is awesome and I will DEFINITELY BE PURCHASING IT AGAIN.</li>
            <li>Maybe because i needed to apply more water.  </li>
            <li>I added a couple of tablespoons of my favorite conditioner and water.  </li>
            <li>Got this much faster than I thought at a great price.  </li>
            <li>So if you wish to keep your gray (as I do) I recommend skipping the Kalpi, to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li>But to be on fair side I am not the right to rate it.</li>
            <li>I started using this stuff and noticed that my hair gradully became alot helathier and stronger and in becoming stronger it grew better.</li>
            <li>I have very fine graying, light brown hair.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m excited to see!</li>
            <li>the smell is not unpleasant nor is it completely pleasant however the scent is mild so once its on your hair you don&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>It was a great natural conditioner.</li>
            <li>After coating my scalp and extending the paste to the roots, I ran water over a bandana, lightly squeezed it out, and wrapped it around my hair 1940&#x27;s style (Think Lucille Ball in I Love Lucy on housecleaning day)</li>
            <li>I have used hair mask made with Amla, Kalpi and brahmi powders plus some indian herbal oils for a while now, and I have long, healthy and beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>I mix this with other hair powders and this seem to condition the hair very nicely, what i have found is when mixing water add a tiny bit of baking soda with your powders and it immediatly foams up and makes a wonderful shampoo.</li>
            <li>mix it with whatever cheap hair mask or thicker hair conditioner that happens to be around.</li>
            <li>a sulfate free shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>and i use on face it leaves face smooth</li>
            <li>I read on a beauty blog that this makes a great facial masque</li>
            <li>I add Amla and Brahmi powder to the coconut oil for deep conditioning and they work great for me.</li>
            <li>here is the recipe I used for mask:&lt;br /&gt;Kalpi tone powder (I love it because it is made from many many healthy powders, I dont even know if you have to add any other powders, but I did)&lt;br /&gt;Brahmi&lt;br /&gt;Neem&lt;br /&gt;Amla</li>
            <li>The price is so worth the try!</li>
            <li>used this to darken my henna, pure and natural, did just what it was supposed great reliable product.</li>
            <li>High quality -- makes a very fine paste.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I had bright red ends and auburn roots.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really feel like I got the most out of it,</li>
            <li>I have nothing to say anything better than this items works really well and delivers the results.</li>
            <li>I liked that it rinsed clear and covered my gray, somewhat.  </li>
            <li>so she quickly went back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mine came quickly from the seller and I use it in oils for my hair.</li>
            <li>Super buy for your buck.</li>
            <li>This  was a very smooth consistency that mixed well &amp; rinsed easily.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried this as a deep conditioner yet, which is my intended purpose, but I love it already!</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re interested in restoring your hair to your original color, the Kalpi seems to be a healthy and natural approach to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i got amazing results from this product as a deep conditioner .</li>
            <li>It is absolutely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is absolutely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Topping that with a shower cap keeps the paste moist, which I&#x27;m guessing is useful.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s economical, gets the oil out and also promotes silky hair.</li>
            <li>My face is super soft and smooth, plus it cleared up some blemishes.  </li>
            <li>Used 50 grams of henna/ 1 cup water, 50 grams of Indigo/ 1 cup water and 1 TBS of Amla mixed with a little water and that was the perfect amount.</li>
            <li>this is good for the hair and does slightly make the hair darker.</li>
            <li>A little clumpy but otherwise good.</li>
            <li>Thats why I may prefer to add some more powder to absorb the extra water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thats why I may prefer to add some more powder to absorb the extra water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this powder along with the shikakai powder from the same company to wash my hair and the results are lovely.</li>
            <li>I first do a hot oil treatment w/[[ASIN:B000JWQ3N2 Dabur Amla Hair Oil 16.9 oz]] for an hour.</li>
            <li>I mix it with one or more of the following ingredients:</li>
            <li>It makes the henna color more deep for my gray hair.</li>
            <li>This got rid of it after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I first used Amla as a leave in conditioner and washed it out with shampoo.</li>
            <li>I would recommend and definitely order more than one at a time.</li>
            <li>Sounds like results vary, depending on what triggers hair loss in the first place.</li>
            <li>so I mixed it into a paste with warm water and WOW!</li>
            <li>I just tried this product today and my hair feels smooth and it looks shinny, I used this product on dry clean hair, I didn&#x27;t shampoo this powder since is supposed to be a conditioner</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product after reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Darker hair reflects better the light and usually looks shinnier than lighter hair.</li>
            <li>It certainly hasn&#x27;t done a thing to my or my mom&#x27;s hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It certainly hasn&#x27;t done a thing to my or my mom&#x27;s hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I had some leftover pure Castor oil, so that&#x27;s what I used.)</li>
            <li>This bulge in all new hair was pretty funny.</li>
            <li>, there is so much shine and health that it looks like hair care ad.</li>
            <li>If you really are on the budget you don&#x27;t have to get every product.</li>
            <li>If you really are on the budget you don&#x27;t have to get every product.</li>
            <li>My hair is stronger and MUCH shinier than ever before.</li>
            <li>I am starting to use more natural products on my hair and I really helps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good...made my hair smooth,soft and shiny...will buy again</li>
            <li>Plus the shipping was amazingly fast, even to Alaska.</li>
            <li>This product works really well if you don&#x27;t use it too often.</li>
            <li>My hair is so much healthier now.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what it does longterm, but I really like how it makes my hair feel after using it.</li>
            <li>not, when I normally dye my hair, I notice so much hair fall out!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a real customer/consumer on Amazon and wanted to share my experience because hair loss is no joke.</li>
            <li>so I like to use a real conditioner after shampooing it out.  </li>
            <li>So I now rinse my hair out in our stainless steel sink.</li>
            <li>seemed to condition nicely, but I bought it hoping it would help bring back the natural curls that have started straightening out since I started using henna and other sulfate free products and enhance waves and volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So not having split ends is pretty new thing.</li>
            <li>So not having split ends is pretty new thing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m interested to learn whether this mixture stimulates growth of new hair.</li>
            <li>Mix amla my favorite with other powders, oils and coconut milk</li>
            <li>if you care to know how my mom is doing then right now her only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; is that her hair grow so fast she keeps having to dye them!</li>
            <li>Indeed this had brought the hair I thought were gone forever, to grow back.(It takes about 4 weeks for healthy hair to grow half an inch.</li>
            <li>so I use powders from quarter to half tea spoon, depending how many powders I use, and maybe 5 to 10 drops of each oil.</li>
            <li>I will update my comment after several more uses in the future.</li>
            <li>if you care to know how my mom is doing then right now her only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; is that her hair grow so fast she keeps having to dye them!rt running on your face and neck.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>You have to really rinse to get it all out, because it dries like mud, but afterward your hair is so soft and manageable</li>
            <li>Gray hair is a shiny golden brown with just a hint of red and the rest of my hair is a shiny chestnut color.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it and it wasn&#x27;t worth sending it back.</li>
            <li>But this winter my hair gets really dry, dull and fuzzy and I resume it and immediately my hair gets much better, becoming smoothy, softer and shiny.</li>
            <li>She had naturally wavy-curly hair, and new hair were straight as sticks.</li>
            <li>I left this in for about an hour this morning with hot water, a little of the 9 herbs blend linked in \\&quot;better together\\&quot; and some hemp and silk hair oil, then washed it out with</li>
            <li>It also leaves your hair very dry as it is an astringent so be sure to use a deep conditioner afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I do it before shampooing, which I recommend because its (1) not super easy to get out and</li>
            <li>My hair, which had been quite dull and dry, developed a lovely sheen and became very silky right away!</li>
            <li>However, based on what I know so far, I like it!</li>
            <li>Natural hair African American, use for deep conditioning love it.</li>
            <li>I personally prefer Amla because it leaves my brown hair more black.  </li>
            <li>, I just rinsed out until water runned clear.</li>
            <li>But actually this review is not even that much about me, it is about my mother.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she never thought she had to worry about the loss of hair in her old age.</li>
            <li>put that mask on her hair twice a week, and it stayed on for at least 1.5 hours, basically the more the merrier.</li>
            <li>Made my 4b natural Afrocentric hair sooooo soft.</li>
            <li>Hair is shiny and soft though not any thicker.</li>
            <li>Has become a staple in my natural hair care.</li>
            <li>It also seems to help maintain my natural hair color and keep the gray in check.</li>
            <li>I used this powder along with cassia powder and my hair was silky soft and easier to detangle, and boy was my hair tangled up at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>still shed (it&#x27;s a natural process)</li>
            <li>This has worked for me, so far.</li>
            <li>It reduces shedding hair ,and can be used as a natural astringent for the skin .</li>
            <li>and this had no trouble penetrating the shaft of my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and shining after two washes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not softening or moisturizing (at least in terms of how my hair feels), its more strengthening in a way that I like.  </li>
            <li>(2) doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling soft</li>
            <li>Hard to rinse out and messy, be sure to clean your tub or it will leave brown streaks.</li>
            <li>then her normal hair were, and then suddenly they became much thicker then regular hair.</li>
            <li>To be honest I didn&#x27;t see much, I&#x27;ve used as the instructions indicate it on the box and even left it on my hair for a longer period of time with little or not significant results, won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>Originally I thought this was indigo powder but mixed this with the other powder I had</li>
            <li>On my first application I mixed with castor oil and conditioner, but the second time I used with just water and my curls were revitalized.</li>
            <li>I use it as a deep conditioner and it leaves my hair very soft and clearly moisturized.</li>
            <li>tell you the truth, for what ever reason they didn&#x27;t look the same as her normal length hair were.</li>
            <li>This is a first for me using these powers, I like the fact at the rashools leaves my hair soft and so does this mix with other powers and EVOO</li>
            <li>We leave on for about an hour and a half, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>It left my hair very soft and it arrived in a couple of days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These masks can be messy but they are absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These masks can be messy but they are absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>I naturally have super thick hair</li>
            <li>And that first half an inch was thinner</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to tell if it helps with growth, I will have to re-review in a few more months for that.  </li>

            <li> A month ago I tried the 9 herbs \\&quot;Nupur\\&quot; and I liked it too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed by how fast my hair is growing</li>
            <li> very easy to use</li>
            <li> but it is a hassle to clean all that from your hair, I rather to use another product which could give me good results without the aftermath headache of cleaning my hair again and again all over just to wash all that \\&quot;sand\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> You put it on your scalp (very important) and hair and leave it alone.&lt;br /&gt;After washing it off</li>
            <li> but I love seeing my hair on sunlight</li>
            <li> Conditioner don&#x27;t matter, it is more like the carrier for powders and oils.</li>
            <li> sure you use towel over shoulders or better yet, wrap around your hair because it seems that herbal oils react with conditioner and water in it gets separated so it can start running on your face and neck.</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this powder.</li>
            <li> and I continue to love the results.</li>
            <li> I was able to make the treatment for my hair</li>
            <li> it was okay.</li>
            <li> and I had to cut most of it off.</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> I will always, always use these hair powders and wish I had found them many, many years ago.</li>
            <li> This takes most of the redness outta pimples.</li>
            <li> I tried it and is seems to be okay</li>
            <li> great for mixing with Henna and Indigo for beautiful dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand for Indian haircare products.</li>
            <li> With the 9 herbs my hair looked lighter; more coppery.</li>
            <li> I love it as a face mask.</li>
            <li> More often than not, there are no strands in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and now I feel more confident.</li>
            <li> I tried the alma powder and I love the results.  </li>
            <li> I have tried this treatment three times and I have found that it works best by simply mixing with water.</li>
            <li> It is awesome and I will DEFINITELY BE PURCHASING IT AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Maybe because i needed to apply more water.  </li>
            <li> I added a couple of tablespoons of my favorite conditioner and water.  </li>
            <li> Got this much faster than I thought at a great price.  </li>
            <li> So if you wish to keep your gray (as I do) I recommend skipping the Kalpi, to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> But to be on fair side I am not the right to rate it.</li>
            <li> I started using this stuff and noticed that my hair gradully became alot helathier and stronger and in becoming stronger it grew better.</li>
            <li> I have very fine graying, light brown hair.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m excited to see!</li>
            <li> the smell is not unpleasant nor is it completely pleasant however the scent is mild so once its on your hair you don&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> It was a great natural conditioner.</li>
            <li> After coating my scalp and extending the paste to the roots, I ran water over a bandana, lightly squeezed it out, and wrapped it around my hair 1940&#x27;s style (Think Lucille Ball in I Love Lucy on housecleaning day)</li>
            <li> I have used hair mask made with Amla, Kalpi and brahmi powders plus some indian herbal oils for a while now, and I have long, healthy and beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> I mix this with other hair powders and this seem to condition the hair very nicely, what i have found is when mixing water add a tiny bit of baking soda with your powders and it immediatly foams up and makes a wonderful shampoo.</li>
            <li> mix it with whatever cheap hair mask or thicker hair conditioner that happens to be around.</li>
            <li> a sulfate free shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> and i use on face it leaves face smooth</li>
            <li> I read on a beauty blog that this makes a great facial masque</li>
            <li> I add Amla and Brahmi powder to the coconut oil for deep conditioning and they work great for me.</li>
            <li> here is the recipe I used for mask:&lt;br /&gt;Kalpi tone powder (I love it because it is made from many many healthy powders, I dont even know if you have to add any other powders, but I did)&lt;br /&gt;Brahmi&lt;br /&gt;Neem&lt;br /&gt;Amla</li>
            <li> The price is so worth the try!</li>
            <li> used this to darken my henna, pure and natural, did just what it was supposed great reliable product.</li>
            <li> High quality -- makes a very fine paste.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I had bright red ends and auburn roots.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really feel like I got the most out of it,</li>
            <li> I have nothing to say anything better than this items works really well and delivers the results.</li>
            <li> I liked that it rinsed clear and covered my gray, somewhat.  </li>
            <li> so she quickly went back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine came quickly from the seller and I use it in oils for my hair.</li>
            <li> Super buy for your buck.</li>
            <li> This  was a very smooth consistency that mixed well &amp; rinsed easily.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried this as a deep conditioner yet, which is my intended purpose, but I love it already!</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re interested in restoring your hair to your original color, the Kalpi seems to be a healthy and natural approach to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i got amazing results from this product as a deep conditioner .</li>
            <li> It is absolutely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is absolutely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Topping that with a shower cap keeps the paste moist, which I&#x27;m guessing is useful.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s economical, gets the oil out and also promotes silky hair.</li>
            <li> My face is super soft and smooth, plus it cleared up some blemishes.  </li>
            <li> Used 50 grams of henna/ 1 cup water, 50 grams of Indigo/ 1 cup water and 1 TBS of Amla mixed with a little water and that was the perfect amount.</li>
            <li> this is good for the hair and does slightly make the hair darker.</li>
            <li> A little clumpy but otherwise good.</li>
            <li> Thats why I may prefer to add some more powder to absorb the extra water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thats why I may prefer to add some more powder to absorb the extra water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this powder along with the shikakai powder from the same company to wash my hair and the results are lovely.</li>
            <li> I first do a hot oil treatment w/[[ASIN:B000JWQ3N2 Dabur Amla Hair Oil 16.9 oz]] for an hour.</li>
            <li> I mix it with one or more of the following ingredients:</li>
            <li> It makes the henna color more deep for my gray hair.</li>
            <li> This got rid of it after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I first used Amla as a leave in conditioner and washed it out with shampoo.</li>
            <li> I would recommend and definitely order more than one at a time.</li>
            <li> Sounds like results vary, depending on what triggers hair loss in the first place.</li>
            <li> so I mixed it into a paste with warm water and WOW!</li>
            <li> I just tried this product today and my hair feels smooth and it looks shinny, I used this product on dry clean hair, I didn&#x27;t shampoo this powder since is supposed to be a conditioner</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product after reading all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Darker hair reflects better the light and usually looks shinnier than lighter hair.</li>
            <li> It certainly hasn&#x27;t done a thing to my or my mom&#x27;s hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It certainly hasn&#x27;t done a thing to my or my mom&#x27;s hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I had some leftover pure Castor oil, so that&#x27;s what I used.)</li>
            <li> This bulge in all new hair was pretty funny.</li>
            <li> , there is so much shine and health that it looks like hair care ad.</li>
            <li> If you really are on the budget you don&#x27;t have to get every product.</li>
            <li> If you really are on the budget you don&#x27;t have to get every product.</li>
            <li> My hair is stronger and MUCH shinier than ever before.</li>
            <li> I am starting to use more natural products on my hair and I really helps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good...made my hair smooth,soft and shiny...will buy again</li>
            <li> Plus the shipping was amazingly fast, even to Alaska.</li>
            <li> This product works really well if you don&#x27;t use it too often.</li>
            <li> My hair is so much healthier now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it does longterm, but I really like how it makes my hair feel after using it.</li>
            <li> not, when I normally dye my hair, I notice so much hair fall out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a real customer/consumer on Amazon and wanted to share my experience because hair loss is no joke.</li>
            <li> so I like to use a real conditioner after shampooing it out.  </li>
            <li> So I now rinse my hair out in our stainless steel sink.</li>
            <li> seemed to condition nicely, but I bought it hoping it would help bring back the natural curls that have started straightening out since I started using henna and other sulfate free products and enhance waves and volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So not having split ends is pretty new thing.</li>
            <li> So not having split ends is pretty new thing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m interested to learn whether this mixture stimulates growth of new hair.</li>
            <li> Mix amla my favorite with other powders, oils and coconut milk</li>
            <li> if you care to know how my mom is doing then right now her only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; is that her hair grow so fast she keeps having to dye them!</li>
            <li> Indeed this had brought the hair I thought were gone forever, to grow back.(It takes about 4 weeks for healthy hair to grow half an inch.</li>
            <li> so I use powders from quarter to half tea spoon, depending how many powders I use, and maybe 5 to 10 drops of each oil.</li>
            <li> I will update my comment after several more uses in the future.</li>
            <li> if you care to know how my mom is doing then right now her only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; is that her hair grow so fast she keeps having to dye them!rt running on your face and neck.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> You have to really rinse to get it all out, because it dries like mud, but afterward your hair is so soft and manageable</li>
            <li> Gray hair is a shiny golden brown with just a hint of red and the rest of my hair is a shiny chestnut color.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it and it wasn&#x27;t worth sending it back.</li>
            <li> But this winter my hair gets really dry, dull and fuzzy and I resume it and immediately my hair gets much better, becoming smoothy, softer and shiny.</li>
            <li> She had naturally wavy-curly hair, and new hair were straight as sticks.</li>
            <li> I left this in for about an hour this morning with hot water, a little of the 9 herbs blend linked in \\&quot;better together\\&quot; and some hemp and silk hair oil, then washed it out with</li>
            <li> It also leaves your hair very dry as it is an astringent so be sure to use a deep conditioner afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I do it before shampooing, which I recommend because its (1) not super easy to get out and</li>
            <li> My hair, which had been quite dull and dry, developed a lovely sheen and became very silky right away!</li>
            <li> However, based on what I know so far, I like it!</li>
            <li> Natural hair African American, use for deep conditioning love it.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer Amla because it leaves my brown hair more black.  </li>
            <li> , I just rinsed out until water runned clear.</li>
            <li> But actually this review is not even that much about me, it is about my mother.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she never thought she had to worry about the loss of hair in her old age.</li>
            <li> put that mask on her hair twice a week, and it stayed on for at least 1.5 hours, basically the more the merrier.</li>
            <li> Made my 4b natural Afrocentric hair sooooo soft.</li>
            <li> Hair is shiny and soft though not any thicker.</li>
            <li> Has become a staple in my natural hair care.</li>
            <li> It also seems to help maintain my natural hair color and keep the gray in check.</li>
            <li> I used this powder along with cassia powder and my hair was silky soft and easier to detangle, and boy was my hair tangled up at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> still shed (it&#x27;s a natural process)</li>
            <li> This has worked for me, so far.</li>
            <li> It reduces shedding hair ,and can be used as a natural astringent for the skin .</li>
            <li> and this had no trouble penetrating the shaft of my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and shining after two washes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not softening or moisturizing (at least in terms of how my hair feels), its more strengthening in a way that I like.  </li>
            <li> (2) doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling soft</li>
            <li> Hard to rinse out and messy, be sure to clean your tub or it will leave brown streaks.</li>
            <li> then her normal hair were, and then suddenly they became much thicker then regular hair.</li>
            <li> To be honest I didn&#x27;t see much, I&#x27;ve used as the instructions indicate it on the box and even left it on my hair for a longer period of time with little or not significant results, won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Originally I thought this was indigo powder but mixed this with the other powder I had</li>
            <li> On my first application I mixed with castor oil and conditioner, but the second time I used with just water and my curls were revitalized.</li>
            <li> I use it as a deep conditioner and it leaves my hair very soft and clearly moisturized.</li>
            <li> tell you the truth, for what ever reason they didn&#x27;t look the same as her normal length hair were.</li>
            <li> This is a first for me using these powers, I like the fact at the rashools leaves my hair soft and so does this mix with other powers and EVOO</li>
            <li> We leave on for about an hour and a half, but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It left my hair very soft and it arrived in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These masks can be messy but they are absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These masks can be messy but they are absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> I naturally have super thick hair</li>
            <li> And that first half an inch was thinner</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell if it helps with growth, I will have to re-review in a few more months for that.  </li>
            <li> and maybe my expectations were a little high, but I didn&#x27;t notice any change anywhere in my hair..</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even check the status of her hair for first 6 weeks, as I said I thought the chances of them growing back were weak, plus if some of them would have grown back, I thought it takes some extensive therapy for the nutrients to kick in and hair to grow.</li>
            <li> I leave it on as long as possible, sometimes overnight.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my face soft when use as mask and my hair dark but what a mess in my bathtub, hard to clean, wont purchase again.</li>
            <li> I got to say my hair is already showing a half of inch in growth and it made my hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li> I mixed a thick paste and then let it sit on my hair for one hour, now my whole head is auburn, not orange.</li>
            <li> Mixed this with some other products to make a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> Especially after hennaing my hair feels very dry, and they help restore the moisture and softness of my hair.</li>
            <li> So low and behold when some 6 weeks after starting I saw a little, half an inch in length, what I called a \\&quot;forest\\&quot; of new hair.</li>
            <li> I tried it once but did not like how it went on and how long it took to remove.  </li>
            <li> myself recently replaced  Nyle oil with Bajaj Brahmi Amla Hair oil (I really do not like mineral oil), and here are it&#x27;s ingredients: Sesame Seed oil, Bilwa, Brahmi, Amla, Ashwagandha, Kanta Kari, Gokshura, Bala, Neem, Purnarnava, Atibala, Agnimantha, Prasarani, Patal Twak, Shatawari, Mishreya , Jatamansi , Turmeric, Daruharidra, Shailja, Sandalwood, Pushkarmool, Ela , Manjistha, Yasti Madhu, Tagar, Musta, Tejpatra, Bringraj, Jiwak, Vacha, Kama Duda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have not used this product for a long time so it is too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> I usually mix this with black jamaican castor oil as both a deep conditioner and a protein treatment although the product doesnt advertise per se as a protein treament, it really does help strengthen hair.</li>
            <li> The difference in Krissu&#x27;s mother&#x27;s experience and mine re whether the Kalpi imparts a darker tone may be due to the length of time I left it</li>
            <li> Hair comes out felling dry</li>
            <li> It is a huge vitamin and mineral bomb and I will put it up against Maroccanoil masks and other expensive hair care items any day!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>

            <li> I usually use coconut oil as a deep conditioner, but I plan to flat Iron my hair tomorrow and Coconut oil will leave my hair to flat.</li>
            <li> I ordered this powder to tone down the red, and it did just the job!</li>
            <li> I henna my hair and use this for toning down the red as well as enhancing my waves (henna can relax wavy hair over time).</li>
            <li> I probably should have mixed it with other products as some of the other reviews</li>
            <li> If one has short hair you can get away with much less then that.</li>
            <li> This time, there was a third less hair fall while I dyed my hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I added a little almond oil to the mixture(my hair is dry coarse)</li>
            <li> Also, I noticed my hair was very dry after I rinsed with water...</li>
            <li> about 2 years ago I had cut my hair and bleached it white, not shocker that the harsh processing severly broke my hair off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll report back in a few months.</li>
            <li> A must for all dark haired folks with or without dry scalp concerns.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a mess to wash out, and if you have an old fiberglass tub, it can be hard to scrub the stain from it.</li>
            <li> To get this result in 6 weeks means it took roughly 2 weeks for this stuff to kick in!</li>
            <li> but I use other oils too that contribute to hair growth and thickness, so</li>
            <li> I only used a small portion, so I will be applying in about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I started using this with the dark brown henna from &amp;#34;henna guys&amp;#34; and it really does help remove that crazy red glow in the sunshine.  </li>
            <li> Kalpi tone powder is hard to find, then as one person here already mentioned, Godrej Nupur Mehendi is very similar.</li>

            <li> It is a bit messy and I had stopped this routine for a while.</li>

            <li> (a week apart) and have already noticed less hair fall out!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have VERY thick hair and have suffered from dry scalp all of our lives.  </li>
            <li> you must mix with water as to apply to hair and see results instantly when wash out it strips and of all hair to renew ill use 1 time a week</li>
            <li> My hair feels stronger less shedding and no more split ends!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really hard to wash all those particles of grinding pits???</li>
            <li> and I thought it must have been too late for that,</li>
            <li> I was afraid the actual oil would smell</li>
            <li> mom has always had thick hair</li>
            <li> It was a bit too thick</li>
            <li> I like making a paste and putting it on my skin, especially when I am having bad breakouts.</li>
            <li> My hair is badly damage and just started using this product 2 weeks now with my deep conditioner routine.</li>
            <li> I never realized the embarrassment that makes elderly woman wear so obviously fake wigs until my mom was thinking about wigs herself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> $5 package is also too expensive, since it&#x27;s one use on my BSL hair.</li>
            <li> but it has definitely decreased since I&#x27;ve used Amla!</li>
            <li> THis version was difficult to apply.</li>

            <li> Excellent quality, item just as described.</li>
            <li> Give my hair the shine it needs! My hair feels stronger less shedding and no more split ends!!</li>
            <li> No problems. A bit messy</li>
            <li> Very nice product and i reached my expectation! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Natural hair African American, use for deep conditioning love it.</li>
            <li> It is below my expectation</li>
            <li> A little clumpy but otherwise good.</li>
            <li> I use amla powder in all of my hair mixes, especially my deep conditioning mix. I also use it a couple of weeks after I henna to tighten my curls. Amla has improved the strength of my hair also.</li>
            <li> I tried it once but did not like how it went on and how long it took to remove.  I probably should have mixed it with other products as some of the other reviews said but I went by directions on the package.</li>
            <li> amazing product for hair! supposedly for skin also but I have not tried it! I have using alma powder for a couple months now it is great. Just make sure to scrub a lot to get all the powder out after!</li>
            <li> I have used hair mask made with Amla, Kalpi and brahmi powders plus some indian herbal oils for a while now, and I have long, healthy and beautiful hair.It sounds petty but I love seeing my hair on sunlight, there is so much shine and health that it looks like hair care ad. But actually this review is not even that much about me, it is about my mother.&lt;br /&gt;My mom has always had thick hair and she never thought she had to worry about the loss of hair in her old age. But as it happened, several of her medications had hair loss as side effect and hair started falling out.&lt;br /&gt;She tried medicated hair shampoos and they did nothing. I bought her from Amazon some 100$ hair care system from Italy (don&#x27;t remember the name) and it did nothing as well. And my mom was pretty desperate. I never realized the embarrassment that makes elderly woman wear so obviously fake wigs until my mom was thinking about wigs herself.&lt;br /&gt;So I thought I will let her try my hair masks and see what they do. Frankly I wasn&#x27;t hoping to get any hair to grow back, because her hair had started falling out some 3-4 years earlier and I thought it must have been too late for that, but I wanted to give enough nutrients for remaining hair to stop them from falling out as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We put that mask on her hair twice a week, and it stayed on for at least 1.5 hours, basically the more the merrier. I didn&#x27;t even check the status of her hair for first 6 weeks, as I said I thought the chances of them growing back were weak, plus if some of them would have grown back, I thought it takes some extensive therapy for the nutrients to kick in and hair to grow. So low and behold when some 6 weeks after starting I saw a little, half an inch in length, what I called a \\&quot;forest\\&quot; of new hair. Indeed this had brought the hair I thought were gone forever, to grow back.(It takes about 4 weeks for healthy hair to grow half an inch. To get this result in 6 weeks means it took roughly 2 weeks for this stuff to kick in! How crazy is that???)&lt;br /&gt;To tell you the truth, for what ever reason they didn&#x27;t look the same as her normal length hair were. She had naturally wavy-curly hair, and new hair were straight as sticks. And that first half an inch was thinner then her normal hair were, and then suddenly they became much thicker then regular hair. This bulge in all new hair was pretty funny. But you know what? My mom didn&#x27;t complain. Finally her scalp didn&#x27;t shine through her hair anymore.  Soon after that she started doing the mask 2-3 times a month or so. And a year later she stopped and her hair started falling out again so she quickly went back.&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t work if your problem is caused by hormones, but if it&#x27;s the lack of proper nutrition for the hair then this mask works wonders!&lt;br /&gt;And here is the recipe I used for mask:&lt;br /&gt;Kalpi tone powder (I love it because it is made from many many healthy powders, I dont even know if you have to add any other powders, but I did)&lt;br /&gt;Brahmi&lt;br /&gt;Neem&lt;br /&gt;Amla&lt;br /&gt;I added few drops of Vatika hair oil and Nyle hair oil&lt;br /&gt;I mix it with whatever cheap hair mask or thicker hair conditioner that happens to be around. Conditioner don&#x27;t matter, it is more like the carrier for powders and oils. Suave conditioner is great,&lt;br /&gt;I have long and thick hair so I use powders from quarter to half tea spoon, depending how many powders I use, and maybe 5 to 10 drops of each oil. If one has short hair you can get away with much less then that. You put it on your scalp (very important) and hair and leave it alone.&lt;br /&gt;After washing it off we also used herbal tea made from only nettles to pour over hair just before we step out of the shower. Nettles are also very good for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is what worked for my mom and what has kept my hair in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use towel over shoulders or better yet, wrap around your hair because it seems that herbal oils react with conditioner and water in it gets separated so it can start running on your face and neck. Thats why I may prefer to add some more powder to absorb the extra water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word about Kalpi tone powder -description says its for dying hair, but dye kicks in only if you let it stand in iron pot overnight,I guess  iron reacts to the powder,So if you use it in regular bowl it don&#x27;t dye a thing. It certainly hasn&#x27;t done a thing to my or my mom&#x27;s hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those 6 products (Neem, Kalpi, Brahmi, Amla, Nyle and Vatika) should cost under 35$ even with shipping. And even with my long and thick hair it will last some 6 months at least. It is absolutely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just checked the prices on all those powders on Amazon and prices left me stunned. You can find alternate stores outside of Amazon with cheaper prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Kalpi tone powder is hard to find, then as one person here already mentioned, Godrej Nupur Mehendi is very similar. If you really are on the budget you don&#x27;t have to get every product. Because Nyle and Vatika are both made with a lot of ingredients, and they somewhat match.&lt;br /&gt;Vatika has coconut oil, Neem, brahmi, Henna, Rosemary,Bahera, Harar, Lemon and Kapur katchri oil. (Henna won&#x27;t dye your hair).&lt;br /&gt;Nyle has Coconut, Gingelly, Amla, Henna, Hibiscus, Rosemary, Avuri, Fenugreek oil. (But it also has Mineral oil which I am not a fan of).&lt;br /&gt;Kalpi tone powder is made with Amla (10%), Maka leaves (10%), Mandoor (10%), Hibiscus (9%),Naranhical (9%), Shikakai (7%), Kumari leaves (7%), Kapur Katchi (6%), Brahmi (5%), Methi seed (5%), Wala (5%), Khadir stem (3%),and  Neem, Chandra, Sitaphal and Sugandi, all under 2%.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to substitute Kalpi with Godrej Nupur Mehendi Powder then this is made with Brahmi, Shikakai, Aloe Vera, Methi, Bhringraj, Amla, Neem, Hibiscus, and Jatamansi .&lt;br /&gt;If you can not afford all powders and oils I mentioned, cris cross ingredients and prices and see what works for you best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I myself recently replaced  Nyle oil with Bajaj Brahmi Amla Hair oil (I really do not like mineral oil), and here are it&#x27;s ingredients: Sesame Seed oil, Bilwa, Brahmi, Amla, Ashwagandha, Kanta Kari, Gokshura, Bala, Neem, Purnarnava, Atibala, Agnimantha, Prasarani, Patal Twak, Shatawari, Mishreya , Jatamansi , Turmeric, Daruharidra, Shailja, Sandalwood, Pushkarmool, Ela , Manjistha, Yasti Madhu, Tagar, Musta, Tejpatra, Bringraj, Jiwak, Vacha, Kama Duda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - my husband just mentioned that I don&#x27;t have split ends anymore. My hair are into the mid back and I have always had split ends. But I have been doing those hair masks for 3 or so years now and even during that time I had to cut the ends. So not having split ends is pretty new thing. Don&#x27;t expect that to happen to you overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These masks can be messy but they are absolutely worth it. It is a huge vitamin and mineral bomb and I will put it up against Maroccanoil masks and other expensive hair care items any day!&lt;br /&gt;And if you care to know how my mom is doing then right now her only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; is that her hair grow so fast she keeps having to dye them!rt running on your face and neck. Thats why I may prefer to add some more powder to absorb the extra water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word about Kalpi tone powder -description says its for dying hair, but dye kicks in only if you let it stand in iron pot overnight,I guess  iron reacts to the powder,So if you use it in regular bowl it don&#x27;t dye a thing.

            <li> Left my hair extermly shinny and moisturized. Arrived within a couple of days. Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I use this powder along with the shikakai powder from the same company to wash my hair and the results are lovely. I love how this makes my hair feel. I used to just use reetha (soapnut) tea earlier but now I mix a spoonful of both powders, add reetha tea to it, use this as shampoo. I love it!!</li>
            <li> I have not used this product for a long time so it is too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this powder. I am AA w/ 4b type hair. I mix a tablespoon of this into my favorite DC and it works wonders! My hair is stronger and MUCH shinier than ever before. Even my co-workers have commented on how shiny my hair has become. I first do a hot oil treatment w/[[ASIN:B000JWQ3N2 Dabur Amla Hair Oil 16.9 oz]] for an hour. I then apply my DC/Amla powder mix for about another hour. I do this weekly and it&#x27;s now a staple product. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I mix this with other hair powders and this seem to condition the hair very nicely, what i have found is when mixing water add a tiny bit of baking soda with your powders and it immediatly foams up and makes a wonderful shampoo.</li>
            <li> Mix amla my favorite with other powders, oils and coconut milk and I continue to love the results. Yes I would recommend!</li>
            <li> Made my 4b natural Afrocentric hair sooooo soft. Perfect!!! Mixed it with Shikakai powder as well but will try Amla by itself to see what will happen 👍🏾</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use this</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and shoulder length and about 20% gray. Used 50 grams of henna/ 1 cup water, 50 grams of Indigo/ 1 cup water and 1 TBS of Amla mixed with a little water and that was the perfect amount. I did not add lemon juice or ACV as those have never worked well with my hair. Left on for 4 hours. Color is beautiful! Hair is shiny and soft though not any thicker. Gray hair is a shiny golden brown with just a hint of red and the rest of my hair is a shiny chestnut color. Amla gave my hair a really nice curl!</li>
            <li> used this to darken my henna, pure and natural, did just what it was supposed great reliable product.</li>
            <li> I loooove this stuff. Shikakai and Amla make a great duo! It left my hair very soft and it arrived in a couple of days. I am starting to use more natural products on my hair and I really helps. I wen like the brownish color my hair has</li>
            <li> My hair powder came out great. I was able to make the treatment for my hair and I am so happy</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried this as a deep conditioner yet, which is my intended purpose, but I love it already! I love the smell, kind of reminds me of Mcdonalds tea!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good...made my hair smooth,soft and shiny...will buy again</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it and it wasn&#x27;t worth sending it back. I didn&#x27;t realize that it was for black hair and I have blonde hair.</li>
            <li> This is a first for me using these powers, I like the fact at the rashools leaves my hair soft and so does this mix with other powers and EVOO</li>
            <li> eh. it was okay. didn&#x27;t really feel like I got the most out of it, and maybe my expectations were a little high, but I didn&#x27;t notice any change anywhere in my hair..probably wouldn&#x27;t spend money on it again. it either works for you or it doesn&#x27;t...</li>
            <li> Best hair powder I have bought all of them but that is the best</li>
            <li> I have been adding the amla powder to the amla oil for my pre-poo condition. My hair feels and looks amazing! Has become a staple in my natural hair care.</li>
            <li> I usually mix this with black jamaican castor oil as both a deep conditioner and a protein treatment although the product doesnt advertise per se as a protein treament, it really does help strengthen hair. I initially started using this stuff about 2 years ago I had cut my hair and bleached it white, not shocker that the harsh processing severly broke my hair off and I had to cut most of it off. I started using this stuff and noticed that my hair gradully became alot helathier and stronger and in becoming stronger it grew better. I would say I noticed a difference after using the mix once a week with a conditioning cap.</li>
            <li> I like the way it makes my face soft when use as mask and my hair dark but what a mess in my bathtub, hard to clean, wont purchase again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my friends. Seems they like it. But to be on fair side I am not the right to rate it.</li>
            <li> High quality -- makes a very fine paste.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t buy enough of this. It&#x27;s really good in strengthen my hair and make them shiny. I mix it with one or more of the following ingredients: rosemary infuse, yogurth, oil, little of honey, egg yolks and leave it on. Works great. I also made an oil out of it to use on my damp hair before air drying them or using the hair dryer. Love this product</li>
            <li> I left this in for about an hour this morning with hot water, a little of the 9 herbs blend linked in \\&quot;better together\\&quot; and some hemp and silk hair oil, then washed it out with a sulfate free shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to condition nicely, but I bought it hoping it would help bring back the natural curls that have started straightening out since I started using henna and other sulfate free products and enhance waves and volume.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;This $5 package is also too expensive, since it&#x27;s one use on my BSL hair. I might try a different amla product, but not this one again.</li>
            <li> I used Henna to color my hair red, but my ends were highlighted. Therefore, I had bright red ends and auburn roots. I ordered this powder to tone down the red, and it did just the job! I mixed a thick paste and then let it sit on my hair for one hour, now my whole head is auburn, not orange. This product does NOT lend a red hue, it lends \\&quot;ash\\&quot; undertones. I noticed the next day that my hair felt like SILK. I then read about all the great aspects of Amla for dandruff ext...You won&#x27;t regret getting this product.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders on the hair. Amla is very effective to promote hair growth, strengh and shine. It also seems to help maintain my natural hair color and keep the gray in check. I mix a spoonful of Brahmi powder in my regular shampoo and a spoonful of Shikakai and Amla powder on my regular conditioner. I use these products once or twice a week when I wash my hair. I will always, always use these hair powders and wish I had found them many, many years ago.</li>
            <li> I use a combination of Amla, Shikakai and Brahmi with some Amla oil and it works well for me - I can start feeling the difference in terms of texture and hair fall.</li>
            <li> My Kinky hair loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> I like making a paste and putting it on my skin, especially when I am having bad breakouts. This takes most of the redness outta pimples. I add this to my henna too.</li>
            <li> I tried it and is seems to be okay but its too soon tell what it does for my hair! I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I used this powder along with cassia powder and my hair was silky soft and easier to detangle, and boy was my hair tangled up at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the smell of it either.</li>
            <li> great for mixing with Henna and Indigo for beautiful dark brown hair.  My hair is naturally very WHITE!  I also add salt to the indigo and cinnamon to the henna.</li>
            <li> Loved it! The volume it gave my hair was unreal!</li>
            <li> It is messy so prepare to lay out some towels but i did like the product.</li>
            <li> omg is all i have to say , i mixed this in my hair regimine and i got amazing results from this product as a deep conditioner .</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand for Indian haircare products.</li>
            <li> Best product great investment</li>
            <li> Mixed this with some other products to make a deep conditioning treatment. Love it!</li>
            <li> The jury&#x27;s been out on this product for a while.  I wanted to give it every opportunity to prove itself.  I purchased it because Amla is supposed to be used with henna and indigo to give hair a cooler tone.  I&#x27;ve tried it several times and found no difference when compared with times it was not used.  Since it did not perform to expectation, I will not be purchasing this brand again.</li>
            <li> I used this to darken henna and it works.  It makes the henna color more deep for my gray hair.</li>
            <li> This paste works wonders.  My daughter and I have VERY thick hair and have suffered from dry scalp all of our lives.  Nothing works, until now!  This got rid of it after the first use.  Amazing stuff.  We leave on for about an hour and a half, but it is worth it. You have to really rinse to get it all out, because it dries like mud, but afterward your hair is so soft and manageable it is almost like it belongs to someone else.  A must for all dark haired folks with or without dry scalp concerns.</li>
            <li> I just tried this product today and my hair feels smooth and it looks shinny, I used this product on dry clean hair, I didn&#x27;t shampoo this powder since is supposed to be a conditioner, I just rinsed out until water runned clear. I added a little almond oil to the mixture(my hair is dry coarse) I usually use coconut oil as a deep conditioner, but I plan to flat Iron my hair tomorrow and Coconut oil will leave my hair to flat. A month ago I tried the 9 herbs \\&quot;Nupur\\&quot; and I liked it too (They suggested to add curd to add sofness to the hair. I personally prefer Amla because it leaves my brown hair more black.  Darker hair reflects better the light and usually looks shinnier than lighter hair. With the 9 herbs my hair looked lighter; more coppery.</li>
            <li> is muddy you must mix with water as to apply to hair and see results instantly when wash out it strips and of all hair to renew ill use 1 time a week and i use on face it leaves face smooth my facial spots is clearing</li>
            <li> This  was a very smooth consistency that mixed well &amp; rinsed easily. I used it together with cassia, in a 1/5 ratio, mixed into coconut milk. I added the amla as I wanted to keep my curls from being too relaxed by the cassia. Really impressed with this product. My hair is conditioned, with a great deal of shine and 80% reduction in frizz. And the price is great. Plus the shipping was amazingly fast, even to Alaska.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this item its awful, it feels like sand on your hair and is hard to remove after applied. Also, I noticed my hair was very dry after I rinsed with water...do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product works really well if you don&#x27;t use it too often. Maybe once a month is good but not as an ongoing routine. I love it as a face mask.</li>
            <li> I henna my hair and use this for toning down the red as well as enhancing my waves (henna can relax wavy hair over time). Hard to rinse out and messy, be sure to clean your tub or it will leave brown streaks. It also leaves your hair very dry as it is an astringent so be sure to use a deep conditioner afterwards.  I read on a beauty blog that this makes a great facial masque so I mixed it into a paste with warm water and WOW! My face is super soft and smooth, plus it cleared up some blemishes.  I like this a lot and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I cant say enough about this product. I use it as a deep conditioner and it leaves my hair very soft and clearly moisturized. Im definetly incooperating this into my hair regimen and cant wait to try it as a facial mask</li>
            <li> I started using this with the dark brown henna from &amp;#34;henna guys&amp;#34; and it really does help remove that crazy red glow in the sunshine.  My hair is so much healthier now.</li>
            <li> I have used this with the almond oil and did like the results.  Over time I am looking for the texture of my hair to be shinier and healthier!</li>
            <li> I was afraid the actual oil would smell so I ordered the powder.  I mixed the powder with castor oil in a hair color bottle.  It was a bit too thick so I ended up adding some grapeseed oil.  I&#x27;ve been using this on my scalp and hair overnight then cowashing it out.  I don&#x27;t have any problems with grittiness in my hair but I think that&#x27;s because the oil fixes that.  The only thing is that the powder sits on the bottom  and I have to shake it forever to get it mixed up.  I don&#x27;t know what it does longterm, but I really like how it makes my hair feel after using it.</li>
            <li> I add Amla and Brahmi powder to the coconut oil for deep conditioning and they work great for me. Especially after hennaing my hair feels very dry, and they help restore the moisture and softness of my hair. It is a bit messy and I had stopped this routine for a while. But this winter my hair gets really dry, dull and fuzzy and I resume it and immediately my hair gets much better, becoming smoothy, softer and shiny. I will not move away from it from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this powder twice (a week apart) and have already noticed less hair fall out! I first used Amla as a leave in conditioner and washed it out with shampoo. A week later, I mixed the powder into my hair dye! I kid u not, when I normally dye my hair, I notice so much hair fall out! This time, there was a third less hair fall while I dyed my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using Amla, I would always run my fingers through my hair so I could catch the fallen strands. I swear, there was always 1-5 strands in my hand every time :-( After using Amla, I run my hands through my hair and there is FEWER fall out. More often than not, there are no strands in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still shed (it&#x27;s a natural process) but it has definitely decreased since I&#x27;ve used Amla! The price is so worth the try! I&#x27;m a real customer/consumer on Amazon and wanted to share my experience because hair loss is no joke. I felt like I was going bald and now I feel more confident. This has worked for me, so far. I will update my comment after several more uses in the future. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I tried the alma powder and I love the results.  After shampooing my hair, I mixed the amla powder with some olive oil as I heard that it can be drying to hair.  A applied the mixer to my scalp only and let it sit for about ten minutes as I could tell that it was still drying out my hair.  I rinsed and applied conditioner.  The result was shiney, bouncy hair as it removed the build up of product from my scalp.  After a few days I noticed less shedding and itching.  My hair looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> Mine came quickly from the seller and I use it in oils for my hair. You do have to shake it in a bottle because it settles at the bottom. It is supposed to grow and thicken hair but I use other oils too that contribute to hair growth and thickness, so I can&#x27;t truly tell if this powder makes a difference.</li>
            <li> Originally I thought this was indigo powder but mixed this with the other powder I had this is good for the hair and does slightly make the hair darker.</li>
            <li> Amla is Indian gooseberry. It can be used as a hair conditioner.  It reduces shedding hair ,and can be used as a natural astringent for the skin .</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product after reading all the positive reviews. I have only used the product once however this is what I think thus far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;2. the smell is not unpleasant nor is it completely pleasant however the scent is mild so once its on your hair you don&#x27;t smell. Also, once I washed it off it did not leave a scent deposit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for thickening and strengthening my hair  and helping in hair fall I&#x27;ll have to wait and see.</li>
            <li> not wasting time telling why but it&#x27;s messy dirt with twigs that did not do anything  that what reviewers claims that it does.</li>
            <li> We have been using for our hair care. I have nothing to say anything better than this items works really well and delivers the results.</li>
            <li> Soften, shiny hair!! Love Amla!</li>
            <li> I have tried this treatment three times and I have found that it works best by simply mixing with water. On my first application I mixed with castor oil and conditioner, but the second time I used with just water and my curls were revitalized. My hair seem stronger with each application and I have seen a inch of growth within one month. I am a African American women with 3 c hair in the crown of my head and 4a hair on sides. I naturally have super thick hair and this had no trouble penetrating the shaft of my hair. I would recommend and definitely order more than one at a time. Super buy for your buck.</li>
            <li> I mixed this product with henna. After using - my hair was nice and healthy looking! It is awesome and I will DEFINITELY BE PURCHASING IT AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I used henna about 20+ years ago.  It was a great natural conditioner. THis version was difficult to apply. Maybe because i needed to apply more water.  I liked that it rinsed clear and covered my gray, somewhat.  I only used a small portion, so I will be applying in about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be difficult to wash out, but it wasn&#x27;t.  I added a couple of tablespoons of my favorite conditioner and water.  Left in my hair for about 30-45 minutes.  My hair was soft and shining after two washes.  I will definitely add this to my regular routine.</li>
            <li> Great for conditioning the hair. Smell is bareable. Hair comes out felling dry but you have to use your regular conditioner to soften hair.</li>
            <li> Got this much faster than I thought at a great price.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet so I don&#x27;t know if it works as it says but I&#x27;m excited to see!</li>
            <li> I mix it with conditioner or sometimes oil.  It&#x27;s not softening or moisturizing (at least in terms of how my hair feels), its more strengthening in a way that I like.  I do it before shampooing, which I recommend because its (1) not super easy to get out and (2) doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling soft so I like to use a real conditioner after shampooing it out.  I use it like every 2 weeks or so.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on some You Tube videos regarding use as a hair growth aide...I love how it makes my hair feel after two uses!  It&#x27;s hard to tell if it helps with growth, I will have to re-review in a few more months for that.  However, based on what I know so far, I like it!</li>
            <li> My hair is badly damage and just started using this product 2 weeks now with my deep conditioner routine. I got to say my hair is already showing a half of inch in growth and it made my hair extremely soft. I&#x27;m impressed by how fast my hair is growing this is my miracle.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really hard to wash all those particles of grinding pits??? I don&#x27;t know but it is a hassle to clean all that from your hair, I rather to use another product which could give me good results without the aftermath headache of cleaning my hair again and again all over just to wash all that \\&quot;sand\\&quot;. To be honest I didn&#x27;t see much, I&#x27;ve used as the instructions indicate it on the box and even left it on my hair for a longer period of time with little or not significant results, won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended. I was inspired by Krissu&#x27;s and others&#x27; reviews, and bought Amla, Brahmi, and Kalpi, which I have used 3 times a week for 4 weeks. My hair, which had been quite dull and dry, developed a lovely sheen and became very silky right away! I have very fine graying, light brown hair. I do want to mention that although I did not prepare the Kalpi powder in a metal/cast iron container, I found that my hair has in fact lost its gray since using it. So if you wish to keep your gray (as I do) I recommend skipping the Kalpi, to be on the safe side. However, if you&#x27;re interested in restoring your hair to your original color, the Kalpi seems to be a healthy and natural approach to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Krissu recommended, I prepared a paste of the powders and a conditioner, to which I added oil. (I had some leftover pure Castor oil, so that&#x27;s what I used.) After coating my scalp and extending the paste to the roots, I ran water over a bandana, lightly squeezed it out, and wrapped it around my hair 1940&#x27;s style (Think Lucille Ball in I Love Lucy on housecleaning day) Topping that with a shower cap keeps the paste moist, which I&#x27;m guessing is useful. I leave it on as long as possible, sometimes overnight. The difference in Krissu&#x27;s mother&#x27;s experience and mine re whether the Kalpi imparts a darker tone may be due to the length of time I left it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s a mess to wash out, and if you have an old fiberglass tub, it can be hard to scrub the stain from it. So I now rinse my hair out in our stainless steel sink. I sometimes use a paste of baking soda and water for the last shampoo - it&#x27;s economical, gets the oil out and also promotes silky hair. I then follow with a rinse of 1T vinegar and 2 cups water, or nettle tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m interested to learn whether this mixture stimulates growth of new hair. I&#x27;ll report back in a few months. Sounds like results vary, depending on what triggers hair loss in the first place.</li>
