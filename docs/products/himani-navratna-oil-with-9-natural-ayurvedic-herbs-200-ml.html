            <li>Great price for such a great product!</li>
            <li>I bought it originally as a face wash, and it wasnt that great..</li>
            <li>True some may not like the scent, but it works great.</li>
            <li>and it very very strong scented oil</li>
            <li>Navratna oil is mild and yet very effective.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell,but it&#x27;s very good oil to calm you down,stress free.</li>
            <li>It smells more like candle wax.</li>

            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to use it again :)</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this hair oil</li>
            <li>and I love the products.</li>
            <li>I love the cooling effect when it touch the scalp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t mind the smell and he likes this smell better than Neem oil</li>
            <li>Ahhh love this stuff.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll update this when I&#x27;ve used the product longer (which is why the 4 stars - if it does what I hope, 5 stars! :) )</li>
            <li>Smells lovely and provides a cooling menthol feeling.</li>
            <li>Good smell, fresh hair.</li>
            <li>For those people who are over whelmed with life or too much bills to pay, this oil is definitely good to use to keep you going with your life.</li>
            <li>but it is strong so this may be a factor in your decision as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, not willing to give up, because even though my hair didn&#x27;t feel nice, my scalp felt great</li>
            <li>The smell is fine to me...</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff no longer need so much pain patches and pills just like a liquid message</li>
            <li>I actually really enjoy the smell as well.</li>
            <li>and she said this product was great for facial cleansing (if you&#x27;re doing the oil method).</li>
            <li>Navratna oil has a super strong scent</li>
            <li>I originally bought this from the suggestion of Organic Olivia for washing my face to improve acne.</li>
            <li>This is a MUST if you are using shapley&#x27;s original mtg.  </li>
            <li>Hair very good shine after it, soft and clear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s feels good when I massage it on my back and in my scalp.</li>
            <li>(kind of reminds me of an old person from my childhood) .</li>
            <li>Himani Navratna scent reminds me mildly of a mentholated cherry cough drop.  </li>
            <li>Great to apply before lying down on an infrared heating pad.</li>
            <li>This oil has a strong herbal smell but it works very well at growing hair.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves this, I am not crazy about the smell.  </li>
            <li>and I liked sleeping with the scent on my head as it did help me feel especially relaxed.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>but I would never put it on right before I was going to be socializing.</li>
            <li>if you apply it directly on scalp, i recommend you don&#x27;t stimulate your scalp with it during day time, it make one little sleepy,  but it is very good for message and head anxiety management</li>
            <li>The smell is ten times better than bengay</li>
            <li>My face feels fresh and soft and still cool and tingly.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more for myself regardless of the smell.</li>
            <li>It is very cooling to the skin (it has a &amp;#34;Vick&#x27;s&amp;#34; feel to it--- do not get it in your eyes it hurts!).</li>
            <li>have stated (only lavender does that for me) and it does have a calming effect like a more relaxing type than a sleeping type.</li>
            <li>but I will say, it leaves my face feeling smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>A very multi-functional oil!</li>
            <li>It cools my scalp and gives me a peaceful night rest.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about it being a stress reliever, but I will say that I sometimes apply it twice a day because it is so pleasant.</li>
            <li>This would also be great for hair/scalp massage and conditioning or tense muscles.</li>
            <li>I had a pretty clear forehead which quickly turned to being covered in acne bumps.</li>
            <li>Products were packed well, everything seems to be very well, thanks!</li>
            <li>Kind of a mix between different incense (fresh linen sort of and like nag champa) and tiger balm or something similar.</li>
            <li>If you are able to use it on your forehead or temples without breaking out, it really does calm you down and help you get sleepy and fall asleep.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very soothing.</li>
            <li>fast delivery</li>
            <li>Very affordable&lt;br /&gt;and shipped</li>
            <li>as an overnight hair and scalp treatment oil, which makes my hair feel very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This helps me so much with my migraines..</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It has a cooling effect, and it absorbs really well.</li>
            <li>I could really see it offending people.</li>
            <li>and it feels very cooling to the scalp</li>
            <li>My husband said that he did not feel much of a cooling effect and that the smell reminded him of the men&#x27;s room at a truck stop.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to like this, but the smell was just too much for me.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very acneic and oily</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower while there is steam so it really seeps into my skin</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very relaxing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing and non-irritating.  </li>
            <li>Some my find the scent a little off-putting at first, but you get used to it very quickly and, like myself, may actually come to enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li>I love the tingle it gives, smells slightly but the smell fades fast.</li>
            <li>The feel, smell, and look of it also reminds me mildly of transmission fluid.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Normally, I use [[ASIN:B00I7DUQZQ</li>
            <li>It went in the trash because it wasn&#x27;t worth the cost of sending it back.</li>
            <li>I put it in my husbands hair because his hair is becoming thinner at the hair line (frontal part or front half of his hair) and it is noticeably working (as an growth)</li>
            <li>so I was hesitant to put more oil on my face, but this stuff cleared up my skin in just a few days!</li>
            <li>I first discovered this oil at a local East Indian grocery store.  </li>
            <li>Nice oil,  it&#x27;s red in color, the odor is a bit hard to overcome.</li>
            <li>It has taken awhile of not using the products for it to clear up.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>Darshana Natural Indian Hair Oil (6 fl oz.)]]</li>
            <li>Well rested, invigorated scalp and soft hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I continued using it for nearly 2 weeks just to see if my skin needed to acclimate</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It smells like a porter potty to me or some kind of nasty cologne from a 3rd world country rofl Idon&#x27;t</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other reviews are correct that it does have a strong smell that is difficult to get used to at first</li>
            <li>Sorry but other than that it is a great product.</li>
            <li>I used to use noxzema because I love the tingliness of it, but gave recently been using the OCM method which has helped slightly but not much.</li>
            <li>The next morning when I wash my hair, my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far (I just received it in the mail)</li>
            <li>did like that it has a cooling effect, similar to icy hot</li>
            <li>Find my other review under shapleys original mtg where I provide how i use this mix plus some other stuff on my scalp</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t understand that this is a tingling oil (similar feel to Icy Hot or a topical muscle pain reliever in my opinion)</li>
            <li>I apply it regularly to the achy areas and sometimes mix it with other topical products like tiger balm or cannabis balm if I need a  little more punch.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 2 weeks and have noticed small hairs growing on top of my forehead (where I have less hair).</li>

            <li> My husband said that he did not feel much of a cooling effect and that the smell reminded him of the men&#x27;s room at a truck stop.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to like this, but the smell was just too much for me.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very acneic and oily</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower while there is steam so it really seeps into my skin</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very relaxing.</li>

            <li> Some my find the scent a little off-putting at first, but you get used to it very quickly and, like myself, may actually come to enjoy it very much.</li>
            <li> I love the tingle it gives, smells slightly but the smell fades fast.</li>

            <li> br /&gt;It smells like a porter potty to me or some kind of nasty cologne from a 3rd world country rofl Idon&#x27;t</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other reviews are correct that it does have a strong smell that is difficult to get used to at first</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like it a lot! It&#x27;s feels good when I massage it on my back and in my scalp.Almost a lot of people say that this oil smells really bad, I disagree. It smells more like candle wax.I actually love the smell of that oil so I don&#x27;t see what the big deal is.</li>
            <li> Himani Navratna scent reminds me mildly of a mentholated cherry cough drop.  The feel, smell, and look of it also reminds me mildly of transmission fluid.</li>
            <li> I was given this product and have used it with great luck on my migraines. Put it on my scalp and massage in at onset of migraine, migraine is gone within 15 minutes! True some may not like the scent, but it works great. It definitely proven itself to me. The smell is ten times better than bengay so i have used it for body aches as well. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, I hope they keep it around!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this, I am not crazy about the smell.  He says it works great to shave his head with.</li>
            <li> Perfect! I moved to NYC in August (from the Sierra Nevada area) and during this time my skin has broken out like crazy (never did before moving here). I used to use noxzema because I love the tingliness of it, but gave recently been using the OCM method which has helped slightly but not much. I just received this and washed my face with it a few minutes ago and I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s very refreshing smelling... Kind of a mix between different incense (fresh linen sort of and like nag champa) and tiger balm or something similar. My face feels fresh and soft and still cool and tingly. It&#x27;s so relaxing. Can&#x27;t wait to use it again :)</li>
            <li> Bought this oil after reading someone&#x27;s blog based on the oil cleansing method. This oil has cleared my skin dramatically in two days! I don&#x27;t use any follow up moisturizers afterwards. My skin is moisturizer and looks healthy again! I hope it works this well during the spring/summer. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me I actually like it, it&#x27;s very soothing. I rub it in to my skin for about a minute and then hop in the shower, so that the steam can open my pores. Boy do I feel a tingling sensation on my face and it feels great! Then I wipe my face off with a damp wash rag, pat my face with cold water to close my pores and that&#x27;s it! Try it!!    I also want to add that I just used it for a sore spot I had on my side and its ceasing the pain! I can&#x27;t believe it! I need to stock up on this oil!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this hair oil and it&#x27;s made with lots of ayurvedic herbs. I have really dry hair and a small amount worked in after a shower leaves my hair supple and silky. You only need a little after towel drying your hair and just a little goes a long way. The price is really good too.</li>
            <li> This oil has a strong herbal smell but it works very well at growing hair. I have thinning hair and I apply this product on my scalp before bed and let it &amp;#34;marinate&amp;#34; overnight. The next morning when I wash my hair, my hair is soft and shiny. I only wash my hair about 3-4 times a week and I always use this oil. I have been using it for about 2 weeks and have noticed small hairs growing on top of my forehead (where I have less hair). AMAZING!! I have tried different products like Rogaine but they don&#x27;t work this well and cost way more! I am very happy with this product and will continue to use it. I only wish I would have started using this product when I was 18. Lol.</li>
            <li> I bought this because Olivia from organicolovia.com uses it to wash her face with. It made my face burn, but I have been rubbing it into my legs when they get itchy with razor burn and I noticed I ddon&#x27;t get bit by mosquitoes when it&#x27;s on!  So I&#x27;m using it to repel mosquitoes now😄 oh and it came in two small bottles instead of one large bottle, which I didn&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
            <li> helped with my dry hair</li>
            <li> fast delivery and I love the products.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff no longer need so much pain patches and pills just like a liquid message</li>
            <li> The delivery was on time. Products were packed well, everything seems to be very well, thanks!</li>
            <li> I actually like the smell and after a very short while the scent fades.&lt;br /&gt;The oil has a great quality to it. Leaves my hair feeling thick.&lt;br /&gt;You definitely don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it and it&#x27;s all natural. Very affordable&lt;br /&gt;and shipped right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just not sure it will do all they claim it will as far as regrow hair but it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;too soon to tell after just about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on recommendation from and friend. I was a little put off by the smell for something that goes in my hair, because I&#x27;m used to using products that smell that way for achey muscles. I applied it to my hair before bed, as suggested and found that my hair felt very dry upon rinsing, which is the opposite of what I expected. Normally, I use [[ASIN:B00I7DUQZQ Darshana Natural Indian Hair Oil (6 fl oz.)]] as an overnight hair and scalp treatment oil, which makes my hair feel very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, not willing to give up, because even though my hair didn&#x27;t feel nice, my scalp felt great and I liked sleeping with the scent on my head as it did help me feel especially relaxed. The next time I tried it I used a plastic dropper [[ASIN:B005IQTSE0 Plastic Transfer Pipettes 3ml, Gradulated, Pack of 100]] to apply some oil directly to my scalp, then I used my usual oil for the length of my hair. Well rested, invigorated scalp and soft hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad to have found this blend in sesame oil because others I&#x27;ve seen are in a mineral oil base. Will continue to use on my scalp and will keep it in mind for aching muscles as well.</li>
            <li> Himani Navratna oil is good to make your shinier, and softer, it made of combined many good oils for hair and skin,  it also has calming affect on senses, if you apply it directly on scalp, i recommend you don&#x27;t stimulate your scalp with it during day time, it make one little sleepy,  but it is very good for message and head anxiety management</li>
            <li> Gross smell. Extremely thick and oily with a motor oil consistency. No way could I see rubbing in hair as it would be too heavy. Chucking this one up to a bad purchase made on impulse.</li>
            <li> Bought it on a whim. Now, use it all the time and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Very bad experience with the oils, made my skin breakout (rashes, itching and burning) within a week of using oils.</li>
            <li> Has a smell that may bother some but otherwise extremely good for ailments and body aches, Headaches and sleeplessness</li>
            <li> This helps me so much with my migraines.. It relaxes me at night. Helps with hair growth .... I love this!!!! My mom and my sister also use it now</li>
            <li> It is all in one oil for me. I use it on my hair. I love the cooling effect when it touch the scalp.&lt;br /&gt; I use it for massage and apply on wound.  If you don&#x27;t like the smell It is culture problem .all the Indian like the smell, I don&#x27;t expect the chinese to like the smell. They don&#x27;t use to this kind of smell. In India, there are million who like the smell and use it. It is blessing that this item come to USA market. learn to appreciate it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell,but it&#x27;s very good oil to calm you down,stress free. I have a family member who was paralyzed one side of his face and he has been told by the doctor that it will take six months to get heal. I gave him massage three times with the oil and he was healed. I will definitely buy more for myself regardless of the smell. For those people who are over whelmed with life or too much bills to pay, this oil is definitely good to use to keep you going with your life. Thanks</li>
            <li> I originally bought this from the suggestion of Organic Olivia for washing my face to improve acne. It didn&#x27;t work for me for acne, it made it worse, unfortunately. I had a pretty clear forehead which quickly turned to being covered in acne bumps. I continued using it for nearly 2 weeks just to see if my skin needed to acclimate but it did not. It has taken awhile of not using the products for it to clear up. In the product&#x27;s defense, it seems like my skin doesn&#x27;t respond well to any oil treatments.&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews are correct that it does have a strong smell that is difficult to get used to at first but I eventually did. It is a heavy menthol smell, with an undertone of ammonia.&lt;br /&gt;I did like that it has a cooling effect, similar to icy hot and it definitely calms the muscles of wherever you put it. So I will still be using the product, but as a muscle relaxer and not on my face. If you are able to use it on your forehead or temples without breaking out, it really does calm you down and help you get sleepy and fall asleep. So I did like that part of it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for your skin hair everywhere. You can feel the softness in your skin and freshness because of it&#x27;s cooling effect. I absolutely love it and will continue using it for life! Have one to my mom y sisters, they also loved it. My mom is loosing her hair and because of Amla in it, it&#x27;s working great for her hair too.</li>
            <li> Nice oil,  it&#x27;s red in color, the odor is a bit hard to overcome. (kind of reminds me of an old person from my childhood) . It has a cooling effect, and it absorbs really well. I&#x27;m still experimenting with it.</li>
            <li> I did not use this product as a hair growth oil, but did use it on my skin and it was great.  It has a nice cooling effect and I actually really liked the smell.  It&#x27;s kind of like roses.</li>
            <li> Nice! But I found it cheaper at my local store than what I paid for it online.</li>
            <li> Well the smell is definitely funky. I bought it originally as a face wash, and it wasnt that great.. Until i realized how great it is for pain!!! Beats taking pain killers that stress the liver. I had a headache, put some oil on my temples and forehead and it was gone! So awesome</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for the oil cleansing method (using oil instead of face wash) as it contains a variety of oils with antifungal properties. It also has a nice cooling sensation which is great for putting on a sore neck and shoulders. The smell may be a little funky for some people, but I like it! Great price for such a great product!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling minty and it tingles for a few minutes. The smell is fine to me...u get over it. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is very heavily scented. I don&#x27;t mind the smell but I would never put it on right before I was going to be socializing. I could really see it offending people. lol But I use this to oil cleanse my face. It works great and has helped my acne a lot! It is very cooling to the skin (it has a &amp;#34;Vick&#x27;s&amp;#34; feel to it--- do not get it in your eyes it hurts!). I only oil cleanse once a day at night because this can make my skin a little red! But since using this, my previously oily skin is now normal... no dryness... no oiliness. Just to prevent my skin overcompensating oil production, I put one drop of sunflower oil on my face!</li>
            <li> This oil is absolutely amazing! I have seen a difference with one use on my face and I&#x27;m using it on my husband&#x27;s head to promote hair growth. If within the next few weeks the hair grows I will definitely write an updated review!</li>
            <li> Unlike others who use if for their hair, I actually apply it to my scalp after I shave my head. I find the cooling sensation to be a wonderful follow up to the shave and the menthol helps me breath easier all around. I&#x27;m not sure about it being a stress reliever, but I will say that I sometimes apply it twice a day because it is so pleasant. Some my find the scent a little off-putting at first, but you get used to it very quickly and, like myself, may actually come to enjoy it very much. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a MUST if you are using shapley&#x27;s original mtg.  Mix this oil with equal amounts of mtg in an applicator bottle and this knocks out the smell.  You will only smell this oil which smells like hair grease.  Find my other review under shapleys original mtg where I provide how i use this mix plus some other stuff on my scalp</li>
            <li> Very good condition and it feels very cooling to the scalp and it very very strong scented oil so I will recommend u to put 1/2 teaspoon on the scalp Or else you going be smelling like pine-Sol</li>
            <li> The only thug that has helped my skin&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for my husband&#x27;s head massages.  Wanted something that was cooling and relaxing.  I use a lot of Ayurvedic Indian products and know that some have smells that Westerners may not like, this is definitely one of them.  My husband said that he did not feel much of a cooling effect and that the smell reminded him of the men&#x27;s room at a truck stop.  Nuff said!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this, but the smell was just too much for me.  Someone on here said it smelled like a Gas Station bathroom; that about sums it up.  I wish I would have listened but everyone has different ideas on &amp;#34;fragrances&amp;#34; so I had to try it.  It went in the trash because it wasn&#x27;t worth the cost of sending it back.</li>
            <li> Wonderful massage oil for people with nagging headaches.... Rub intensely, and the pain vaporizing effect kicks in after a few minutes....</li>
            <li> Great product for cleaning your face!</li>
            <li> Navratna oil has a super strong scent and I did not like it at all.  It has no lightness to the fragrance, it is heavy and overly spicy.  I could not use the product.  The fragrance gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it but it works! I gave it 4 stars because it works lol&lt;br /&gt;It smells like a porter potty to me or some kind of nasty cologne from a 3rd world country rofl Idon&#x27;t want to be mean but it does! My husband doesn&#x27;t mind the smell and he likes this smell better than Neem oil but I beg to differ!&lt;br /&gt;It does have a cooling effect and it doesn&#x27;t make me feel sleepy like others have stated (only lavender does that for me) and it does have a calming effect like a more relaxing type than a sleeping type. I have kept it in my hair all day and even over night some times. I use it 1-2 times a week but now once because the smell, sometimes I just can muster it and sometimes I just refuse. I put it in my husbands hair because his hair is becoming thinner at the hair line (frontal part or front half of his hair) and it is noticeably working (as an growth) so that is a plus. If it were truly up to me, I would give it 3 stars cuz the smell but it works so just plug your nose LOL the smell lingers btw! I would def not go out with this stuff on me!</li>
            <li> I use this as part of my deep conditioning routine. I love the tingle it gives, smells slightly but the smell fades fast.</li>
            <li> The BEST.. I use this to wash my face--it does wonders.</li>
            <li> Ahhh love this stuff. I bought after reading it on Organic Olivia&#x27;s blog for the oil cleansing method. My skin is very acneic and oily so I was hesitant to put more oil on my face, but this stuff cleared up my skin in just a few days! I use it in the shower while there is steam so it really seeps into my skin and it&#x27;s very relaxing. I actually really enjoy the smell as well. Also great for muscle relaxation, head aches, etc but please don&#x27;t buy it for hair growth!! Hair growth doesn&#x27;t work that way. Sorry but other than that it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Great for washing my face!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the recommendation of Organic Olivia (her website) because I&#x27;ve been cleaning my face with oil for a couple of months now and she said this product was great for facial cleansing (if you&#x27;re doing the oil method). I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far (I just received it in the mail) but I will say, it leaves my face feeling smooth and soft. However, I didn&#x27;t understand that this is a tingling oil (similar feel to Icy Hot or a topical muscle pain reliever in my opinion) so DO NOT get this in  your eyes. Holy cow - I did that by accident and tingling eyeballs is not a great feeling. I like the scent but it is strong so this may be a factor in your decision as well. It smells a little -- pine-y and clove-y? It&#x27;s a mix of oil and herbs, so that&#x27;s where the scent comes from.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also hoping this helps my acne/scars clear up a little bit so I&#x27;ll update this when I&#x27;ve used the product longer (which is why the 4 stars - if it does what I hope, 5 stars! :) ) This would also be great for hair/scalp massage and conditioning or tense muscles. A very multi-functional oil!</li>
            <li> I first discovered this oil at a local East Indian grocery store.  I have bulging discs and chronic back pain.  Navratna oil is mild and yet very effective.  It&#x27;s very soothing and non-irritating.  I apply it regularly to the achy areas and sometimes mix it with other topical products like tiger balm or cannabis balm if I need a  little more punch.  Great to apply before lying down on an infrared heating pad.</li>
            <li> it helps me with my migraine headaches. It cools my scalp and gives me a peaceful night rest. When you rub it into your scalp and hair, watch out for the pillow covers, almost always need to be washed next day. If you have a partner, tell them ahead of time, f not the smell will be repulsive and you might also have relationship issues.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely and provides a cooling menthol feeling. I&#x27;ll be buying this product a lot.</li>
            <li> Good smell, fresh hair. Stimulate growth! Hair very good shine after it, soft and clear. Like!! Use 1 time in a week about 1-2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
