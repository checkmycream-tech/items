            <li>Scents have the capability to help relax us and honestly, this perfume does just that for me.</li>
            <li>I wear this during the warm months of the year and always receive compliments.  </li>
            <li>I get asked all the time what kind of perfume I&#x27;m wearing and get complemented on how nice it smells.  </li>

            <li>I love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent.  </li>
            <li>when I finished it I turned to Amazon for a more affordable option.</li>
            <li>I just recently re-purchased this perfume from Amazon and got an awesome surprise.</li>
            <li>and yes it&#x27;s authentic in</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for a while and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this perfume.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it is not a scent I smell on everyone I pass by.  </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>but I really love the scent.  </li>
            <li>Love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong, just a nice, clean scent.  </li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance and great price, it is only $10 more for a 3.4 oz bottle compared to 1.7 oz bottle.</li>
            <li>Pure is ok but doesn&#x27;t smell as good as Pure with Verbena.</li>
            <li>Plus, free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Its a cheap perfume that gives you a headache.</li>
            <li>Great price in comparison with local department stores.</li>
            <li>It smells very fresh.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived within days of ordering -- it was in original packaging, unadulterated with working sprayer --</li>
            <li>, I thought of Amazon first as a cheap way to replace my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>And, as usual, Amazon had the best price anywhere, and it was shipped immediately.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s original packaging.</li>
            <li>The scent is faintly sweet and delightfully clean.</li>
            <li>, I guess I&#x27;m rating DKNY Pure as just ok.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I have ordered  Pure DKNY.</li>
            <li>Love this scent but it seems to fade pretty quickly during the day even though my clothes still smell good the next day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years and was super excited to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Its fragance is very fresh and sexy at the same time, it is smooth fragance, it is perfect to use everyday and avery hour.</li>
            <li>Pure DKNY Verbena scent can be described as a fresh, clean, slightly floral scent which is simply delightful.  </li>
            <li>Clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Based upon how quickly the scent fades, I can&#x27;t justify the cost.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to women who love spring essence.</li>
            <li>I originally had a sample that I completely fell in love with.</li>
            <li>Of course, this is my new favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This has now become my 2nd favorite perfume!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s appropriate for the office, comfortable enough to wear at home and even out.</li>
            <li>It smells like a fresh herb garden after a rain.  </li>
            <li>I got this right away</li>
            <li>Right out of the box though, my nose wrinkled a bit.</li>
            <li>I would caution you to be sure the correct product was sent prior to opening it all</li>
            <li>Even at Ulta and my go-to department store, I could not find this exact bottle.  </li>
            <li>Goes fast!</li>
            <li>purchased my first bottle at Sephora,</li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Not sure how long it stays on since I&#x27;m so used to the smell now but its great!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>and I wanted a fresh, new scent just to change things up</li>
            <li>Thought I was getting only the perfume, but was surprised with full size perfume, body wash, and body cream!!</li>
            <li>I had been using DKNY Pure from a department store forever and when it ran out</li>
            <li>the Pure DKNY Verbena and Pure DKNY Vanilla were among them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Would I buy the Pure DKNY Verbena scent again?  </li>
            <li>The bottle of Pure when sprayed had no scent it smelled like alcohol when put on.</li>
            <li>This bottle of perfume is absolutely gigantic...</li>
            <li>This came with a shower gel and a cream (which I really didn&#x27;t know I was getting as a boxed set as I thought I had just ordered the cologne).  </li>
            <li>I really like this perfum.</li>
            <li>I am really</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance and am now looking to order the body wash and other items in this scent.</li>
            <li>Apparently they do not sell or widely market this product any more -- I had a little sample in my jumble drawer and tried it one day while cleaning it out -- really liked the scent and wanted to try using it.  </li>
            <li>Fresh, clean, aquatic, calm, green and simple scent.</li>
            <li>I received the item just a few days after ordering it- even better.  </li>
            <li>I love scents with citrus, green elements and things that remind me of the freshness of spring and summer.  </li>
            <li>It is very soft and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>If you only want the best,buy this,thank you so much !</li>
            <li>After opening, I realized that the word Verbena was not included on the bottle and the regular Pure was sent in error.</li>
            <li>This scent smells like an early morning to afternoon perfume for me.</li>
            <li>If I know I&#x27;m going to have a harsh or long day I put this on as a nice personal pick-me-up.</li>
            <li>I love the subtle hints of verbena..</li>
            <li>It makes me feel fresh and polished, yet is not overwhelming.</li>

            <li> I was a bit skeptical that it was the real deal given the price, but it is the real thing indeed!</li>
            <li> either this bottle will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell the same as the bottle previously purchased at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> A couple of hours after applying, it is hard to find the scent even when sniffing directly on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The problem is, it fades way too soon for the money spent on it.  </li>
            <li> Not worth to buy, last less than 2 hrs</li>
            <li> Whole bottle unable to use.</li>
            <li> The price was half of what I would have paid anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> As other reviews mentioned - this time around I got the shower gel and body lotion as well!!</li>
            <li> a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had received a few scent samples in a mailing and</li>
            <li> It has become my go to scent for everyday.</li>
            <li> I  wear a number of different fragrances- Jo Malone colognes, L&#x27;occitane  perfumes, - and I ordered this blind based on all the rave reviews I received from  a ton of other women about &amp;#34;A Drop of Verbena&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> and this item is a total fake.</li>

            <li> Wife&#x27;s favorite, fair price, great quick delivery.  Will do again for sure.</li>
            <li> I got this right away and I seriously love the way this smells, it&#x27;s so summer!!!! what a perfect way to start :)</li>
            <li> This bottle of perfume is absolutely gigantic...but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a good thing. I had been using DKNY Pure from a department store forever and when it ran out, I thought of Amazon first as a cheap way to replace my favorite scent. This came with a shower gel and a cream (which I really didn&#x27;t know I was getting as a boxed set as I thought I had just ordered the cologne).  Right out of the box though, my nose wrinkled a bit. Not that the scent is bad...it just doesn&#x27;t smell like what I was used to.  I still use it, but not as often as I would if it was like the stuff from the department store.</li>
            <li> This product arrived as part of a gift set.I did not pay close attention to the label at that time. After opening, I realized that the word Verbena was not included on the bottle and the regular Pure was sent in error. Pure is ok but doesn&#x27;t smell as good as Pure with Verbena. I would caution you to be sure the correct product was sent prior to opening it all up.&lt;br /&gt;So, I guess I&#x27;m rating DKNY Pure as just ok.</li>
            <li> Not worth to buy, last less than 2 hrs</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell the same as the bottle previously purchased at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that this is the first expensive perfume I have purchased in years.  My husband and I are celebrating our 10th anniversary this summer and I wanted a fresh, new scent just to change things up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had received a few scent samples in a mailing and the Pure DKNY Verbena and Pure DKNY Vanilla were among them.  I loved both, but how to decide?  The vanilla reminded me of a scent I used 30 years ago, so I opted for the verbena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pure DKNY Verbena scent can be described as a fresh, clean, slightly floral scent which is simply delightful.  The problem is, it fades way too soon for the money spent on it.  A couple of hours after applying, it is hard to find the scent even when sniffing directly on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy the Pure DKNY Verbena scent again?  No. Based upon how quickly the scent fades, I can&#x27;t justify the cost.  I wish I could have found this scent in a local store before buying.  Then I could have discovered this fact prior to making the investment.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  Not too strong, just a nice, clean scent.  Wish it was easier to find.</li>
            <li> First of all the price is awesome for this product (almost 50% off what the store price is). I received the item just a few days after ordering it- even better.  I love this fragrance and am now looking to order the body wash and other items in this scent.</li>
            <li> I really like this perfum. Its fragance is very fresh and sexy at the same time, it is smooth fragance, it is perfect to use everyday and avery hour.</li>
            <li> I went to a retail store looking for this, they didn&#x27;t have it. Decided to try Amazon an they had it at a great price and it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> This is my daughters favorite! I was thankful to find it at a great price and received it promptly. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  It smells very fresh.  It always reminds me of spring and laundry.  It&#x27;s very light, perfect for summer.</li>
            <li> Apparently they do not sell or widely market this product any more -- I had a little sample in my jumble drawer and tried it one day while cleaning it out -- really liked the scent and wanted to try using it.  Even at Ulta and my go-to department store, I could not find this exact bottle.  Then Amazon dawned on me -- thank goodness.  Of course, this is my new favorite fragrance.  The product arrived within days of ordering -- it was in original packaging, unadulterated with working sprayer -- The price was half of what I would have paid anywhere else.  Plus, free shipping.  The scent is perfect for summer or hot weather -- I could not be happier with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Smells great on,lasting scent.Clean and fresh. Get compliments whenever I wear it. This scent smells like an early morning to afternoon perfume for me.</li>
            <li> Smelled this in a catalog and loved it, the price is almost every time for everything I want better here then anywhere else. You don&#x27;t need to over spray either this bottle will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance and great price, it is only $10 more for a 3.4 oz bottle compared to 1.7 oz bottle. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love this scent but it seems to fade pretty quickly during the day even though my clothes still smell good the next day.</li>
            <li> Bought this and tried it on. After 2 sprays it looks like I have used it for a week already. Goes fast! But it smells good</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this item. I know pureDKNY and this item is a total fake. Its a cheap perfume that gives you a headache. Very very disappointing....</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this!!  What a clean, fresh beautiful fragrance!  I am really&lt;br /&gt;impressed.  I  wear a number of different fragrances- Jo Malone colognes, L&#x27;occitane  perfumes, - and I ordered this blind based on all the rave reviews I received from  a ton of other women about &amp;#34;A Drop of Verbena&amp;#34;.  What  a wonderful find!  And, as usual, Amazon had the best price anywhere, and it was shipped immediately.  Gorgeous fragrance!</li>
            <li> i get lots of compliments when i wear this one.  scent lasts too.  also try prada yellow diamonds if you like this one.</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean, aquatic, calm, green and simple scent. I originally had a sample that I completely fell in love with. Scents have the capability to help relax us and honestly, this perfume does just that for me. If I know I&#x27;m going to have a harsh or long day I put this on as a nice personal pick-me-up. It&#x27;s appropriate for the office, comfortable enough to wear at home and even out. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments from my sweetie and others as well.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased my first bottle at Sephora, when I finished it I turned to Amazon for a more affordable option. I just recently re-purchased this perfume from Amazon and got an awesome surprise. As other reviews mentioned - this time around I got the shower gel and body lotion as well!! Could not be happier with my purchase and yes it&#x27;s authentic in it&#x27;s original packaging.</li>
            <li> The bottle of Pure when sprayed had no scent it smelled like alcohol when put on. Whole bottle unable to use.</li>
            <li> Great light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I wear this perfume every day! I love the subtle hints of verbena.. everyone always asks me what perfume I wear! Worn it for two years now. favorite!</li>
            <li> Ahh, this became one of my favorites...!!  As soon as I begin to run out, I order another, lol. It was well packaged and delivered in great time!</li>
            <li> I cant get over how good this sm smells I was pleasantly surprized that it came with the lotion and body wash....which I didn&#x27;t expect for the price or the description. This is a great deal on a fabulous scent.</li>
            <li> This has now become my 2nd favorite perfume! (Next to Sunflower by Elizabeth Arden). The service was good. I received it very quickly!</li>
            <li> Wonderful!!! Thought I was getting only the perfume, but was surprised with full size perfume, body wash, and body cream!!</li>
            <li> Awesome price on my favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> I love everything about it ! It came with a shower gel and a body lotion,I didn&#x27;t expect that.It was a great price,fast and safe shipping.If you only want the best,buy this,thank you so much !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for a while and absolutely love it.  Not sure how long it stays on since I&#x27;m so used to the smell now but its great!</li>
            <li> Faboulous! it brings spring spirit! I am so glad that I have ordered  Pure DKNY. I highly recommend it to women who love spring essence.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years and was super excited to see it on Amazon. Got a great deal!</li>
            <li> Donna Karan pureDKNY Verbena is a lovely, light scent that is perfect for the workplace.  It makes me feel fresh and polished, yet is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments when wearing this fragrance!  Great price in comparison with local department stores. Why is there is minimum word requirement?</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical that it was the real deal given the price, but it is the real thing indeed! Great price!</li>
            <li> Bought this perfume because a friend of mine wore it and I loved it!!! I would recommend it to anyone.  My friend paid considerably more than I did--so buy it on amazon!</li>
            <li> Loved this scent for summer and spring.  I love scents with citrus, green elements and things that remind me of the freshness of spring and summer.  I wear this during the warm months of the year and always receive compliments.  I also love the fact that it is not a scent I smell on everyone I pass by.  This is a happy scent which makes me :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s birthday, it&#x27;s her favorite perfume! She has always like this fragrance, she loved her gift!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  It smells like a fresh herb garden after a rain.  I wish it was longer lasting but I really love the scent.  It has become my go to scent for everyday.</li>
            <li> The scent is faintly sweet and delightfully clean.</li>
            <li> Great scent- not too strong and not too powdery or flowery.</li>
            <li> Great price for premium cologne, also got lotion and bath soap included in the price!  Would have paid much more at any department store!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.  It is very soft and not overpowering.  I get asked all the time what kind of perfume I&#x27;m wearing and get complemented on how nice it smells.  Will definitely be ordering more.</li>
