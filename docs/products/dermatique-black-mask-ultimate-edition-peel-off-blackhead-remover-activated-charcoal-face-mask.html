            <li>My skin feels incredibly smooth now!</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks of use, I do noticed my face is brighter and more radiant.  </li>
            <li>But ever since I got the product, I&#x27;ve felt more compelled to stick to the routine and process.</li>
            <li>so I look more refreshed.</li>
            <li>, I decided to do some searching here on Amazon and was overwhelmed with so many choices.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the product and I recommend it to others to give it a try.</li>
            <li>are some most asked questions answered in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>Maybe because of the hot weather, It gave me a pleasant refreshed toning feeling that I never noticed before.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>Vitamin C Serum is becoming my favorite product on the market.</li>
            <li>My skin is now smooth and I can see my breakouts becoming more manageable and fewer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is now smooth and I can see my breakouts becoming more manageable and fewer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, my skin feels smooth and light, not oily at all!</li>
            <li>I did receive this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li>Argan oil is a great ingredient that helps with acne, irritation, and in general just makes your skin (or hair) feel more smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>The eyedropper cap makes application easy and prevents contamination of germs and bacteria.</li>
            <li>I have many sensitivities and allergies (i.e. dairy, gluten), so I needed a product with clean quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>Feels light and clean, doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue, absorbs quickly and smells nice.</li>
            <li>Part of the reason is that it smells quite nice, but the main reason is how much better my skin has been feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to use and how quickly it dries.</li>
            <li>it contains Hyaluronic Acid it helps with fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>LOVE how quickly this product absorbs with no residue once it dries.</li>
            <li>I ended up choosing Jeffen because I liked their positive message and they also included argan oil in their ingredients.</li>
            <li>my skin is so much softer and looks so much more heathy too!</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive, so I was happy to have something I could safely apply.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it worked really well in hot arid climates too!</li>
            <li>but I can tell a huge difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>think I saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li>The serum is light weight and it is not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I would suggest lightly shaking the bottle before each application to allow all of the ingredients to mix together again and settle.</li>
            <li>Feels light on the skin, refreshes the face, and skin feels softer and tighter.  </li>
            <li>you for creating something I enjoy using</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the way the it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I love the tingly and fresh feeling it gives my face.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with the product and will be using it religiously.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an effortless addition to my daily routine which is great.</li>
            <li>She says that it&#x27;s light, moisturizing, and the scent is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I’m really happy with my choice</li>
            <li>All 3 of the best skincare ingredients in one serum - definitely fits the name very well.  </li>
            <li>The shipment came in within two days and was carefully packaged in a beautiful bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have been receiving compliments on my hair, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the change in my face that people are seeing.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling fresh and RADIANT!</li>
            <li>It smells so good &amp; really is a nice little &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; in my morning routine.</li>
            <li>The packaging is also nice and speaks to the straightforward natural ingredients in this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy and the product glides on smoothly also also absorbs fairly quickly on my skin.</li>
            <li>Given that I haven&#x27;t used anything for a while, I am a clean slate for new-ness</li>
            <li>It comes as no surprise that facial serums are now becoming increasingly more popular and now are a hot commodity on the beauty circuit.</li>
            <li>I discovered Jeffen skin care at a street fair in Hayes Valley, SF, last year, and bought two jars of the</li>
            <li>when I was living in the cool climates of Toronto.</li>
            <li>I love it so much, I now plan to bring it with me everywhere</li>
            <li>Love the light and natural scent too.</li>
            <li>This stuff has more than just Vitamin C Serum in it, but it does the same job, better.  </li>
            <li>I Am Radiant was nice enough to send me a free bottle of their anti-aging serum to review.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and doesn&#x27;t linger either.</li>
            <li>She says that it soaks quickly into her skin and doesn&#x27;t leave her face feeling sticky.  </li>
            <li>It’s just nice to have something nice to see everyday.</li>
            <li>I do actually use more than recommend - more like 5-6</li>
            <li>I love that it has a thicker consistency like the argan oil that I normally use</li>
            <li>A great product that I will definitely buy again and that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I was originally attracted to this product for it&#x27;s cool looking bottle, which is covered in positive affirmations.</li>

            <li>helped keep my skin soft, moisturized, and looking healthy.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is also 98% natural &amp; 74% organic.</li>
            <li>, so I put vitamin C serum on two boils under my right arm, underarm.</li>
            <li>I use it right after my shower in the morning.</li>
            <li>The smell is relaxing and the natural ingredients are easy on my skin.</li>

            <li>Serum is nice and thick and cool when applied and leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>and I love to repeat such a positive mantra!</li>

            <li>My wife tried this product and she noticed softer skin after the first use.</li>
            <li>If you have the chance to looker younger and have healthier skin, take the chance, you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>, she has no idea where she got it in the first place.</li>
            <li>I have actually not had any more boils under my arms since I began using vitamin C serum.</li>

            <li>I would recommend this serum to absolutely everyone!</li>
            <li>My goal is hydration and it feels like I Am Radiant is absolutely supporting that desire.  </li>

            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It makes them feel super soft too !!</li>
            <li>There are some ingredients that I absolutely, positively MUST have in a facial product and when I find a product that has more than one of those ingredients, I am in beauty heaven.</li>
            <li>For a while now I&#x27;ve been using this other midnight recovery serum and it smells nice</li>
            <li>I have been receiving compliments left and right and a friend even asked me if I was using new makeup when I was makeup free!</li>
            <li>It makes me feel ready for my day ;)</li>
            <li>I’ve experienced from other products, which is a big plus living in South Florida.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m prefacing with my skin sensitivity to let others know that this serum helps keep my skin SUPER soft, like a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>never thought of using a vitamin c serum before, but had recently been hearing about its benefits from friends When I started noticing fine lines around my lips and eyes</li>
            <li>This serum really makes my face feel soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>The product is reasonable and is guaranteed to work for you.</li>
            <li>So smooth and the only face serum I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy, I even feel fresher after using.  </li>
            <li>I also really love the way it feels on my skin--lightweight, moisturizing, and absolutely no greasy feeling whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Also with moisturizers, I can&#x27;t use Aveeno or Neutrogena, I currently use Trader Joe&#x27;s moisturizer that&#x27;s scent free because otherwise, I get irritated.</li>
            <li>The serum was working really well</li>
            <li>and I really like I Am Radiant.  </li>
            <li>I really do notice a difference and see the glow.</li>
            <li>It soaks very well and does not feel sticky.</li>
            <li>smells like a whole bunch of herds.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if it was supposed to do that</li>
            <li>I love how simple the ingredients are and that they are natural.</li>
            <li>I can see a natural healthy glow to my skin only after one day of</li>
            <li>Hands down, one of the best facial products that has been keeping my face from getting dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid helps regenerate the skin and promotes collagen growth to make your skin appear more toned and tightened (in other words it fights sagging and aging).</li>
            <li>When I am on top of my routine, I regularly exfoliate with an at-home microdermabrasion machine, cleanse with an exfoliating brush and face scrub, take supplements including 100% hyaluronic acid, do regular facials, and apply Josie Maran Argan Oil twice a day.</li>
            <li>I apply my regular acne products (2% salicylic acid and 5% benzoyl peroxide), then smooth at least 2 drops of this serum on top.</li>
            <li>I Am Radiant serum a few weeks ago and am so pleased with this product, as well.</li>
            <li>My skin felt moisturized but more importantly, not sticky and greasy.</li>
            <li>For my combination skin, however, it was not the right product to use on a regular basis, as I had a bit of a breakout after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I encourage every man and woman who purchases this item to really allow the product to soak in while repeating such a positive message</li>
            <li>I tend to use the eyedropper to dispense a small amount of serum onto different areas of my face and lightly use my fingertips to smooth the serum over my skin.</li>
            <li>but I have had a chance to live with this product for a while now</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I still battle adult acne and in my two months of using the serum, it hasn&#x27;t made me break out (yay!).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only does it work with my unique skin type, I am starting to see some of my lines diminishing.</li>
            <li>My skin also does not feel as dehydrated which is a huge plus especially after a long plane ride.</li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t see much of a difference and my dry skin wouldnt go away.</li>
            <li>Everything is listed clearly on the bottle.</li>
            <li>is that it is 98% natural and 74% organic.</li>
            <li>Now, since it does use natural ingredients, these ingredients tend to separate</li>
            <li>This is a miracle cure as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and supple after about a week of usage.  </li>
            <li>It is Organic and Natural.</li>
            <li>Jeffren offers 100% MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE:</li>
            <li>I really think this one is a winner especially for the price</li>
            <li>When I use the serum I do feel Radiant, not only because I repeat this mantra, as the bottle invites, but because the serum gently hugs my skin and does not suffocate it.</li>
            <li>~it makes the natural product create a natural experience.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I am 25 years old and have oily skin.</li>
            <li>The serum has a natural fragrance, and it is not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually used it on my hands when they&#x27;ve been really cracked a couple times.</li>
            <li>Use this serum if you&#x27;re wanting soft, refreshed skin.</li>
            <li>I had a question and directly contacted them.</li>
            <li>One of the draws was knowing that everything was organic and all natural.  </li>
            <li>Love the subtle smell and feel of this serum.</li>
            <li>means that my skin care needs are unique and different from other people’s requirements.</li>
            <li>I loved that I only had to put a few drops on my fingers, then I message a little bit on my fingers and message the serum on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But this caught my eye and even if it can seem quirky, I actually like the concept of marrying my regimen with positive affirmations --</li>
            <li>I try my best to take care of my skin since I am a beauty blogger, but it can be difficult and expensive to maintain a skincare routine with all the right ingredients and products.</li>
            <li>After just a few days you will start to see a reduction in age spots, wrinkles, dark circles and much more.  </li>
            <li>It has also left my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Personally, I have sensitive combination skin and</li>
            <li>There were natural components that I could actually understand!</li>
            <li>Right now, my skin feels so soft &amp; there is no more flaking.  </li>
            <li>Since the product soaks very well, I can apply it as a regular moisturizer to help my dry skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a very sticky feel like some other products out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found a face serum with natural ingredients and actually works!</li>
            <li>but it definitely showed a major difference in my face.</li>
            <li>So far it has been working well to soften the areas of dry eczema I have.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin (slight rosacea) and I only wear Bare Minerals foundation because my skin breaks out with liquid make-ups.</li>

            <li> so I look more refreshed.</li>
            <li> , I decided to do some searching here on Amazon and was overwhelmed with so many choices.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the product and I recommend it to others to give it a try.</li>
            <li> are some most asked questions answered in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> Maybe because of the hot weather, It gave me a pleasant refreshed toning feeling that I never noticed before.</li>

            <li> Vitamin C Serum is becoming my favorite product on the market.</li>
            <li> My skin is now smooth and I can see my breakouts becoming more manageable and fewer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is now smooth and I can see my breakouts becoming more manageable and fewer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, my skin feels smooth and light, not oily at all!</li>
            <li> I did receive this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is a great ingredient that helps with acne, irritation, and in general just makes your skin (or hair) feel more smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> The eyedropper cap makes application easy and prevents contamination of germs and bacteria.</li>
            <li> I have many sensitivities and allergies (i.e. dairy, gluten), so I needed a product with clean quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> Feels light and clean, doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue, absorbs quickly and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Part of the reason is that it smells quite nice, but the main reason is how much better my skin has been feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to use and how quickly it dries.</li>
            <li> it contains Hyaluronic Acid it helps with fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> LOVE how quickly this product absorbs with no residue once it dries.</li>
            <li> I ended up choosing Jeffen because I liked their positive message and they also included argan oil in their ingredients.</li>
            <li> my skin is so much softer and looks so much more heathy too!</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive, so I was happy to have something I could safely apply.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it worked really well in hot arid climates too!</li>
            <li> but I can tell a huge difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> think I saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li> The serum is light weight and it is not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I would suggest lightly shaking the bottle before each application to allow all of the ingredients to mix together again and settle.</li>
            <li> Feels light on the skin, refreshes the face, and skin feels softer and tighter.  </li>
            <li> you for creating something I enjoy using</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the way the it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love the tingly and fresh feeling it gives my face.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with the product and will be using it religiously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an effortless addition to my daily routine which is great.</li>
            <li> She says that it&#x27;s light, moisturizing, and the scent is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I’m really happy with my choice</li>
            <li> All 3 of the best skincare ingredients in one serum - definitely fits the name very well.  </li>
            <li> The shipment came in within two days and was carefully packaged in a beautiful bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have been receiving compliments on my hair, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the change in my face that people are seeing.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling fresh and RADIANT!</li>
            <li> It smells so good &amp; really is a nice little &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; in my morning routine.</li>
            <li> The packaging is also nice and speaks to the straightforward natural ingredients in this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and the product glides on smoothly also also absorbs fairly quickly on my skin.</li>
            <li> Given that I haven&#x27;t used anything for a while, I am a clean slate for new-ness</li>
            <li> It comes as no surprise that facial serums are now becoming increasingly more popular and now are a hot commodity on the beauty circuit.</li>
            <li> I discovered Jeffen skin care at a street fair in Hayes Valley, SF, last year, and bought two jars of the</li>

            <li> I love it so much, I now plan to bring it with me everywhere</li>
            <li> Love the light and natural scent too.</li>
            <li> This stuff has more than just Vitamin C Serum in it, but it does the same job, better.  </li>
            <li> I Am Radiant was nice enough to send me a free bottle of their anti-aging serum to review.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild and doesn&#x27;t linger either.</li>
            <li> She says that it soaks quickly into her skin and doesn&#x27;t leave her face feeling sticky.  </li>
            <li> It’s just nice to have something nice to see everyday.</li>
            <li> I do actually use more than recommend - more like 5-6</li>
            <li> I love that it has a thicker consistency like the argan oil that I normally use</li>
            <li> A great product that I will definitely buy again and that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was originally attracted to this product for it&#x27;s cool looking bottle, which is covered in positive affirmations.</li>

            <li> I also am so in love with the fact that it&#x27;s organic and natural.</li>
            <li> helped keep my skin soft, moisturized, and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is also 98% natural &amp; 74% organic.</li>
            <li> , so I put vitamin C serum on two boils under my right arm, underarm.</li>
            <li> I use it right after my shower in the morning.</li>
            <li> The smell is relaxing and the natural ingredients are easy on my skin.</li>

            <li> Serum is nice and thick and cool when applied and leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> and I love to repeat such a positive mantra!</li>

            <li> Really helped me navigate what I&#x27;m suppose to do!</li>

            <li> I would recommend this serum to absolutely everyone!</li>
            <li> My goal is hydration and it feels like I Am Radiant is absolutely supporting that desire.  </li>

            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It makes them feel super soft too !!</li>
            <li> There are some ingredients that I absolutely, positively MUST have in a facial product and when I find a product that has more than one of those ingredients, I am in beauty heaven.</li>
            <li> For a while now I&#x27;ve been using this other midnight recovery serum and it smells nice</li>
            <li> I have been receiving compliments left and right and a friend even asked me if I was using new makeup when I was makeup free!</li>
            <li> It makes me feel ready for my day ;)</li>
            <li> I’ve experienced from other products, which is a big plus living in South Florida.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m prefacing with my skin sensitivity to let others know that this serum helps keep my skin SUPER soft, like a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> never thought of using a vitamin c serum before, but had recently been hearing about its benefits from friends When I started noticing fine lines around my lips and eyes</li>
            <li> This serum really makes my face feel soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> The product is reasonable and is guaranteed to work for you.</li>
            <li> So smooth and the only face serum I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy, I even feel fresher after using.  </li>
            <li> I also really love the way it feels on my skin--lightweight, moisturizing, and absolutely no greasy feeling whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Also with moisturizers, I can&#x27;t use Aveeno or Neutrogena, I currently use Trader Joe&#x27;s moisturizer that&#x27;s scent free because otherwise, I get irritated.</li>
            <li> The serum was working really well</li>
            <li> and I really like I Am Radiant.  </li>
            <li> I really do notice a difference and see the glow.</li>
            <li> It soaks very well and does not feel sticky.</li>
            <li> smells like a whole bunch of herds.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if it was supposed to do that</li>
            <li> I love how simple the ingredients are and that they are natural.</li>
            <li> I can see a natural healthy glow to my skin only after one day of</li>
            <li> Hands down, one of the best facial products that has been keeping my face from getting dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid helps regenerate the skin and promotes collagen growth to make your skin appear more toned and tightened (in other words it fights sagging and aging).</li>
            <li> When I am on top of my routine, I regularly exfoliate with an at-home microdermabrasion machine, cleanse with an exfoliating brush and face scrub, take supplements including 100% hyaluronic acid, do regular facials, and apply Josie Maran Argan Oil twice a day.</li>
            <li> I apply my regular acne products (2% salicylic acid and 5% benzoyl peroxide), then smooth at least 2 drops of this serum on top.</li>
            <li> I Am Radiant serum a few weeks ago and am so pleased with this product, as well.</li>
            <li> My skin felt moisturized but more importantly, not sticky and greasy.</li>
            <li> For my combination skin, however, it was not the right product to use on a regular basis, as I had a bit of a breakout after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I encourage every man and woman who purchases this item to really allow the product to soak in while repeating such a positive message</li>
            <li> I tend to use the eyedropper to dispense a small amount of serum onto different areas of my face and lightly use my fingertips to smooth the serum over my skin.</li>
            <li> but I have had a chance to live with this product for a while now</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I still battle adult acne and in my two months of using the serum, it hasn&#x27;t made me break out (yay!).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only does it work with my unique skin type, I am starting to see some of my lines diminishing.</li>
            <li> My skin also does not feel as dehydrated which is a huge plus especially after a long plane ride.</li>

            <li> Skin feels soft and supple after about a week of usage.  </li>
            <li> It is Organic and Natural.</li>

            <li> I am 25 years old and have oily skin.</li>
            <li> The serum has a natural fragrance, and it is not greasy at all.  </li>

            <li> Use this serum if you&#x27;re wanting soft, refreshed skin.</li>
            <li> I had a question and directly contacted them.</li>
            <li> One of the draws was knowing that everything was organic and all natural.  </li>
            <li> Love the subtle smell and feel of this serum.</li>
            <li> means that my skin care needs are unique and different from other people’s requirements.</li>
            <li> I loved that I only had to put a few drops on my fingers, then I message a little bit on my fingers and message the serum on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But this caught my eye and even if it can seem quirky, I actually like the concept of marrying my regimen with positive affirmations --</li>
            <li> I try my best to take care of my skin since I am a beauty blogger, but it can be difficult and expensive to maintain a skincare routine with all the right ingredients and products.</li>
            <li> After just a few days you will start to see a reduction in age spots, wrinkles, dark circles and much more.  </li>
            <li> It has also left my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Personally, I have sensitive combination skin and</li>

            <li> Right now, my skin feels so soft &amp; there is no more flaking.  </li>
            <li> Since the product soaks very well, I can apply it as a regular moisturizer to help my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a very sticky feel like some other products out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a face serum with natural ingredients and actually works!</li>
            <li> but it definitely showed a major difference in my face.</li>

            <li> **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How is the price?&lt;br /&gt;The regular price is $39.95 which is little high</li>
            <li> It is fast absorbing and leaves behind absolutely no sitcky or oily residues.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and at the same time makes it feel tight.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The serum is light weight and it is not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I used it in the mornings after I do my face wash routine. I loved that I only had to put a few drops on my fingers, then I message a little bit on my fingers and message the serum on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell I have no idea of what it smell like but I love it. When I smell it for some reason it makes me relax so maybe its the oil,,lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Little goes a long way with this serum which I like it saves me money. It spreads nice and evenly. I notice just a tad of  shininess on the for head but I just dab my fingers and it went away, in my experience it could of been the toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my face looks radiant and I do not look like I just woke up and I don&#x27;t even need to use moisturizer if I don&#x27;t want to. Also love that its a 3x toning serum and that it&#x27;s natural and organic.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.all opinion are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> It comes as no surprise that facial serums are now becoming increasingly more popular and now are a hot commodity on the beauty circuit. I, for one, cannot get enough! It seems every other week I am trying out yet another facial serum and adding them into my ever expanding collection. My skin thrives on serums and they always leave my skin looking radiant and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Am Radiant is a facial serum from the company Jeffen that is a 3-in-1 system to help restore and wake up your skin. There are some ingredients that I absolutely, positively MUST have in a facial product and when I find a product that has more than one of those ingredients, I am in beauty heaven. I Am Radiant contains hyaluronic acid, argan oil, and Vitamin C and all three of these ingredients are on my list. Hyaluronic acid helps regenerate the skin and promotes collagen growth to make your skin appear more toned and tightened (in other words it fights sagging and aging). Argan oil is a great ingredient that helps with acne, irritation, and in general just makes your skin (or hair) feel more smooth and hydrated. Vitamin C helps fight against skin wrinkling. With all three of these ingredients in one serum, you just can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum has a very light consistency with an even greater texture. It is fast absorbing and leaves behind absolutely no sitcky or oily residues. The eyedropper cap makes application easy and prevents contamination of germs and bacteria. I tend to use the eyedropper to dispense a small amount of serum onto different areas of my face and lightly use my fingertips to smooth the serum over my skin. I always use upward circular motions to prevent any unnecessary pulling that can possibly cause sagging. This serum absorbs into the skin within a matter of seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love the most about this serum is that it is 98% natural and 74% organic. Now, since it does use natural ingredients, these ingredients tend to separate so I would suggest lightly shaking the bottle before each application to allow all of the ingredients to mix together again and settle. It is also paraben free which is another absolute must have of mine when it comes to skincare products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this serum for a little over a month now, applying it in the morning and at night, and have noticed a drastic improvement in my skin. I no longer get those nasty dry patches of skin that just look flaky and, quite frankly, unattractive underneath makeup. My skin is now smooth and I can see my breakouts becoming more manageable and fewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product complementary in exchange for my unbiased reviewy shaking the bottle before each application to allow all of the ingredients to mix together again and settle.

            <li> This serum is shipped and presented so beautifully. I love the message of self love that comes with it! The serum also felt great going on, silky smooth and amazing smell. For my combination skin, however, it was not the right product to use on a regular basis, as I had a bit of a breakout after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> JEFFEN&#x27;s serum is one amazing product.  The shipment came in within two days and was carefully packaged in a beautiful bottle.  The texture is smooth and the smell is very light, which is good as I don&#x27;t want to smell anything crazy during the day or when I sleep.  I also like the fact it&#x27;s of vegan ingredient and not tested on animals.  A great product!  Absolutely loved it!.</li>
            <li> Excellent product to add to one&#x27;s daily routine.  Feels light on the skin, refreshes the face, and skin feels softer and tighter.  Love the light and natural scent too.</li>
            <li> I noticed instant results.....love it!</li>
            <li> All 3 of the best skincare ingredients in one serum - definitely fits the name very well.  All of these come together beautifully to reduce the early signs of aging and give your skin that awesome feel of youth and beauty :)  Serum is nice and thick and cool when applied and leaves your skin feeling fresh and clean.  This has a wonderful fresh scent and packed with all the great ingredients it really makes a difference in your skin!  After just a few days you will start to see a reduction in age spots, wrinkles, dark circles and much more.  This also has aloe vera and geranium oil that just adds to the benefits of this serum.  This comes with a 1 year money back guarantee, but you won&#x27;t need it - the 1 oz bottle will last you quite a while and you will be pleased with the results :)  I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for an honest review. This stuff has more than just Vitamin C Serum in it, but it does the same job, better.  Now I can&#x27;t tell you this stuff makes me look ten years younger. That may take some time.  If you are looking at this, you are trying to get rid of wrinkles, spots or rough aged skin. My wife tried this product and she noticed softer skin after the first use. You only use a little, it goes a long way and makes your skin look and feel younger. If you have the chance to looker younger and have healthier skin, take the chance, you will be glad you did. The product is reasonable and is guaranteed to work for you. This vitamin c serum works good for my wife and i&#x27;m sure it will work good for you.  It is great to know what you are putting on your skin and how to do it correctly. My wife got rid of a wart with Vitamin C Serum. She also has an old scar that is slowly fading from using it. She&#x27;s had it so long, she has no idea where she got it in the first place. Vitamin C Serum is doing wonders for her skin. I&#x27;m wondering if it works on boils, which I am going to try today to see what the results will be. This is a miracle cure as far as I am concerned. It won&#x27;t make you younger, but it will make your skin look younger. Update-Day two of using Vitamin C Serum on my two boils&#x3D;the pain is gone and some of the swelling has stopped. I will continue to use it to see if this product will actually take boils away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I put vitamin C serum on two boils under my right arm, underarm. After two days, the swelling and burning went away, thankfully. I continued to put the vitamin C serum on the boils and they slowly vanished. This is the coolest stuff they ever made. My wife is now putting it on a boil that she has and it is working for her too. Receiving the free Vitamin C serum was a great added bonus. I am now telling my friends how great vitamin C serum works for me. Vitamin C Serum is becoming my favorite product on the market. You can use it for so many things and it improves your skin. I have actually not had any more boils under my arms since I began using vitamin C serum. Trust me, this is a big deal for me.arket. You can use it for so many things and it improves your skin. I have actually not had any more boils under my arms since I began using vitamin C serum. Trust me, this is a big deal for me.</li>
            <li> I am happy because I am Radiant!  This product delivers what it promised.  Skin feels soft and supple after about a week of usage.  Bottle may look small but all you need is a few drops each night so it will go a very long way. Each drop is packed with a lot of oomph! and nature&#x27;s best.  What more can a busy girl ask for??</li>
            <li> I discovered Jeffen skin care at a street fair in Hayes Valley, SF, last year, and bought two jars of the I Am Happy scrub (please restock this -- it&#x27;s great!) I received my I Am Radiant serum a few weeks ago and am so pleased with this product, as well. Feels light and clean, doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue, absorbs quickly and smells nice. My skin feels a little firmer when I use it though it&#x27;s too soon to tell if it&#x27;s helping with lines. These are lovely, nontoxic products made with quality ingredients.  I look forward to trying other formulations in the line.</li>
            <li> Just Love Vitamin C Serum. I am Radiant also contains Virgin Argan Oil And Hyaluronic Acid. I have been doing a lot of reading about different serums, its effects, helpfulness, how it can improve different parts of your body. Vitamin C has cleared my skin from acne. It has also left my skin feeling soft. It takes away the excess oil in my skin. I have oil skin so it feels great not to have that overload of oil on my skin all day. I love to use Jeffen Vitamin C Serum on my hands. It makes them feel super soft too !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it contains Hyaluronic Acid it helps with fine lines and wrinkles. I continue to use Jeffen I am Radiant Vitamin C for the best results to moisturize my skin with out the oil build up. It makes my skin feel soft and at the same time makes it feel tight. It is Organic and Natural. Jeffren offers 100% MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE: If For Any Reason You Don&#x27;t Absolutely Love Your Serum, Just Let Us Know And We&#x27;ll Refund Every Penny (You Can Keep The Bottle).

            <li> This really does work!  I have been receiving compliments on my hair, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the change in my face that people are seeing.  I haven&#x27;t changed my hair at all.  I have always had really bad eczema and very dry skin.  Right now, my skin feels so soft &amp; there is no more flaking.  I am also not allergic to it at all. A great product that I will definitely buy again and that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great for my skin. No grease factor and my skin felt great! I really think this one is a winner especially for the price</li>
            <li> I Am Radiant was nice enough to send me a free bottle of their anti-aging serum to review. This anti-aging serum has vitamin c, argan oil, and hyaluronic acid to give you healthier younger looking skin. They also only use organic ingredients and they don&#x27;t use alcohol, dyes, or fragrances. I have only been using this serum for a couple weeks but I can tell a huge difference in the texture of my skin. My skin seems to look more radiant after I use this. The only down fall is I don&#x27;t think it moisturizes as good as it should and I have to use a moisturizer after applying this. Over all I believe this is a good product to improve you skin if you don&#x27;t mind using a moisturizer with it.</li>
            <li> JEFFEN is an amazing product!! I love how simple the ingredients are and that they are natural. When I use the serum I do feel Radiant, not only because I repeat this mantra, as the bottle invites, but because the serum gently hugs my skin and does not suffocate it. Also, my skin feels smooth and light, not oily at all! I encourage every man and woman who purchases this item to really allow the product to soak in while repeating such a positive message~it makes the natural product create a natural experience.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for creating something I enjoy using and I love to repeat such a positive mantra! I look forward to trying more JEFFEN products!</li>
            <li> IN LOVE with this serum!! So smooth and the only face serum I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t make me feel greasy, I even feel fresher after using.  Honestly makes me feel radiant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a face serum with natural ingredients and actually works! For a while now I&#x27;ve been using this other midnight recovery serum and it smells nice but I really didn&#x27;t see much of a difference and my dry skin wouldnt go away. Now that I&#x27;ve switched to JEFFEN&#x27;s I AM RADIANT my skin is so much softer and looks so much more heathy too! My mom even started stealing some of mine...guess its time to buy her a bottle too!!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this serum! The packaging is beautiful. The serum smells great and feels like a real treat to put apply. I also really love the way it feels on my skin--lightweight, moisturizing, and absolutely no greasy feeling whatsoever.</li>
            <li> My husband got this for me and I felt I should write a review after using this product for a few months now.  I really enjoy the way the it feels on my skin.  It goes on smooth and not greasy at all. It make me feel good!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to review beauty products until I&#x27;ve used them for a while but I have had a chance to live with this product for a while now and it is fantastic. Very pleasant herbal scent and it works great!</li>
            <li> So far, so good! I am shocked that &amp;#34;I am radiant&amp;#34; plays so nicely with my problem skin and all my other products. I still battle adult acne and in my two months of using the serum, it hasn&#x27;t made me break out (yay!). I apply my regular acne products (2% salicylic acid and 5% benzoyl peroxide), then smooth at least 2 drops of this serum on top. When my skin is feeling dry, I follow with a spritz of hydrosol and a drop of Jeffen&#x27;s oil-based serum. I have no idea if I&#x27;m seeing skin improvement, but intend to continue using the product until I figure it out!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! Hands down, one of the best facial products that has been keeping my face from getting dry in the winter. I have a oily/dry skin, but after summer time I find myself putting 3 different products so that I can keep my face glowing in the winter. I&#x27;ve replaced this product with my morning face lotion instead. I use this 2 times a day, sometimes 3 times, it&#x27;s awesome, almost need to order some more!</li>
            <li> Actually this is my favorite thing that I have bought for my face since my YSL youth serum days(which I think the price is outrageous).... I am 25 years old and have oily skin. I use to have horrible acne prone face due to flying. I work for the airlines and the Cabin environment is harsh and dry. I sleep at all the weird hours of the day sometimes with make up on and eat bad while on the road. This serum really makes my face feel soft and fresh. I can feel the difference it had made for my face since I started using it a week ago. I actually look forward to washing my face and do the routine now because of this serum! I love the tingly and fresh feeling it gives my face. I have to start really take care of my face now since my job can shave 10 years away from my skin! I also am so in love with the fact that it&#x27;s organic and natural. Unlike the expensive chemical products that I use to spend hundreds of dollars on....... Which was dumb! I am really happy with the product and will be using it religiously. Thank you JEFFEN!</li>
            <li> LOVE how quickly this product absorbs with no residue once it dries. It&#x27;s an effortless addition to my daily routine which is great. I&#x27;ve even started taking it with me when I travel. I like that the packaging is in darker colored glass to protect the ingredients inside. My skin feels incredibly smooth now! The scent is mild and doesn&#x27;t linger either. So glad I tried this as I was looking for a great serum to add to my skincare regime. Thanks Jeffen!</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING.  I am usually hesitated to try new products from smaller brand but the I am Radiant serum was recommend by my good friend and I am glad I took her words for it.  The serum has a natural fragrance, and it is not greasy at all.  I use about 3 drops day and night before moisturizer, and it actually allow my moisturizer to absorb better.  I also use the serum to carefully tap around the eye area before applying eye moisturizer.  After 3 weeks of use, I do noticed my face is brighter and more radiant.  I also had a few small breakouts on my forehead from a greasy product I tried couple months ago.  It has been difficult to get rid of those breakouts, but since I used the Radiant Serum, the breakouts started to dry out themselves.  Being the person who spends $200/bottle of face product, I am happy to include the Radiant Serum as part of my routine, and would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this serum.  She says that it&#x27;s light, moisturizing, and the scent is fantastic.  She says that it soaks quickly into her skin and doesn&#x27;t leave her face feeling sticky.  Will be purchasing another bottle for here once she runs out.</li>
            <li> Amazing! This is my first time trying it and I&#x27;m impressed. I have many sensitivities and allergies (i.e. dairy, gluten), so I needed a product with clean quality ingredients. I liked that it worked great with my combination skin and that it dries quick. It was a lifesaver for my acne scars too.  The added bonus is the mantra on the label. It’s just nice to have something nice to see everyday. I like having something tell me I’m “radiant.”</li>
            <li> A friend gave me this serum &amp; I love it! I use it right after my shower in the morning. It smells so good &amp; really is a nice little &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; in my morning routine. It makes me feel ready for my day ;) I do actually use more than recommend - more like 5-6 drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;ve actually used it on my hands when they&#x27;ve been really cracked a couple times. I know that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s intended for, but it really did seem to sooth and soften my cuticles!</li>
            <li> It is incredibly important to me to use products that are natural and organic. My skin can be wacky at times and I am very wary of what I put on it. This serum is INCREDIBLE. It smells amazing and is light, with great absorption. I have been using it for a few weeks now and I can see and feel a serious difference. I have been receiving compliments left and right and a friend even asked me if I was using new makeup when I was makeup free! If that doesn&#x27;t make you a lifetime customer, I DON&#x27;T know what will. 100% recommend trying this serum! It will make you glow from the inside out.</li>
            <li> Love the subtle smell and feel of this serum. So far it has been working well to soften the areas of dry eczema I have. The packaging is also nice and speaks to the straightforward natural ingredients in this product!</li>
            <li> I have to confess that I&#x27;m usually a bit lazy when it comes to maintaining my face and other routines. But ever since I got the product, I&#x27;ve felt more compelled to stick to the routine and process. Part of the reason is that it smells quite nice, but the main reason is how much better my skin has been feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really loved the tips Jeffen provided on how to apply the serum. Really helped me navigate what I&#x27;m suppose to do!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin (slight rosacea) and I only wear Bare Minerals foundation because my skin breaks out with liquid make-ups. Also with moisturizers, I can&#x27;t use Aveeno or Neutrogena, I currently use Trader Joe&#x27;s moisturizer that&#x27;s scent free because otherwise, I get irritated. I&#x27;m prefacing with my skin sensitivity to let others know that this serum helps keep my skin SUPER soft, like a baby&#x27;s butt. It also brightens my skin as well so I look more refreshed. Use this serum if you&#x27;re wanting soft, refreshed skin.</li>
            <li> I have used several Vitamin C face serums and agree with you this is the #1 product.  I am extremely happy with the results,  Still searching, however, for a product that will renew my chest skin.  Numerous brown spots and bumps have appeared over the years, mainly due to.sun overexposure.  I have tried various vitamin C products but they seem to irritate the problem.  Would appreciate your input.  Thank you and again you have an awesome product with results after 10 days!!!  Ann Marie</li>
            <li> Being of mixed descent (Caucasian and Asian)  means that my skin care needs are unique and different from other people’s requirements. Since I also travel a lot as a teacher and musician, I’ve been on the lookout for an anti-aging serum that would meet all my crazy demands. It had to feel lightweight but also protective in all kinds of climates. The packaging also needed to be lighter but also sturdy so I could take it on flights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought of using a vitamin c serum before, but had recently been hearing about its benefits from friends When I started noticing fine lines around my lips and eyes, I decided to do some searching here on Amazon and was overwhelmed with so many choices. I ended up choosing Jeffen because I liked their positive message and they also included argan oil in their ingredients. I’ve been seeing great results using argan oil with my hair so I know it works. What a great idea to combine it with vitamin c for the face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my first test of the product was when I was traveling in Africa. The serum was working really well when I was living in the cool climates of Toronto. My skin felt moisturized but more importantly, not sticky and greasy. Surprisingly, it worked really well in hot arid climates too! Maybe because of the hot weather, It gave me a pleasant refreshed toning feeling that I never noticed before. I love it so much, I now plan to bring it with me everywhere I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it work with my unique skin type, I am starting to see some of my lines diminishing. My skin also does not feel as dehydrated which is a huge plus especially after a long plane ride. Overall, I’m really happy with my choice and I plan on purchasing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I had a question and directly contacted them. I was blown away by how helpful they were. Great customer service guys!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS. I have very sensitive skin and it is hard for me to find a product that doesn&#x27;t over-dry or irritate my skin. I AM RADIANT from Jeffen helped keep my skin soft, moisturized, and looking healthy. I love how easy it is to use and how quickly it dries. The smell is relaxing and the natural ingredients are easy on my skin. I would recommend this serum to absolutely everyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and the product glides on smoothly also also absorbs fairly quickly on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave a very sticky feel like some other products out there. I love the fact that it is also 98% natural &amp; 74% organic. Everything is listed clearly on the bottle. I use the product religiously twice a day, every day before my regular moisturizing routine. Personally, I have sensitive combination skin and the serum works amazing! I can see a natural healthy glow to my skin only after one day of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I AM RADIANT!</li>
            <li> It has been a long time since I have used any products or had a regimen for my skin care.  But this caught my eye and even if it can seem quirky, I actually like the concept of marrying my regimen with positive affirmations -- it&#x27;s like a mini meditation and a really nice touch/reminder.  But enough about that!  Given that I haven&#x27;t used anything for a while, I am a clean slate for new-ness and I really like I Am Radiant.  My goal is hydration and it feels like I Am Radiant is absolutely supporting that desire.  Plus, you don&#x27;t have to use a ton of it -- in fact it comes with an eye dropper.  So I feel like I&#x27;m getting a good value, too.  So what&#x27;s the next product on the agenda?!</li>
            <li> I was originally attracted to this product for it&#x27;s cool looking bottle, which is covered in positive affirmations. I really believed in the message that Jeffen was trying to give off - beauty starts from within! After reading the ingredients, I was sold. There were natural components that I could actually understand! No toxic stuff. I am usually afraid to try new products on my sensitive skin, especially my face. But now that I finally tried it, I&#x27;m hooked! I really do notice a difference and see the glow. It also doesn&#x27;t hurt to repeat &#x27;I am radiant&#x27; internally from time to time :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these products! The smell is to die for. It leaves my skin feeling fresh and RADIANT! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized without the heavy greasy feeling I’ve experienced from other products, which is a big plus living in South Florida. My skin feels totally rejuvenated and is smoother and softer than ever.</li>
            <li> I love the product and I recommend it to others to give it a try. It soaks very well and does not feel sticky. Perfect for my summer skin care needs. I don’t usually like to use moisturizer in the summer because after I apply it, it feels sticky. My skin is very dry unfortunately so I still need it moisturized. Since the product soaks very well, I can apply it as a regular moisturizer to help my dry skin. I also like that it is organic and has a nice smell. Been using it twice a day, morning and night after I wash my face. Now looking forward to using it in the winter too!</li>
            <li> I bought this product looking for other alternatives out on the market and couldn&#x27;t have been happier.  One of the draws was knowing that everything was organic and all natural.  My skin is pretty sensitive, so I was happy to have something I could safely apply. After using this for several days, I was really happy with incorporating it as part of my daily morning routine. I will definitely be recommending this to my friends.</li>
            <li> I try my best to take care of my skin since I am a beauty blogger, but it can be difficult and expensive to maintain a skincare routine with all the right ingredients and products. When I am on top of my routine, I regularly exfoliate with an at-home microdermabrasion machine, cleanse with an exfoliating brush and face scrub, take supplements including 100% hyaluronic acid, do regular facials, and apply Josie Maran Argan Oil twice a day. As you can imagine, not only does this take a huge amount of time but it is also very expensive. This product contains Vitamin C which helps exfoliate away dry skin, hyaluronic acid to promote collagen production and retain moisture, and argan oil to add moisture and create a dewy finish. This is basically my entire 2 hour long routine in one bottle at nearly half of what I pay for just one product. I love that it has a thicker consistency like the argan oil that I normally use and I don&#x27;t have to use very much for immediate results. Although I prefer a more in-depth approach, this is great for maintaining great skin. I used a 100% off coupon in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Omg! How can I even begin to describe this product?! It&#x27;s awesome!! There is no word to describe this serum. There are so pros and cons though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some most asked questions answered in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it smell?&lt;br /&gt;It smells like a whole bunch of herds. I don&#x27;t know the definite smell. I give it 3 stars ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it feel on your skin?&lt;br /&gt;It feels like rubbing water on your skin. It doesn&#x27;t burn or sting when you apply. 4 stars ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How is the price?&lt;br /&gt;The regular price is $39.95 which is little high but it&#x27;s not that bad. 3 stars ***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?&lt;br /&gt;I think I saw a huge difference. My face looked brighter and felt smoother. The dark circles and ewwww stuff on my face are gone. I don&#x27;t really know if it was supposed to do that but it definitely showed a major difference in my face. 5 stars *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you like this product as much as I do! You can comment down below when you apply on I Am Radiant.  In the morning or at night? I apply at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bye stay tuned for more reviews coming next.  ;)</li>
