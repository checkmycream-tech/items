    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best thing I can say for it is that it makes waxing painless.</li>
            <li>This item is WONDERFUL!!!</li>
            <li>I seceretly use it on my nose hairs to which seems to be working great.</li>
            <li>Delivered in good time and as described</li>
            <li>It is a good bang for the buck.  </li>
            <li>I have had good luck with this product.  </li>
            <li>Good for bikini or underarm waxing.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s about all it is good for.</li>
            <li>when i called customer service they told me that the patches are good for 8 uses each</li>
            <li>Good value</li>
            <li>So they make their own electrolysis pen so they can reap the benefits too.</li>
            <li>The product is packaged nicely for storage and seems to be well thought out.</li>
            <li>This is not mentioned in the brochure that comes with the e-pen, and I think it is important to know and do if you use the e-pen and want good results.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Painless and effective:)</li>
            <li>The difference was HUGE!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I could have found the battery at a better price.</li>
            <li>Instead of getting rid of hairs, it makes more grow.</li>
            <li>She also said, which makes perfect sense, that if there were a way for her to do her electrolysis totally painlessly</li>
            <li>She&#x27;d have a hell of a lot more customers thats for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I am not 100% sure yet.</li>
            <li>So the darker the hair, the more treatments it will need.  </li>
            <li>I need to get more of the replacement pads.</li>
            <li>Hopefully she will have better luck with that one.    </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li>So many products out there for hair removal,</li>
            <li>Extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li>i would have to say i am overall very happy with my results.</li>
            <li>but could&#x27;ve included more pads.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product and am happy thus far with the results.    </li>
            <li>So far the mustache strip device works great.</li>
            <li>EASY TO USE, NO PAIN.  </li>
            <li>Item is as described and received very quickly.</li>
            <li>I tried this product for over a month and followed the direction precisely...</li>
            <li>And most likely laughed.  </li>
            <li>I was excited when the Epen arrived today.  </li>
            <li>Please see Target&#x27;s website for more positive reviews.</li>
            <li>When something works and would be popular (and painless permanent hair removal WOULD be popular), tons of other companies want their slice of the profit pie.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper and more convenient than going for electrolysis.  </li>
            <li>true, but ironically it beeps... .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know a lot of reviews have said this product didn&#x27;t work, but I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try myself, because for me, it really has helped.</li>
            <li>I, too was betrayed by that first review of the product!</li>
            <li>This is great but not excited about having to pay for the shipping.</li>
            <li>This product isnt even worth 1 star.&lt;BR</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>hope some good authority could prevent them from duping other gullible consumers any further.&lt;BR</li>
            <li>Right now, though, it does not look hopeful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still not going to tell her she was right though.</li>
            <li>If the hair did not come out fairly easy, the root was not killed and she applied the charge again until the hair came out without tugging it out.  </li>
            <li>I am impressed with it; but as I said it takes a long time to permanently remove all the problem hairs, so only time will tell how this home electrolysis compares with professional.  </li>
            <li>Pros: Very fast shipping.    </li>
            <li>At first you feel like it&#x27;s doing something.</li>
            <li>Thanks for nothing Verseo!</li>
            <li>it does absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>People should be aware of scams like this product.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I bought this ePen a couple months ago, and it&#x27;s working exactly as was stated in the pamphlet that comes with this product.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit, I was very skeptic about this product when I first bought it.</li>
            <li>It works on dark hairs better than my new gray hairs which are my primary issue on my chin.</li>
            <li>Also I can not pluck I need to shave certain area&#x27;s</li>
            <li>if I should use the face pad or the body pad on my neck area, I have used the probe on it and it had an intense tingle.</li>
            <li>Any advice would be very helpful..</li>
            <li>It looks like this manufacturer is really an expert in this category.</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>I had to use it on the whole area</li>
            <li>but treatment is much more involved than I expected.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mother and she doesn&#x27;t like it because it hurts to much.</li>
            <li>I am truly amazed and very thankful.</li>
            <li>Yes, this thing really deserves zero stars....</li>
            <li>It is very portable, but doesn&#x27;t take care of the stubborn ones.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t do a whole lot while it was on.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using your money to get a real electrolysis done professionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product arrived as expected :) This product requires patience and three months in order to work..</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.       </li>
            <li>The tweezers are difficult to use, if you don&#x27;t have great amount of strength in your fingers, don&#x27;t even bother trying...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had the product for a week, so it is too soon to tell how powerful it is in removing the hair, but I believe it will work.  </li>
            <li>O.K., at least it did at first but not so sure now.  </li>
            <li>just doesn&#x27;t work well on anything other than really fine hair.</li>
            <li>and they are sending new ones-no problem.</li>
            <li>I wanted to share my opinion with others who are in need of something new to try for a solution to hair removal.</li>
            <li>e-pen is easy to use and has a timer to let you know how long to apply the charge to various body areas.  </li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t work the first time or even the second time.</li>
            <li>It had so much information about hair growth cycles as well hair growth in general.</li>
            <li>It was after I received it that this problem became clear I shouldn&#x27;t use the Eglide.</li>
            <li>I treated only my underarms and face, and i did it like the instructions red,20 mins, twice a week on clean dry skin.</li>
            <li>I had to give up and go to a professional electrolysis.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had professional electrolysis years ago and it works.  </li>
            <li>professional electrolysis does not try to remove all the hairs in the lip area.  </li>
            <li>the professional electrolysis applied the electrical charge to kill the hair root, she then pulled the hair out with a tweezer.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your time or money</li>
            <li>this product is completely useless.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>I noticed after only two applications on my lip, MUCH slower hair growth than before.  </li>
            <li>After following the instructions, and continued use I was able to destroy all hair follicles.</li>
            <li>It really takes a long time to work.  </li>
            <li>The hair needs to be treated several times for it to disappear completely.  </li>
            <li>So far, the hair I removed is not growing back.</li>
            <li>Some of the hair follicles that did not get removed completely grows back in-grown hair, so it causes bumps where that hair is.  </li>
            <li>I finally took the dive and am having my leg hair removed via professional lasers.</li>
            <li>After several years, you should be rid of all your unwanted hair with regular electrolysis and not POSSIBLY A SMALL PORTION like you</li>
            <li>My side had absolutely no change after 2 months and her side had 20%+ reduction in hair (permanent removal) and 50% of the other hair was growing back in significantly</li>
            <li>Electrode pads have limited uses so will have to continually order new supplies ($19.95 per set).</li>
            <li>I wished it could have at least console me with some results for the faith and time ive put it, it doesnt have to be significant, but just some would be enough for some consolation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It takes a very long period of time to actually kill of all the problem hairs in the lip area (which is the area I had electrolysis done by a professional electrolysis) - it took 2 years of treatments -once a week for me.  </li>
            <li>Initial unit costs much less than professional treatments but by the time I achieve complete, permanent hair removal-who knows?</li>
            <li>hairs that grow back are actually new hairs and the area will have to be treated again to remove these hairs while they are in an active growth cycle.</li>

            <li> It takes a very long period of time to actually kill of all the problem hairs in the lip area (which is the area I had electrolysis done by a professional electrolysis) - it took 2 years of treatments -once a week for me.  </li>

            <li> Now the professional electrolysis does work, which is quite painful, if you go about every three weeks for a few months, so until I see better results from this, I will give it the poor to fair rating.</li>
            <li> Right, sort of ridiculous to to pay $80 only to do that...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had to tweeze morning and night but with this item I go long periods without having to tweeze, it grows back slower, thinner, and is finally disappearing.</li>
            <li> However I feel it rush down the hair shafts when working just like when I went to a professional epi person.</li>
            <li> The system did completely get rid of maybe half of the hair on my legs.  </li>
            <li> There wasnt even a single doubt bone when I ordered my set in febuary this year, I also ordered a total of 42 replacement pads thruout the months.</li>
            <li> Received my product earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent $$$ trying to remove my unwanted facial hair</li>
            <li> The instructions say it may take several tries to get rid of the hair.</li>
            <li> No matter how long I use it, it just doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried using the product yet, due to it being my wife&#x27;s xmas present.</li>
            <li> (500 hairs in a square inch, 20% of them grow at same time for 2 weeks of active growth.)</li>
            <li> a fortune back then and was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t kill a single hair.  </li>
            <li> It could possibly work to permanently remove the hair but it would take SEVERAL YEARS since the current is so weak.</li>
            <li> I believe I was expecting something a little different in results.</li>
            <li> so few actually work.  </li>
            <li> I have only used the ePen for a few weeks, but I have already seen results.</li>
            <li> Not really immediate results.  </li>
            <li> They should go to jail for fraud.</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, though, that I meticulously electrocuted the same areas and plucked the hairs at least six times each, only to lose half of the hairs there permanently.</li>
            <li> ...if it worked, there would be dozens of other units for sale from other companies in stores everywhere.</li>
            <li> and I used the pen on the other.</li>
            <li> Once I got it, I review the instruction and it was extremely thorough.</li>

            <li> with a little pateince this pen remove all unwanted hair.</li>

            <li> The thing is difficult to use, covers a very, very small area, requires multiple attempts to eradicate hair in even those small areas and can&#x27;t be used in the same area too close in time.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m sold on this yet.  </li>
            <li> Would not recommend: it takes forever to kill one little hair and after doing a few, you get tired with this and just put this epen away not to ever use it again...</li>

            <li> Since it&#x27;s on batteris, I feel like the charge is too weak, I wish it was on a cord.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Delivered in good time and as described</li>
            <li> It is a good bang for the buck.  I don&#x27;t think I could have found the battery at a better price.</li>
            <li> You have to use it 60 times to get results. How does the job on mens beard? Probably waist of time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to bogus reviews!! I, too was betrayed by that first review of the product! This was a terrible product. At first you feel like it&#x27;s doing something. But in reality, it&#x27;s doing nothing but giving you headaches. Instead of getting rid of hairs, it makes more grow. I had to give up and go to a professional electrolysis. I suggest never to use this product. NO GOOD!</li>
            <li> ...if it worked, there would be dozens of other units for sale from other companies in stores everywhere. When something works and would be popular (and painless permanent hair removal WOULD be popular), tons of other companies want their slice of the profit pie. So they make their own electrolysis pen so they can reap the benefits too. Do you see 10 different brands of electrolysis pens out on the shelves? Nope, because it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started electrolysis treatments 18 months ago. Then I saw this pen and thought I could save myself a lot of money so I bought it and stopped going. Well 4 months later I started going back to the appointments because it just didn&#x27;t work. She had been doing my chin and was going to start on my upper lip when I stopped going. I told her why I cancelled and she asked me to bring the electrolysis pen in for her to look at. She told me that there is no way possible enough current gets to the hair follicle in order to kill it with this pen. It could possibly work to permanently remove the hair but it would take SEVERAL YEARS since the current is so weak. She also said, which makes perfect sense, that if there were a way for her to do her electrolysis totally painlessly don&#x27;t you think she&#x27;d be using it?? She&#x27;d have a hell of a lot more customers thats for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well we did a test. It was time to start on my upper lip and she could only do one section at a time so she did one side of my lip and I used the pen on the other. The difference was HUGE! My side had absolutely no change after 2 months and her side had 20%+ reduction in hair (permanent removal) and 50% of the other hair was growing back in significantly thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the electrolysis pen could possibly give you some permanent hair removal after several YEARS of use, but regular electrolysis gives you a 20% reduction in hair, permanently, after 2-3 months. After several years, you should be rid of all your unwanted hair with regular electrolysis and not POSSIBLY A SMALL PORTION like you would with this electrolysis pen.not POSSIBLY A SMALL PORTION like you would with this electrolysis pen.</li>
            <li> Bought this, not from Amazon, but mail order and have used it for about three months. Still no permanent result. The hair is still coming back and it is time consuming. Now the professional electrolysis does work, which is quite painful, if you go about every three weeks for a few months, so until I see better results from this, I will give it the poor to fair rating.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t works as the seller said. I have few hair to remove and i never saw any results. The gel isn&#x27;t enoght neither.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE COMPANY!  VERSEO IS A SCAM AND WILL LIE AND TELL YOU YOUR CARD WAS DENIED WHEN IT WASN\\&quot;T!!! DON\\&quot;T BUY THEIR PRODUCTS!</li>
            <li> I was excited when the Epen arrived today.  But then I opened it.  Junk.  The \\&quot;probe\\&quot; is a Q-tip.  Not well made at all.  Almost don&#x27;t want to waste time trying it out.  But I&#x27;ve paid for so I will.  I will update if my review changes.  Right now, though, it does not look hopeful.  The thing is difficult to use, covers a very, very small area, requires multiple attempts to eradicate hair in even those small areas and can&#x27;t be used in the same area too close in time. I imagine that to see if it works on my chin will take months, according to the directions.  Impossible to use on any larger area despite what the ads imply.</li>
            <li> I think I like it... I am not 100% sure yet. because I haven&#x27;t used it enough... I have P.C.O.S and I have a lot of hair to get rid of hehe! I have not quite figured out if I should use the face pad or the body pad on my neck area, I have used the probe on it and it had an intense tingle. Not enough for me not to use it, but enough for me to question whether to use face pad for 5 mins or body pad for longer. Also I can not pluck I need to shave certain area&#x27;s so what should I do?? Any advice would be very helpful.. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the product for a week, so it is too soon to tell how powerful it is in removing the hair, but I believe it will work.  I&#x27;ve had professional electrolysis years ago and it works.  The thing to know about the e-pen is some background into how electrolysis and hair removal works.  It takes a very long period of time to actually kill of all the problem hairs in the lip area (which is the area I had electrolysis done by a professional electrolysis) - it took 2 years of treatments -once a week for me.  So, don&#x27;t expect the e-pen to do it in a short amount of time.  You have to be serious and committed.&lt;br /&gt;A professional electrolysis does not try to remove all the hairs in the lip area.  Only those hairs that are a problem are removed.  So when you are instructed to remove the hairs with a tweezer, I am only removing the problem hairs that way.  Otherwise it would take too long.&lt;br /&gt;When the professional electrolysis applied the electrical charge to kill the hair root, she then pulled the hair out with a tweezer.  If the hair did not come out fairly easy, the root was not killed and she applied the charge again until the hair came out without tugging it out.  This is not mentioned in the brochure that comes with the e-pen, and I think it is important to know and do if you use the e-pen and want good results.&lt;br /&gt;The e-pen is easy to use and has a timer to let you know how long to apply the charge to various body areas.  The product is packaged nicely for storage and seems to be well thought out. I am impressed with it; but as I said it takes a long time to permanently remove all the problem hairs, so only time will tell how this home electrolysis compares with professional.  It definitely is not as costly.</li>
            <li> I used this \\&quot;hair remover\\&quot; religiously for two months.  It didn&#x27;t kill a single hair.  I wasted hours of my time with it.</li>
            <li> I have had good luck with this product.  It&#x27;s much cheaper and more convenient than going for electrolysis.  But it doesn&#x27;t work the first time or even the second time. The hair needs to be treated several times for it to disappear completely.  But each time a hair grows back, its lighter.  So the darker the hair, the more treatments it will need.  Unfortunately there&#x27;s no quick fix for unwanted hair but this product is a big help for me.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I was very skeptic about this product when I first bought it. Once I got it, I review the instruction and it was extremely thorough. It had so much information about hair growth cycles as well hair growth in general. It looks like this manufacturer is really an expert in this category. After following the instructions, and continued use I was able to destroy all hair follicles. The hair in the treated areas is gone forever!!!!      I would highly recommend this product.       I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes of saving money and I can&#x27;t even use it. I have epilepsy. There wasn&#x27;t any indication on the site that made think that I should avoid this product because of my disability. It was after I received it that this problem became clear I shouldn&#x27;t use the Eglide. I don&#x27;t like to whine and throw it in everyones face that I have epilepsy, but it really sucks when I waste a bunch of money because companies are insensitive like this. Thanks for nothing Verseo!</li>
            <li> The body and face pads are completely useless. I&#x27;ve used them several times in the same places and the hair always grows back. However the probe method of removal does actually work. Unfortunately you can only remove one hair at a time with this method. It really does work. You just have to have a lot of time, patience and dexterity in order to see the results.</li>
            <li> Even though it is expensive!! I have bought 2 and it is CRAP! The wires are so thin they BREAK!!!!  and where can you get parts?? No where!!! I have asked the company and get no answers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not good enough... I think It doesn&#x27;t work at all...</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because the ad says it is permanent hair removal. I used it for months and the hair continues to grow back. The best thing I can say for it is that it makes waxing painless. Once you use the pad on the affected area, the hair slides out painlessly after applying wax. Good for bikini or underarm waxing. That&#x27;s about all it is good for.</li>
            <li> So far, the hair I removed is not growing back. The holidays were hectic and I have not had alot of time of work with the product.  Each hair takes about 1 minute to process so patience is required.  Painless and effective:)</li>
            <li> I was fascinated by the claims they make on their commercials, &lt;BR&gt;&amp;quot;easy, fast,effective and clinically proven&amp;quot;. I chose to buy this over a rotary epilator. There wasnt even a single doubt bone when I ordered my set in febuary this year, I also ordered a total of 42 replacement pads thruout the months. I treated only my underarms and face, and i did it like the instructions red,20 mins, twice a week on clean dry skin. I also got several tweezermans to tweeze my hair after each treatment. This has been going on for almost 5 months, my hairgrowth is still abundent and I have totally lost faith in it. &lt;BR&gt;I wished it could have at least console me with some results for the faith and time ive put it, it doesnt have to be significant, but just some would be enough for some consolation.&lt;br /&gt;I hope some good authority could prevent them from duping other gullible consumers any further.&lt;BR&gt;This product isnt even worth 1 star.&lt;BR&gt;I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend bought the e-pen from target and I told her she was crazy. She started using it on her eyebrows and just random hairs everywhere. I still didn&#x27;t think it would work. So she used it on a patch of hairs on my chest she always teases me about and a month later I was still amazed. I had to use it on the whole area becuase there was a bald patch. Some hairs grew back but they were really thin. The second pass got almost all of them. I seceretly use it on my nose hairs to which seems to be working great. I&#x27;m still not going to tell her she was right though. It&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time or money this product is completely useless.&lt;br /&gt;Does not remove hair at all and the instructions are difficult to understand.</li>
            <li> Received my product earlier than expected. YEAH! Been using for a month now and I believe it is working but treatment is much more involved than I expected. There&#x27;s a science to it so keeping track of it and actually doing the treatments is time consuming. (500 hairs in a square inch, 20% of them grow at same time for 2 weeks of active growth.) Permanent? I can&#x27;t comment on yet,according to the enclosed pamphlet, I may not know for 8-12 weeks. Disclaimer: hairs that grow back are actually new hairs and the area will have to be treated again to remove these hairs while they are in an active growth cycle. Plucking is required for removal of treated hairs which as they claim is painless however, inactive hairs are painful and plentiful(the other 80%),OUCH! My e-pen had faulty wires and have to be replaced-took awhile to figure this out-so I called customer service and they are sending new ones-no problem. This is great but not excited about having to pay for the shipping. Typos in instruction manual. Electrode pads have limited uses so will have to continually order new supplies ($19.95 per set). Initial unit costs much less than professional treatments but by the time I achieve complete, permanent hair removal-who knows? I guess I will find out, maybe you&#x27;ll just decide to shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother and she doesn&#x27;t like it because it hurts to much.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for over a month and followed the direction precisely...it does absolutely nothing! Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> Some of the hair follicles that did not get removed completely grows back in-grown hair, so it causes bumps where that hair is.  Also, scars where I&#x27;ve dug at the skin to get the hair out. The system did completely get rid of maybe half of the hair on my legs.  The other half keeps growing, so still have to shave.</li>
            <li> I was deligent in using it once a week.  Now have places that are approximately the shape of the pad that is almost hair free.  I need to get more of the replacement pads.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my girlfriend at her request. She read the directions and followed them. She was unable to get to tip part to work, but the pads did. We finally realized that the item arrived broken and she will soon be going to target to try to get another one. Hopefully she will have better luck with that one.    Pros: Very fast shipping.    Cons: Arrived partially broken, testing the return policy.</li>
            <li> This item is WONDERFUL!!! Painless!!! It does work!!! I&#x27;ve spent $$$ trying to remove my unwanted facial hair and it always, always grew back. I&#x27;ve always had to tweeze morning and night but with this item I go long periods without having to tweeze, it grows back slower, thinner, and is finally disappearing. I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied. Definitely worth the money. I am truly amazed and very thankful. Please see Target&#x27;s website for more positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Have only had it a month so no significant hair diminishing yet. However I feel it rush down the hair shafts when working just like when I went to a professional epi person. I had mixed results from them too. It works on dark hairs better than my new gray hairs which are my primary issue on my chin. But the feel is correct so hope it will work. Btw the professionals say to not pluck during treatment, shave (gross) so that u r retreating the same hair and multi zaps will kill resistant ones</li>
            <li> Yes, this thing really deserves zero stars....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The battery cover keeps falling down while the machine is in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  When the q-tip touches any living or non-living surface, it stupidly beeps :-), regardless of whether it is soaked in the \\&quot;conductive\\&quot; gel or not.  I tried it on wood, my skin, and a dead chicken.  It beeps every 20 seconds... yeah... true, but ironically it beeps... .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  The q-tip does not warm up at all... The conductive gel remains cold.  No different feel on the face, obviously...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  The tweezers are difficult to use, if you don&#x27;t have great amount of strength in your fingers, don&#x27;t even bother trying... Or, use the tweezers as a mechanism to build strength in your finger. Right, sort of ridiculous to to pay $80 only to do that... :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. There is no way that the way the machine is constructed would conduct any type of electricity...  The entire advertising is so deceiving...  If they would have said that is a q-tip and some cheapo gel, I would have turned my head away from this gimmicky product... And most likely laughed.  Now whoever put my money in their pocket are laughing at me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it on sharperimageonline.com, and it was an $79.99 ripoff...  A complete waste of money which I worked hard for.  I can&#x27;t believe I was ripped off by a gimmicky, useless, non-refundable, non-returnable, so-called ePen...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t waste your money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely won&#x27;t ever recommend this to my friends nor to my enemies.  I will take my precious time and write this review on other sites where this pathetic product is sold. People should be aware of scams like this product.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time. It works as described but it will take time to see if the hair is actually permanently removed in the long-term. Overall, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Crap!  Does anyone thing this actually works?  So many products out there for hair removal, so few actually work.  I finally took the dive and am having my leg hair removed via professional lasers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m sold on this yet.  It seems to work O.K., at least it did at first but not so sure now.  Maybe I&#x27;m just not giving it enough time.  The instructions say it may take several tries to get rid of the hair.</li>
            <li> I have only used the ePen for a few weeks, but I have already seen results. I know a lot of reviews have said this product didn&#x27;t work, but I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try myself, because for me, it really has helped. I wanted to share my opinion with others who are in need of something new to try for a solution to hair removal.</li>
            <li> I bought this ePen a couple months ago, and it&#x27;s working exactly as was stated in the pamphlet that comes with this product.  It takes multiple uses to achieve permanent hair loss.  That is fully explained in detail in the instructions, as well as how to properly use this product.    I noticed after only two applications on my lip, MUCH slower hair growth than before.  Extremely pleased.  Same for bikini line.  I will continue to use this product and am happy thus far with the results.    My advice, don&#x27;t be impatient, and READ the directions, ALL the directions.</li>
            <li> This product does not work, should have returned it but never got around to it. Do not buy this product</li>
            <li> did  religiously and it did not work. it took a lot of time and still after 6 months of use no reduction of facial hairs. don&#x27;t bother to try this.</li>
            <li> EASY TO USE, NO PAIN.  TOO SOON TO TELL RESULTS</li>
            <li> just doesn&#x27;t work well on anything other than really fine hair. It is very portable, but doesn&#x27;t take care of the stubborn ones.</li>
            <li> I used this for almost a year on a weekly basis and it still didn&#x27;t work.  I didn&#x27;t even notice it thinning, it still looks just as thick as it was when I started,</li>
            <li> No big result yet. I wanted to stop plucking</li>
            <li> I used the thing and felt like little pin pricks as it was on. I couldn&#x27;t do a whole lot while it was on. (I used the pads). After a couple days, I started getting ingrown hairs on my leg! I had to dig them out. I threw the contraption in the trash. Had thrown out the receipt so I couldn&#x27;t even return it. Always keep receipts!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried using the product yet, due to it being my wife&#x27;s xmas present. Item is as described and received very quickly.</li>
            <li> I purchased the epen in hopes of getting rid of unwanted facial hair. So far the mustache strip device works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a process. Not really immediate results.  I believe I was expecting something a little different in results.</li>
            <li> Tedious to use only treats one hair at a time arrived quickly not pricey but excessive wait for results treatment of a hairy area would be exhausting like looking for a needle in a haystack</li>
            <li> Would not recommend: it takes forever to kill one little hair and after doing a few, you get tired with this and just put this epen away not to ever use it again... Since it&#x27;s on batteris, I feel like the charge is too weak, I wish it was on a cord. Would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money. Please don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> No matter how long I use it, it just doesn&#x27;t work. Trying to get rid of ear hair, &amp; around the nose, &amp; &amp;#34;Just doesn&#x27;t work&amp;#34;. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> It really takes a long time to work.  Medium results.</li>
            <li> with a little pateince this pen remove all unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these years ago. Tried it off and on down through the years.&lt;br /&gt;No Hair removal at all.&lt;br /&gt;Cost a fortune back then and was a total waste of money. I can&#x27;t believe these people are still pushing this crap. They should go to jail for fraud.</li>
            <li> I have had the Verseo ePen electrolysis system for 3 months now, I find that i have less and less hair. It does take time &amp; when i called customer service they told me that the patches are good for 8 uses each and if you contine to use them after the 8 uses the results take longer. i would have to say i am overall very happy with my results.</li>
            <li> Basically worthless. I have noticed some permanent hair loss in the areas I used it. Keep in mind, though, that I meticulously electrocuted the same areas and plucked the hairs at least six times each, only to lose half of the hairs there permanently. I would recommend using your money to get a real electrolysis done professionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or at least get an electrolysis system with a needle.</li>
            <li> This did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product several months ago. Though I have faithfully used the product for 2 months; I yet to see results.  eVverseo epen replacement pads  is not effective. It was a total waste of time and money. The company who sells this product should be arrested for fraud.</li>
            <li> Good value but could&#x27;ve included more pads. Still using it to see if results are permanent so I can&#x27;t say how well it works.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as expected :) This product requires patience and three months in order to work.. A product review should be performed wonts results are seen.</li>
