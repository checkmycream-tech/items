            <li>Love these for every day use and travel...</li>
            <li>Love theses.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my set for 14 or more years now, and it is my favorite hair styler.</li>
            <li>The shorter the hair, the more it curls.  </li>
            <li>They are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>and I am concerned that the top is so flimsy that it will break.</li>
            <li>but otherwise, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen better clips.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with item: Packed with care, shipped quickly</li>
            <li>Otherwise they are fine and the plastic klips are very easy to use</li>
            <li>, the set looks pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Love these for medium-thickness, fine texture blondish hair,</li>
            <li>Both Reviews talk as if they have the full size kit!</li>
            <li>They work nicely once in the hair though and are great for travel as they are a nice small size in the suitcase.</li>
            <li>I think I will like them, they are really easy to use.</li>
            <li>so it makes them easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>The clips tend to get a little bent up but ythe metal ones are great!</li>
            <li>shoulder length bob, bends the ends under nicely and gives much volume.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see the metal pins in the product photo, but they fit into the slot in front of the rollers.  </li>
            <li>They warm up fairly quick and the plastic edge of the roller doesn&#x27;t get overly hot...</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Have had these for years, and they are great at giving long hair some bounce and waves.</li>
            <li>You need to Review ALL REVIEWS when you read reviews because you will find that many reviews do not pertain to the EXACT PRODUCT you are reading Reviews about.</li>
            <li>so I was excited when I saw these online.  </li>
            <li>I just wish Conair would make one with more large rollers and metal clips, as the plastic ones are a joke.</li>
            <li>(my hair is fine and these rollers don&#x27;t get too hot and they add body to my hair, not curl).  </li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and provide lots of volume.</li>
            <li>These rollers are super.  </li>
            <li>Heat up super quick.  </li>
            <li>SUPER</li>
            <li>Bought for quick heating.  </li>
            <li>I love this set, rollers are the right size and it heats up fast but 5 rollers isnt enough, had to order a second set to get 10 rollers and its perfect.</li>
            <li>This does not get very hot.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s probably better not to curl right after washing your hair - next day might be better.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem to get that HOT!</li>
            <li>I have had this set of rollers for nearly 10-15 years and have never found anything better to replace them with.  </li>
            <li>For smoothing and body, I only warm the rollers, for curl</li>
            <li>I just make sure that they get super hot, and they are completely cooled when I take them out.</li>
            <li>They are just the right size for my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once they finally reach a warm temperature, they go to HOT, and I have to unplug them and wait to use them.  </li>
            <li>These hot rollers take forever to heat up, and they get too hot!  </li>
            <li>am fortunate to have a 120 plug in my house, so I can still use them but I cannot use them elsewhere in New Zealand and they will not work in Europe</li>
            <li>The cover is delicate--may break off easily, so I use the old ones for travel now.  </li>
            <li>Clips are nice and long and, of course, the claw type of clips are helpful with any set of hot rollers.</li>
            <li>They heat up fast and tame my frizzy hair into beautiful large bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately while they work perfectly on 120V</li>
            <li>My first set of these lasted since I was in college.  </li>
            <li>, I let them get hot.  </li>
            <li>To get curls on longer hair, you&#x27;d need smaller sections of hair and more rollers.  </li>
            <li>Love the size, but the curlers just don&#x27;t get hot enough to make the curls I want.  </li>
            <li>The rollers are exactly as described and do the job.</li>
            <li>The rollers heated up pretty hot</li>
            <li>They make my morning routine super fast, and give my hair some decent body and shine.  </li>
            <li>All large rollers, clips leave creases in you hair</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t even get some decent rollers for 30 bucks!</li>
            <li>I saw these featured on one of Bethanny Frankel&#x27;s blogs and they seemed to work very well for her.</li>
            <li>While I really like the compact size of the Jumbo rollers...</li>
            <li>I cannot get my hair to curl as much as I want with these.  </li>
            <li>I really like the curlers, however, they are a bit wobbly in the stand.</li>
            <li>I usually wash my hair at night and let it air dry most of the way before bed, then roll it on warm rollers in the morning.  </li>
            <li>and when I want to replace my original Big Curls.</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly, are just the right size for big curls or soft waves.</li>
            <li>Long heat up time; rollers do not get really hot and therefore lose what heat they have quickly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>The only reason I needed a new set is that the old ones were taking too long to warm up.  </li>
            <li>Because I air dry my hair and use these flocked rollers as my only heated product, stylists always comment on how healthy my hair is.  </li>
            <li>Great feature is that the cord wraps around the base making for easy transport.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these rollers from New Zealand</li>
            <li>The curler don&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li>They take FOREVER to heat up and still don&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>And I have the full-size version of this exact set (in purple, same generation), and use it all the time</li>
            <li>The rollers are large enough that you won&#x27;t get \\&quot;curls\\&quot; but rather body and some volume.</li>
            <li>give me just the right amount of loose curl that I want.  </li>
            <li>These rollers could not sell at a retail store for 30 dollars because no one would pay that much if they could actually see what they were buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only gripe is I have medium length hair and really wish the set came with 6 instead of 5 curlers.</li>
            <li>Also, the white clips work really well to hold the curler in place.</li>
            <li>I use both the metal pins and the plastic clips to hold the rollers in, so the flocking on my rollers is pretty bare in the middle sections now.  </li>
            <li>But next time I guess i&#x27;ll have to fork out 70 bucks for some decent quality rollers.  </li>
            <li>Take s long time to get hot, five rollers are not enough.</li>
            <li>I will be surprised if these last a year.  </li>
            <li>The curls last for the morning with some light hold hairspray, and then they mellow out to look like I round brushed my hair, but I still have the volume.  </li>
            <li>I tried a couple different times with varying amounts of hair and time on the roller but never really got much of a curl</li>

            <li> I tried a couple different times with varying amounts of hair and time on the roller but never really got much of a curl</li>
            <li> I do however really like the covers over the base to the rollers--it is kind to your hair and would encourage others not to bypass this type of covered roller.</li>
            <li> The absence of a lid doesn&#x27;t seem to make any difference with how the set works.  </li>
            <li> Mine came with a plastic lid that cracked and was thrown away long ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how long these have lasted.</li>
            <li> Below shoulder blades long</li>
            <li> I have used them when my hair was both above my shoulders and down my back.</li>
            <li> These do take a while to heat up, so I just plug them in after I get out of the shower, so I have time to dress and blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> The curl didn&#x27;t last long, but not sure I heated them long enough.  </li>
            <li> Not worth sending back, garage sale merchandise</li>
            <li> it was not worth the postage to send the item back.</li>
            <li> However, they had little effect in actually curling my hair.  </li>
            <li> I wake up with crazy kinks in my hair, and these rollers smooth everything out.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up as expected.  </li>
            <li> I shower at night and go to sleep with wet hair.  </li>
            <li> This is my second set over past 6 years.  </li>
            <li> but I still use the set and even travel with it to foreign countries.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair like me you will find that these are not enough and you will need two, but I was not willing to buy another, so I use these and curling ruin to get desired effect.</li>
            <li> I have medium thick hair, and this has worked for any length from above the shoulder to mid-back.  </li>
            <li> Typical with Reviews on products.</li>
            <li> and others are fine, but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and these rollers</li>
            <li> I have medium thick long hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know Conair made this little set anymore</li>
            <li> I wish they would get a little hotter</li>
            <li> I have never seen such poor quality rollers.  </li>
            <li> I have used these a few times now and they seem to do what they are supposed to.  </li>
            <li> Clips are too small to wrap around rollers.  </li>
            <li> It is convenient for traveling, and held up well during suitcase transport, which was not the case for a previous brand set we had used before, where the cover was broken after one trip in a suitcase.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the actual HEATING of them!</li>
            <li> Since they were not that expensive</li>
            <li> Like her I have very thin hair</li>
            <li> It is disappointing as I was hoping to use them as travel rollers.</li>

            <li> I saw these featured on one of Bethanny Frankel&#x27;s blogs and they seemed to work very well for her. Like her I have very thin hair so gave them at try. Nothing impressive.</li>
            <li> Have had these for years, and they are great at giving long hair some bounce and waves. The rollers are large enough that you won&#x27;t get \\&quot;curls\\&quot; but rather body and some volume. These do take a while to heat up, so I just plug them in after I get out of the shower, so I have time to dress and blow dry my hair. The case lid is horribly cracked, so I can&#x27;t give these 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The curler don&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li> I love this set, rollers are the right size and it heats up fast but 5 rollers isnt enough, had to order a second set to get 10 rollers and its perfect. Plus you get 2 seperate kind of clips.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with item: Packed with care, shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Both Reviews talk as if they have the full size kit! Typical with Reviews on products. You need to Review ALL REVIEWS when you read reviews because you will find that many reviews do not pertain to the EXACT PRODUCT you are reading Reviews about.</li>
            <li> Add volume and not curl.  Great for that!</li>
            <li> 30 dollars for rollers that could not cost more than a dollar to make.  I have never seen such poor quality rollers.  I will be surprised if these last a year.  These rollers could not sell at a retail store for 30 dollars because no one would pay that much if they could actually see what they were buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might keep them because they get the job done (my hair is fine and these rollers don&#x27;t get too hot and they add body to my hair, not curl).  But next time I guess i&#x27;ll have to fork out 70 bucks for some decent quality rollers.  Prices these days are shameful.  Can&#x27;t even get some decent rollers for 30 bucks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these travel curlers for 10 years and use them regularly. They heat up fast and tame my frizzy hair into beautiful large bouncy curls. My only gripe is I have medium length hair and really wish the set came with 6 instead of 5 curlers. Also, the white clips work really well to hold the curler in place.</li>
            <li> Love these for every day use and travel... Heat well and are duel voltage  This is my second set over past 6 years.  I use them several times a week</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair like me you will find that these are not enough and you will need two, but I was not willing to buy another, so I use these and curling ruin to get desired effect. I just wish Conair would make one with more large rollers and metal clips, as the plastic ones are a joke.</li>
            <li> I ordered these rollers from New Zealand They were sent to California and my son, who lives in the States brought them out with him on his recent visit Unfortunately while they work perfectly on 120V they do not work on 220V&lt;br /&gt;I am fortunate to have a 120 plug in my house, so I can still use them but I cannot use them elsewhere in New Zealand and they will not work in Europe It is disappointing as I was hoping to use them as travel rollers. Otherwise they are fine and the plastic klips are very easy to use</li>
            <li> My first set of these lasted since I was in college.  The only reason I needed a new set is that the old ones were taking too long to warm up.  The cover is delicate--may break off easily, so I use the old ones for travel now.  Love these for medium-thickness, fine texture blondish hair, shoulder length bob, bends the ends under nicely and gives much volume.</li>
            <li> While I really like the compact size of the Jumbo rollers...I am disappointed in the actual HEATING of them! They don&#x27;t seem to get that HOT! I let them HEAT UP for over 10 minutes. I am using them for travel only!</li>
            <li> My wife likes this set a lot.It is convenient for traveling, and held up well during suitcase transport, which was not the case for a previous brand set we had used before, where the cover was broken after one trip in a suitcase.</li>
            <li> I have had this set of rollers for nearly 10-15 years and have never found anything better to replace them with.  I have long, thick hair and these rollers give me just the right amount of loose curl that I want.  Mine came with a plastic lid that cracked and was thrown away long ago but I still use the set and even travel with it to foreign countries.  The absence of a lid doesn&#x27;t seem to make any difference with how the set works.  I didn&#x27;t even know Conair made this little set anymore but now I know where to go if and when I want to replace my original Big Curls.</li>
            <li> Got some for travel and home.</li>
            <li> Love theses.  Bought two&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consume should come out with a&lt;br /&gt;10 roller</li>
            <li> i use this rollers when i travel. it packs easily, and curls my hair very nicely. i am very pleased with product.</li>
            <li> These rollers are perfect for home or travel!</li>
            <li> All large rollers, clips leave creases in you hair</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use.  The curl didn&#x27;t last long, but not sure I heated them long enough.  Also, it&#x27;s probably better not to curl right after washing your hair - next day might be better.  I think I will like them, they are really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up as expected.  I cannot get my hair to curl as much as I want with these.  They work somewhat for body only styles though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these rollers for about eight years and they are great.  They warm up fairly quick and the plastic edge of the roller doesn&#x27;t get overly hot...so it makes them easy to work with.  Clips are nice and long and, of course, the claw type of clips are helpful with any set of hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my set for 14 or more years now, and it is my favorite hair styler. I have medium thick hair, and this has worked for any length from above the shoulder to mid-back.  For smoothing and body, I only warm the rollers, for curl, I let them get hot.  The shorter the hair, the more it curls.  To get curls on longer hair, you&#x27;d need smaller sections of hair and more rollers.  I usually wash my hair at night and let it air dry most of the way before bed, then roll it on warm rollers in the morning.  Because I air dry my hair and use these flocked rollers as my only heated product, stylists always comment on how healthy my hair is.  I didn&#x27;t see the metal pins in the product photo, but they fit into the slot in front of the rollers.  I use both the metal pins and the plastic clips to hold the rollers in, so the flocking on my rollers is pretty bare in the middle sections now.  Other than that, the set looks pretty good.  I&#x27;m amazed at how long these have lasted.</li>
            <li> I really like the curlers, however, they are a bit wobbly in the stand. They heat up quickly and provide lots of volume.</li>
            <li> I have had these rollers since they came out in the mid-90&#x27;s.  They are fantastic!  I use the metal pins to hold mine in place.  The plastic clips usually left a dent in my hair, so I quit using them.  They make my morning routine super fast, and give my hair some decent body and shine.  I shower at night and go to sleep with wet hair.  I wake up with crazy kinks in my hair, and these rollers smooth everything out.  I just make sure that they get super hot, and they are completely cooled when I take them out. The curls last for the morning with some light hold hairspray, and then they mellow out to look like I round brushed my hair, but I still have the volume.  My hair even looks good on day 2!  My hair fluctuates in length from collar bone to lower shoulder blade, and these rollers always make it look great.</li>
            <li> It is too big for my suitcase and I am concerned that the top is so flimsy that it will break.</li>
            <li> Love the size, but the curlers just don&#x27;t get hot enough to make the curls I want.  Could just be the one I have and others are fine, but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> These hot rollers take forever to heat up, and they get too hot!  Once they finally reach a warm temperature, they go to HOT, and I have to unplug them and wait to use them.  They work nicely once in the hair though and are great for travel as they are a nice small size in the suitcase.</li>
            <li> I love these curlers! They are just the right size for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried others, but these work the best.</li>
            <li> This does not get very hot.  Not worth sending back, garage sale merchandise</li>
            <li> The rollers are exactly as described and do the job. I bought these for my wife for a trip to Marmaris in Turkey in September and she was very happy with them.</li>
            <li> I have used these a few times now and they seem to do what they are supposed to.  I wish they would get a little hotter but otherwise, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> These rollers are super.  I have looong hair.  Below shoulder blades long and these 5 give it just the curl and body it needs.  Heat up super quick.  the are quite compact.  Great feature is that the cord wraps around the base making for easy transport.  SUPER</li>
            <li> I thought &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; meant 2&amp;#34;.  Should have read description that they are only 1 1/2&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve seen better clips.  I&#x27;ll keep them anyway.</li>
            <li> I replaced a set I had for about 18 years. They heat up quickly, are just the right size for big curls or soft waves. I have used them when my hair was both above my shoulders and down my back. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Long heat up time; rollers do not get really hot and therefore lose what heat they have quickly. I have medium thick long hair and I personally would look for a set that is known to be hotter. I do however really like the covers over the base to the rollers--it is kind to your hair and would encourage others not to bypass this type of covered roller.</li>
            <li> I like that it is compact and travels well.  The clips tend to get a little bent up but ythe metal ones are great!</li>
            <li> Bought for quick heating.  Clips are too small to wrap around rollers.  Used others that I had.</li>
            <li> Take s long time to get hot, five rollers are not enough. Flimsy clips. Need to heat it twice to do entire head. Make since curls.</li>
            <li> I wish I could return these. They take FOREVER to heat up and still don&#x27;t get hot enough. My hair had zero curl. And I have the full-size version of this exact set (in purple, same generation), and use it all the time and they are amazing. I intentionally sought out this specific set because it was so similar to my full-sized set. What a disappointment</li>
            <li> I travel overseas quite a bit and wanted a roller set that was dual voltage so I was excited when I saw these online.  The travel rollers arrived on time and were as described .  The rollers heated up pretty hot so I was hopeful they would work.  However, they had little effect in actually curling my hair.  I tried a couple different times with varying amounts of hair and time on the roller but never really got much of a curl and I ended up throwing them out.  Since they were not that expensive it was not worth the postage to send the item back.</li>
