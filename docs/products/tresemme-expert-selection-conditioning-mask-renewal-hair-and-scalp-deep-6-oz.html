            <li>Best of all, no scent.  </li>

            <li>Great for scalp psoriasis.</li>
            <li>and it has seemed to make a great difference to our hair.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used up a couple bottles now and it works great.</li>
            <li>hair felt good, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it feels great after using this.</li>
            <li>Still, the scent is delightful, and the trade-off is worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Wen and it made my hair feel gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way it nourishes and softens my hair from root to tip!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels better than it has in years!</li>
            <li>Deep Conditioning Mask leaves a very pleasant scent in my hair that doesn&#x27;t smell at all perfume-y, making it an ideal product for both men and women.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I wanted to know how this conditioner would work on its own,  I washed Wen out of my hair for about a week before trying this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a nice conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is a nice hair mask.</li>
            <li>The mask rinses out nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a filmy feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is nice: reminds me of an Aveda product I tried before.  </li>
            <li>This product is fairly light for a &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; but it does a good job conditioning.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, so I have a problem with frizz.  </li>
            <li>So, okay.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This has a nice light smell, too.  </li>
            <li>Why pay more.</li>
            <li>The product is just okay.</li>
            <li>It looked noticeably better after use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily and it has a nice, light smell.</li>
            <li>only downside is that after use, though my hair feels wonderful, it does need to be washed more often.  </li>
            <li>I like the way my hair looks after using and would consider purchasing more when this tube runs out.</li>
            <li>my hair, which is long and color treated, it did fine but not as impressive as his.  </li>
            <li>is 3-4 minutes, making it easy to use in the shower.</li>
            <li>Overall a nice product, good for easing dryness and frizzies.</li>
            <li>Tea tree extract has a strong scent.</li>
            <li>Perhaps with more frequent use I can notice more results, but I&#x27;m pretty happy with</li>
            <li>day after however, it was fine.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner eliminates the frizz, and leaves my hair smooth, without having to fight with it.  </li>
            <li>glided on our hair easily and rinsed cleanly.  </li>
            <li>Great quality from the brand for a low price.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than once a week, because it is a bit sticky and it takes time to wash it all out from the roots, but the results are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent was light and fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He washed it out and wasn&#x27;t impressed, but after three different times, it was noticeably softer and didn&#x27;t look as much like a scrub</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strongly scented or full of a perfume</li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance and rinses out cleanly.</li>
            <li>Nothing special like I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a  fresh fragrance that&#x27;s light and clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been very happy with Tresemme products in the past, and I&#x27;m not unhappy with this one.</li>
            <li>I really like it, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good, deep conditioning product to help with static and frizz.</li>
            <li>Winter has been very drying and this made it feel better without leaving it coated or waxy.</li>
            <li>The scent is clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, and static free after I use it.  </li>
            <li>This worked well for me - kept my hair nice and neat and frizz free until the next shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was just labeling but this conditioner  definitely seemed to have a better effect on my scalp than most conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I love the way they breathe new life into my hair.  </li>
            <li>While these directions would easily work with any conditioner, I think combing through with my fingers really did help to detangle, not just in the shower, but afterwards, as well.</li>
            <li>This Tresemme Renewal Hair and Scalp mask worked really well on my shoulder length baby fine hair</li>
            <li>It smells nice, and it didn&#x27;t leave a gross residue in my hair, like some hair masks do.  </li>
            <li>Not medicine-y, just fresh.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance was nice, but sort of generic.</li>
            <li>I find this effective and lightweight for regular conditioning.</li>
            <li>This creamy conditioner rinses smooth, and has a pleasant, but not overwhelming scent.  </li>
            <li>I love the slightly pepperminty scent of tea tree oil, and I love the tingling that it brings to my scalp as it conditions my hair.</li>
            <li>Have used a lot of their products and as usual it is a great product.  </li>
            <li>It was not weighed down and looked and felt good.</li>
            <li>Sort of a manly scent, very unusual.</li>
            <li>First time using this by Tresemme.</li>
            <li>It could have something to do with the texture of the mask, but I&#x27;ve seen varying results with similar products that I&#x27;ve enjoyed more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I started using this mask, I have found my hair to have more body and shine as well as no more static.</li>
            <li>I have used deep conditioning hair treatments before, but most of them focus on the hair and don&#x27;t consider the  needs of the scalp.  </li>
            <li>More like extra conditioning.</li>
            <li>but more towards the regular hair conditioner side.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to run a comb through wet hair without pulls and snags--</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything more than regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>But, it did leave our hair very soft, smooth and it made it so much easier to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Somewhere between a good deep conditioner or hot oil treatment and regular hair conditioner</li>
            <li>She needs intense conditioning to keep it in good condition and to stop breakage from heavy brushing.</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft and smooth but did not over condition my fine locks.</li>
            <li>It did kind of weigh down my hair however, which I wasn&#x27;t a fan of.  </li>
            <li>&gt; Contained in a tube, the white cream distributes easily through hair.</li>
            <li>Rinses out easily for daily use.</li>
            <li>This is an okay conditioner but after use my hair didn&#x27;t seem deeply conditioned or softer than when I use my normal conditioner.</li>
            <li>Certainly my hair is softer then if I had used shampoo alone.</li>
            <li>deep conditioning mask works surprisingly well with my dry, 4a hair.</li>
            <li>unexpected upside was that it really was nice on my dry scalp.</li>
            <li>Our hair looks and feels much healthier.</li>
            <li>I read some reviews on this and thought I would give it a try since I have very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair with just enough natural curl that if I don&#x27;t use a good conditioner that trying to comb it out is a nightmare.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and dry on the ends</li>
            <li>have liked Tea Tree products before, even though I am not sure what Tea Tree is.  </li>
            <li>I wonder why the main ingredients are WATER (AQUA) &amp; CETEARYL ALCOHOL?</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for a deep conditioning mask.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that becomes dry, flyaway and full of static when it becomes cold.</li>
            <li>Aweful new formula...</li>
            <li>I used as directed and my hair was exactly the same afterwards.  </li>
            <li>For winter months, which are really harsh on my hair, this would be a good every other shampoo conditioner.</li>
            <li>The 3-4 minutes it needs according to the directions are worth the time if it helps prevent my hair from getting too dry.</li>
            <li>My hair used to feel silky and smooth, now with this new formula, I had trouble passing a brush through it.</li>
            <li>It performed as well as any other good quality conditioner but not necessarily better.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>But feels soft.</li>
            <li>I really like this deep conditioning mask.  </li>
            <li>This mask did nothing to help out and the two times I used it without following with a separate conditioner on the ends of my hair, I had to use twice as much</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I was surprised when this product didn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li>Normally with a product like this, I notice my hair being fuller and more manageable but have seen little results after use and my hair was still dry with no noticeable conditioning attributes.</li>
            <li>course all hair types are different and your mileage may vary, but we&#x27;ve had much better results from other deep conditioners before.</li>
            <li>I used about a walnut sized amount the first time, but the product is rich enough that I used a lot less than that the next time.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and I really love the smell.</li>
            <li>Static is a huge problem for me during the cold months, so you can imagine my delight when I finally found something that worked in taming it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t appear to do anything for my long hair, but I find it very soothing for my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even after using a generous amount and leaving it in more than the suggested time, her hair was knotty and hard to comb through afterwards and looked no different once it was</li>
            <li>I got this for my daughter, who has very long, very tangly hair.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry climate, and have fragile hair, and this mask really worked to help some of the moisture.  </li>
            <li>Really keeps the ends from looking dry and damaged.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with my head this winter, but my scalp has been feeling very itchy and dry.  </li>
            <li>I have super thick, coarse hair, and it makes my hair feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair currently has a lovely shine to it, which I can at least partially attribute to this product.</li>
            <li>I have fine, but thick hair, and it tends to get really dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>It left a slight fragrance after drying, but not so much that it would interfere with my cologne.</li>
            <li>My hair has damage just from bad products and not having a good beautician.  </li>

            <li> My hair used to feel silky and smooth, now with this new formula, I had trouble passing a brush through it.</li>
            <li> It performed as well as any other good quality conditioner but not necessarily better.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> But feels soft.</li>
            <li> I really like this deep conditioning mask.  </li>
            <li> This mask did nothing to help out and the two times I used it without following with a separate conditioner on the ends of my hair, I had to use twice as much</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I was surprised when this product didn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> Normally with a product like this, I notice my hair being fuller and more manageable but have seen little results after use and my hair was still dry with no noticeable conditioning attributes.</li>
            <li> course all hair types are different and your mileage may vary, but we&#x27;ve had much better results from other deep conditioners before.</li>
            <li> I used about a walnut sized amount the first time, but the product is rich enough that I used a lot less than that the next time.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and I really love the smell.</li>
            <li> Static is a huge problem for me during the cold months, so you can imagine my delight when I finally found something that worked in taming it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t appear to do anything for my long hair, but I find it very soothing for my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even after using a generous amount and leaving it in more than the suggested time, her hair was knotty and hard to comb through afterwards and looked no different once it was</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter, who has very long, very tangly hair.</li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate, and have fragile hair, and this mask really worked to help some of the moisture.  </li>
            <li> Really keeps the ends from looking dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with my head this winter, but my scalp has been feeling very itchy and dry.  </li>
            <li> I have super thick, coarse hair, and it makes my hair feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair currently has a lovely shine to it, which I can at least partially attribute to this product.</li>
            <li> I have fine, but thick hair, and it tends to get really dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> It left a slight fragrance after drying, but not so much that it would interfere with my cologne.</li>
            <li> My hair has damage just from bad products and not having a good beautician.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an average mask that didn&#x27;t do much to help my hair which gets dry from heat accessories.</li>
            <li> Deep conditioners are designed to address the dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> This Tresemme conditioner rinsed out completely and did not leave a heavy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did this without being overly heavy on my thin fine</li>
            <li> and I can get by with washing it every other day, or sometimes even every third day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use much, starting from about midway down to the roots, then massage what is left into the rest of my hair, then I comb through with a wide toothed comb, roll it up and continue with my shower.</li>
            <li> I appreciated the subtle fragrance .</li>
            <li> I figure alcohol would dry out my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is on the dry side</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly dry hair that I wash about once a week in the winter and twice in the summer.</li>
            <li> I apply alot to my 50 year old thick curly Irish head of hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, very dry, color treated hair, and wash it maybe three,time,a week.</li>
            <li> The plus side of that is that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down as much as a deep treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to be careful with conditioners because while some of them moisturize my hair and give it texture, they&#x27;re simply too heavy and leave it looking flat.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I had to use a lot of this product with each use, which made it not last as long.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and messaged it through my wet hair after shampooing.</li>
            <li> I use deep conditioners on a regular basis, whenever my hair starts to look a little dull.  </li>
            <li> It is certainly not as fussy as other deep conditioning products I&#x27;ve used in the past, and works about as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I left it in my hair for 3 to 4 minutes and then rinsed and dried it as usual.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down or make it greasy.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.</li>
            <li> My hair is so thick and dry that I used it every time I washed my hair.</li>
            <li> Usually formulated with a combination of oils, they promise to infuse moisture and impart manageability to hair stressed by over-processing and other damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I need a little bit of added moisture every so often and this product does it well.</li>
            <li> and I saw no great improvements after using the Renewal Deep Conditioner Mask.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave any oily or slick feeling on our hair.  </li>
            <li> I use it once a week and frizzies are a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderfully thick conditioning hair and scalp</li>
            <li> conditioning mask is thick and creamy and the suggested leave on time</li>
            <li> The texture is thick, but not sticky and rinses out well.</li>
            <li> However, it has a serious case of frizzies, which I can solve, but should I have to?  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d recommend this product for a dry, unhappy scalp, but not for hair.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s just been a very hard winter</li>
            <li> My hair did not feel coated or have any unpleasant residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the results...</li>
            <li> It tends to be curly but the pool has been brutal on it, and frankly, he hates spending time on it.  </li>
            <li> It looks terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this for my color damaged hair.  Really keeps the ends from looking dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> Great for scalp psoriasis.</li>
            <li> This creamy conditioner rinses smooth, and has a pleasant, but not overwhelming scent.  It leaves my hair soft, and static free after I use it.  My hair is very fine, so I have a problem with frizz.  This conditioner eliminates the frizz, and leaves my hair smooth, without having to fight with it.  I really like it, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good, deep conditioning product to help with static and frizz.</li>
            <li> Tresemme is a brand name that I trust.  My cleansing conditioner has not been working the way that I want it to.  I have been using Wen and it made my hair feel gorgeous.  It has a beautiful shine and then it stopped working.  So, okay.  Tresemme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I wanted to know how this conditioner would work on its own,  I washed Wen out of my hair for about a week before trying this conditioner.  This Tresemme conditioner rinsed out completely and did not leave a heavy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have liked Tea Tree products before, even though I am not sure what Tea Tree is.  The scent is clean and fresh. My hair feels soft and manageable.  However, it has a serious case of frizzies, which I can solve, but should I have to?  It looks terrible.  But feels soft.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderfully thick conditioning hair and scalp mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This glided on our hair easily and rinsed cleanly.  It didn&#x27;t leave any oily or slick feeling on our hair.  But, it did leave our hair very soft, smooth and it made it so much easier to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a nice light smell, too.  It&#x27;s not too strongly scented or full of a perfume smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use this every 3 or 4 days and it has seemed to make a great difference to our hair.  Our hair looks and feels much healthier.</li>
            <li> First time using this by Tresemme. Have used a lot of their products and as usual it is a great product.  Doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down or make it greasy. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit torn on this one. I definitely saw some results and Tresemme has a history of quality that extends to this product. I did not feel compelled to give this five stars though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt good, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it feels great after using this. It could have something to do with the texture of the mask, but I&#x27;ve seen varying results with similar products that I&#x27;ve enjoyed more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously others may feel different and I can say that this does work. For the price, it&#x27;s worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for a deep conditioning mask. I just wasn&#x27;t blown away by this one.</li>
            <li> Deep conditioners are designed to address the dry and damaged hair. Usually formulated with a combination of oils, they promise to infuse moisture and impart manageability to hair stressed by over-processing and other damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Contained in a tube, the white cream distributes easily through hair. It has a light fragrance and rinses out cleanly. It left my hair soft and smooth but did not over condition my fine locks. It performed as well as any other good quality conditioner but not necessarily better. I do like the inclusion of tea tree oil, ginseng and sunflower seed oil. The product is to remain on the head for three to four minutes before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice conditioner. I appreciated the subtle fragrance . My hair did not feel coated or have any unpleasant residue. It was not weighed down and looked and felt good. Overall a nice product, good for easing dryness and frizzies.</li>
            <li> Great quality from the brand for a low price.  Rinses out easily for daily use. Why pay more. Reliable. Dependable.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews on this and thought I would give it a try since I have very curly hair.  The product is just okay. Nothing special like I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> This is a nice hair mask. I used it after a week testing a crappy shampoo that turned my hair into a fuzzball. This mask gave back some of the shine and body that had been stripped away. It looked noticeably better after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An unexpected upside was that it really was nice on my dry scalp. Winter has been very drying and this made it feel better without leaving it coated or waxy.</li>
            <li> Oh how I wish I had this conditioning mask during the winter months! I have very fine hair that becomes dry, flyaway and full of static when it becomes cold. Since I started using this mask, I have found my hair to have more body and shine as well as no more static. Static is a huge problem for me during the cold months, so you can imagine my delight when I finally found something that worked in taming it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioning mask is thick and creamy and the suggested leave on time is 3-4 minutes, making it easy to use in the shower. I don&#x27;t use much, starting from about midway down to the roots, then massage what is left into the rest of my hair, then I comb through with a wide toothed comb, roll it up and continue with my shower. The mask rinses out nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a filmy feeling. It is certainly not as fussy as other deep conditioning products I&#x27;ve used in the past, and works about as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is a keeper for me!</li>
            <li> I have fine, but thick hair, and it tends to get really dry in the winter. This product works wonderfully to reduce breakage and soften my hair. The texture is thick, but not sticky and rinses out well.</li>
            <li> No complaints in our household for the Tresemme Renewal Hair and Scalp Deep Conditioning Mask. We&#x27;ve used up a couple bottles now and it works great. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I really like this deep conditioning mask.  I live in a dry climate, and have fragile hair, and this mask really worked to help some of the moisture.  It smells nice, and it didn&#x27;t leave a gross residue in my hair, like some hair masks do.  It did kind of weigh down my hair however, which I wasn&#x27;t a fan of.  So I wouldn&#x27;t use it on a day you want to go somewhere and have your hair look nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day after however, it was fine.  I would definitely use the product again!</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this product for my scalp alone.  It didn&#x27;t appear to do anything for my long hair, but I find it very soothing for my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with my head this winter, but my scalp has been feeling very itchy and dry.  I guess it&#x27;s just been a very hard winter and my scalp is feeling stressed.  So I tried the Tresemme Mask and it&#x27;s worked every time to moisturize and sooth my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have NOT found that it&#x27;s done wonders for my hair. I have long hair with just enough natural curl that if I don&#x27;t use a good conditioner that trying to comb it out is a nightmare.  This mask did nothing to help out and the two times I used it without following with a separate conditioner on the ends of my hair, I had to use twice as much detangler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;d recommend this product for a dry, unhappy scalp, but not for hair.</li>
            <li> This worked well for me - kept my hair nice and neat and frizz free until the next shampoo.  Best of all, no scent.  I don&#x27;t have to leave the bathroom smelling like a cosmetics line.</li>
            <li> I use deep conditioners on a regular basis, whenever my hair starts to look a little dull.  I love the way they breathe new life into my hair.  That&#x27;s why I was surprised when this product didn&#x27;t work at all.  I used as directed and my hair was exactly the same afterwards.  It was like I hadn&#x27;t conditioned at all.  Won&#x27;t be using again and don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used deep conditioning hair treatments before, but most of them focus on the hair and don&#x27;t consider the  needs of the scalp.  This mask takes care of both areas, moisturizing and healing the skin of the scalp without making it greasy while simultaneously treating dried-out hair.  After using for a couple of times, I noticed that it reduced the itchiness of my scalp.  It was also making my hair softer and easier to manage.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than once a week, because it is a bit sticky and it takes time to wash it all out from the roots, but the results are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Use it in lieu of your regular conditioner, I use it whenever I wash my hair. It moisturizes my scalp without making my hair oily or creating dandruff. I wonder why the main ingredients are WATER (AQUA) &amp; CETEARYL ALCOHOL? I figure alcohol would dry out my scalp and hair. hmmmm.  Maybe that&#x27;s why the directions say &amp;#34;For ultimate conditioning, use in addition to your regular conditioner&amp;#34;.  Certainly my hair is softer then if I had used shampoo alone. I apply alot to my 50 year old thick curly Irish head of hair.  I start at the tips/ends of my hair and work back to my scalp/roots.  I use my fingers and a wide-tooth comb to untangle and fully work the product into my hair. I leave it on while I bathe then rinse.</li>
            <li> The Tresemme Renewal Hair and Scalp deep conditioning mask works surprisingly well with my dry, 4a hair. I have super thick, coarse hair, and it makes my hair feel soft and manageable. It&#x27;s not oily and it has a nice, light smell. I will be purchasing this in the future.</li>
            <li> After one use, my hair felt fuller, healthier and thicker. I love the smell and the way it nourishes and softens my hair from root to tip! I love it!</li>
            <li> I do like this conditioner a lot, but it doesn&#x27;t feel deeply conditioning. More like extra conditioning. Somewhere between a good deep conditioner or hot oil treatment and regular hair conditioner but more towards the regular hair conditioner side. The plus side of that is that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down as much as a deep treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very happy with Tresemme products in the past, and I&#x27;m not unhappy with this one. For winter months, which are really harsh on my hair, this would be a good every other shampoo conditioner. The 3-4 minutes it needs according to the directions are worth the time if it helps prevent my hair from getting too dry.</li>
            <li> My husband tried this on his chlorine damaged salt and pepper gray hair.  It tends to be curly but the pool has been brutal on it, and frankly, he hates spending time on it.  I put this on and let it sit after the pool one day, like an hour.  He washed it out and wasn&#x27;t impressed, but after three different times, it was noticeably softer and didn&#x27;t look as much like a scrub brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice: reminds me of an Aveda product I tried before.  Sort of a manly scent, very unusual. Not medicine-y, just fresh.  I think it&#x27;s the tea tree oil that does that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my hair, which is long and color treated, it did fine but not as impressive as his.  Perhaps with more frequent use I can notice more results, but I&#x27;m pretty happy with Tresemme&#x27;s regular split ends shampoo and smoothing conditioner in the big bottles.</li>
            <li> This product does just what it says it does. My hair is so thick and dry that I used it every time I washed my hair. It never left build-up or made my hair oily. My only complaint is that I had to use a lot of this product with each use, which made it not last as long. Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li> This did not do anything for my hair.  My hair has damage just from bad products and not having a good beautician.  I used this in the shower and did not notice any difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long, very dry, color treated hair, and wash it maybe three,time,a week. This stuff is great!  I use it once a week and frizzies are a thing of the past.  It&#x27;s so nice to run a comb through wet hair without pulls and snags--and of course, the inevitable chunks of hair in t he comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that after use, though my hair feels wonderful, it does need to be washed more often.  Still, the scent is delightful, and the trade-off is worthwhile.  My hair looks and feels better than it has in years!</li>
            <li> Aweful new formula... My hair used to feel silky and smooth, now with this new formula, I had trouble passing a brush through it. I have been using their deep conditioner faithfully for years until now. I will need to look for something else. And how can there be almost no scent if there truly is tea tree added. Tea tree extract has a strong scent. Anyhow, just my 2cents. I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is an okay conditioner but after use my hair didn&#x27;t seem deeply conditioned or softer than when I use my normal conditioner. It&#x27;s an average mask that didn&#x27;t do much to help my hair which gets dry from heat accessories. I like some of the Tresemme products but I probably wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to purchase this. It worked like a cheaper conditioner on my hair. My hair is fine and dry on the ends and I saw no great improvements after using the Renewal Deep Conditioner Mask. Normally with a product like this, I notice my hair being fuller and more manageable but have seen little results after use and my hair was still dry with no noticeable conditioning attributes.</li>
            <li> This Tresemme Renewal Hair and Scalp mask worked really well on my shoulder length baby fine hair and it didn&#x27;t weigh it down at all. I have to be careful with conditioners because while some of them moisturize my hair and give it texture, they&#x27;re simply too heavy and leave it looking flat. This one didn&#x27;t do that at all. My hair is on the dry side and I can get by with washing it every other day, or sometimes even every third day. I need a little bit of added moisture every so often and this product does it well. I followed the directions and messaged it through my wet hair after shampooing. I used about a walnut sized amount the first time, but the product is rich enough that I used a lot less than that the next time.  I left it in my hair for 3 to 4 minutes and then rinsed and dried it as usual. The fragrance was nice, but sort of generic. It left a slight fragrance after drying, but not so much that it would interfere with my cologne. I like the way my hair looks after using and would consider purchasing more when this tube runs out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was just labeling but this conditioner  definitely seemed to have a better effect on my scalp than most conditioners.  It did this without being overly heavy on my thin fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also had a viscosity / texture that seemed easier to massage onto my scalp.</li>
            <li> I love the slightly pepperminty scent of tea tree oil, and I love the tingling that it brings to my scalp as it conditions my hair. This Tresemme Renewal Hair and Scalp Deep Conditioning Mask leaves a very pleasant scent in my hair that doesn&#x27;t smell at all perfume-y, making it an ideal product for both men and women. The product instructions suggest that you use it in place of, or in addition to, your regular conditioner, and they also suggested that you comb through your hair with your fingers or a comb to work it through to every strand. While these directions would easily work with any conditioner, I think combing through with my fingers really did help to detangle, not just in the shower, but afterwards, as well. My hair currently has a lovely shine to it, which I can at least partially attribute to this product.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter, who has very long, very tangly hair. She needs intense conditioning to keep it in good condition and to stop breakage from heavy brushing. I was disappointed with the results... it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything more than regular conditioner. Even after using a generous amount and leaving it in more than the suggested time, her hair was knotty and hard to comb through afterwards and looked no different once it was dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent was light and fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course all hair types are different and your mileage may vary, but we&#x27;ve had much better results from other deep conditioners before. This one didn&#x27;t pass our test.</li>
            <li> This product is fairly light for a &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; but it does a good job conditioning. A little goes a long way, and I really love the smell. It&#x27;s a  fresh fragrance that&#x27;s light and clean smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly dry hair that I wash about once a week in the winter and twice in the summer. I find this effective and lightweight for regular conditioning.</li>
