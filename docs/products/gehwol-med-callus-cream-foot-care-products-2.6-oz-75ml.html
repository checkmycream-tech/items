            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this cream!!</li>
            <li>Good product, just takes continuous use.</li>
            <li>Working good on my callus after battling it for a while.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t even have a chance to assess how well this cream dealt with calluses because the scent was so incredibly overpowering - like cheap cologne.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I know that is not the way to do it effectively.</li>
            <li>Thank you for this great product at a reasonable price!!</li>
            <li>I bought this and the salve for cracked skin and they are both good, although I don&#x27;t really think they help get rid of calluses, but do a good job of keeping your feet moisturized.</li>
            <li>Love this cream.  </li>
            <li>So maybe I need to give it more time r @</li>
            <li>This cream works miracles, and just in time for summer, I am callus free!</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many lotions on my crusty elbows.</li>
            <li>I found that Vaseline works better</li>
            <li>Love this cream.  </li>
            <li>My heel gets cracked easily.  </li>
            <li>I will never stop wearing high heels, so anything that helps is a good deal for me.</li>
            <li>Within 2 weeks of using Gehwol, my feet were smooth and free of calluses.</li>
            <li>Personally, I really like the smell, which is kind of herbal, but it may be offensive to some.</li>
            <li>Make sure the skin has healed first.</li>
            <li>so if you don&#x27;t mind strong scents give it a try, the other reviews are great</li>
            <li>They are now nice and soft and I hope to keep them that way.</li>
            <li>I would be happier if the price were more reasonable.</li>
            <li>I definitely will be buying more and telling my friends about!</li>
            <li>I may be a bit more sensitive than others</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has almost no fragrance, and soaks right in.  </li>
            <li>Mainly these are the products my pedicurist uses and my feet are fabulous when she finishes.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is magic - after using it for several weeks</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the first time I put it on.  </li>
            <li>Got relief after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>It really works on softening your feet!</li>
            <li>The calluses on my feet have softened enough so that walking is a lot more comfortable, so I will definitely continue using this</li>
            <li>There are many other competitively priced urea creams with higher percentages of urea.  </li>
            <li>This product works really well to soften calloused heels.  </li>
            <li>It really helps and it feels silky on your skin not greasy</li>
            <li>and it has really softened them.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this callus cream for use on the very heavy calluses that continuously build up on the bottoms and heels of my feet.  </li>
            <li>this point I am sure that only sanding off callus on regular bases works in conjunction with cream.</li>
            <li>Will keep on using for several more weeks for ultimate results.</li>
            <li>This one has a light masculine perfume scent and it&#x27;s German.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the end results after a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased, I only had a small callus but after 2 weeks of using the Gehwol callus cream it is almost gone, the skin is much softer.  </li>
            <li>So my feet take a beating, I was looking for something that would keep my feet soft in between pedi.  </li>
            <li>The cream does the job, although I may have to go through a vat of it since the bottoms of my feet are like old leather.</li>
            <li>Within 3 days, thick calluses that I have had on my hands for many years have softened and virtually disappeared.  </li>
            <li>It stings a little, but is well worth it!</li>
            <li>It feels at least as strong as the prescription version.  </li>
            <li>Within a month the hard, crusty skin is gone and now the elbows are smooth.</li>
            <li>Its ok but not great.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Such a difference in such a little time.</li>
            <li> Cream keeps skin moisturized for a very long time.</li>
            <li> My heels still fill dry and look dry.</li>
            <li> Have only been using for a few days but my heels were instantly smoother</li>
            <li> I am not sure I noticed any difference after nearly 2 months usage.</li>
            <li> So helpful to my dry skin!</li>
            <li> I get regular pedicures, but also workout heavily 3x&#x27;s a week.  </li>
            <li> Spent a lot of $$$ and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> really not strong enough but will continue to use it to see if I notice any differences in the condition of my feet.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t find Allontine much in other products.</li>
            <li> As a Diabetic, I have to be very careful concerning my feet.  </li>
            <li> Urea 18% is the active ingredient here.  </li>
            <li> Seems to break down callus over time.</li>
            <li> Though don&#x27;t use this on freshly cracked skin, that would be painful.</li>
            <li> If you have heavy calluses, I recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I did buff a few times.</li>
            <li> so I assume once you get past</li>
            <li> the least this can not hurt.</li>
            <li> I purchased it based on the advice of a friend who did some serious hiking in Europe.</li>
            <li> my feet (ravaged by years of running, a few bouts of athlete&#x27;s foot, refusal to get pedicures, and working on my feet) are so much less disgusting than they have been in a long time.</li>
            <li> This cream softens the skin on my feet, especially my heels , which tends to crack and be very painful.  </li>
            <li> Went to AZ for a week and came back with worst calluses ever.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to take the bad route of using some modified cheese grater on my feet.</li>
            <li> I am no longer embarrassed about my heels, and they are no longer cracked and painful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So helpful to my dry skin! I am a fan!</li>
            <li> Still using it, they recommend a Month,not there yet., have had some relief</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever stop using this.  Its just a great product.  I can control my callus issue when using this in between pedicures.  I will never stop wearing high heels, so anything that helps is a good deal for me.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it does. Within 2 weeks of using Gehwol, my feet were smooth and free of calluses. Love it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even have a chance to assess how well this cream dealt with calluses because the scent was so incredibly overpowering - like cheap cologne. I may be a bit more sensitive than others so if you don&#x27;t mind strong scents give it a try, the other reviews are great so I assume once you get past that it does a good job on calluses!</li>
            <li> The order of Gehwol Callus Cream was well packaged and received well within the time promised.  Very satisfied with this callus cream for use on the very heavy calluses that continuously build up on the bottoms and heels of my feet.  It softens and relieves much of the irritation that accompanies these heavy calluses.</li>
            <li> This works great, although it must be used twice a day</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic - after using it for several weeks my feet (ravaged by years of running, a few bouts of athlete&#x27;s foot, refusal to get pedicures, and working on my feet) are so much less disgusting than they have been in a long time. It definitely softens callouses and makes it easier to pumice them off. Personally, I really like the smell, which is kind of herbal, but it may be offensive to some.</li>
            <li> Used two days and lready a amrked improvement. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.  I have psoriasis on my feet and hands and it is an excellent cream for my cracked feet.</li>
            <li> I get regular pedicures, but also workout heavily 3x&#x27;s a week.  So my feet take a beating, I was looking for something that would keep my feet soft in between pedi.  I am not sure I noticed any difference after nearly 2 months usage. My heels still fill dry and look dry. without the regular pedi i think i would still have callus build up and cracked feet. @ this point I am sure that only sanding off callus on regular bases works in conjunction with cream. Would I order the product again probably yes. Mainly these are the products my pedicurist uses and my feet are fabulous when she finishes.  So maybe I need to give it more time r @ the least this can not hurt.</li>
            <li> Ick, callused feet are gross, and embarrassed to say, that I have them.  This cream works miracles, and just in time for summer, I am callus free! If you stop using the cream, they do come back, so I am ordering my next tube now!</li>
            <li> This cream is stronger than the foot softening creams and ointments made by companies like Dr. Scholls, Gold Bond, and others, so if you have sensitive feet or feet requiring extra care, I would be careful.  It feels at least as strong as the prescription version.  The cream does the job, although I may have to go through a vat of it since the bottoms of my feet are like old leather. :)  The calluses on my feet have softened enough so that walking is a lot more comfortable, so I will definitely continue using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has almost no fragrance, and soaks right in.  If you have heavy calluses, I recommend this product.  I would be cautious if you&#x27;re diabetic, but also have to add here that I am NOT a doctor.</li>
            <li> Within 3 days, thick calluses that I have had on my hands for many years have softened and virtually disappeared.  It stings a little, but is well worth it!</li>
            <li> Good product, just takes continuous use.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness helpful.  Went to AZ for a week and came back with worst calluses ever.  Provides immediate relief.  Seems to break down callus over time.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the salve for cracked skin and they are both good, although I don&#x27;t really think they help get rid of calluses, but do a good job of keeping your feet moisturized.</li>
            <li> Have only been using for a few days but my heels were instantly smoother</li>
            <li> My heel gets cracked easily.  I have tried numerous creams over the years.  Spent a lot of $$$ and nothing worked.  So then I have to avoid wearing sandals during the summer for this reason.  I am so happy to have found this cream.  I noticed a difference the first time I put it on.  I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the end results after a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> Best foot cream I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Working good on my callus after battling it for a while. Got relief after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> This works great! Saw a post about it on Pinterest!</li>
            <li> Truly works miracles!!! Such a difference in such a little time. Love it! And has a great smell!</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased, I only had a small callus but after 2 weeks of using the Gehwol callus cream it is almost gone, the skin is much softer.  Will keep on using for several more weeks for ultimate results.</li>
            <li> This product works really well to soften calloused heels.  My callouses split and I used this product with lava stones, callous cream, and  gel socks to finally get my heels to stop bleeding and hurting.  They are now nice and soft and I hope to keep them that way.</li>
            <li> Urea 18% is the active ingredient here.  There are many other competitively priced urea creams with higher percentages of urea.  This one has a light masculine perfume scent and it&#x27;s German.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many lotions on my crusty elbows. I finally tried this although it was not mentioned for elbows. Within a month the hard, crusty skin is gone and now the elbows are smooth. I did buff a few times. Cream keeps skin moisturized for a very long time.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. You don&#x27;t find Allontine much in other products. Recommend it greatly for people with callus.</li>
            <li> Its ok but not great.  really not strong enough but will continue to use it to see if I notice any differences in the condition of my feet.  I found that Vaseline works better</li>
            <li> Love this cream.  Best I have ever used to treat my running calluses.  Thank you for this great product at a reasonable price!!</li>
            <li> I love this cream!! It really works on softening your feet! I definitely will be buying more and telling my friends about!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. It really helps and it feels silky on your skin not greasy</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I purchased it based on the advice of a friend who did some serious hiking in Europe. I have never been one to get callouses on my feet, but I have one on both heels these days. I didn&#x27;t want to take the bad route of using some modified cheese grater on my feet. I know that is not the way to do it effectively. I have been using this cream at night for about two weeks and it has really softened them. I am no longer embarrassed about my heels, and they are no longer cracked and painful. Though don&#x27;t use this on freshly cracked skin, that would be painful. Make sure the skin has healed first.</li>
            <li> As a Diabetic, I have to be very careful concerning my feet.  This cream softens the skin on my feet, especially my heels , which tends to crack and be very painful.  This heightens the risk of infection.  The Gehwol Cream does an excellent job.  I am very happy with its performance.  I would be happier if the price were more reasonable.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that clears up my cracked heels.  Worth every penny.</li>
