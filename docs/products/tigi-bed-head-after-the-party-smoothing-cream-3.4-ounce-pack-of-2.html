            <li>I have the most unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li>and I love</li>
            <li>I like to put it in my hair when it&#x27;s damp or right after finishing straightening it to get a really good shine</li>
            <li>This package of two is a great value for such an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I use it before I blow dry my hair and it works great!</li>
            <li>I have tried many products to help smooth the frizzies.  </li>
            <li>This package deal is really nice and economical</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much</li>
            <li>(this could easily be through my laziness/ignorance at using said product)</li>
            <li>Received product very quickly.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and makes your hair even more amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>I used it on my curls the day after, and it did add nice shine, but didn&#x27;t do much to help control frizz or make my hair look redone.</li>
            <li>This cream leave your hair so smooth it feels like angels were brushing it for 1000 years.</li>
            <li>The price of the 2 pack was fabulous and I use this product every day.</li>

            <li>Fabulous product.</li>
            <li>Great double deal price!!</li>
            <li>Also, my daughter&#x27;s hair is unruly and this makes it smooth.</li>
            <li>Once I put this product in my hair, it is so smooth</li>
            <li>This stuff is the really deal, the price is awesome too considering if you were paying regular retail it would cost $17 just for one bottle.</li>
            <li>I actually need to buy more!!</li>
            <li>Just make sure you don&#x27;t clump it all in one place, instead smooth it around in your hands first, then work from the bottom of your hair up.</li>
            <li>The smell is sweet, but not annoying.</li>
            <li>Works great on damp or dry hair</li>
            <li>I use it after using heating products and it helps my hair feel soft and smell amazingly well.</li>
            <li>this smells amazing, and makes your hair sooo soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good reviews about it, but obviously it just isn&#x27;t for my hair type.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and makes my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>I have straight hair and have issues with static electricity.</li>
            <li>Light and fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>great for after styling to smooth down some flyaways.</li>
            <li>It smells great and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy like some other products.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>This is a great product, one of the few that actually smooth&#x27;s my hair.  </li>
            <li>Simple, fast, and leaves my hair looking great.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful, makes my hair smooth no fly away hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d asked my stylist how to prevent brittle split ends from forming so quickly after my cuts, and he recommended this product.</li>
            <li>I spend a lot of money on my hair and I have tried many, many different hair products.</li>
            <li>this product from the very first time i smelled and used it.</li>
            <li>I only need to wash my hair every three-days and on day two and three I pump a little on to my hands and run it through my hair to calm the fly-aways, remove static, and for the delicious smell!</li>
            <li>It felt like glass.soft shiny like a new head of hair.. 10x better that the Jon Freida</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it say does!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I have been using this smoothing cream for almost ten years now and love it!</li>
            <li>and I really like the light scent and softness of my hair afterwards.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite thus far.  </li>
            <li>I promise it&#x27;s worth investing the money in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love to change my hair frequently with dye and perms, which results in frizzy split ends.  </li>
            <li>I have thin fly away hair!  </li>
            <li>Favorite product so far from Bed Head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it though since it&#x27;s the very best thing going to tame that party hair!!!</li>
            <li>I use it after blow-drying right before flat-ironing my hair, its even awesome if you put it in wet hair and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li>price was high but worth every dime!</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and this keeps my curls nice and soft (not crunchy) without frizziness.</li>
            <li>and it still isn&#x27;t smooth and silky, but two seconds spent applying this product under my hair and smoothed over the top</li>
            <li>After Party makes your hair soft and easy to style.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Thanks sooo much!!</li>
            <li>At first glance i didnt read the directions and applied it to my Damp hair like a leave in conditoner.(altho</li>
            <li>or so I was trying to figure out exactly what it was</li>
            <li>I only give it four stars because I have used better products for the price.  </li>
            <li>I just love trying out different things, but I ALWAYS have this on hand.</li>
            <li>First of all, it is a finishing cream -</li>
            <li>The shape if rather comical since it reminds me of a male&#x27;s you-know-what ;</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Have tried many others but always come back to Bed Head After Party.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what was promised.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>and it dries to be extremely soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>And I get two for the same price stores charge for ONE!!:)</li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy it as much as I have the past decade :)!</li>
            <li>Love this, I have dry, colored, heat processed hair and it leaves it smooth and soft with out any feeling of something being in my hair!</li>
            <li>Smooths down flyaways amazing well.</li>
            <li>and putting it on dry will also make your hair extremely soft, shiny and healthy looking!</li>
            <li>This is a miracle product I cannot live without!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of BedHead products, but I&#x27;m definitely a believer in this one.</li>
            <li>and I came straight to Amazon to stock-up.</li>
            <li>I have short and curly hair, so my primary concern is keeping the curls from separating and frizzing out.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair and it really helps with the frizzes.  </li>
            <li>I have somewhat frizzy hair, and this relaxes it very well..</li>
            <li>The formula made my hair feel silky, but did not do too much else.</li>
            <li>My hair reaches the middle of my back, and I rarely need more than one pump of this.  </li>
            <li>And it really has made a difference in terms of shine, texture, and preventing split ends.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li>and my hair still looked decently smooth, but it definitely needed a pick-me-up.</li>
            <li>Also, you don&#x27;t need much  of an application when you do use it.</li>
            <li>looks like I spent time on my hair :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely ¢¾Loved¢¾</li>
            <li>Really helped my hair.</li>
            <li>I have a very oily scalp</li>
            <li>I really like the Bed Head line of products.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I use this product immediately after I flat iron it to smooth all the fly-aways and baby hair.</li>
            <li>It somehow melts all the first-day product out of my hair, leaving it silky and wavy, and with only one pump&#x27;s worth of product!  </li>
            <li>the name states, this is intended for use on second and third day hair - to remove the smell from the party :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly Reccomended for all hair types</li>
            <li>Friends and family have urged me to try many products they have laying around, and I have, and not been the least bit interested... until this.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and not much needed to do the trick !</li>
            <li>Cannot live without this product.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t leave that wet look and still feels super soft!!</li>
            <li>It keeps your hair shiney and tangle free, but, doesn&#x27;t make it feel dirty, which is why I love it so much.</li>
            <li>My hair feels silky and soft!</li>
            <li>My hair is amazingly soft!  </li>
            <li>it makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth and silky but not weighed down.</li>
            <li>it smells great and helps smooth down my crazy hair.</li>
            <li>I had trouble finding this product in stores, luckily I found it on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>I tried the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; stuff everyone raves about and it made my hair feel stiff kind of after it was dry, like it had a bunch of product in it, but I didn&#x27;t use a bunch.</li>
            <li>This item is hard to find in stores and I&#x27;m glad to get it here</li>
            <li>Works better than any serum I&#x27;ve tried and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair icky.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so shiny soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it makes your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me except to straighten my natural wave.</li>
            <li>LEAVES IT SOFT AND MANAGEABLE.  </li>
            <li>Hair stays soft and there is no build up.</li>
            <li>My hair is never frizzy anymore, it&#x27;s soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>only wish the &amp;#34;Biggie&amp;#34; was more readily available, the regular size doesn&#x27;t last that long and a little on the spendy side.</li>
            <li>t even use conditioner now, i just put a quarter size of this in my hair right after the shower while it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li>My hair is prone to flyaways and frizzies, so it&#x27;s important that I have a product to tame them.  </li>
            <li>I use this periodically on my damp almost dry hair to blow dry it smooth.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really read the directions at first, so I put it in my hair after I showered, then I blow dried it.</li>
            <li>Be careful though because if you use too much your hair will look greasy!</li>
            <li>I use cheap shampoo/condition, use basic soap, and generally just tie my hair back wet.</li>
            <li>Now when they use it on my hair at the saloon to blow dry my hair straight</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair smooth, instead of that dry, damaged look a lot of blondes have, but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily looking or weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>Live this product, I use it to protect my ends before flat ironing or curling my hair.</li>
            <li>this is SO much cheaper than buying at Ulta or other beauty stores).</li>
            <li>I also use it on dry hair, but it seems to work a little better when I apply it wet.</li>
            <li>It also smells  delisions, very subtle smell, which i love.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and keeps away the frizzes all day long.</li>
            <li>This smooths it out without weighing it down, letting the wave do its freaky thing without crossing into frizz town and making my fried ends look much healthier than they have any call to.</li>
            <li>This product is a miracle on DRY hair, preferably hair that has been all fixed up, then slept in.  </li>
            <li>I have waist length, super thick hair and this product smooths it out and tames the hair cuticle</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft every single time I use After Party.</li>
            <li>I always use this only on my dry hair after straightening or wearing it natural.</li>
            <li>It will never be greasy if you only apply a half a pump to whole pump.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser puts it on when my hair is wet, but I&#x27;ve found it very beneficial to put on dry when my hair is going everywhere.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>have also used after dried and styled hair and WOW is it soft and manageable!  </li>
            <li>I use it to smooth and condition my hair after blow-drying; also on weekends, just a little dab before ponytail or messy</li>

            <li> I have the most unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> and I love</li>
            <li> I like to put it in my hair when it&#x27;s damp or right after finishing straightening it to get a really good shine</li>
            <li> This package of two is a great value for such an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I use it before I blow dry my hair and it works great!</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to help smooth the frizzies.  </li>
            <li> This package deal is really nice and economical</li>
            <li> and I loved it so much</li>
            <li> (this could easily be through my laziness/ignorance at using said product)</li>
            <li> Received product very quickly.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and makes your hair even more amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> I used it on my curls the day after, and it did add nice shine, but didn&#x27;t do much to help control frizz or make my hair look redone.</li>
            <li> This cream leave your hair so smooth it feels like angels were brushing it for 1000 years.</li>

            <li> Also, my daughter&#x27;s hair is unruly and this makes it smooth.</li>
            <li> Once I put this product in my hair, it is so smooth</li>
            <li> This stuff is the really deal, the price is awesome too considering if you were paying regular retail it would cost $17 just for one bottle.</li>
            <li> I actually need to buy more!!</li>
            <li> Just make sure you don&#x27;t clump it all in one place, instead smooth it around in your hands first, then work from the bottom of your hair up.</li>
            <li> The smell is sweet, but not annoying.</li>
            <li> Works great on damp or dry hair</li>
            <li> I use it after using heating products and it helps my hair feel soft and smell amazingly well.</li>
            <li> this smells amazing, and makes your hair sooo soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good reviews about it, but obviously it just isn&#x27;t for my hair type.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and makes my hair soft.  </li>
            <li> I have straight hair and have issues with static electricity.</li>
            <li> Light and fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> great for after styling to smooth down some flyaways.</li>
            <li> It smells great and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy like some other products.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, one of the few that actually smooth&#x27;s my hair.  </li>
            <li> Simple, fast, and leaves my hair looking great.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful, makes my hair smooth no fly away hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d asked my stylist how to prevent brittle split ends from forming so quickly after my cuts, and he recommended this product.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of money on my hair and I have tried many, many different hair products.</li>
            <li> this product from the very first time i smelled and used it.</li>
            <li> I only need to wash my hair every three-days and on day two and three I pump a little on to my hands and run it through my hair to calm the fly-aways, remove static, and for the delicious smell!</li>
            <li> It felt like glass.soft shiny like a new head of hair.. 10x better that the Jon Freida</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it say does!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this smoothing cream for almost ten years now and love it!</li>
            <li> and I really like the light scent and softness of my hair afterwards.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite thus far.  </li>
            <li> I promise it&#x27;s worth investing the money in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love to change my hair frequently with dye and perms, which results in frizzy split ends.  </li>
            <li> I have thin fly away hair!  </li>
            <li> Favorite product so far from Bed Head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it though since it&#x27;s the very best thing going to tame that party hair!!!</li>
            <li> I use it after blow-drying right before flat-ironing my hair, its even awesome if you put it in wet hair and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> price was high but worth every dime!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and this keeps my curls nice and soft (not crunchy) without frizziness.</li>
            <li> and it still isn&#x27;t smooth and silky, but two seconds spent applying this product under my hair and smoothed over the top</li>
            <li> After Party makes your hair soft and easy to style.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Thanks sooo much!!</li>
            <li> At first glance i didnt read the directions and applied it to my Damp hair like a leave in conditoner.(altho</li>
            <li> or so I was trying to figure out exactly what it was</li>
            <li> I only give it four stars because I have used better products for the price.  </li>
            <li> I just love trying out different things, but I ALWAYS have this on hand.</li>
            <li> First of all, it is a finishing cream -</li>
            <li> The shape if rather comical since it reminds me of a male&#x27;s you-know-what ;</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Have tried many others but always come back to Bed Head After Party.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what was promised.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> and it dries to be extremely soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> And I get two for the same price stores charge for ONE!!:)</li>
            <li> Hope you enjoy it as much as I have the past decade :)!</li>
            <li> Love this, I have dry, colored, heat processed hair and it leaves it smooth and soft with out any feeling of something being in my hair!</li>
            <li> Smooths down flyaways amazing well.</li>
            <li> and putting it on dry will also make your hair extremely soft, shiny and healthy looking!</li>
            <li> This is a miracle product I cannot live without!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of BedHead products, but I&#x27;m definitely a believer in this one.</li>
            <li> and I came straight to Amazon to stock-up.</li>
            <li> I have short and curly hair, so my primary concern is keeping the curls from separating and frizzing out.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it really helps with the frizzes.  </li>
            <li> I have somewhat frizzy hair, and this relaxes it very well..</li>
            <li> The formula made my hair feel silky, but did not do too much else.</li>
            <li> My hair reaches the middle of my back, and I rarely need more than one pump of this.  </li>
            <li> And it really has made a difference in terms of shine, texture, and preventing split ends.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> and my hair still looked decently smooth, but it definitely needed a pick-me-up.</li>
            <li> Also, you don&#x27;t need much  of an application when you do use it.</li>
            <li> looks like I spent time on my hair :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely ¢¾Loved¢¾</li>
            <li> Really helped my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a very oily scalp</li>
            <li> I really like the Bed Head line of products.  </li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product immediately after I flat iron it to smooth all the fly-aways and baby hair.</li>
            <li> It somehow melts all the first-day product out of my hair, leaving it silky and wavy, and with only one pump&#x27;s worth of product!  </li>
            <li> the name states, this is intended for use on second and third day hair - to remove the smell from the party :)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly Reccomended for all hair types</li>
            <li> Friends and family have urged me to try many products they have laying around, and I have, and not been the least bit interested... until this.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and not much needed to do the trick !</li>
            <li> Cannot live without this product.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t leave that wet look and still feels super soft!!</li>
            <li> It keeps your hair shiney and tangle free, but, doesn&#x27;t make it feel dirty, which is why I love it so much.</li>
            <li> My hair feels silky and soft!</li>
            <li> My hair is amazingly soft!  </li>
            <li> it makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smooth and silky but not weighed down.</li>
            <li> it smells great and helps smooth down my crazy hair.</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding this product in stores, luckily I found it on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> I tried the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; stuff everyone raves about and it made my hair feel stiff kind of after it was dry, like it had a bunch of product in it, but I didn&#x27;t use a bunch.</li>
            <li> This item is hard to find in stores and I&#x27;m glad to get it here</li>
            <li> Works better than any serum I&#x27;ve tried and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair icky.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so shiny soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it makes your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me except to straighten my natural wave.</li>
            <li> LEAVES IT SOFT AND MANAGEABLE.  </li>
            <li> Hair stays soft and there is no build up.</li>
            <li> My hair is never frizzy anymore, it&#x27;s soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> only wish the &amp;#34;Biggie&amp;#34; was more readily available, the regular size doesn&#x27;t last that long and a little on the spendy side.</li>
            <li> t even use conditioner now, i just put a quarter size of this in my hair right after the shower while it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> My hair is prone to flyaways and frizzies, so it&#x27;s important that I have a product to tame them.  </li>
            <li> I use this periodically on my damp almost dry hair to blow dry it smooth.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really read the directions at first, so I put it in my hair after I showered, then I blow dried it.</li>
            <li> Be careful though because if you use too much your hair will look greasy!</li>
            <li> I use cheap shampoo/condition, use basic soap, and generally just tie my hair back wet.</li>
            <li> Now when they use it on my hair at the saloon to blow dry my hair straight</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair smooth, instead of that dry, damaged look a lot of blondes have, but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily looking or weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> Live this product, I use it to protect my ends before flat ironing or curling my hair.</li>
            <li> this is SO much cheaper than buying at Ulta or other beauty stores).</li>
            <li> I also use it on dry hair, but it seems to work a little better when I apply it wet.</li>
            <li> It also smells  delisions, very subtle smell, which i love.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and keeps away the frizzes all day long.</li>
            <li> This smooths it out without weighing it down, letting the wave do its freaky thing without crossing into frizz town and making my fried ends look much healthier than they have any call to.</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle on DRY hair, preferably hair that has been all fixed up, then slept in.  </li>
            <li> I have waist length, super thick hair and this product smooths it out and tames the hair cuticle</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft every single time I use After Party.</li>
            <li> I always use this only on my dry hair after straightening or wearing it natural.</li>
            <li> It will never be greasy if you only apply a half a pump to whole pump.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser puts it on when my hair is wet, but I&#x27;ve found it very beneficial to put on dry when my hair is going everywhere.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> have also used after dried and styled hair and WOW is it soft and manageable!  </li>
            <li> I use it to smooth and condition my hair after blow-drying; also on weekends, just a little dab before ponytail or messy</li>
            <li> It is thick but not greasy and doesn&#x27;t weigh down even my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair, so it&#x27;s also a plus that one bottle will last for months!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s then only thing I have found that gives me volume all day long</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this product with my last haircut &amp; my dry, frizzy summer hair became silky that day.</li>
            <li> I agree with not using it on completely wet hair because of missing the point of the product but absolutely nothing happens if I just add it to my hair dry the next morning</li>
            <li> You CAN use this on towel dried hair, just be careful to not use too much.  </li>
            <li> I use it on dry hair (blow dried or mid day) and it makes my hair soft and shiny and silky.</li>
            <li> have tried other products that are cheaper, but this seems to be the only thing that actually works.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dry, wavy hair that I have to flat-iron daily to wear it straight.</li>
            <li> I them blow dry and flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Myself and 2 daughters all have long hair and we go through hair products like water...</li>
            <li> I use a tiny tiny bit (one little squirt) while my hair is damp.  </li>
            <li> I finally have that coveted shiny hair that everyone envies, and at minimal effort!</li>
            <li> my hair is blond, dry and over processed.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dry and somewhat damaged from lots of highlights.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t make it feel like it has product in it after it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> so, you&#x27;re using it on dry hair.</li>
            <li> O lyrics use when your hair is dry though.</li>
            <li> The (Pack of 2) arrived as 1 single 3.4 ounce item instead of 2.  </li>
            <li> This product made my dry unmanageable hair feel soft and looked unbelievably shiny.</li>
            <li> Apply from mid head and down.  </li>
            <li> (my hair is similar to Elle Varner&#x27;s, except my curls are slightly looser)</li>
            <li> I use about a half a pump and apply the product from the mid shaft of my hair to the ends.</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY DRY HAIR--</li>
            <li> This is the fastest, easiest way to control the friz and damaged ends on mornings, leaving natural-looking curls or waves where I&#x27;d previously only had a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> I put it on  my hair when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> I use this product when my hair is wet and after I straighten  it to smoothe the fly-aways.  </li>
            <li> hair is blonde, not too fine or thick with a bit of waviness prone to frizzy weird curls on my hairline, and a little fried from sun and dye.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with After Party.  </li>
            <li> I saw a single bottle of this at Walgreens yesterday for over 20 dollars--this is TWO for less than 15.</li>
            <li> never happened with any other product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I use this product to add extra volume to my thin flat hair.</li>
            <li> I always put oil (usually by Oils of Aloha) at the tips of my hair when still wet after a shower, and then use the After Party throughout when still wet or semi-wet.</li>
            <li> I apply it to damp hair and then blow dry and style as usual.</li>
            <li> I purchased and my package came within less than 2 days.</li>
            <li> saved almost half buying the two pack on amazon.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> When I found it here for less</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair tamed all day long and doesn&#x27;t make it the least bit greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t look like a frizzed out mess.</li>
            <li> However, you need just a little bit.</li>
            <li> I use a little bit of it before blow drying and some after.</li>
            <li> It just makes it a little smoother, that&#x27;s all.  </li>
            <li> It smooths without being heavy.</li>
            <li> I would be really disappointed if this were true because this is truly a staple in my hair care</li>
            <li> the directions say otherwise)when  my hair finally dried to my surprise..</li>
            <li> It dried out my hair, so i had to wash it out.</li>
            <li> I have made a few impulse tigi buys in my time and find that i&#x27;m a curmudgeon-</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using Bed Head After Party on freshly-washed hair, you&#x27;re missing the point.  </li>
            <li> A few years ago a stylist recommended this product to me and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> I searched on Amazon and found this deal-2 bottles for the price of less than 1!</li>
            <li> and I had been using oil-based products to tame my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have straightened my hair every day for the past 6 years</li>
            <li> After I shower and let it dry, it is so frizzy and just not nice looking, even if I straighten it its still just not great looking.</li>
            <li> It does not leave your hair feeling hard.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and could not get rid of the frizz.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 10 years seriously since i was 17.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and a bottle lasts me about 4 months.</li>
            <li> I usually pay around $18-$19 for ONE!!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I opened the package and saw that both of the bottoms where a little broken, like the cream was about to seep through however the dispenser worked so they are usable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I gave all the credit to the bed head product.</li>
            <li> Im guessing it might of been the cold weather and being tossed around</li>
            <li> Think bad second-day hair.  </li>
            <li> I was getting really frustrated because my the bleached ends looked and felt like hay, so</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product, one of the few that actually smooth&#x27;s my hair.  In the salons one of these bottles costs $20!  To get two of them for that price is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to help smooth the frizzies.  This has been my favorite thus far.  It smooths without being heavy.</li>
            <li> I use After Party on a daily basis. I have thick, dry, wavy hair that I have to flat-iron daily to wear it straight. I use this product immediately after I flat iron it to smooth all the fly-aways and baby hair. I only need to wash my hair every three-days and on day two and three I pump a little on to my hands and run it through my hair to calm the fly-aways, remove static, and for the delicious smell! It refreshes my hair and I love to catch wiffs of the smoothing creme during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the name states, this is intended for use on second and third day hair - to remove the smell from the party :) It does a great job of that but also is a great all-around product. I heard recently Toni &amp; Guy were discontinuing the Bed Head line and I came straight to Amazon to stock-up. I would be really disappointed if this were true because this is truly a staple in my hair care regiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and feeling wonderful! This is a great deal! I have left this product and always come back to it. Works better than any serum I&#x27;ve tried and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair icky. However, you need just a little bit.</li>
            <li> Love this, I have dry, colored, heat processed hair and it leaves it smooth and soft with out any feeling of something being in my hair!</li>
            <li> I have short and curly hair, so my primary concern is keeping the curls from separating and frizzing out.  This works perfectly, and if you touched my hair you would NEVER know I used any product.  I ordered a ton of it.</li>
            <li> my hair is blond, dry and over processed.  this makes my hair look like a million dollars with lots  of shine.  love love</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream.  It smells great and works wonderfully.  I have curly hair and it really helps with the frizzes.  Will keep buying.</li>
            <li> This has been one of my favorite hair care products for YEARS. I have naturally curly hair, and this keeps my curls nice and soft (not crunchy) without frizziness. I always put oil (usually by Oils of Aloha) at the tips of my hair when still wet after a shower, and then use the After Party throughout when still wet or semi-wet. Simple, fast, and leaves my hair looking great. Smells good too!  I also use it on dry hair, but it seems to work a little better when I apply it wet.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> After Party has to be one of my favorite hair products of all time.  Besides the fact that it smells great, it really is great as smoothing my hair.  My hair is prone to flyaways and frizzies, so it&#x27;s important that I have a product to tame them.  A little goes a long way with After Party.  It leaves my hair tamed all day long and doesn&#x27;t make it the least bit greasy or weighed down. I have really long hair, so it&#x27;s also a plus that one bottle will last for months!  This is a produc that I will never be without!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with After party after I tried it in a store. However, I did not want to pay $20 for one bottle. I searched on Amazon and found this deal-2 bottles for the price of less than 1! I purchased and my package came within less than 2 days. Great product and a satisfactory seller!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly!!!  I would recommend this product to anyone.  I have somewhat frizzy hair, and this relaxes it very well..</li>
            <li> ok so where do I begin? A friend of mine left this at my place by accident and boy was that a mistake. Ive been hooked since day one! It does it all, conditions, protects and softens while ironing. At first glance i didnt read the directions and applied it to my Damp hair like a leave in conditoner.(altho the directions say otherwise)when  my hair finally dried to my surprise.. It felt like glass.soft shiny like a new head of hair.. 10x better that the Jon Freida \\&quot;sERum\\&quot; .once i ironed it Viola! silky str8 hair  that smells like fruit punch! USE sPARINGLY about 1 pea size to 2 pea sized pumps..depending on hair length.. one bottle lasts me 2 yrs and i have med length hair..Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!  My hair is dry and somewhat damaged from lots of highlights.  I use it on dry hair (blow dried or mid day) and it makes my hair soft and shiny and silky. It also smells  delisions, very subtle smell, which i love.  I thnk what i like most about this product is that it makes my hair look very healthy (which its not).  Get it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> The formula made my hair feel silky, but did not do too much else. I used it on my curls the day after, and it did add nice shine, but didn&#x27;t do much to help control frizz or make my hair look redone. I&#x27;ve heard a lot of good reviews about it, but obviously it just isn&#x27;t for my hair type. (my hair is similar to Elle Varner&#x27;s, except my curls are slightly looser)</li>
            <li> I love this product..  It keeps your hair shiney and tangle free, but, doesn&#x27;t make it feel dirty, which is why I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Live this product, I use it to protect my ends before flat ironing or curling my hair. I have seen a difference since I began using it, stronger and healthier looking hair</li>
            <li> saved almost half buying the two pack on amazon.  Great smell and really smooths and gets the tangles out of my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> This product smells great but thats about it. It dried out my hair, so i had to wash it out.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for taming my unruly hair. It is smooth and not much needed to do the trick !</li>
            <li> this stuff is like liquid gold for your hair. Smells amazing and makes your hair even more amazingly soft. My hair can be unbelievebly frizzy at times and this is the only stuff that can fix it. This package of two is a great value for such an amazing product.</li>
            <li> If you thinking about purchasing this product, go for it! I love this stuff and can&#x27;t live without it! I&#x27;ve been using this for about 10 years now. I always use this only on my dry hair after straightening or wearing it natural. Makes my hair so shiny soft and silky. I use about a half a pump and apply the product from the mid shaft of my hair to the ends. It will never be greasy if you only apply a half a pump to whole pump. I promise it&#x27;s worth investing the money in. Smells great as well! I hope and pray they never discontinue this product! Hope you enjoy it as much as I have the past decade :)!</li>
            <li> very smooth leaves hair feeling really good even on color treated hair</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Smooths down flyaways amazing well. And smells wonderful!!! Five star item!!!! Definitely keep this on hand! So worth the money!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft every single time I use After Party. I apply it to damp hair and then blow dry and style as usual. I have tried many products, but this stuff is the best, I got a great deal and am so happy with my purchase. - Kelly</li>
            <li> I have made a few impulse tigi buys in my time and find that i&#x27;m a curmudgeon- I find the smells cloying and somewhat chemical, and the products themselves have not wowed me (this could easily be through my laziness/ignorance at using said product) but this...this is different. The smell is sweet, but not annoying. I literally just put a tiny dab and run it through my hair, simplicity itself.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is blonde, not too fine or thick with a bit of waviness prone to frizzy weird curls on my hairline, and a little fried from sun and dye. This smooths it out without weighing it down, letting the wave do its freaky thing without crossing into frizz town and making my fried ends look much healthier than they have any call to. Hooray for triumph of hope over experience.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, for a year or so I was trying to figure out exactly what it was, I don&#x27;t think it was written on the bottle until semi recently. As soon as I saw it was smoothing cream I had to get some and this is the best smoothing cream I have used to date, besides the Tigi rockaholic smoothing cream, which I can&#x27;t find any where any more.</li>
            <li> This product makes your hair look and feel wonderfully smooth! It&#x27;s great for both men and women. Great for flyaways!</li>
            <li> The (Pack of 2) arrived as 1 single 3.4 ounce item instead of 2.  I would not have ordered this item if it were only 1, there is no savings.</li>
            <li> Good price.  Excellent product</li>
            <li> Having the name &amp;#34;after the party smoothing cream&amp;#34; you&#x27;d think there&#x27;s something magical in this product. WELL THERE IS! This cream leave your hair so smooth it feels like angels were brushing it for 1000 years. It also smells like mermaid kisses.</li>
            <li> The product is great and is listed at such a great price on amazon! Most stores ask around $20 for one bottle!!! This package deal is really nice and economical</li>
            <li> Smells nice and makes my hair soft.  I only give it four stars because I have used better products for the price.  Very interesting bottle when you take off the cap! lol</li>
            <li> Cannot live without this product.  The price of the 2 pack was fabulous and I use this product every day.</li>
            <li> You get a lot of product for your money.  The bottles are much larger than ones I see in the retail stores.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist used this on my hair for styling and I really like the light scent and softness of my hair afterwards.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT product and the PRICE!!!!! WOW!!! I have been paying $20 for ONE bottle all these years!!! Thanks sooo much!! Great price, and a FANTASTIC product!!</li>
            <li> I like this product because it makes your hair soft and shiny. The hair dresser used it and it really styled my hair nicely.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time. It makes my hair shiny and less frizzy. I love it.</li>
            <li> I JUST GOT THIS AND I BOUGHT IT ON THE 28 ! JUST GOT IT IN AND LOVE IT !</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using Bed Head After Party on freshly-washed hair, you&#x27;re missing the point.  This product is a miracle on DRY hair, preferably hair that has been all fixed up, then slept in.  Think bad second-day hair.  That&#x27;s when you reach for this stuff.  It somehow melts all the first-day product out of my hair, leaving it silky and wavy, and with only one pump&#x27;s worth of product!  My hair reaches the middle of my back, and I rarely need more than one pump of this.  It is GREAT.</li>
            <li> great for after styling to smooth down some flyaways. great smell and feel on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;this was a great value for the price. I think I will not run out of this for about 5 years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 5 years&lt;br /&gt;  It is wonderful, makes my hair smooth no fly away hair. I put it on  my hair when it&#x27;s wet&lt;br /&gt;  Love this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d asked my stylist how to prevent brittle split ends from forming so quickly after my cuts, and he recommended this product. I love it. It is thick but not greasy and doesn&#x27;t weigh down even my fine hair. He recommended applying after towel drying and rubbing through the ends, up to but not over the scalp. And it really has made a difference in terms of shine, texture, and preventing split ends.</li>
            <li> Use this all the time on my hair after drying and curling. It gives a great shine&lt;br /&gt;Manages hair well.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of money on my hair and I have tried many, many different hair products. I just love trying out different things, but I ALWAYS have this on hand. there is nothing else that compares to this stuff! I use it before I blow dry my hair and it works great! It keeps my hair smooth, instead of that dry, damaged look a lot of blondes have, but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily looking or weigh my hair down. It also doesn&#x27;t make it feel like it has product in it after it&#x27;s dry. I tried the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; stuff everyone raves about and it made my hair feel stiff kind of after it was dry, like it had a bunch of product in it, but I didn&#x27;t use a bunch. I&#x27;ve used after party for years now and it&#x27;s the one hair product I never go without!</li>
            <li> This product made my dry unmanageable hair feel soft and looked unbelievably shiny. G&lt;br /&gt;The price was high but worth every dime!</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and could not get rid of the frizz. This product does exactly what it say does! My hair feels silky and soft! That&#x27;s  never happened with any other product. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> Smells great and controls frizz.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you my hair-schpiel. I have straightened my hair every day for the past 6 years, I have highlighted it, bleached the ends...yeah you get the picture. I was getting really frustrated because my the bleached ends looked and felt like hay, so my roommate let me borrow her After Party cream. I didn&#x27;t really read the directions at first, so I put it in my hair after I showered, then I blow dried it. THIS IS WHERE THE MAGIC HAPPENED. I don&#x27;t know what they put in this stuff, but I&#x27;m definitely not complaining. My hair was smooth...my bleached ends looked like my hair again! I was so happy. But the magic didn&#x27;t stop there. I slept in it and I woke up the next morning and my hair still looked decently smooth, but it definitely needed a pick-me-up. So I grabbed the After Party and put it on the ends and was re-amazed. I went to work and got SO many compliments on how nice my hair looked. I then hopped on here and bought my own (trust me, this is SO much cheaper than buying at Ulta or other beauty stores). This product is phenomenal. I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of BedHead products, but I&#x27;m definitely a believer in this one. Do your hair a favor and buy this.</li>
            <li> Works great for controlling frizz during summer humidity.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this product with my last haircut &amp; my dry, frizzy summer hair became silky that day. Unfortunately, I gave all the credit to the bed head product. Shouldn&#x27;t have. First of all, it is a finishing cream - so, you&#x27;re using it on dry hair. Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me except to straighten my natural wave. Not what I was looking for. Second, Amazon sells it in twos. So, I now have alot of something I won&#x27;t use on a regular basis. Also, you don&#x27;t need much  of an application when you do use it. Oh boy, what a mistake.</li>
            <li> CONTROLS WITHOUT MAKING YOUR HAIR FEEL HORRIBLE!   LEAVES IT SOFT AND MANAGEABLE.  I HAVE VERY DRY HAIR--WORKS WELL!</li>
            <li> This is a MUST!  I have fine, thin hair.  I use a tiny tiny bit (one little squirt) while my hair is damp.  I them blow dry and flat iron.  My hair is amazingly soft!  You CAN use this on towel dried hair, just be careful to not use too much.  Apply from mid head and down.  Putting it at roots will flatten your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used after dried and styled hair and WOW is it soft and manageable!  I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Best hair care product ever. I have straight hair and have issues with static electricity. On days that I use this product, my hair stays smooth and shiny for hours (without looking greasy!). Smells great, too.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this product on her clients so I decided to use it at home too. It does leave my hair feeling very smooth. I love the scent of it. I use a little bit of it before blow drying and some after. I have very thick hair and a bottle lasts me about 4 months. It really is a great product.</li>
            <li> Perfect soft hair and the product smells awesome.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, if I didn&#x27;t I wouldn&#x27;t get a comb through my hair. I usually pay around $18-$19 for ONE!! I was amazed at the price for PACK OF TWO was $21.55. I will always buy here in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It detangles damaged hair and also the kids hair.I have been using this product for a several years and probably will always use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using After Party for years on my frizzy hair. My hairdresser puts it on when my hair is wet, but I&#x27;ve found it very beneficial to put on dry when my hair is going everywhere. Just make sure you don&#x27;t clump it all in one place, instead smooth it around in your hands first, then work from the bottom of your hair up. It&#x27;s all I need for &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; in my hair and smells so yummy good too! The shape if rather comical since it reminds me of a male&#x27;s you-know-what ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish the &amp;#34;Biggie&amp;#34; was more readily available, the regular size doesn&#x27;t last that long and a little on the spendy side. It&#x27;s worth it though since it&#x27;s the very best thing going to tame that party hair!!!</li>
            <li> I actually need to buy more!! A squirt a day keeps the frizzes away, even in Miami humidity!</li>
            <li> Great for getting smoke smell out of the hair after a night out.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go without this product</li>
            <li> Fabulous product. It&#x27;s worth every penny. I love it! Makes my hair feel like silk. O lyrics use when your hair is dry though.</li>
            <li> Iv always loved bed head for my hair and found it cheaper on Amazon ..$13 for 2!!!! I was disappointed when I opened the package and saw that both of the bottoms where a little broken, like the cream was about to seep through however the dispenser worked so they are usable. It did look like the seller tried to wrap them up good so it wouldn&#x27;t break, so Im guessing it might of been the cold weather and being tossed around that did it.</li>
            <li> Well this product just does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and nothing that great. Definitely a bit over priced. BEWARE !</li>
            <li> Great product and lasts forever!  I use it to smooth and condition my hair after blow-drying; also on weekends, just a little dab before ponytail or messy bun gives a great shine and silkiness to my hair- looks like I spent time on my hair :)</li>
            <li> it was perfect in all ways..just remember not to use too much or hair will get greasy plus it smells awesome</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Myself and 2 daughters all have long hair and we go through hair products like water... I will never buy retail again for this item...love Amazon deals!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I buy it online now because it is way cheaper than buying it in the store.  it smells great and helps smooth down my crazy hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service! The cream smells delicious! Great for partying and come home and put it in your hair if you don&#x27;t feel like taking a shower. If you&#x27;re around smoke put some of this cream on your hair and it gets rid of the smoke smell. Received product very quickly. Price is great!</li>
            <li> I love to change my hair frequently with dye and perms, which results in frizzy split ends.  This is the fastest, easiest way to control the friz and damaged ends on mornings, leaving natural-looking curls or waves where I&#x27;d previously only had a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> I absolutely ¢¾Loved¢¾ this product from the very first time i smelled and used it. Leaves your hair super silky, amazingly smooth, and has the riches scent!!! Great double deal price!! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I have thin fly away hair!  This is a miracle product I cannot live without!!  Highly Reccomended for all hair types</li>
            <li> The product was as advertised.  Really helped my hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t flake, build up in hair, or leave it feeling &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; with product.  Have tried many others but always come back to Bed Head After Party.  Try it for yourself!</li>
            <li> Favorite product so far from Bed Head. Works amazing &amp; helps keep my hair straight!&lt;br /&gt;Helps keep a fabulous look!!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much. I have been searching everywhere for a great deal on Bed Head. In the stores here it sell for about $19 a bottle. When I found it here for less AND I got TWO!! I couldnt wait to order. TIGI After Party is the best anti frizz, shine, and not to mention gives you the smoothest hair! I can not recommend it more or this dealer more. Thank you again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different products and this is the only one that works for me. Leaves hair smooth and silky but not weighed down.</li>
            <li> I like this product and it help to keep the frizzes away. Hair stays soft and there is no build up.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I can straighten my hair for hours and it still isn&#x27;t smooth and silky, but two seconds spent applying this product under my hair and smoothed over the top makes all the difference. I almost never use products because they don&#x27;t actually do anything, but this stuff is different. My friend lent me some and I loved it so much I ordered it the same night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the price is UNBEATABLE. I saw a single bottle of this at Walgreens yesterday for over 20 dollars--this is TWO for less than 15. It&#x27;s Prime eligible, effective, and cheap--what more could you want?</li>
            <li> I use this product to add extra volume to my thin flat hair. I scrunch it in like moose but it doesn&#x27;t leave that wet look and still feels super soft!! Works great on damp or dry hair it&#x27;s then only thing I have found that gives me volume all day long</li>
            <li> This cream is one of the best creams I&#x27;ve ever tried. It smells great and it doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy like some other products. The price is also good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 10 years seriously since i was 17. This stuff is the really deal, the price is awesome too considering if you were paying regular retail it would cost $17 just for one bottle. after party is a really nice smoothing product that is good if you want to use it to define waves or if you straighten your hair. it smells awesome and adds a really nice shine. it makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. I like to put it in my hair when it&#x27;s damp or right after finishing straightening it to get a really good shine</li>
            <li> This product is great. It adds shine to your hair...the only drawback is the packaging...</li>
            <li> After Party makes your hair soft and easy to style.  Not to mention the pleasant smell.  I had trouble finding this product in stores, luckily I found it on Amazon!  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love the way this makes me hair feel. I use it after using heating products and it helps my hair feel soft and smell amazingly well. Def recommend</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was promised. This item is hard to find in stores and I&#x27;m glad to get it here it came as described</li>
            <li> I use this product when my hair is wet and after I straighten  it to smoothe the fly-aways.  Be careful though because if you use too much your hair will look greasy!</li>
            <li> I have never been the type to have any kind of interest in any kind of hair product. I use cheap shampoo/condition, use basic soap, and generally just tie my hair back wet. Friends and family have urged me to try many products they have laying around, and I have, and not been the least bit interested... until this. This stuff is magic. I finally have that coveted shiny hair that everyone envies, and at minimal effort! It&#x27;s perfect, and so worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years but have never reviewed it. I have a very oily scalp and I had been using oil-based products to tame my frizzy hair. A few years ago a stylist recommended this product to me and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. It&#x27;s not greasy, it&#x27;s very smooth and feels great. A little goes a long way! My hair is never frizzy anymore, it&#x27;s soft and shiny. I get a ton of compliments on my hair now! I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I really like the Bed Head line of products.  After party works best for my curly hair to control the frizz caused by humidity.  It does not leave your hair feeling hard.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I love how this smells.  Also, my daughter&#x27;s hair is unruly and this makes it smooth.</li>
            <li> This is one of the finest products I&#x27;ve used on my hair. I have waist length, super thick hair and this product smooths it out and tames the hair cuticle so I don&#x27;t look like a frizzed out mess. Love.</li>
            <li> like my title.  this smells amazing, and makes your hair sooo soft.  i don&#x27; t even use conditioner now, i just put a quarter size of this in my hair right after the shower while it&#x27;s wet and it dries to be extremely soft and smooth.  and putting it on dry will also make your hair extremely soft, shiny and healthy looking!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It makes my hair soft and keeps away the frizzes all day long.</li>
            <li> I have been using this smoothing cream for almost ten years now and love it! I use it after blow-drying right before flat-ironing my hair, its even awesome if you put it in wet hair and let it air dry.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Used it for years. And I get two for the same price stores charge for ONE!!:)</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite hair products and you can&#x27;t beat the price when purchasing it on Amazon</li>
            <li> I use this periodically on my damp almost dry hair to blow dry it smooth.  It just makes it a little smoother, that&#x27;s all.  I agree with not using it on completely wet hair because of missing the point of the product but absolutely nothing happens if I just add it to my hair dry the next morning, it will not penetrate my hair enough to do anything.  Now when they use it on my hair at the saloon to blow dry my hair straight it&#x27;s like a miracle product. I think it&#x27;s all in the blow drying technique at the saloon that I can not duplicate.</li>
            <li> Light and fresh fragrance. Low oil. A winner.</li>
            <li> Great product but took longer to be delivered that it said</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my daughter, she liked it</li>
            <li> I have the most unmanageable hair. After I shower and let it dry, it is so frizzy and just not nice looking, even if I straighten it its still just not great looking. Once I put this product in my hair, it is so smooth and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other products that are cheaper, but this seems to be the only thing that actually works. love it!</li>
