            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>The brushes really smelled of strong chemicals when they arrived.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>thought they would be useful for art projects</li>
            <li>but hey for the price I payed for I say it was worth it.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so useful.</li>
            <li>but it goes away pretty quick.</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean and dry fairly quickly!</li>
            <li>these brushes are definitely worth the money, great for someone who is just starting to build their set for personal use</li>
            <li>These were fantastic, Much better than I had expected.  </li>
            <li>I mean if you want better brushes go make your own.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll probably wash them first.</li>
            <li>They look decent, and for $10 they look promising!!</li>
            <li>Soft case is a bright metallic type pink and the brushes are shades of purple.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge makeup freak or a huge baby who will throw a fit if they shed or whatever.</li>
            <li>Shipping AND delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really use the brushes just the eyebrow brush and eyeshadow applier</li>
            <li>Bought this for one of my daughters and she absolutely loves it!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I never recived my brushes from the mail it is upseting because I was really hoping to use them</li>
            <li>so I really like them.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and so pretty.</li>
            <li>I clean my brushes everyday and my makeup goes on problem free.</li>
            <li>They had it listed down for 1.32$ which was very cheap</li>
            <li>Amazing brushes use them everyday!</li>
            <li>arrived two weeks early!!</li>
            <li>It also came in a pretty hot pink pouch.</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>Feels soft to the touch !</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t exactly know how they only because I gave them away at an event</li>
            <li>When you get them in the mail, the brushes are wrapped individually and the 4 large ones have a plastic cover on them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>feels a little cheap</li>
            <li>but these can be used for actual face work&lt;br /&gt;much better than I expected at this low price</li>
            <li>Brushes are extremely soft.</li>
            <li>Brushes are soft but not too soft ...</li>
            <li>Like what everyone&#x27;s saying they are soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with them falling out.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft against my skin</li>
            <li>The brushes are about 6 inches long (From the top of the bristles down to the end of the handle).</li>
            <li>All the e/s brushes that come in the set are flat brushes, which you can&#x27;t really blend with.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bristles on the brushes are soft, I was a little bit scared that they&#x27;d be too soft that they wouldn&#x27;t pick up eyeshadow or powder</li>

            <li> /&gt;The bristles on the brushes are soft, I was a little bit scared that they&#x27;d be too soft that they wouldn&#x27;t pick up eyeshadow or powder</li>
            <li> , the only complaint i would have is that there are about 6 brushes exactly the same but a bit bigger in size, while there are no smaller fluffyy brushes.</li>
            <li> , the head of the brushes are purple and the bottom is white except on the 4 big brushes its like an off white , the handle is a dark wine purple color.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes but didn&#x27;t come as pictured  :(</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about it smelling like spray paint, but I think thats just the outside case&#x27;s coloring.</li>
            <li> I chose sellers who are in close proximity to me, but this came even faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> I had to air them and the case outside for a few days before the smell went away.  </li>
            <li> These are sharp looking but the smell of spray paint or whatever it is on them is over powering.  </li>
            <li> and I guess I just wasted money.</li>
            <li> The case smells pretty bad</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday!</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is i wish it had a  small blending brush.</li>
            <li> Since I bought these a few months ago I have never once needed a brush that wasn&#x27;t included in the set and none of them have disappointed me.</li>
            <li> idk I&#x27;m just weird and like funky scents anyway like gasoline XD, but anywho...</li>
            <li> The smell of the brushes isn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> I hate that smell that</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t know the difference between these and very expensive brushes, but at this rate I&#x27;ll never have to figure it out!</li>
            <li> so I thought the quality of the brushes would terrible</li>

            <li> Shipping AND delivery was fast. I chose sellers who are in close proximity to me, but this came even faster than I expected. The smell of the brushes isn&#x27;t that bad. :P idk I&#x27;m just weird and like funky scents anyway like gasoline XD, but anywho...haven&#x27;t used these brushes yet but I&#x27;ll probably wash them first. They look decent, and for $10 they look promising!! I&#x27;m not a huge makeup freak or a huge baby who will throw a fit if they shed or whatever. I mean if you want better brushes go make your own. lol XD These will be plenty good. :) Will buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> feels a little cheap but I don&#x27;t really use the brushes just the eyebrow brush and eyeshadow applier but then my daughter broke it lol so was good</li>
            <li> This was a add on item.  thought they would be useful for art projects but these can be used for actual face work&lt;br /&gt;much better than I expected at this low price</li>
            <li> Loved the color ! Feels soft to the touch ! Would definitely recommend these to someone . Don&#x27;t exactly know how they only because I gave them away at an event but I love them!</li>
            <li> This make up brush set is awesome, i love the color and they are very well made.  thank you so much &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> these are so soft and so beautiful. identical to the picture. im a MUA and i wanted some brushes to add to my kit and these did the trick i only wish it had a stipple brush or a foundation brush but other than that you get a great quality set of brushes for a cheap price :), °°°°°°° beware the fan brush does shed°°°°°°°</li>
            <li> Received a month later, however, it was noted when purchased. I wasn&#x27;t in no rush as it was a Christmas present and it came on time. Brushes are extremely soft. Love the feel of it and the variety of sizes. It also came in a pretty hot pink pouch. I only wish I would&#x27;ve ordered myself one too. Will recommend. Don&#x27;t anticipate speedy delivery thou.</li>
            <li> Bought this for one of my daughters and she absolutely loves it!&lt;br /&gt;The case is very nice. The brushes are beautiful</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes use them everyday! I didnt expect them to be that good and I was actually very impressed only wiyh time the gkue will give out and your brush may fall. But waynworth the money</li>
            <li> these brushes are definitely worth the money, great for someone who is just starting to build their set for personal use</li>
            <li> I never recived my brushes from the mail it is upseting because I was really hoping to use them and I guess I just wasted money.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed! And my makeup slides on smooth with these! I love that they came with there own case!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!! arrived two weeks early!! The case smells pretty bad but I washed it and it does go away, the head of the brushes are purple and the bottom is white except on the 4 big brushes its like an off white , the handle is a dark wine purple color. Brushes are soft but not too soft ... They work great!!! No shedding or loss of color :) :) !!!!!!! They also come with plastic sleeve cover to keep your brushes shape!</li>
            <li> Nice brushes but didn&#x27;t come as pictured  :( in the picture they were all purple but when I got them only the tips of the brushes are purple</li>
            <li> The brushes really smelled of strong chemicals when they arrived.  I had to air them and the case outside for a few days before the smell went away.  It almost smells like paint thinner.  Once the smell went away, they&#x27;re great brushes for a good price.</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes and very soft! I didn&#x27;t expect the brushes to be of any type of quality because of the price, but they definitely have exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> *I didn&#x27;t buy from this seller specifically but I ordered from another.* They had it listed down for 1.32$ which was very cheap so I thought the quality of the brushes would terrible but they turned out being amazing brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes that I received were white with purple tops (I&#x27;ll upload a photo), they have the same handle and case. When you get them in the mail, the brushes are wrapped individually and the 4 large ones have a plastic cover on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles on the brushes are soft, I was a little bit scared that they&#x27;d be too soft that they wouldn&#x27;t pick up eyeshadow or powder but they actually do pick up a lot of product. The brushes are about 6 inches long (From the top of the bristles down to the end of the handle). I haven&#x27;t had any break on me yet which is good, so they&#x27;re durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush set does not come with tapered e/s brushes. All the e/s brushes that come in the set are flat brushes, which you can&#x27;t really blend with. It also doesn&#x27;t come with stippling, foundation or concealer brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for a brush kit with basic brushes, they&#x27;re working for me. The Contour/highlighting, powder, and blush brush work great.&lt;br /&gt;*I didn&#x27;t proofread so I apologize for any typos</li>
            <li> Got the brushes after more than a month.lol but hey for the price I payed for I say it was worth it. Like what everyone&#x27;s saying they are soft.</li>
            <li> The product does not look anything like the picture and it cheaply made. It is still nice for the price but I dont like the fact that I did not get what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no makeup artist, but I am an artist who loves makeup. These brushes are so useful. I wouldn&#x27;t know the difference between these and very expensive brushes, but at this rate I&#x27;ll never have to figure it out! The bristles are soft and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with them falling out. The case they come with is the perfect size for convenience and keeps them organized really well. They are easy to clean and dry fairly quickly! Since I bought these a few months ago I have never once needed a brush that wasn&#x27;t included in the set and none of them have disappointed me. If you&#x27;re someone who rarely uses makeup or is exploring a new interest in it, this set is absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li> Have not used the items yet but they come in their own soft case. Tools individually wrapped and protected. Has a bit of a strong chemical smell which I&#x27;m sure will lessen over time.... Soft case is a bright metallic type pink and the brushes are shades of purple. Very pretty</li>
            <li> Awesome quality!  I clean my brushes everyday and my makeup goes on problem free. I work at Sephora and these brushes are just as good. Very soft.</li>
            <li> Bought 3sets of these brushes as gifts....they loved them...the brushes are soft and of good quality not bad at all .</li>
            <li> it ok....but the case already button fall off so now it won&#x27;t close except with one button. do not like the case!!!</li>
            <li> I like how many brushes there are, they are quality and come with a bag. I dont like the bag at all but its a ncie place to store the items, the only complaint i would have is that there are about 6 brushes exactly the same but a bit bigger in size, while there are no smaller fluffyy brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes came in a decent amount of time but when I opened the package they had a very strong smell. As long as you let them air for a bit though, its all good! These brushes are so soft against my skin so I really like them.</li>
            <li> Nice #Hair by ADAM 813....dont shead hairs wish the tip were glued better.. feel off after 1wash ...  but great</li>
            <li> They are very soft and so pretty. I love the color and they look just like the picture. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> These brushes smell like plastic annd I hate that smell that the only priblem I have. It would be nice if u label the brushes to but I like the color.</li>
            <li> These were fantastic, Much better than I had expected.  Very very nice set and I would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> yet firm bristles, and I love the colors :D I was a little concerned about it smelling like spray paint, but I think thats just the outside case&#x27;s coloring. Otherwise FAN-TAS-TIC</li>
            <li> I love these brushes ! They&#x27;re cute &amp; are great . If you don&#x27;t need a lot of brushes get these</li>
            <li> it does have a strong smell at first but it goes away pretty quick. love this set I use it almost everyday! The only bad thing is i wish it had a  small blending brush. but this great!</li>
            <li> These are sharp looking but the smell of spray paint or whatever it is on them is over powering.  I have left them sit out of the package to air out and the smell seems to get weaker.</li>
