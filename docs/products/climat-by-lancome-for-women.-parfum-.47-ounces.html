    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is one of the best, if not THE BEST, from Lancome</li>
            <li>If these are fakes then they are great</li>
            <li>Very nice and unexpencive perfume.</li>
            <li>I know nothing about perfume, but even I liked this scent.</li>
            <li>Mom adored it, she told me that&#x27;s exactly what she had, so we both are happy.</li>
            <li>I bought this perfumes as a gift to my girlfriend, she was pleased with the flavor.</li>
            <li>I buy this parfume for more then 30 years.</li>
            <li>You may still like the fragrance, but don&#x27;t expect it to be like the authentic Climat.</li>
            <li>is  NOT  100% Authentic</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments as it is</li>
            <li>different from many of today&#x27;s scents and suits me perfectly.  </li>
            <li>When I lived in Europe, Climat by Lancome was one of my two favorite fragrances.</li>
            <li>The perfume smells nothing like the original which was the most amazing fragrance I&#x27;ve ever worn (yes, I realize there are a number of hyperboles in that sentence, but they are sincere and used intentionally).  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it in the US when I moved here, which I remember surprised me because I thought it was beautiful.</li>
            <li>At the top of my list would be Chanel #22 ( pricey but genuine</li>
            <li>you loved the original Climat, don&#x27;t bother with the new one.</li>
            <li>What a huge mistake.  </li>
            <li>Package looked cheap.</li>
            <li>have done a bit of research since then and found out that Lancome had changed the formula for Climat because one of the ingredients was no longer available.</li>
            <li>, it is NOT the real \\&quot;Climat\\&quot; !!!</li>
            <li>Move on and find a new fragrance to love as much as you loved Climat.  </li>
            <li>I tried it (not from Amazon), and it&#x27;s nothing like the original Climat.  </li>
            <li>Best parfum ,i have used for past 30 years.</li>
            <li>This is an old Fragrance by Lancome which has been discontinued and I was thrilled to discover&lt;br /&gt;it at Amazon and to my amazement</li>
            <li>The smell was almost the same at the beginning--that wonderful mix of floral and woody that no other perfume even closely resembled--but it didn&#x27;t develop in the same way afterward.</li>
            <li>It was a gift for my mom, who loves Climat very much.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell the difference except that the perfume obviously has a more concentrated scent.   </li>
            <li>It starts with familiar notes similar to the original Climat; however, an a matter of a couple of minutes, the smell nearly completely dissapears into a cheap cologne territory, and then completely vanishes.</li>
            <li>Since it rare I use only for special days.</li>
            <li>Good buy blue box Climat, as long as you do not restore your properties.</li>
            <li>I certainly hope it remains&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new formulation is a far cry from the original.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really smell the way it should be.</li>
            <li>It was light enough for daytime use, and, at the same time, sensual, classy, and sophisticated.</li>
            <li>Not very distinct, just kinda like a good generic perfume smell.</li>
            <li>The old Climat had been long-lasting while the new one wore off quickly (luckily for me, I must add, for the longer</li>
            <li>Climat is simply no longer made in its original version.  </li>
            <li>I have to agree with several other reviews - if you are familiar with the glorious and uniquely unforgettable Climat, don&#x27;t waste your money and time (unless you want to spend a fortune on a proven vintage) and find another adlelhydes fragrance.</li>
            <li>The new one was much thinner and yellowish.</li>
            <li>When I received Climat, I noticed that covered plastic was glued and did not have special stamps on the top and the bottom indicating that Climat&#x27;s box was previously opened and closed again.</li>
            <li>There was a minor issue which was resolved quickly and well, and I must add that we will be reffering our friends to Lancome</li>
            <li>It is sharp and rather unpleasant, whereas the original fragrance was sultry and seductive and lovely and warm.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Climat perfume 1.7 oz in October of 2007 directly from Lancome online.</li>
            <li>Smells like French parfum... which we really like, yet it seems to lack something.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this item.</li>
            <li>My mother used this perfume long time ago (as well as many other women in former USSR in 1970-1980s) and now she complains that smell itself does not remind that old smell</li>
            <li>the parfume that was sold to me is not even close to the real one - some very cheap fake</li>
            <li>Also when you opened just a box, not bottle, the smell was already strong, but after opening this box the smell is hardly heard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty concentrated, so a little goes long way.</li>

            <li> A smell does not hold enough time even with significant wetting - less than 3 hours, not as long as it used to be in 1970s-1980s: 10-12 hours even with small amount</li>

            <li> It is very different and a total waste of money.</li>

            <li> I am afraid this wasn&#x27;t the real french high quality perfume.</li>
            <li> The old Climat had been thick, even oily, and very green in color.</li>
            <li> In my country it&#x27;s impossible to get such old perfume, so when I saw it on amazon, I decided to try luck.</li>

            <li> I thought it could be fake and sent it back to Amazon.</li>

            <li> I wore it, the worse it smelled).</li>
            <li> So, for those of you who think you received a fake from Amazon, you probably didn&#x27;t; that&#x27;s what Climat smells like nowadays.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately one does not know how bad it is until after it is opened,</li>
            <li> Also, I would think that would be a terribly stupid liability for Amazon to sell fake perfume.</li>
            <li> I was beyond disappointed by this version of the scent.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend it:(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this perfumes as a gift to my girlfriend, she was pleased with the flavor.I know nothing about perfume, but even I liked this scent. Thank you.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my mom, who loves Climat very much. In my country it&#x27;s impossible to get such old perfume, so when I saw it on amazon, I decided to try luck. Mom adored it, she told me that&#x27;s exactly what she had, so we both are happy. The only minus is that fragrance is very small and does not cost too cheap. But I again recommend it.</li>
            <li> FVI.  I bought the Climat perfume 1.7 oz in October of 2007 directly from Lancome online. If these are fakes then they are great cause I can&#x27;t tell the difference except that the perfume obviously has a more concentrated scent.   Also, I would think that would be a terribly stupid liability for Amazon to sell fake perfume.</li>
            <li> I buy this parfume for more then 30 years. This is one of the best, if not THE BEST, from Lancome</li>
            <li> Although the majority of the buyers of this version of Climat warned me against doing so, nostalgia won out, and I clicked the \\&quot;Purchase\\&quot; button.  What a huge mistake.  The perfume smells nothing like the original which was the most amazing fragrance I&#x27;ve ever worn (yes, I realize there are a number of hyperboles in that sentence, but they are sincere and used intentionally).  I was beyond disappointed by this version of the scent.  It is sharp and rather unpleasant, whereas the original fragrance was sultry and seductive and lovely and warm.  Please, please, please be warned -- do not spend your money on this product.  Climat is simply no longer made in its original version.  Move on and find a new fragrance to love as much as you loved Climat.  This offering is not it.</li>
            <li> FYI:  Lancome stopped manufacturing Climat perfume many years ago, so anything you buy now is a guaranteed fake.  I tried it (not from Amazon), and it&#x27;s nothing like the original Climat.  You may still like the fragrance, but don&#x27;t expect it to be like the authentic Climat.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell the way it should be. Package looked cheap. I am afraid this wasn&#x27;t the real french high quality perfume. I would not recommend it:(</li>
            <li> Smells like French parfum... which we really like, yet it seems to lack something.  Not very distinct, just kinda like a good generic perfume smell.</li>
            <li> Sorry,but i had to drop a line and say merchandise sold  is  NOT  100% Authentic, it is NOT the real \\&quot;Climat\\&quot; !!!&lt;br /&gt;Even the color is not the same...</li>
            <li> My wife has been using Climat perfume for years and obviously knows how it should smell. This item is definately not real Climat, but a very inferior imitation, whose fragrance lasts about 3 minutes before wearing off. Do not waste your money on this item. Unfortunately one does not know how bad it is until after it is opened, which then makes it non returnable.</li>
            <li> Best parfum ,i have used for past 30 years.Always get compliments on smell.Since it rare I use only for special days.</li>
            <li> There is not much to say except that I got a fake! I&#x27;ve used this perfume for a dozen years, and I know what I was supposed to get. Instead, I got something that literally smelled like soap! Will NEVER buy perfume online again!</li>
            <li> For the price it is such a small size , I wasn&#x27;t expecting a tiny bottle and it was a gift .</li>
            <li> There was a minor issue which was resolved quickly and well, and I must add that we will be reffering our friends to Lancome</li>
            <li> Climat by Lancome for women - after few weeks of using.&lt;br /&gt;  My mother used this perfume long time ago (as well as many other women in former USSR in 1970-1980s) and now she complains that smell itself does not remind that old smell and she hears even some alcohol component. A smell does not hold enough time even with significant wetting - less than 3 hours, not as long as it used to be in 1970s-1980s: 10-12 hours even with small amount [one touch by a finger and a dress holded smell (in cabinet) weeks after that evening]. Also when you opened just a box, not bottle, the smell was already strong, but after opening this box the smell is hardly heard. So, it is not only people are changing with a time, but same perfume is changing too (may be it is not  already same perfume?). Good buy blue box Climat, as long as you do not restore your properties.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with several other reviews - if you are familiar with the glorious and uniquely unforgettable Climat, don&#x27;t waste your money and time (unless you want to spend a fortune on a proven vintage) and find another adlelhydes fragrance. At the top of my list would be Chanel #22 ( pricey but genuine if bought at Chanel.com or an a Chanel boutique), Estee Lauder&#x27;s White Sholders, just to name a few. The new formulation is a far cry from the original. I have also tried this formulation. It starts with familiar notes similar to the original Climat; however, an a matter of a couple of minutes, the smell nearly completely dissapears into a cheap cologne territory, and then completely vanishes. A complete waste of money, considering that an opened package cannot be returned.</li>
            <li> When I received Climat, I noticed that covered plastic was glued and did not have special stamps on the top and the bottom indicating that Climat&#x27;s box was previously opened and closed again. I thought it could be fake and sent it back to Amazon. I would advise to examine plastic integrity before opening a perfume box.</li>
            <li> the parfume that was sold to me is not even close to the real one - some very cheap fake</li>
            <li> This is an old Fragrance by Lancome which has been discontinued and I was thrilled to discover&lt;br /&gt;it at Amazon and to my amazement it is the same.  I have received many compliments as it is&lt;br /&gt;so different from many of today&#x27;s scents and suits me perfectly.  I certainly hope it remains&lt;br /&gt;available!</li>
            <li> When I lived in Europe, Climat by Lancome was one of my two favorite fragrances. I couldn&#x27;t find it in the US when I moved here, which I remember surprised me because I thought it was beautiful. It was light enough for daytime use, and, at the same time, sensual, classy, and sophisticated. I always got compliments when I wore it. To my delight, I saw it at a duty-free shop in Paris, France last month, and I bought it on the spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew that something was wrong when I first took the bottle out of the box. The old Climat had been thick, even oily, and very green in color. The new one was much thinner and yellowish. The smell was almost the same at the beginning--that wonderful mix of floral and woody that no other perfume even closely resembled--but it didn&#x27;t develop in the same way afterward. I waited and waited for those narcissus and peach layers to grow, but they never did. The old Climat had been long-lasting while the new one wore off quickly (luckily for me, I must add, for the longer I wore it, the worse it smelled). I tried it again the next day with the same results, and, when my friend commented that she did not like the scent I was wearing, I threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have done a bit of research since then and found out that Lancome had changed the formula for Climat because one of the ingredients was no longer available. So, for those of you who think you received a fake from Amazon, you probably didn&#x27;t; that&#x27;s what Climat smells like nowadays. What a pity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you loved the original Climat, don&#x27;t bother with the new one. It is very different and a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Very nice and unexpencive perfume. I like the smell. It&#x27;s pretty concentrated, so a little goes long way. I recommend it.</li>
