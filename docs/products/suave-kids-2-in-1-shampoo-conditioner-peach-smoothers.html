            <li>a good quality product and I am happy with purchase.</li>
            <li>The peach is not overpowering and quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>I strongly believe that it is best to cycle your hair products in order to prevent your hair from developing a tolerance towards one hair product, eventually rendering it</li>
            <li>The peach scent smells wonderful but doesn&#x27;t linger on too strong after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>leaves a pleasant scent after cleaned, good product</li>
            <li>He has inherited my fine hair, so this works out perfectly.  </li>
            <li>This is a great price and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>But all in all a good product.</li>
            <li>It also makes for good bubbles if you just squeeze a bit under the running water.  </li>
            <li>they are both surprisingly conditioning.</li>
            <li>Packaging May Vary)]] and loved that one too.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of cleaning their hair.</li>
            <li>and it makes her hair smooth and perfect</li>
            <li>My wife doesn&#x27;t feel that it cleans as well as Aveeno brand shampoo conditioner, but it is a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>This is so great that I use it on my own hair as well as my preschooler.</li>
            <li>This works great with my kids - the smell is nice and it works well.  </li>
            <li>If your scalp can tolerate it, this shampoo does smell good and kids like it.</li>

            <li>I love that it works and its a great product.</li>
            <li>The price is great and the Suave fragrances are appealing to children.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell, my kids&#x27; hair look great and the youngest one likes the lobster drawing on it</li>
            <li>It did a nice job cleaning her hair and a good job conditioning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance is unbelievably appealing!</li>
            <li>they  love the smell and it lathers up really nice!</li>
            <li>Love suave!</li>
            <li>The product was gentle to use, effective and smells great with a bottle design my nephew loved!</li>
            <li>boys love the bright colors/pictures on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is also tear free which is great.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has a nice peach scent that is not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li>My kid prefer the strawberry scented Suave Kids shampoo, but the peach is a nice alternative.</li>
            <li>It also worked nicely for my daughter who has silky hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice to know that this won&#x27;t burn or irritate their eyes.</li>
            <li>This is another nice shampoo + conditioner from the Suave Kids line.  </li>
            <li>It has a really nice smell that&#x27;s peachy without being overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells nice and cleans well.</li>
            <li>i got this for my grand daughter it smells so good</li>
            <li>While I liked the smell, my grandsons thought it was too &#x60;girly&#x27;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my grand kids smell so good</li>
            <li>like this one better than some of the alternatives because it smells really good.  </li>
            <li>It lathers very easily and makes shampooing seem more pleasant for her.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to get a good lather with and cleaned his hair well.</li>
            <li>I love suave kids products, they smell amazing and they always have 2 in 1 or 3 in 1 products.</li>
            <li>But it is still nice- just more perfumy than fruity.  </li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and my kiddos love it.  </li>
            <li>It DOES NOT have a great deal of conditioner though, so I really think it might be best for boys and girls with hair that doesn&#x27;t need too much conditioning.</li>
            <li>One of my nieces, for example, has very fine hair</li>
            <li>Suave keeps hair clean, eliminates many tangles with the conditioner, and the peach scent is nice!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it myself and while I am not a fan of the color of the shampoo, a shimmery beige color, it did a good job of making my hair clean and giving it a smoothness (since it has conditioner in it as well).</li>
            <li>Love the scent leaves the children&#x27;s hair soft and manageable and perfect!</li>
            <li>Works great for my 3 year old&#x27;s super fine hair, and smells great!</li>
            <li>Pour with caution for the first time, otherwise it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>Smells great and leave my kids hair nice, smooth and smelling fresh</li>
            <li>The peach smell of this one is very light, so keep that in mind.  </li>
            <li>Another nice feature is the bottle has grooves on the side that make it easy to hold (for hands of all sizes).</li>
            <li>Smells great leaves hair smelling great even after a few hours most kids soups the smell fades!</li>
            <li>I love Suave products so decided to purchase this to try with my kids.</li>
            <li>They love the smell and the deaigns on the bottle.</li>
            <li>We love this shampoo/conditioner for the kids.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and does not irritate the eyes.</li>
            <li>2 in 1 is much more convenient and affordable.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of peach.  </li>
            <li>My favorite scented Yankee candle is Juicy Peach.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels healthy.  </li>
            <li>Tear free, and nice scent.</li>
            <li>My six year love the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>We love them.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell of this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been well pleased with the Suave kid&#x27;s products, and that&#x27;s all we buy now.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the peach when it goes on, but you can&#x27;t smell it once her hair dries -</li>
            <li>Love Suave for kids.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely and is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>You can see the conditioner on the bottom and the soap on the top.  </li>
            <li>While I can do that with any shampoo, this one works better because:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>I am going to be getting more as a baby gift for my friends that are having babies here.</li>
            <li>It smells really great, is gentle on young ones, and leaves their hair clean and smelling delicious!</li>
            <li>Smells great, leaves my kiddos hair fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>the price is great, particularly with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>Good kids bodywash that foams up pretty well in the bath.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good value for kids&#x27; shampoo</li>
            <li>I must warn you that the shampoo and conditioner pours easily out of its plastic bottle; it doesnâ€™t ooze out like most shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li>a basic Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, this is a very good product.  </li>
            <li>Great inexpensive shampoo and conditioner that I use on my son who is just over 2 years old.  </li>
            <li>Then the whole bath smells good.  </li>
            <li>The Suave 2 in 1 Shampoo Conditioner has a nice, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>My daughter has long hair, and I need to use a good amount to get a good lather.</li>
            <li>They produce some good products that really work.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and has a peach type scent.  </li>
            <li>Very mild</li>
            <li>It makes all my children hair looking clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>Moreover, it has a rich lather and rinses very clean.</li>
            <li>Because the kids get baths/showers every day they don&#x27;t need to shampoo and condition, a 2 in 1 works fine for them.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and did not bother sensitive scalps.  </li>
            <li>It makes their hair very soft, and they smell sooooo good after their bath.  </li>
            <li>Smells so good and makes kids hair soft!</li>
            <li>My 6 year old daughter loved the smell and it seemed to rinse out easily</li>
            <li>I wish Suave Kids Shampoo would be tear free.</li>
            <li>This worked great for my sons coarse curls.</li>
            <li>A nice gentle peach fragrance.</li>
            <li>Just light on the conditioning.</li>
            <li>always look on, in skepticism, when a shampoo says tear free.</li>
            <li>Overall another great product</li>
            <li>Good smell and make hair soft and smooth after using it</li>
            <li>Detangles, conditions, doesn&#x27;t cause tears, and good for sensitive skin/scalp.</li>
            <li>I also notice is has a pretty good detangler/conditioner, but my daughter&#x27;s hair is really fine, so I&#x27;m surprised it doesn&#x27;t do an even better job.</li>
            <li>This kids shampoo &amp; condition works really well, has a nice smell and does a great job detangling of long hair.</li>
            <li>Peach is pretty good at that, as good as any other 2 in 1</li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday use!</li>
            <li>and they are usually pretty interesting.  </li>
            <li>Both of them have clean, shiny hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does smell really nice and my kids love the bright bottle, but watching it separate has made me more skeptical of combination products.  </li>
            <li>Not fake peaches or real peaches, just kind of generically &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>We use after swimming and it leaves your hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really ask for more than that.  </li>
            <li>Suave Kids 2 in 1 is our absolute favorite shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>I got this for my 9 year old son and he said he really liked the smell.</li>
            <li>and I needed to find a shampoo + conditioner that was more gentle for kids.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is really gentle and still has the no tears.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It lathers well and hair comes out clean and smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li>It lathers well and leaves his hair smelling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>This combination shampoo conditioner is a nice thick liquid that lathers well and has a good smell.</li>
            <li>so he keeps asking to use this particular brand :-)</li>
            <li>Gets their hair clean and it rinses pretty easily (which is nice when there&#x27;s limited shower time).</li>
            <li>Smells great and a 2 for 1 which makes showering kids a little bit faster.</li>
            <li>We go through it like crazy, but that&#x27;s okay, because the price is great!</li>
            <li>We like the fun, fruity peach smell.</li>
            <li>They love that instead of having to do two steps to clean their hair they only need to do one.</li>
            <li>It leave just the right level of oils in the hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product to have in your bathroom if you have little ones!</li>
            <li>This shampoo/conditioner leaves their hair shiny, soft, and smelling peachy clean!</li>
            <li>and we feel that they&#x27;re pretty economical.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very long and did not seem to tangle as much.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice shampoo, with a peachy smell.</li>
            <li>(The fragrance is a little strong  during the actual bath, but after that, our daughter&#x27;s hair smelled great all</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li>shampoos provide more conditioning than baby shampoos, making hair soft and easy to comb, but they still have a no-tears formula that my big kids still need.  </li>
            <li>This particular scent is sweet but not overbearing.</li>
            <li>At one time, I would use the shampoo first, rinse it out and then add the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Soft and Smooth Detangler Twirlin&#x27; Swirlberry]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(We&#x27;ve had slightly better detangling results when using separate shampoos and conditioners, but those take longer, so we usually stick to 2 in 1s in all but the most leisurely baths).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One thing I&#x27;d like to see Amazon change is to either pack things like this in a smaller box or somehow better insure that a package like this can&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li>I have a soon-to-be 5 year old daughter and this is a great alternative to other tear-free/hypoallergenic product!  </li>
            <li>I got it in my eyes because I am not good at keeping my eyes shut, and it didn&#x27;t sting, which was also great.</li>
            <li>I love that it leaves my babies hair clean and conditioned in half the time!  </li>
            <li>It smells really good while you are using it, but doesn&#x27;t last all day long.  </li>
            <li>The scent is not too strong and I use a little in his tub to make a light bubble bath.</li>
            <li>I love having a single bottle that can be used in the tub for both shampoo and conditioner, since getting a &amp;#34;kid&amp;#34; to put up with two products is a bit much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He suggested that I use childrenâ€™s shampoo and conditioner because it is gentle.  </li>
            <li>However, it lathers very well.  </li>
            <li>Which makes is so hassle free not having to buy3 different bottles of products when they just throw it all in one!</li>
            <li>My daughter wants to take a bath every day because of this shampoo)))</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t condition very well, so she still has to use a separate conditioner.</li>
            <li>We really like this Suave 2-in-1 Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It did not leave my hair shiny nor did it provide much in the way of help for detangling.</li>
            <li>My kindergartner has very curly hair and we have found that conditioner is a must for keeping tangles at bay.  </li>
            <li>shampoo itself does smell very peachy.</li>
            <li>I really like the Suave kids product line</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leak as a fault of the product&#x27;s packaging but rather because it just bounced and slid around in the box too much during shipment.</li>
            <li>This 2-1 shampoo works well on the fine long hair of my oldest granddaughter and the thicker hair of my nephew.  </li>
            <li>left her hair clean smelling and no tangles for the discounted price</li>
            <li>Our eight year old has long hair that tends to get tied in knots, so we love shampoos that help with a post-bath combing out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair product for men who suffer from MPB and need a gentle shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>No points deducted from the review since the product itself is still good (may have lost an ounce and a half or two total).</li>
            <li>I line them up, start at the top of their head, work down, and dunk.</li>
            <li>Decent soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tear free and hypoallergenic which is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; in our house with young children...eventually soap inevitably ends up in their eyes at some point, so</li>
            <li>This is a decent shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love the smell when my little guy comes out of the bath.  </li>
            <li>We like the scent of the pineapple a little better.</li>
            <li>I much prefer fruity scents to floral ones, so this line offers a lot of choices.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most importantly he never says his eyes are burning when soap gets in them</li>
            <li>This may be normal for shampoo/conditioner combinations, but it made me suspicious of how well it&#x27;s doing either.  </li>
            <li>The bottle also has a fun fact on the back which my kids like to read</li>
            <li>The peach smell is much more subtle than many of their other scents.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt my sons eyes and leaves hair very soft.</li>
            <li>and my daughter is very sensitive that way.</li>
            <li>Once again, suave comes on the clear winner!</li>
            <li>No crying when in eyes!</li>
            <li>bottle is easy to hold, open and squeeze with wet hands.</li>
            <li>I have three little ones to bathe so ease of use is extremely important.</li>
            <li>, my 6 year old daughter does like it.</li>
            <li>Rinsing is fairly simple, and it doesn&#x27;t take much to wash it out.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is especially sensitive, and it doesn&#x27;t make her eyes red.  </li>
            <li>Admittedly, I still prefer the 3-n-1 over this 2-n-1(saves an extra step), but I DO really like this on their hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this for my three year old daughter who has longer hair.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really the only downside.</li>
            <li>I use this shampoo + conditioner for my 5 year old son.</li>
            <li>(oh the life of a six year old).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hypoallergenic for the the blond one with sensitive skin&lt;</li>
            <li>One of my grandsons has thick, coarse hair and the 2 in 1 does a nice job of smoothing it out and making it softer.</li>
            <li>However, they aren&#x27;t water tight, so when they&#x27;re dropped in a tub full of water, some will get in and dilute the shampoo.</li>
            <li>It takes a decent amount to work up a later, maybe a *splotch* the size of a quarter on my one-year-old&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li>It is tear free, and the texture is silky smooth and thick, but not so heavy that it leaves a film in the kids hair.</li>
            <li>Thankfully there were no other items shipped with this one</li>
            <li>Now, I did note that the conditioning aspect seems a little light, so if your young-one has long hair, you may want to layer on [[ASIN:B004DBS8TC Suave Kids Conditioner Fairy Berry Strawberry]] or spritz on [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>So far the only problem I had is that some of the shampoo went on my daughter eyes and burned her eyes</li>
            <li>It was expected, thanks</li>
            <li>I also like how the lids stay pretty tight on these bottles and won&#x27;t leak if they knock them over.  </li>
            <li>The squeeze bottle is a terrific idea, because it lets our little one pour out the right amount of shampoo by herself without risking a big spill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really does the job and leaves her hair a bit less tangled when it is time for THAT part of the task of getting her ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wish that the consistency was a little thicker, as I think I want my little ones to have a bathwash they enjoy.</li>

            <li> a good quality product and I am happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> The peach is not overpowering and quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> I strongly believe that it is best to cycle your hair products in order to prevent your hair from developing a tolerance towards one hair product, eventually rendering it</li>
            <li> The peach scent smells wonderful but doesn&#x27;t linger on too strong after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> leaves a pleasant scent after cleaned, good product</li>

            <li> and it makes her hair smooth and perfect</li>
            <li> My wife doesn&#x27;t feel that it cleans as well as Aveeno brand shampoo conditioner, but it is a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> This is so great that I use it on my own hair as well as my preschooler.</li>
            <li> This works great with my kids - the smell is nice and it works well.  </li>

            <li> Love suave!</li>
            <li> The product was gentle to use, effective and smells great with a bottle design my nephew loved!</li>
            <li> boys love the bright colors/pictures on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is also tear free which is great.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice peach scent that is not too overpowering.  </li>
            <li> My kid prefer the strawberry scented Suave Kids shampoo, but the peach is a nice alternative.</li>
            <li> It also worked nicely for my daughter who has silky hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice to know that this won&#x27;t burn or irritate their eyes.</li>
            <li> This is another nice shampoo + conditioner from the Suave Kids line.  </li>
            <li> It has a really nice smell that&#x27;s peachy without being overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells nice and cleans well.</li>
            <li> i got this for my grand daughter it smells so good</li>

            <li> my grand kids smell so good</li>
            <li> like this one better than some of the alternatives because it smells really good.  </li>
            <li> It lathers very easily and makes shampooing seem more pleasant for her.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to get a good lather with and cleaned his hair well.</li>
            <li> I love suave kids products, they smell amazing and they always have 2 in 1 or 3 in 1 products.</li>
            <li> But it is still nice- just more perfumy than fruity.  </li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and my kiddos love it.  </li>
            <li> It DOES NOT have a great deal of conditioner though, so I really think it might be best for boys and girls with hair that doesn&#x27;t need too much conditioning.</li>
            <li> One of my nieces, for example, has very fine hair</li>
            <li> Suave keeps hair clean, eliminates many tangles with the conditioner, and the peach scent is nice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it myself and while I am not a fan of the color of the shampoo, a shimmery beige color, it did a good job of making my hair clean and giving it a smoothness (since it has conditioner in it as well).</li>
            <li> Love the scent leaves the children&#x27;s hair soft and manageable and perfect!</li>
            <li> Works great for my 3 year old&#x27;s super fine hair, and smells great!</li>
            <li> Pour with caution for the first time, otherwise it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> Smells great and leave my kids hair nice, smooth and smelling fresh</li>
            <li> The peach smell of this one is very light, so keep that in mind.  </li>
            <li> Another nice feature is the bottle has grooves on the side that make it easy to hold (for hands of all sizes).</li>
            <li> Smells great leaves hair smelling great even after a few hours most kids soups the smell fades!</li>
            <li> I love Suave products so decided to purchase this to try with my kids.</li>
            <li> They love the smell and the deaigns on the bottle.</li>
            <li> We love this shampoo/conditioner for the kids.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and does not irritate the eyes.</li>
            <li> 2 in 1 is much more convenient and affordable.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of peach.  </li>
            <li> My favorite scented Yankee candle is Juicy Peach.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels healthy.  </li>
            <li> Tear free, and nice scent.</li>
            <li> My six year love the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> We love them.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell of this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been well pleased with the Suave kid&#x27;s products, and that&#x27;s all we buy now.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the peach when it goes on, but you can&#x27;t smell it once her hair dries -</li>
            <li> Love Suave for kids.</li>
            <li> It smells lovely and is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> You can see the conditioner on the bottom and the soap on the top.  </li>
            <li> While I can do that with any shampoo, this one works better because:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> I am going to be getting more as a baby gift for my friends that are having babies here.</li>
            <li> It smells really great, is gentle on young ones, and leaves their hair clean and smelling delicious!</li>
            <li> Smells great, leaves my kiddos hair fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> the price is great, particularly with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> Good kids bodywash that foams up pretty well in the bath.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good value for kids&#x27; shampoo</li>
            <li> I must warn you that the shampoo and conditioner pours easily out of its plastic bottle; it doesnâ€™t ooze out like most shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> a basic Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, this is a very good product.  </li>
            <li> Great inexpensive shampoo and conditioner that I use on my son who is just over 2 years old.  </li>
            <li> Then the whole bath smells good.  </li>
            <li> The Suave 2 in 1 Shampoo Conditioner has a nice, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long hair, and I need to use a good amount to get a good lather.</li>
            <li> They produce some good products that really work.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and has a peach type scent.  </li>
            <li> Very mild</li>
            <li> It makes all my children hair looking clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> Moreover, it has a rich lather and rinses very clean.</li>
            <li> Because the kids get baths/showers every day they don&#x27;t need to shampoo and condition, a 2 in 1 works fine for them.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and did not bother sensitive scalps.  </li>
            <li> It makes their hair very soft, and they smell sooooo good after their bath.  </li>
            <li> Smells so good and makes kids hair soft!</li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter loved the smell and it seemed to rinse out easily</li>
            <li> I wish Suave Kids Shampoo would be tear free.</li>
            <li> This worked great for my sons coarse curls.</li>
            <li> A nice gentle peach fragrance.</li>
            <li> Just light on the conditioning.</li>
            <li> always look on, in skepticism, when a shampoo says tear free.</li>
            <li> Overall another great product</li>
            <li> Good smell and make hair soft and smooth after using it</li>
            <li> Detangles, conditions, doesn&#x27;t cause tears, and good for sensitive skin/scalp.</li>
            <li> I also notice is has a pretty good detangler/conditioner, but my daughter&#x27;s hair is really fine, so I&#x27;m surprised it doesn&#x27;t do an even better job.</li>
            <li> This kids shampoo &amp; condition works really well, has a nice smell and does a great job detangling of long hair.</li>
            <li> Peach is pretty good at that, as good as any other 2 in 1</li>
            <li> Perfect for everyday use!</li>
            <li> and they are usually pretty interesting.  </li>
            <li> Both of them have clean, shiny hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does smell really nice and my kids love the bright bottle, but watching it separate has made me more skeptical of combination products.  </li>
            <li> Not fake peaches or real peaches, just kind of generically &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> We use after swimming and it leaves your hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really ask for more than that.  </li>
            <li> Suave Kids 2 in 1 is our absolute favorite shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 9 year old son and he said he really liked the smell.</li>
            <li> and I needed to find a shampoo + conditioner that was more gentle for kids.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is really gentle and still has the no tears.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It lathers well and hair comes out clean and smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li> It lathers well and leaves his hair smelling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> This combination shampoo conditioner is a nice thick liquid that lathers well and has a good smell.</li>
            <li> so he keeps asking to use this particular brand :-)</li>
            <li> Gets their hair clean and it rinses pretty easily (which is nice when there&#x27;s limited shower time).</li>
            <li> Smells great and a 2 for 1 which makes showering kids a little bit faster.</li>
            <li> We go through it like crazy, but that&#x27;s okay, because the price is great!</li>
            <li> We like the fun, fruity peach smell.</li>
            <li> They love that instead of having to do two steps to clean their hair they only need to do one.</li>
            <li> It leave just the right level of oils in the hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great product to have in your bathroom if you have little ones!</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner leaves their hair shiny, soft, and smelling peachy clean!</li>
            <li> and we feel that they&#x27;re pretty economical.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very long and did not seem to tangle as much.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice shampoo, with a peachy smell.</li>
            <li> (The fragrance is a little strong  during the actual bath, but after that, our daughter&#x27;s hair smelled great all</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li> shampoos provide more conditioning than baby shampoos, making hair soft and easy to comb, but they still have a no-tears formula that my big kids still need.  </li>
            <li> This particular scent is sweet but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> At one time, I would use the shampoo first, rinse it out and then add the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Soft and Smooth Detangler Twirlin&#x27; Swirlberry]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (We&#x27;ve had slightly better detangling results when using separate shampoos and conditioners, but those take longer, so we usually stick to 2 in 1s in all but the most leisurely baths).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One thing I&#x27;d like to see Amazon change is to either pack things like this in a smaller box or somehow better insure that a package like this can&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> I have a soon-to-be 5 year old daughter and this is a great alternative to other tear-free/hypoallergenic product!  </li>
            <li> I got it in my eyes because I am not good at keeping my eyes shut, and it didn&#x27;t sting, which was also great.</li>
            <li> I love that it leaves my babies hair clean and conditioned in half the time!  </li>
            <li> It smells really good while you are using it, but doesn&#x27;t last all day long.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not too strong and I use a little in his tub to make a light bubble bath.</li>
            <li> I love having a single bottle that can be used in the tub for both shampoo and conditioner, since getting a &amp;#34;kid&amp;#34; to put up with two products is a bit much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He suggested that I use childrenâ€™s shampoo and conditioner because it is gentle.  </li>
            <li> However, it lathers very well.  </li>
            <li> Which makes is so hassle free not having to buy3 different bottles of products when they just throw it all in one!</li>
            <li> My daughter wants to take a bath every day because of this shampoo)))</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t condition very well, so she still has to use a separate conditioner.</li>
            <li> We really like this Suave 2-in-1 Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It did not leave my hair shiny nor did it provide much in the way of help for detangling.</li>
            <li> My kindergartner has very curly hair and we have found that conditioner is a must for keeping tangles at bay.  </li>
            <li> shampoo itself does smell very peachy.</li>
            <li> I really like the Suave kids product line</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leak as a fault of the product&#x27;s packaging but rather because it just bounced and slid around in the box too much during shipment.</li>
            <li> This 2-1 shampoo works well on the fine long hair of my oldest granddaughter and the thicker hair of my nephew.  </li>
            <li> left her hair clean smelling and no tangles for the discounted price</li>
            <li> Our eight year old has long hair that tends to get tied in knots, so we love shampoos that help with a post-bath combing out.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hair product for men who suffer from MPB and need a gentle shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> No points deducted from the review since the product itself is still good (may have lost an ounce and a half or two total).</li>
            <li> I line them up, start at the top of their head, work down, and dunk.</li>
            <li> Decent soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tear free and hypoallergenic which is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; in our house with young children...eventually soap inevitably ends up in their eyes at some point, so</li>
            <li> This is a decent shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love the smell when my little guy comes out of the bath.  </li>
            <li> We like the scent of the pineapple a little better.</li>
            <li> I much prefer fruity scents to floral ones, so this line offers a lot of choices.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most importantly he never says his eyes are burning when soap gets in them</li>
            <li> This may be normal for shampoo/conditioner combinations, but it made me suspicious of how well it&#x27;s doing either.  </li>
            <li> The bottle also has a fun fact on the back which my kids like to read</li>
            <li> The peach smell is much more subtle than many of their other scents.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt my sons eyes and leaves hair very soft.</li>
            <li> and my daughter is very sensitive that way.</li>
            <li> Once again, suave comes on the clear winner!</li>
            <li> No crying when in eyes!</li>
            <li> bottle is easy to hold, open and squeeze with wet hands.</li>
            <li> I have three little ones to bathe so ease of use is extremely important.</li>
            <li> , my 6 year old daughter does like it.</li>
            <li> Rinsing is fairly simple, and it doesn&#x27;t take much to wash it out.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is especially sensitive, and it doesn&#x27;t make her eyes red.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly, I still prefer the 3-n-1 over this 2-n-1(saves an extra step), but I DO really like this on their hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this for my three year old daughter who has longer hair.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really the only downside.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo + conditioner for my 5 year old son.</li>
            <li> (oh the life of a six year old).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hypoallergenic for the the blond one with sensitive skin&lt;</li>
            <li> One of my grandsons has thick, coarse hair and the 2 in 1 does a nice job of smoothing it out and making it softer.</li>
            <li> However, they aren&#x27;t water tight, so when they&#x27;re dropped in a tub full of water, some will get in and dilute the shampoo.</li>
            <li> It takes a decent amount to work up a later, maybe a *splotch* the size of a quarter on my one-year-old&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li> It is tear free, and the texture is silky smooth and thick, but not so heavy that it leaves a film in the kids hair.</li>
            <li> Thankfully there were no other items shipped with this one</li>
            <li> Now, I did note that the conditioning aspect seems a little light, so if your young-one has long hair, you may want to layer on [[ASIN:B004DBS8TC Suave Kids Conditioner Fairy Berry Strawberry]] or spritz on [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> So far the only problem I had is that some of the shampoo went on my daughter eyes and burned her eyes</li>
            <li> It was expected, thanks</li>
            <li> I also like how the lids stay pretty tight on these bottles and won&#x27;t leak if they knock them over.  </li>
            <li> The squeeze bottle is a terrific idea, because it lets our little one pour out the right amount of shampoo by herself without risking a big spill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really does the job and leaves her hair a bit less tangled when it is time for THAT part of the task of getting her ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish that the consistency was a little thicker, as I think I want my little ones to have a bathwash they enjoy.</li>
            <li> This product helps tame the tangles in her hair, which makes life much easier for everyone in our household.</li>
            <li> I tried it myself in the shower and it didn&#x27;t sting, but I&#x27;m not an eight year old, so I can&#x27;t compare this to other no tears formulations, or tell you whether a youngster would mind getting it in her eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell however is probably not going to be tolerated too long by my nephew (now only 3).</li>
            <li> I get anxiety and don&#x27;t want to be in there long enough to shampoo and condition.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of anything that will get my kids a least a little bit excited to shower.</li>
            <li> The little ones (ages 3, 4, 6, 9) like all the different scents Orange Mango, Cowabunga Coconut, Wild Watermelon &amp; Strawberry</li>
            <li> for my 2 with long hair I follow with Suave Kids Detangling Spray.</li>
            <li> So if you are going to use it on a child with long hair, plan on still buying your spray on detangler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 3yo has incredibly long hair that gets tangly</li>
            <li> The other grandson has thin and fine hair and the 2 in 1 doesn&#x27;t weigh his hair down or make it greasy.</li>
            <li> That will dry out the skin, though...</li>
            <li> This does help with tangles, but we still use a leave-in conditioner before we dry the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with a lot of fragrances but this is not too strong or irritating.</li>
            <li> It leaves my daughter with her very thick hair so much easier to get through.</li>
            <li> While the fragrance is slightly stronger while lathering the shampoo, once the hair is dry</li>
            <li> Only problem I have with the shampoo is that it&#x27;s a little runny (compared to other shampoos I previously owned) when trying to pour it out.</li>
            <li> With other shampoo/conditioner combos, I have had difficulty rinsing out, not so with this.</li>
            <li> I even use it on myself sometimes when my hair is getting a little dry and over worked.</li>
            <li> A small amount will go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent will be a problem for some kids but the average kid will have no adverse reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a month on my son, who has very short but thick hair, and my daughter who has finer toddler hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little too peachy for my tastes.</li>
            <li> We use it for hair and body on my two little boys.  </li>
            <li> I have two little boys.</li>
            <li> Harsh, abrasive cleansers will damage my hair, causing it to fall out of my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Personally, my kids hate getting their hair washed, so I really appreciate the fact that the shampoo and conditioner is combined.</li>
            <li> They credited my account in less than 10 minutes!</li>
            <li> bottle itself did leak pretty bad inside the Amazon box, though.</li>
            <li> but I am lazy or</li>
            <li> The peach smells terrible; usually we love all of the scents but this one missed the mark,</li>
            <li> Conditioning is a must for both my daughters, they both have thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It cleansed my children&#x27;s and my hair with suds that were thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li> and when I smell their heads it is seriously heavenly.</li>
            <li> It might be gentler, but get any soap in your eyes and it is not good and will create tears.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> But too expensive in Amazon</li>
            <li> but came with a leak , hopefully just a one time poor packaging issue!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it made her scalp itch after two weeks, so she stopped using it.</li>
            <li> The peach scent comes through, and doesn&#x27;t smell artificial or overpowering.  </li>
            <li> our daughter wasn&#x27;t crazy about testing the &amp;#34;no tears&amp;#34; claim.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> No tears great scent!</li>
            <li> Smells great,  my kid loves it</li>
            <li> Good kids bodywash that foams up pretty well in the bath.  Wish that the consistency was a little thicker, as I think I want my little ones to have a bathwash they enjoy. The smell is a little too peachy for my tastes. But all in all a good product. Will probably try a different scent next time.</li>
            <li> My kids ask for me to use thos shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t make them tear and the smell is great.</li>
            <li> I love Suave products so decided to purchase this to try with my kids. They love the smell and the deaigns on the bottle. I love that it works and its a great product.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo for my daughter ever. But too expensive in Amazon</li>
            <li> We love this shampoo/conditioner for the kids.  It smells really great, is gentle on young ones, and leaves their hair clean and smelling delicious!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  We use it for hair and body on my two little boys.  It makes their hair very soft, and they smell sooooo good after their bath.  It also makes for good bubbles if you just squeeze a bit under the running water.  Then the whole bath smells good.  We go through it like crazy, but that&#x27;s okay, because the price is great!</li>
            <li> This is a great price and smells amazing. My child loves it and I find myself using it also!!</li>
            <li> a good quality product and I am happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and does not irritate the eyes.</li>
            <li> Decent soap. Inexpensive enough that I don&#x27;t die inside when my kids squeeze out the entire bottle. That will dry out the skin, though...</li>
            <li> Works great on kids&#x27; hair and grown-ups!  We use after swimming and it leaves your hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Years ago, I went to a dermatologist for treatment of my Male Pattern Baldness (MPB).  He suggested that I use childrenâ€™s shampoo and conditioner because it is gentle.  Harsh, abrasive cleansers will damage my hair, causing it to fall out of my scalp.  Furthermore, childrenâ€™s shampoo and conditioner doesnâ€™t sting my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have to use a conditioner every day in order to prevent dandruff.  At one time, I would use the shampoo first, rinse it out and then add the conditioner.  This was time consuming and sometimes, if I wasnâ€™t using the conditioner every day, I would forget the last time I used it.  2 in 1 is much more convenient and affordable.  Packing for a trip is easier when your shampoo and conditioner are in one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Suave Kids 2 in 1 Peach Shampoo and Conditioner smells great.  I love the smell of peach.  My favorite scented Yankee candle is Juicy Peach.  Whenever I open up the bottle of Suave 2 in 1 Peach, I think of the Juicy Peach Yankee Candle.  I must warn you that the shampoo and conditioner pours easily out of its plastic bottle; it doesnâ€™t ooze out like most shampoos and conditioners.  However, it lathers very well.  A small amount will go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I havenâ€™t had any dandruff since using the Suave Kids 2 in 1 Peach Shampoo and Conditioner.  My hair looks and feels healthy.  It is shiny and lustrous.  I highly recommend this hair product for men who suffer from MPB and need a gentle shampoo and conditioner.  In fact, I believe all adults can benefit from it.  I strongly believe that it is best to cycle your hair products in order to prevent your hair from developing a tolerance towards one hair product, eventually rendering it ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B. Hoyos</li>
            <li> Works as intended.  Cleans the kids up with no problems or complaints from them so I can&#x27;t really ask for more than that.  Doesn&#x27;t stink either.</li>
            <li> I love suave kids products, they smell amazing and they always have 2 in 1 or 3 in 1 products. Which makes is so hassle free not having to buy3 different bottles of products when they just throw it all in one!</li>
            <li> Tear free, and nice scent. Only problem I have with the shampoo is that it&#x27;s a little runny (compared to other shampoos I previously owned) when trying to pour it out. Pour with caution for the first time, otherwise it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> Smells great and leave my kids hair nice, smooth and smelling fresh</li>
            <li> The product arrived taped up:  YES!  That kept it from leaking all over the place!  I have a soon-to-be 5 year old daughter and this is a great alternative to other tear-free/hypoallergenic product!  The peach smell was nice to have and smelled great in her hair (I wanted to use it!  LOL!)  It did a nice job cleaning her hair and a good job conditioning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product to have in your bathroom if you have little ones!</li>
            <li> Love the smell when my little guy comes out of the bath.  Most importantly he never says his eyes are burning when soap gets in them</li>
            <li> This kids shampoo &amp; condition works really well, has a nice smell and does a great job detangling of long hair.</li>
            <li> The product was gentle to use, effective and smells great with a bottle design my nephew loved! Perfect for everyday use! Once again, suave comes on the clear winner!</li>
            <li> My six year love the smell of this shampoo. So far the only problem I had is that some of the shampoo went on my daughter eyes and burned her eyes I wish Suave Kids Shampoo would be tear free.</li>
            <li> The best smelling suave product we&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> Best kids shampoo out there!</li>
            <li> After graduating from baby shampoos, my kids started using Suave Kids shampoos.  We love them.  Suave Kids 2-in-1 shampoos provide more conditioning than baby shampoos, making hair soft and easy to comb, but they still have a no-tears formula that my big kids still need.  The price is great and the Suave fragrances are appealing to children.  This shampoo has a nice peach scent that is not too overpowering.  My kid prefer the strawberry scented Suave Kids shampoo, but the peach is a nice alternative.</li>
            <li> We recently tried this and the Suave 3-in-1 Shampoo conditioner and body wash in Pineapple. They are both great. We like the scent of the pineapple a little better. This is sort of syrupy peach scent. But it is still nice- just more perfumy than fruity.  they are both surprisingly conditioning. This worked great for my sons coarse curls. It also worked nicely for my daughter who has silky hair.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of anything that will get my kids a least a little bit excited to shower. This 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner does the trick. They love that instead of having to do two steps to clean their hair they only need to do one. Conditioning is a must for both my daughters, they both have thick wavy hair. This shampoo/conditioner leaves their hair shiny, soft, and smelling peachy clean!</li>
            <li> This 2-1 shampoo works well on the fine long hair of my oldest granddaughter and the thicker hair of my nephew.  The smell however is probably not going to be tolerated too long by my nephew (now only 3).</li>
            <li> My granddaughter is now spending one night a week at Grammy&#x27;s house (That&#x27;s me). I love having a single bottle that can be used in the tub for both shampoo and conditioner, since getting a &amp;#34;kid&amp;#34; to put up with two products is a bit much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves the peachy scent and so do I. It really does the job and leaves her hair a bit less tangled when it is time for THAT part of the task of getting her ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up - working for us.</li>
            <li> This combination shampoo conditioner is a nice thick liquid that lathers well and has a good smell. Whether or not you like the peach scent is irrelevant, there are so many different fragrances to choose from. I&#x27;ve also used the [[ASIN:B0020122ZS Suave Kids 2 in 1 Shampoo and Conditioner, Cowabunga Coconut, 22.5 Ounce (Packaging May Vary)]] and loved that one too. I much prefer fruity scents to floral ones, so this line offers a lot of choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; While the fragrance is slightly stronger while lathering the shampoo, once the hair is dry I don&#x27;t find the scent overpowering. One of my grandsons has thick, coarse hair and the 2 in 1 does a nice job of smoothing it out and making it softer. The other grandson has thin and fine hair and the 2 in 1 doesn&#x27;t weigh his hair down or make it greasy. Also, if it gets in their eyes it doesn&#x27;t burn or sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product and would purchase it in the future.</li>
            <li> I have two little boys. We like the fun, fruity peach smell. It does a good job of cleaning their hair. It&#x27;s tear free and hypoallergenic which is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; in our house with young children...eventually soap inevitably ends up in their eyes at some point, so it&#x27;s nice to know that this won&#x27;t burn or irritate their eyes. It arrived packaged well and taped up, so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about it leaking on arrival.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell like peaches. Not fake peaches or real peaches, just kind of generically &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; smelling.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Great for kids.</li>
            <li> Great product but came with a leak , hopefully just a one time poor packaging issue!</li>
            <li> Good smell and make hair soft and smooth after using it, my 6 year old daughter does like it.</li>
            <li> Works great on my grandkids hair</li>
            <li> I use this as an all-in-one for my kiddos after swim class. It works great. A nice gentle peach fragrance. I have a hard time with a lot of fragrances but this is not too strong or irritating. Gets their hair clean and it rinses pretty easily (which is nice when there&#x27;s limited shower time). Great product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this. My daughter likes it as well and it makes her hair smooth and perfect</li>
            <li> This is another nice shampoo + conditioner from the Suave Kids line.  The peach scent smells wonderful but doesn&#x27;t linger on too strong after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lathers well and hair comes out clean and smelling fresh.  This does help with tangles, but we still use a leave-in conditioner before we dry the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is easy to hold, open and squeeze with wet hands.</li>
            <li> for my 2 with long hair I follow with Suave Kids Detangling Spray. Because the kids get baths/showers every day they don&#x27;t need to shampoo and condition, a 2 in 1 works fine for them. The little ones (ages 3, 4, 6, 9) like all the different scents Orange Mango, Cowabunga Coconut, Wild Watermelon &amp; Strawberry (I like Surf&#x27;s up).</li>
            <li> The peach scent comes through, and doesn&#x27;t smell artificial or overpowering.  It takes a decent amount to work up a later, maybe a *splotch* the size of a quarter on my one-year-old&#x27;s head.  Rinsing is fairly simple, and it doesn&#x27;t take much to wash it out.  My daughter is especially sensitive, and it doesn&#x27;t make her eyes red.  My wife doesn&#x27;t feel that it cleans as well as Aveeno brand shampoo conditioner, but it is a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> My daughter wants to take a bath every day because of this shampoo)))</li>
            <li> This is so great that I use it on my own hair as well as my preschooler. It doesn&#x27;t hurt my sons eyes and leaves hair very soft.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using the Suave 3-n-1 for awhile now on all 3 of my boys(5,2,1). Admittedly, I still prefer the 3-n-1 over this 2-n-1(saves an extra step), but I DO really like this on their hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;-Smells wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;-Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;-Tear free&lt;br /&gt;-My boys love the bright colors/pictures on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;-You still have to have a body wash/soap to use on the rest of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been well pleased with the Suave kid&#x27;s products, and that&#x27;s all we buy now.</li>
            <li> I use this for my three year old daughter who has longer hair. I love the smell of the peach when it goes on, but you can&#x27;t smell it once her hair dries - I wish it did like the Johnson&#x27;s and Johnsons tend to do.  I also notice is has a pretty good detangler/conditioner, but my daughter&#x27;s hair is really fine, so I&#x27;m surprised it doesn&#x27;t do an even better job. We still have knots when we brush it after the shower, but they come out without needing any detangle spray.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is unbelievably appealing! It will make adults jealous. This, alone, can entice children into the ever-dreaded bath. Moreover, it has a rich lather and rinses very clean. Now, I did note that the conditioning aspect seems a little light, so if your young-one has long hair, you may want to layer on [[ASIN:B004DBS8TC Suave Kids Conditioner Fairy Berry Strawberry]] or spritz on [[ASIN:B004DBXKM2 Suave Kids Soft and Smooth Detangler Twirlin&#x27; Swirlberry]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> Love Suave for kids. Smells great and a 2 for 1 which makes showering kids a little bit faster.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for a month on my son, who has very short but thick hair, and my daughter who has finer toddler hair. Both of them have clean, shiny hair and when I smell their heads it is seriously heavenly. My son has a history of severe eczema and I was worried he might get a rash in his armpits  or back or stomach from switching shampoo but no problem. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> The peach smell is much more subtle than many of their other scents.  We&#x27;ve used the Kids Suave products for years with all of our children.  They like them and we feel that they&#x27;re pretty economical.  The peach smell of this one is very light, so keep that in mind.  I also like how the lids stay pretty tight on these bottles and won&#x27;t leak if they knock them over.  However, they aren&#x27;t water tight, so when they&#x27;re dropped in a tub full of water, some will get in and dilute the shampoo.</li>
            <li> This works great with my kids - the smell is nice and it works well.  Detangles, conditions, doesn&#x27;t cause tears, and good for sensitive skin/scalp.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves the peach scent of this shampoo. It lathers very easily and makes shampooing seem more pleasant for her.  It doesn&#x27;t condition very well, so she still has to use a separate conditioner. Unfortunately, it made her scalp itch after two weeks, so she stopped using it. Not everyone will have that reaction to this shampoo. If your scalp can tolerate it, this shampoo does smell good and kids like it.</li>
            <li> Suave Kids 2 in 1 is our absolute favorite shampoo/conditioner. It is tear free, and the texture is silky smooth and thick, but not so heavy that it leaves a film in the kids hair. Personally, my kids hate getting their hair washed, so I really appreciate the fact that the shampoo and conditioner is combined. This particular scent is sweet but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> This is the best cost-effective shampoo</li>
            <li> Great combo for children who don&#x27;t like to wash their hair and then add conditioner to rinse out again.</li>
            <li> Great price. kids like it because of the smell and because they don&#x27;t have to do separate shampoo and conditioning- great value for the price!</li>
            <li> This is such a convenient product for my children!  The smell is amazing and my kiddos love it.  I love that it leaves my babies hair clean and conditioned in half the time!  Will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I got this for my 9 year old son and he said he really liked the smell. It was easy to get a good lather with and cleaned his hair well. I&#x27;ve used it myself and while I am not a fan of the color of the shampoo, a shimmery beige color, it did a good job of making my hair clean and giving it a smoothness (since it has conditioner in it as well). Another nice feature is the bottle has grooves on the side that make it easy to hold (for hands of all sizes). I thought this was a very good shampoo.</li>
            <li> We really like this Suave 2-in-1 Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.  It has a really nice smell that&#x27;s peachy without being overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleansed my children&#x27;s and my hair with suds that were thick and creamy.  It DOES NOT have a great deal of conditioner though, so I really think it might be best for boys and girls with hair that doesn&#x27;t need too much conditioning. One of my nieces, for example, has very fine hair and if she uses a product with too much conditioning her locks just lay there limply.  This Suave product would be great for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not leave my hair shiny nor did it provide much in the way of help for detangling. So if you are going to use it on a child with long hair, plan on still buying your spray on detangler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a basic Kids Shampoo and Conditioner, this is a very good product.  Smells nice and cleans well. Just light on the conditioning.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and makes kids hair soft! Great price too.</li>
            <li> My kindergartner has very curly hair and we have found that conditioner is a must for keeping tangles at bay.  This 2 in 1 has been great for her as she does not have to shampoo and condition separately.  She likes the peach smell so there is no fuss when it is time for her to shampoo.  This product helps tame the tangles in her hair, which makes life much easier for everyone in our household.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and did not bother sensitive scalps.  It left our hair frizzy and in need of further conditioning.  Will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> I bought it for myself because sometimes I feel like showering but I am lazy or I get anxiety and don&#x27;t want to be in there long enough to shampoo and condition. This is great for those times because I can get it done and it&#x27;s very gentle on my hair. It smells lovely and is not overpowering. I got it in my eyes because I am not good at keeping my eyes shut, and it didn&#x27;t sting, which was also great.</li>
            <li> Works great for my 3 year old&#x27;s super fine hair, and smells great! Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> i got this for my grand daughter it smells so good left her hair clean smelling and no tangles for the discounted price it was a great deal thamks again for wonderful deals and discounts</li>
            <li> We have a see through shampoo dispenser in the kids bathroom and this stuff literally separated in it.  You can see the conditioner on the bottom and the soap on the top.  This may be normal for shampoo/conditioner combinations, but it made me suspicious of how well it&#x27;s doing either.  Next time I&#x27;ll probably just buy shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell really nice and my kids love the bright bottle, but watching it separate has made me more skeptical of combination products.  I guess if you buy this you should shake it before use.</li>
            <li> The Suave 2 in 1 Shampoo Conditioner has a nice, fresh scent. The peach is not overpowering and quite pleasant. My daughter loves it. My son says it smells girly (probably because my daughter likes it...he likes the pineapple)....I don&#x27;t think so. It rinses out well and does not leave her hair feeling greasy. With other shampoo/conditioner combos, I have had difficulty rinsing out, not so with this. No complaints of eyes burning....and my daughter is very sensitive that way. My daughter has long hair, and I need to use a good amount to get a good lather. That&#x27;s really the only downside. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a hit. Also, for the price, I think there is a lot of value.</li>
            <li> This is a decent shampoo and conditioner. I have used it on myself and the grandkids staying overnight.&lt;br /&gt;I always look on, in skepticism, when a shampoo says tear free. It might be gentler, but get any soap in your eyes and it is not good and will create tears.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself does smell very peachy. While I liked the smell, my grandsons thought it was too &#x60;girly&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;The included conditioner seemed to work well. My hair is very long and did not seem to tangle as much.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice shampoo, with a peachy smell.</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive shampoo and conditioner that I use on my son who is just over 2 years old.  The scent is not too strong and I use a little in his tub to make a light bubble bath.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo + conditioner for my 5 year old son. The scent is good and it washes his hair thoroughly. It lathers well and leaves his hair smelling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I really like the Suave kids product line and this is no exception.  They produce some good products that really work.  This is a 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner.  It is easy to use and has a peach type scent.  MY kids like the smell and the ease of use.  The product is also tear free which is great.  The bottle also has a fun fact on the back which my kids like to read and they are usually pretty interesting.  Overall another great product and I will continue to use the Suave kids products for my children.</li>
            <li> The peach smells terrible; usually we love all of the scents but this one missed the mark, Phew!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my kids they  love the smell and it lathers up really nice!</li>
            <li> Our eight year old has long hair that tends to get tied in knots, so we love shampoos that help with a post-bath combing out. Suave 2 in 1 Peach is pretty good at that, as good as any other 2 in 1 we&#x27;ve tried. (We&#x27;ve had slightly better detangling results when using separate shampoos and conditioners, but those take longer, so we usually stick to 2 in 1s in all but the most leisurely baths).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other things we liked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It lathers and cleans well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- After washing, the shampoo leaves a great peach smell. (The fragrance is a little strong  during the actual bath, but after that, our daughter&#x27;s hair smelled great all day.)&lt;br /&gt;- The squeeze bottle is a terrific idea, because it lets our little one pour out the right amount of shampoo by herself without risking a big spill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Note: our daughter wasn&#x27;t crazy about testing the &amp;#34;no tears&amp;#34; claim. I tried it myself in the shower and it didn&#x27;t sting, but I&#x27;m not an eight year old, so I can&#x27;t compare this to other no tears formulations, or tell you whether a youngster would mind getting it in her eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommended for users of 2 in 1s who like the scent of peach.</li>
            <li> my grand kids smell so good and actually I like to use it too.  Very mild but it makes me hungry for peach pie!!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for toddlers and children. My 3yo has incredibly long hair that gets tangly and I needed to find a shampoo + conditioner that was more gentle for kids. Suave keeps hair clean, eliminates many tangles with the conditioner, and the peach scent is nice!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my son.  He has inherited my fine hair, so this works out perfectly.  I love the fact that it is really gentle and still has the no tears.  It smells really good while you are using it, but doesn&#x27;t last all day long.  I have no had any problems with the conditioner aspect because he has short hair and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the tangles.  My daughter has determined that it is baby shampoo and will not use it (oh the life of a six year old).</li>
            <li> I have three little ones to bathe so ease of use is extremely important. I line them up, start at the top of their head, work down, and dunk. While I can do that with any shampoo, this one works better because:&lt;br /&gt;1. it&#x27;s hypoallergenic for the the blond one with sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;2. it&#x27;s tear-free so they fuss less&lt;br /&gt;3. it has a bit of conditioner in it so one of the three doesn&#x27;t require additional conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this one better than some of the alternatives because it smells really good.  The scent will be a problem for some kids but the average kid will have no adverse reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the price is great, particularly with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> No crying when in eyes! hallelujah ! leaves a pleasant scent after cleaned, good product</li>
            <li> Love the scent leaves the children&#x27;s hair soft and manageable and perfect! Love suave!</li>
            <li> Pretty good value for kids&#x27; shampoo plus it smells amazing! My 6 year old daughter loved the smell and it seemed to rinse out easily enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle itself did leak pretty bad inside the Amazon box, though. Not enough to warrant sending it back but enough that I reached out to Amazon about the issue. They credited my account in less than 10 minutes! Once again proving how excellent their customer service is. One thing I&#x27;d like to see Amazon change is to either pack things like this in a smaller box or somehow better insure that a package like this can&#x27;t leak. It didn&#x27;t leak as a fault of the product&#x27;s packaging but rather because it just bounced and slid around in the box too much during shipment. Thankfully there were no other items shipped with this one so nothing else was damaged by the leaking shampoo. No points deducted from the review since the product itself is still good (may have lost an ounce and a half or two total).</li>
            <li> It was expected, thanks</li>
            <li> Smells great leaves hair smelling great even after a few hours most kids soups the smell fades!</li>
            <li> Smells great, leaves my kiddos hair fresh and clean.  Also makes great bubbles!</li>
            <li> This is a great kids shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t bother either rod my children&#x27;s eyes and they like the smell.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, my kids&#x27; hair look great and the youngest one likes the lobster drawing on it so he keeps asking to use this particular brand :-)</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time for my children. There is no issues with any tears. It leaves my daughter with her very thick hair so much easier to get through. It makes all my children hair looking clean and healthy. I even use it on myself sometimes when my hair is getting a little dry and over worked. It leave just the right level of oils in the hair. I am going to be getting more as a baby gift for my friends that are having babies here. This is a must buy with anyone that has children.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Makes my kids hair smell good even after bathtime! Tear-free and my kids approve!</li>
