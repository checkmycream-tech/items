            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for winter time...</li>
            <li>Was thrilled to find it on amazon!</li>
            <li>I loved it because it worked so well and took care of my itcy skin.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both love this lotion!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Better than Sarna!</li>
            <li>It is also amazing during the day, too, and has been a must-have for myself and my three-year-old son.</li>
            <li>Would have liked to have bought 1 tube, but had to buy two.  </li>
            <li>over priced and has a nice cooling agent in it which is some unnatural chemical, but is great on hot spots</li>
            <li>I have tried so many lotions for healing tattoos, this is by far the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Have tried many others.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I was no longer able to find this item in the stores.</li>
            <li>It was such a dissapointment as it is a wonderful soothing lotion for feet and legs.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite for rashes and healing.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend for sure.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it any more in Target or Walmart</li>
            <li>This lotion has been hands down the best to soothe and stop the itch</li>
            <li>Very good lotion for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I love all the Aveeno products for their effectiveness; the results are well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Also tried the Uderly Smooth Udder Cream and are using it up faster.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps waiting for a pent-up demand to justify a significant price increase?</li>
            <li>Worked great on relieving my sons itchy dry skin.</li>
            <li>It feels cool when applied</li>
            <li>The only thing that has worked almost as good is lotions with hydrocortisone which if I can I avoid.</li>
            <li>Helped my mild sunburn and the menthol soothes me...</li>
            <li>I have tried lotions we use in the hospital for itching without success.</li>
            <li>It is more of a cream then your daily care.</li>
            <li>This cream feels good to me after any chore that is hard on my hands.</li>
            <li>It stops the intense itch, doesn&#x27;t get greasy, it lets my skin breath, and it lasts.</li>
            <li>and we really need that here in Texas...</li>
            <li>my skin is very itchy in places and the Aveeno calming lotion</li>
            <li>The Aveeno doesn&#x27;t soak in to my hands as fast as the Udder Cream, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m really really worried.</li>
            <li>My one patient who actually tried it had good relief and had to take less medication for itching.</li>
            <li>OK, my title was meant half in jest, however...</li>
            <li>This particular version (w/menthol) is heavenly relief.</li>
            <li>product also was the ONLY lotion that soothed my facial eczema as well as providing a cool, non-greasy feeling afterward and for a FRACTION of the cost of prescribed medications.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product that is next to impossible to find in the local stores.</li>
            <li>I treat patients with a chemo therapy drug that causes very itchy dry skin</li>
            <li>This is the only, THE ONLY lotion I have found to calm down my itchy skin after shaving and in the winter from dryness.</li>
            <li>I have dry and sometimes itchy skin due to diabetes and this really helps.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine the ingredients being scarce or a discountenance due to low</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who has dry, itchy skin.</li>

            <li> I have tried others like CeraVe and Sarna, but they leave you feeling with a &amp;#34;clammy&amp;#34; type of wet (although they work well also).</li>

            <li> These medications cause fatigue and other side effects and here this lotion worked!!!  </li>
            <li> Not sure why the maker has decided to discontinue.</li>
            <li> Too bad it is no more.</li>
            <li> It will be difficult to replace it.</li>
            <li> This is the product that is no longer made and difficult to find.</li>
            <li> I had a bad case of psoriasis on my hands and face which i never had before.</li>
            <li> Too bad it&#x27;s discountinued</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve stopped making this and that&#x27;s horrible because it works so well!!  </li>

            <li> Aveeno lotion with menthol is one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t know why in heaven&#x27;s name it was taken off the market!</li>
            <li> Aveeno Skin Relief Itch Calming Lotion is the best lotion around for cooling my eczema.  This is a quality product that doesn&#x27;t sting my sore skin!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that is next to impossible to find in the local stores. I&#x27;m not sure if it is due to demand, or they have discontinued it. I hope they haven&#x27;t discontinued it because it is the ONLY lotion that works for me.</li>
            <li> I had a bad case of psoriasis on my hands and face which i never had before. It was just like poison ivy which i get all the time so i was treating it as such. A neighbor saw my hands and said it looked like psoriasis. This product was recommended to me for relief. I was also doing home remedies so not positive which worked or if it was a combination but it cleared itself. This cream feels good to me after any chore that is hard on my hands. Painting, laying tile, gardening. It is more of a cream then your daily care. Not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many lotions for healing tattoos, this is by far the best I&#x27;ve found. It stops the intense itch, doesn&#x27;t get greasy, it lets my skin breath, and it lasts. I will be restocking often.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love this lotion!  It feels cool when applied and we really need that here in Texas...in the summer!</li>
            <li> Aveeno makes a great skin care product. This particular version (w/menthol) is heavenly relief. However, it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> Very good lotion for dry skin. Have tried many others. This works the best. I recommend this to anyone who has dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> over priced and has a nice cooling agent in it which is some unnatural chemical, but is great on hot spots</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. Too bad it is no more. Not sure why the maker has decided to discontinue. It will be difficult to replace it.</li>
            <li> Worked great on relieving my sons itchy dry skin. I would buy this product again at this great price. A+++</li>
            <li> I was no longer able to find this item in the stores. It was such a dissapointment as it is a wonderful soothing lotion for feet and legs. Was thrilled to find it on amazon!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite for rashes and healing.  I love all the Aveeno products for their effectiveness; the results are well worth the price.</li>
            <li> my skin is very itchy in places and the Aveeno calming lotion is the only product that works.  Walgreens, CVS and others are not longer carrying it.</li>
            <li> Being a winter eczema sufferer, this is my preferred lotion of choice.  I have tried others like CeraVe and Sarna, but they leave you feeling with a &amp;#34;clammy&amp;#34; type of wet (although they work well also).</li>
            <li> Bought to replace same product.  Also tried the Uderly Smooth Udder Cream and are using it up faster.  My wife preferred the Udder Cream, but my mother-in-law prefers the Aveeno, so I have everyone covered.  Would have liked to have bought 1 tube, but had to buy two.  The Aveeno doesn&#x27;t soak in to my hands as fast as the Udder Cream, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Great product.I have dry and sometimes itchy skin due to diabetes and this really helps. Would recommend for sure.</li>
            <li> Helped my mild sunburn and the menthol soothes me... My itchy skin calms down to the point that it disappears. It&#x27;s great for winter time... Very relaxing no strong smell. Too bad it&#x27;s discountinued and I only found one at Grocery Outlet and online. Tip: Use it after taking a bath.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and I need relief at night.  I did not want to take medication that would leave me groggy.  The Aveeno works beautifully.  There is a menthol smell to it, I do not find it offensive.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve stopped making this and that&#x27;s horrible because it works so well!!  The only other one that has the same formula but a lower strength is the Baby Aveeno Anti-Itch.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Sometimes my excema gets so itchy hat it keeps me awake at night. This lotion has been hands down the best to soothe and stop the itch so I can get to sleep. It is also amazing during the day, too, and has been a must-have for myself and my three-year-old son.</li>
            <li> This is the product that is no longer made and difficult to find. I loved it because it worked so well and took care of my itcy skin. I have only a small portion of one tube remaining and am attempting to stretch it out.</li>
            <li> OK, my title was meant half in jest, however...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also was the ONLY lotion that soothed my facial eczema as well as providing a cool, non-greasy feeling afterward and for a FRACTION of the cost of prescribed medications. So why would this \\&quot;no longer be available\\&quot;? I can&#x27;t imagine the ingredients being scarce or a discountenance due to low sales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps waiting for a pent-up demand to justify a significant price increase?</li>
            <li> This is the only, THE ONLY lotion I have found to calm down my itchy skin after shaving and in the winter from dryness. I have tried lotions we use in the hospital for itching without success. Better than Sarna! I treat patients with a chemo therapy drug that causes very itchy dry skin and I have recommended this to them. My one patient who actually tried it had good relief and had to take less medication for itching. These medications cause fatigue and other side effects and here this lotion worked!!!  So I beg beg beg Aveeno not to discontinue this. I can&#x27;t find it any more in Target or Walmart so I&#x27;m really really worried. The only thing that has worked almost as good is lotions with hydrocortisone which if I can I avoid.</li>
