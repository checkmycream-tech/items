            <li>I have been ordering these for years now, and I love the Gigi creme wax product.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>

            <li>not as sticky as honey wax and because of the color, its easy to find on your skin :)</li>
            <li>It was sooo easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great wax, you only need to use a layer to wax, don&#x27;t use more than a layer or it wont work.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pick up fine hairs at all.  </li>
            <li>You can also get cheap ones at goodwill.  </li>
            <li>It comes off the skin easily and when you&#x27;re reafy to clean up, just use some baby oil</li>
            <li>I used the original gigi wax before this</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get in a hurry though because it is a pain to clean up.</li>
            <li>Nice consistency; not messy; precise placement with no dripping all over.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the honey wax if you like using strips or the hard wax which works the best.</li>
            <li>and you had to act quickly to make it all work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and washes off easily in the shower.</li>
            <li>It is messy and make sure to have a bottle of baby oil handy for clean up.</li>
            <li>you can easily clean it off you skin by using baby oil followed by a hot shower.</li>
            <li>But it is worth it.</li>
            <li>but this is a pain to try and clean (or maybe because I&#x27;m new to this type of wax that I am ignorant on how to clean my strips)</li>
            <li>It shipped right when it said it would though</li>
            <li>This is a gentle wax, better than the Honey Wax on sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that you have to make sure its at the right temperature.  </li>
            <li>then turn it off as I don&#x27;t want it too hot.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extra special because of the Tea Tree Oil!</li>
            <li>I have used creme wax from the same brand and from satin smooth.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li>Of all the different types of Gigi waxes, I think this one is my favorite so far (</li>
            <li>Most other honey type waxes caused my skin to break out after waxing.  </li>
            <li>Melted in 15 mins after the heating tray was placed on high.</li>
            <li>Cleanups on other surfaces are easy with a cotton ball soaked in nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and you enjoy having skin on your body, be careful with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to waxing, but this does what i want it to ususally.</li>
            <li>It felt like a particularly sticky, soft gum that gets into and onto everything</li>
            <li>Normally I dread waxing my pits because the area is so sensitive.</li>
            <li>Not a really big issue, just have to be aware of it.  </li>
            <li>Not very easy to handle, it&#x27;s very sticky and it doesn&#x27;t remove hair as easy as the regular brazilian wax</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used hard wax for so many years I&#x27;ve forgot about using the strips.</li>
            <li>Well even though it makes my skin so smooth and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it is really messy.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I like the tea tree and how it is not harsh on my skin</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read all the helpful hints and all I can gather is the people that love it are using it on thick hairs.</li>
            <li>It made for a huge mess!</li>
            <li>It even works great for places hard wax is usually used.</li>
            <li>The only difference and the main fact why this one caught my attention would be because of the &amp;#34;Tea Tree&amp;#34; in the mix.</li>
            <li>I have thick dark hair, lucky for my head, not so lucky everywhere else!  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way though, I do like the blue one better though.</li>
            <li>It makes a mess everywhere &amp; clean up is such a hassle.</li>
            <li>I went crazy because this stuff was so good.  </li>
            <li>I have thick fast growing hair so only hot wax will work and even then, they never get all the hairs.</li>

            <li> The consistency is very different than their other creme wax, it&#x27;s hard to describe but it wouldn&#x27;t hold the hair, and was even more difficult to clean up.</li>
            <li> The wax does not completely come off after applying the strips and ripping so you&#x27;re left with a cloudy, sticky film on your skin.</li>
            <li> If you have long enough hair (about a 1/4 inch), I recommend Nad&#x27;s sugar wax.</li>
            <li> Its a decent product though I think I will be trying the hard wax that you peel off next time.</li>
            <li> It was way too messy, and the wax left behind did not come off easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this after owning the pink crème wax in which they have the same texture.</li>
            <li> I have used the other Gigi waxes and have had the same result of having my skin torn off from the uber sticky stuff.</li>
            <li> I apply some baby powder to the area first, trim hairs if long and apply a thin layer (don&#x27;t plaster it on)</li>
            <li> A couple of tries did remove the bigger hairs (side burns) but doesn&#x27;t work waxing off the hairs on the upper lip; I kept trying so many times out of anger that I ended up burning my skin!</li>
            <li> I had been using the harder Brazilian wax without strips and was looking for a smoother wax.  </li>
            <li> I ended up throwing it out after two tries.</li>
            <li> It is a creamy green color and looks the same heated and unheated color-wise.</li>
            <li> Melts nicely without too much annoying bubbles.</li>
            <li> It was also more painful and sticky than other waxes I&#x27;ve tried and tore off a bit of skin.</li>
            <li> This I have to turn back on half way through or the wax will not come off with the strip leaving quite a mess.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something less hard-wax-like and love the &amp;#34;tea&amp;#34; element in any product but his was horrible messy - smelled funny - and irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews before purchasing this wax and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> Just be mindful that the wax seems to get even hotter than other Gigi waxes, so turn off the warmer for 5 minutes before using.</li>
            <li> I have tried all kinds of wax and other hair removal products.</li>
            <li> Product does not dry hard and is extremely messy.</li>
            <li> What it did do was leave my skin tacky and irritated and red - not a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for a few years now and it never lets me down.</li>
            <li> The other negative is that it smells a bit odd.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use this product it came in so messy.</li>
            <li> Turns out it&#x27;s green.</li>
            <li> I wasted money on this</li>
            <li> It become so sticky and messy that it becomes out of your control.</li>
            <li> it left behind at least 10.</li>
            <li> I find it less irritating and have less of a chance of burning myself.</li>
            <li> I would recommend cutting up old jeans as waxing strips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Usually I heat my wax</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a softer wax, so you have to rip down very hard</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;d rather use the hard wax for those.  </li>
            <li> For delacate areas I suggest the Gigi hard wax.</li>
            <li> I prefer hard wax, but I thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li> I had never seen that before with the hard wax.</li>
            <li> It might work on thick</li>
            <li> I work with creme waxes all the time and it was hard for me to make a thin application</li>
            <li> And I use a butter knife to apply a thin layer of wax.</li>
            <li> You can spread it really thin, so a can lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I did a thin layer of wax on my face, and it still did not pull any hairs off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the home-waxing thing but this product was so horrible, I had to post my comments.  </li>
            <li> On the contrary, the wax is almost impossible to remove.</li>
            <li> I still cant believe how bad it was.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> sucks!!!!!</li>
            <li> I gave it a try though, and it&#x27;s horrible.</li>
            <li> This wax was awful.</li>
            <li> It is horrible.</li>

            <li> I had never used creme wax and was told it is much better for your skin. Well even though it makes my skin so smooth and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it is really messy. I know it&#x27;s meant to be sticky but this is a pain to try and clean (or maybe because I&#x27;m new to this type of wax that I am ignorant on how to clean my strips) The other negative is that it smells a bit odd. I bought tee tree because I love that sent, could just be me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it does not disappoint. I have extremely sensitive skin and this feel much better than tradition honey bee wax.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use this product it came in so messy. Never replaced it...</li>
            <li> No redness are used, by far the best product i have ever used. I have tried many other GIGI wax products and love this one the best.</li>
            <li> I like the tea tree and how it is not harsh on my skin but I feel it doesn&#x27;t do the best job of helping with the removal of hair. Its a decent product though I think I will be trying the hard wax that you peel off next time.</li>
            <li> Not very easy to handle, it&#x27;s very sticky and it doesn&#x27;t remove hair as easy as the regular brazilian wax</li>
            <li> I read other reviews before purchasing this wax and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. They kind of missed the mark on this one. The wax does not completely come off after applying the strips and ripping so you&#x27;re left with a cloudy, sticky film on your skin. I would recommend the honey wax if you like using strips or the hard wax which works the best.</li>
            <li> I have used creme wax from the same brand and from satin smooth.Both are comparable.This is not water soluble,which means you will need baby oil or any oil to get any residue off.Cleanups on other surfaces are easy with a cotton ball soaked in nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle wax, better than the Honey Wax on sensitive areas. Just be mindful that the wax seems to get even hotter than other Gigi waxes, so turn off the warmer for 5 minutes before using. And it&#x27;s a softer wax, so you have to rip down very hard or it gets gummy.</li>
            <li> I wax at home, but my friends all complain of bumps from waxing. Well not with this wax!!! Lip &amp; eyebrows done of course with some redness but nothing like my friends said happened at salons.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pick up fine hairs at all.  It might work on thick but i&#x27;d rather use the hard wax for those.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt because it doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs. Maybe 50%.  I&#x27;ve tried it several times. I&#x27;ve read all the helpful hints and all I can gather is the people that love it are using it on thick hairs.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and you enjoy having skin on your body, be careful with this product. I have used the other Gigi waxes and have had the same result of having my skin torn off from the uber sticky stuff. It&#x27;s great for pesky hairs (my underarm hair stands not a chance against this goo) but should not be used on softer skin like the thigh. I have tiger stripes, I tell ya! For delacate areas I suggest the Gigi hard wax. It&#x27;s gentle and easy to wash off. The regular all purpose wax and the Tea Tree are way too adhesive for my taste and don&#x27;t wash off in the shower. If you have long enough hair (about a 1/4 inch), I recommend Nad&#x27;s sugar wax. It&#x27;s gentle and washes off easily in the shower.</li>
            <li> Note: Will need epithelial strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used hard wax for so many years I&#x27;ve forgot about using the strips. This wax is therapeutic. Easy to apply, leaves no residue, adheres great!</li>
            <li> This is the best creme wax I have ever used.  Most other honey type waxes caused my skin to break out after waxing.  I have had no issues whatsoever with this product.  It smells good and removes hair with ease.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for a few years now and it never lets me down. Don&#x27;t get in a hurry though because it is a pain to clean up. I would recommend cutting up old jeans as waxing strips. They work great and are free. You can also get cheap ones at goodwill.  And I use a butter knife to apply a thin layer of wax. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This did nearly next to nothing for me. For every hair it managed to pull out it left behind at least 10. It was also more painful and sticky than other waxes I&#x27;ve tried and tore off a bit of skin. I&#x27;ve had to go in with tweezers each time I&#x27;ve used it. I&#x27;m pretty much really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet because when it arrived, there was wax all over the outside of the container. It smells wonderful though!</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping . Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Great for do it yourself ears at home</li>
            <li> This product would have received more stars, but when I received my order the wax had spilled all in the box and all over the rest of the products I had ordered! It was not sealed properly.  It made for a huge mess! I won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I have been ordering these for years now, and I love the Gigi creme wax product.&lt;br /&gt;Its not as sticky as honey wax and because of the color, its easy to find on your skin :)&lt;br /&gt;Also you can easily clean it off you skin by using baby oil followed by a hot shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the home-waxing thing but this product was so horrible, I had to post my comments.  I wanted something less hard-wax-like and love the &amp;#34;tea&amp;#34; element in any product but his was horrible messy - smelled funny - and irritated my skin.  I had been using the harder Brazilian wax without strips and was looking for a smoother wax.  Well, this was smooth, alright!  It felt like a particularly sticky, soft gum that gets into and onto everything and you had to act quickly to make it all work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst, it didn&#x27;t get all of my hair.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of unwanted hair, but this wax didn&#x27;t get all of my mustache or chin hair.  What it did do was leave my skin tacky and irritated and red - not a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> Of all the different types of Gigi waxes, I think this one is my favorite so far (and I believe I&#x27;ve tried them all). It comes off the skin easily and when you&#x27;re reafy to clean up, just use some baby oil and it comes off your skin nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing home waxing for over a year, and have used many GiGi products. The Tea Tree Creme wax did not meet my expectations at all. The consistency is very different than their other creme wax, it&#x27;s hard to describe but it wouldn&#x27;t hold the hair, and was even more difficult to clean up. I ended up throwing it out after two tries. I will continue to use this brand of supplies, but can not recommend the tea tree wax.</li>
            <li> Nice consistency; not messy; precise placement with no dripping all over. You can spread it really thin, so a can lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was the yellow wax I&#x27;m used to using. Turns out it&#x27;s green. I gave it a try though, and it&#x27;s horrible. Why? The wax is too gooey that the strips doesn&#x27;t stick well enough, so when you pull.. you end up with no pulled hairs. I did a thin layer of wax on my face, and it still did not pull any hairs off. It doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling soft. On the contrary, the wax is almost impossible to remove. A couple of tries did remove the bigger hairs (side burns) but doesn&#x27;t work waxing off the hairs on the upper lip; I kept trying so many times out of anger that I ended up burning my skin! I bought this wax on accident, a mistake on my part. I wasted money on this I wish I had back.</li>
            <li> I returned this item because it wasn&#x27;t what I wanted</li>
            <li> This is great wax! It even works great for places hard wax is usually used. The smell is pleasant and its easy to remove with oil. Love it!</li>
            <li> I loved this wax. Normally I dread waxing my pits because the area is so sensitive. I used this wax everywhere,  legs, Brazilian bikini,  upper lip and armpits. I went crazy because this stuff was so good.  I apply some baby powder to the area first, trim hairs if long and apply a thin layer (don&#x27;t plaster it on) all hair comes out with one pull. I use muslin strips. Its great on both my course and fine hairs. I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I know that tea tree oil is a very good product, so I figured that this would be a good wax to use on your face, thank you amazon!</li>
            <li> I work with creme waxes all the time and it was hard for me to make a thin application and i&#x27;m not the kind to complain about wax being sticky cause i know all wax is sticky but this one is extra sticky where its noticeable. It shipped right when it said it would though so I was happy about that</li>
            <li> I love this wax. It&#x27;s extra special because of the Tea Tree Oil! If you use hot wax then you&#x27;ll be very happy with this wax and the Tea Tree Oil will just make it better!!</li>
            <li> This wax is the best. I have thick fast growing hair so only hot wax will work and even then, they never get all the hairs. This one does! I was amazed to see how well this wax works. It is messy and make sure to have a bottle of baby oil handy for clean up. But it is worth it. I have tried all kinds of wax and other hair removal products. This is the best out of all of them.</li>
            <li> Product does not dry hard and is extremely messy.</li>
            <li> I would appreciate it if the design of the container was better because when yout try to take off the lid it gets wax everywhere</li>
            <li> I do a lot of at home waxing with Gigi products warmers ect. This wax was awful. I prefer hard wax, but I thought I would give this a try. It literally ripped off my skin, and left me with bruises. I had never seen that before with the hard wax. I am never going back to any honey or creme wax again.</li>
            <li> This product is too sticky! It makes a mess everywhere &amp; clean up is such a hassle. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I just have one thing to say: do not buy this wax!!!! I love Gigi products but tea tree sucks!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this product. Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li> Do no buy this product. It is horrible. I still cant believe how bad it was. It become so sticky and messy that it becomes out of your control.</li>
            <li> I have thick dark hair, lucky for my head, not so lucky everywhere else!  I used the original gigi wax before this and I like this a lot better.  The only thing is that you have to make sure its at the right temperature.  It is a creamy green color and looks the same heated and unheated color-wise. Usually I heat my wax then turn it off as I don&#x27;t want it too hot.  This I have to turn back on half way through or the wax will not come off with the strip leaving quite a mess.  Not a really big issue, just have to be aware of it.  I find it less irritating and have less of a chance of burning myself. I would buy this again and recommend it to others! Ps always wax with numbing spray... if you have not tried it you have to!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to waxing, but this does what i want it to ususally. A little goes a long way though, I do like the blue one better though.</li>
            <li> It was sooo easy to use. I loved it right away!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this after owning the pink crème wax in which they have the same texture. The only difference and the main fact why this one caught my attention would be because of the &amp;#34;Tea Tree&amp;#34; in the mix. That stuff has been known to heal, moisture and nourish. I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I did get to warm it up for testing. Melted in 15 mins after the heating tray was placed on high. Melts nicely without too much annoying bubbles. Good! Happy!</li>
            <li> Great wax, you only need to use a layer to wax, don&#x27;t use more than a layer or it wont work. This is good for legs and armpits.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied. It was way too messy, and the wax left behind did not come off easily. Do not recommend.</li>
