    <ol>
            <li>This worked great for my cosplay!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great product!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s an excellent price in comparison to brand name lipsticks like MAC, MUFE, or Kryolan and its quality still matches up.</li>
            <li>:D</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve owned!</li>
            <li>This is perfect for my DHMIS cosplay of Notepad but any Homestuck troll could use this as well!!</li>

            <li>Love Love Love!!!</li>
            <li>I did, however, get a kick of being able to kiss the mirror and not worry about it taking great feats and miracles to get it off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I was very pleased with the quality</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with my lipstick.</li>
            <li>I just received this item yesterday, and I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick brand!</li>
            <li>I love this color!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll purchase more colors soon!</li>
            <li>I was able to exchange it though and the seller is SUPER awesome.</li>
            <li>And the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>and It&#x27;s amazing &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>The packaging is just amazing, so there is no way it could be damaged.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>It has a nice feeling as balm, but it wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very well and smells good!!</li>
            <li>She loved it :-)</li>
            <li>It has a nice color</li>
            <li>Came fast, and looks great!</li>
            <li>Its kind of like a vanilla scent+ chocolate scent.</li>
            <li>Nice, black-black color</li>
            <li>still have it to this day and it smells kind of vanilla ish and tastes like birthday cake.</li>
            <li>It really is like a colored lip balm because it&#x27;s awesome on your lips.</li>
            <li>I liked this lipstick.</li>
            <li>Also, it smells quite nice and doesn&#x27;t taste too lipstick-y.</li>
            <li>but it is a great lipstick and is well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this seller,  my lipstick came before the estimate date and it was packaged safely.  </li>
            <li>It smells very nice and it true to the name, it looks like velvet when applied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smudges very easily and rubs off on everything.</li>
            <li>Smears very easily.</li>
            <li>It rubs off very easily.</li>
            <li>It also comes off very easily, which is a pro</li>
            <li>This will be great for practicing shapes and contours while still being able to clean it off easily.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I got some of the &amp;#34;Black Velvet&amp;#34; color for cosplay, but I ended up wearing it for most of the day out of cosplay because I really liked it.</li>
            <li>it has good pigment and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I got this item for a cosplay and was surprised by how perfect it was.</li>
            <li>It got here so quickly it was amazing!</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love It !</li>
            <li>It applies very nicely and smoothly, and the pointed tip makes perfecting the look incredibly easy.</li>
            <li>Great for costumes or dress up but might not be the best for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I did /not/ anticipate something significantly better than many lipsticks I own.</li>
            <li>The lipstick looks great when you first put it on</li>
            <li>When it first arrived, I was happy to put it on</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay on your lips, its very cheap.</li>
            <li>as long she&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and smells very good.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE LIPSTICKS...</li>
            <li>A matte lipstick or gloss would be a better long-lasting product.</li>
            <li>It took so many applications to get an even color.</li>
            <li>It went on smooth and the color is a nice matte finish.</li>
            <li>does not apply smoothing, and does not stay on for more than 5 min.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more for sure.</li>
            <li>I love the price, and for something</li>
            <li>I look forward to purchasing more lip products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this lipstick, and I may buy more colors too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s worth every penny, it really is a good lipstick</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely, just a bit too shiny for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more of a matte kinda girl.</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick.</li>
            <li>She plans on buying more of these</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick.</li>
            <li>But still it was fast shipping, product goes on great.</li>
            <li>Also gives it a better softer look.</li>
            <li>satisfied.</li>
            <li>i was really pleased with this lipstick--</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s just me :)</li>
            <li>I anticipated, based on the reviews, something better than the crappy stuff you get at costume shops...</li>
            <li>it was 3.75 which makes it even better</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m glad I made the purchased, was not unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick.</li>
            <li>I recommend it :)</li>
            <li>This lipstick goes on so smoothly!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Nice And Smooth.</li>
            <li>I Love It.</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick.</li>
            <li>Love the color... in the picture.</li>
            <li>the bottom came off, but it was in safe packaging, and applies well with patience.</li>
            <li>might want to wear a lip liner to be sure, though.</li>
            <li>I recommended frequently checking your lipstick to make sure it isn&#x27;t smeared on your face!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still a good buy, though!</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, glides on smoothly, and it&#x27;s not tinted chapstick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was pretty cheap too which was very nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable to wear and easy to remove.</li>
            <li>A good idea is to outline your lips with blackeyeliner first to keep the lipstick from running.</li>
            <li>This lipstick is pretty good, overall.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very nice, smooth, and bright red.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this in the mail!</li>
            <li>It feels nice, and it goes on alright, but it comes off extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>i would definitely buy this product again and recommend it to anyone else looking for some good lipstick for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>But its fine since its so cheap!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the other shades are great too!</li>
            <li>so I enjoy wearing it. :)</li>
            <li>It just sits on top of your lips and moves around freely.</li>
            <li>Got here a couple days early and works great</li>
            <li>I got the lipstick pretty fast in about 3 days which is nice, plus free shipping and a great cost.</li>
            <li>but then again, I wore chapstick underneath it so it would be sure to go on smoothly).  </li>
            <li>also looks very pretty :3 :3</li>
            <li>Needs reapplication often, wipes off easily.</li>
            <li>Like, really easily.</li>
            <li>I wiped it off, and it came off easily.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t wear off too easily, but when you go to remove it, it comes off quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>However, it comes off easily and smears off whenever it&#x27;s touched, so I have to reapply it every</li>
            <li>Comes off easily and will smear off if touched.</li>
            <li>It is soft, supple, smells lovely, produces a satin sheen finish (gorgeous) and doesn&#x27;t come off terribly easily based on my makeup test today.</li>
            <li>It goes on beautifully and gives you a nice depth of black.</li>
            <li>The color and consistency are great, not expected for the price.  </li>
            <li>Best black lipstick I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time user, so I&#x27;ll have to see what else this thing has in store for me, but I&#x27;m sure there will be more pros than cons.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered the black lipstick and it turned out perfect.</li>
            <li>I got the black I wanted and its perfect.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely, is not oily, and stays SUPER well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to buy more!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful rich color and definitely met my expectations!</li>
            <li>It stays on well and is very pretty!</li>
            <li>The lipstick is nice, and goes on very easily, but it seems to be able to come off just as easily as well, which would lead to more applications throughout the day than I&#x27;d probably like to mess with.</li>
            <li>THE COLOURS GO ON LIGHT...</li>
            <li>Think of it as a smooth, colored chapstick.</li>
            <li>I would say getting a pricier one would be worth the money and the better looks...</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something cheap and stumbled upon this...</li>
            <li>was hoping that for almost 4 dollars I would get something that glided on smoothly and evenly...</li>
            <li>this cheap</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly &amp; the aloe it has helped keep my lips moisturized.</li>
            <li>The lipstick itself smells like vanilla and applys smoothly.</li>
            <li>I also got a steel color and it was fantastic.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and does not irritate in any way.</li>
            <li>This is the best black lipstick that I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li>Very good lipstick, is very black and full of pigment :3</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got it that I had to put it on.</li>
            <li>The ceolor is rich as reqired.  </li>
            <li>I was sketchy at first buying this, but I&#x27;m sooooo glad I did.</li>
            <li>Okay to be exact</li>
            <li>Some people think that&#x27;s very good, but since I have considerably large lips, it was different for me.</li>
            <li>It takes a couple of layers to get the right shade of black, but it is perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color, and it&#x27;s smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful black and it glides on really smoothly.</li>
            <li>Nice and black and stayed on nicely AND came off super quick!</li>
            <li>Im satisfied with the procduct (slaso fast delivery)</li>
            <li>Good enough quality for the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really soft and feels nice on my lips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this brand, I bought this specific color for Halloween and regret nothing about it.</li>
            <li>Beautiful black color.&lt;br /&gt;-Does</li>
            <li>I was thrilled with how nice and dark the color was!</li>
            <li>quickly--</li>
            <li>The item even arrived quickly, in fact I&#x27;m ordering another for a friend.</li>
            <li>It fades rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Went on smooth and bold first time applying it.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and has a nice dark color.</li>
            <li>its moist and soft on the lips and fills it with a full black color and just looks wonderful on.</li>
            <li>Below is a list of all the great things the black lipstick has.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m always on the lookout for great black lipstick -- this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>Maybe just for fun and quick pictures or something.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very moist and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Just do your research first!</li>
            <li>, it works pretty well!</li>
            <li>and when I did, it looked fantastic and the colour is a good black.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the PERFECT black lipstick and I highly recommend getting it if you&#x27;re in the market for some!</li>
            <li>Very nice, After a coat or too, its perfectly black.</li>
            <li>overall an amazing lip stick.</li>
            <li>THE STARLET SERIES ARE SOOO FUN...</li>
            <li>I CAN SAY THESE LA COLORS LIPSTICKS AND SHADOWS ARE WORTH IT...</li>
            <li>The lipstick was worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually so surprised everyone gave it better stars.</li>
            <li>but hey completely worth it</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a nice lipstick that she and I would recommend for the price.</li>
            <li>Wanted this lipstick to wear for fun</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, like actual lipstick, rather than just a colored oil (again with those previos purchases).</li>
            <li>, well worth it.</li>
            <li>But It Was Worth</li>
            <li>I put it on for fun, ate dinner, and went to bed without ever looking in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>You cant eat or drink with it on, it&#x27;ll come right off.</li>
            <li>it Comes Right Off.</li>
            <li>I wear it when I want to stand out more and go for a more dark punk-ish look.</li>
            <li>The only issue was that it came off pretty easily, but that&#x27;s a fairly easy fix.</li>
            <li>The black lipstick&#x27;s color opacity was perfect for the multiple cosplays I needed it for during the season.</li>
            <li>This is a basic black lipstick, but it is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Once on, it was extremely greasy and unpleasant-feeling, didn&#x27;t look very nice, smudged easily and often, and the next day I had zits at the corners of my mouth</li>
            <li>PURE BLACKNESS WITH ONE COAT!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m still looking for a good black lipstick.</li>
            <li>This is a really good black lipstick for the price.</li>
            <li>Maybe the one I received was old or something, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay much for it.</li>
            <li>its not too shiny and its a really good black lipstick!&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it arrived super fast.</li>
            <li>Like another review stated, it has a kind of vanilla flavor, which is a great difference from previous black lipsticks I&#x27;ve purchased which just taste oily.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my lips pitch black, but pretty good</li>
            <li>I have never tried black before and is harder to put on correctly but the effect is great, i have even tried it on some friends and they love it also</li>
            <li>But, also like chapstick, the places where my lips were relatively dry were stained an unattractive shade of black/grey, but fortunately it came off easily with a bit of water.</li>
            <li>Because black lipstick smears easily I suggest dabbing your favorite eye shadow on your lips.</li>
            <li>The colour is pretty.</li>
            <li>Pretty matte finish.</li>
            <li>Shipping is fast!</li>
            <li>really recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The package arrived exactly on time and in tact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was very dissapointed!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>She loves them and said this is exactly what she had been looking for.</li>
            <li>that it doesn&#x27;t sink in that well at first.</li>
            <li>though.&lt;br /&gt;I will be keeping it, on the other hand, because of how easily it comes off and how easy it is to shape.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off with some of the cheap stuff you find in stores around Halloween if you&#x27;re looking for something short term -- you&#x27;ll get better depth to the black -- or</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not greasy, there are no purple undertones (a problem with most cheap black lipstick)</li>
            <li>i love the color, its exactly what i wanted, the only thing i can really say is the taste</li>
            <li>L.A Colors are made very well and is very much affordable.</li>
            <li>I got this for my sister in black, and she was rather pleased with it!</li>
            <li>Because that&#x27;s pretty much it.</li>
            <li>Pretty much like halloween lipstick.</li>
            <li>This product is not only made with natural ingredients, it also applies smoothly and feels light on the lips.</li>
            <li>A big selling point for me is the scent: a really sweet vanilla!</li>
            <li>I got black velvet and it was amazing.</li>
            <li>Instead, it continued to smear until I could see the pinks of my lips easily, even after re-applying it multiple times.</li>
            <li>The black goes on super smooth and rarely needs to be reapplied, even if I eat/drink a lot.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly, was pretty darn waxy/greasy feeling on my lips, and didn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li>AND on top of all that ridiculousness, after i take it off, my lips were noticeably and uncomfortably dry.</li>
            <li>The lipstick goes on so smooth &amp; i only had to apply two coats for it to be exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>You need several coats, and it comes off easily onto cups and canned beverages.</li>
            <li>stays on nicely, but wipes off normally like other lipstick.</li>
            <li>Very soft on the lips, and removes fairly well for a black!</li>
            <li>The color is nice, I wish it was a little bit darker though</li>
            <li>SO VERY WORKABLE...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never thin or sticky.  </li>
            <li>only thing you would have to worry about is reapplying it every so often and maybe giving it a couple of layers since it applies on light.</li>
            <li>however, it wasn&#x27;t long-lasting, and when put into my shoulder bag, the cap wasn&#x27;t secure enough</li>
            <li>Really like the smell</li>
            <li>I really do recommend this lipstick ^.^</li>
            <li>it makes your lips very kissible.</li>
            <li>Be really cautious with L.A. Colors lipstick if you have any chemical allergies or sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried it out, &amp; I really like it</li>
            <li>stays on very well during the day unless you eat something</li>
            <li>I had a very adverse reaction using this product.  </li>
            <li>The color goes on really well, and it softens your lips like no tomorrow.</li>
            <li>Creamy and very well pigmented.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>On lips, the product is very almost watery and it doesn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li>It was a bit thin,and not as opaque as she would have liked, so she had to do a few coats, but it got the job done.</li>
            <li>It goes on super smooth, though a little light , but 2-3 thin coats makes it a perfect black.</li>
            <li>: Pure black color, and very smooth.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is its kind of greasy and wipes off easy, needs to be applied a lot.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a while for an economical black lipstick, since most I have seen cost nearly $20.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth and opaque, although it tends to rub off a little more than expected.  </li>
            <li>my opinion, this would be fine for a cosplay or dress up, but if you want a long lasting, every day lipstick, I suggest splurging a little more for a better brand since the frequent re-application of this lipstick gets annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really good solid black</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and stays on all day long.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s thin), and I DID have to wear it for a while before it seemed \\&quot;set\\&quot; and become mostly smudgeless, but I am overall thrilled.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dark and silky smooth!</li>
            <li>It looks good on and actually is pretty black, but is not very long-lasting.</li>
            <li>Got 136 Black Velvet lipstick for my friend who was having a hard time finding a good and affordable ($3.75 is pretty good and there was no s/h) black lipstick.  </li>
            <li>Black Velvet has and will always be my favorite lipstick &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I then proceeded to re-apply and eat a piece of pizza, mainly because I was hungry, but also because I wanted to see what would happen.</li>
            <li>but you have to use a decent amount and it tends to wear off.</li>
            <li>then its a decent product to get.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and gives a nice dark color after a few layers.</li>
            <li>The color is great, it&#x27;s shiny dark black.</li>
            <li>first time I put it on I had to put on quite a few layers before it would go on smoothly black, but now it goes on fine without having to put on more than a couple of layers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Save your dollars and don&#x27;t get your hopes up high about this product.</li>
            <li>leaves behind a slight gray tint to my lips after i wipe it off which is kinda awesome, haha.</li>
            <li>and it gets extremely blotchy, comes off easily etc etc.</li>
            <li>My favorite black lipstick by far!</li>
            <li>(more grey), it didn&#x27;t cover properly at all.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that its long lasting lipstick and when eating it doesn&#x27;t come off easyly.</li>
            <li>Ordered August 14th, its now October 28, wore the product almost everyday and still haven&#x27;t even went through half the product which is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a lovely vanilla smell, and the only problem I did have is that after a while it would dry up, so I&#x27;d have to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to everyone that&#x27;s looking a dark lip colour that comes off easy at night.</li>
            <li>New to the colored lipstick idea</li>
            <li>(and I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin at all)...</li>
            <li>highly recommend buying from this seller, I ordered this three days ago, got it today, two days early.</li>
            <li>Definitely needs to be lined, but thicker and more opaque than I expected for the price!</li>
            <li>The product actually came in a few days early, and was quite nice.</li>
            <li>If people could marry lipsticks I would totally get married to this lipstick.</li>
            <li>accidentally washed my first one in the washing machine, and I&#x27;m definitely planning on buying a replacement.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a product which would cover the lips with a bit of shine, but deep, dark, black color was the most important.</li>
            <li>Only issue I had with it would be true of any black lipstick, and that is the fact it makes your teeth look yellow when you smile!</li>
            <li>The color can be built up from a calm black, to an intense shade.</li>
            <li>It looks a little chalky, but goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>So pretty much if you&#x27;re cool with it coming off and only lasting a few minutes</li>
            <li>found a way around this by adding clear lip gloss over it, wiping the lip gloss applier off, and rubbing my lips together.&lt;br</li>
            <li>: There isn&#x27;t much to the actual lipstick.</li>
            <li>Not matte &amp;#34;velvet&amp;#34; it is a cheap waste of money.</li>
            <li>this lipstick far exceeded my expectations for the price.</li>
            <li>but it is very glossy, and regular touch ups are needed.</li>
            <li>It Just Feels Natural.</li>
            <li>Love the color, very shiny dark black color.</li>
            <li>I got this in black and it was really true to color.</li>
            <li>If you want TRUE black lips, you&#x27;ll need to use some face paint.</li>
            <li>The colour doesn&#x27;t show up well, and it doesn&#x27;t last very long at all -- although that was a blessing in disguise for me, as I found out quickly after application that I have a sensitivity to something in the product.</li>
            <li>My cousin recently bought a 3 pack form this seller and as usual, I was pleased.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I found it worked decently for was blending with a lighter lipstick to create a darker shade.</li>
            <li>I had needed black lipstick for every day use and in the area I live in people seem to think it&#x27;s only used for Halloween which really isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light black with light application, &amp; actually get&#x27;s darker black with multiple applications.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stay on long and you&#x27;ll have to keep retouching very often.</li>
            <li>Though the color was really great, I was a little disappointed with how easy it was to take it off.</li>
            <li>So when I found the LA Colors Black Velvet for only $5, I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear it often because black doesn&#x27;t go over well in all circumstances, but it feels great and looks dramatic.</li>
            <li>The middle of your lips stay their natural color while the outside has a cheap black tint to it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the color black for any lipstick on her or anyone mainly,</li>
            <li>Just make sure you put it on last and use a setting spray, it is so just creamy and thick</li>
            <li>: Moisturize your lips with a balm first, apply a coat of red lipstick second, apply this lip color last.</li>
            <li>Arrived several days early!</li>
            <li>I might just have to ware it with a black or dark gloss for it to look better</li>
            <li>I just walked into my local Dollar General and bought this same exact brand lipstick in Cherry Red for $1, where you guys are spending $5 online and waiting patiently for this to be shipped to you -</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it for how little it costs.</li>
            <li>This lipstick barely shows on your lips.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say the latter was entirely unexpected, however.</li>
            <li>Very moist and does the job as expected</li>
            <li>My order shipped within an hour of placing my order, and it came in the mail about five days later (a day before the first expected delivery date).</li>
            <li>You can get a nice black lip look but you have to lay it on thick</li>
            <li>I only give it 3 stars because it came late, other than that it&#x27;s amazing &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Sure, the container is average sized, but the actual black lipstick is only about an inch tall.</li>
            <li>She likes that it smells like vanilla, goes on smoothly, and isn&#x27;t waxy like some other black lipsticks.</li>
            <li>not dry out</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it comes off very easily.</li>
            <li>Great... when it stayed on my lips and not my teeth. :{</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty moisturizing and my lips don&#x27;t feel dried up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a dark blue or a dark purple it is a true black.</li>
            <li>I bought the black lipstick and it works really</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for anyone who wants black lips or even for cosplay.</li>
            <li>They should call it grey, not black.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little bit of effort to get a true dark black color and it comes off quite easily, so if you don&#x27;t like reapplying lipstick every few hours of the day, preferably save it for non-eating (unless you&#x27;re one of those skillful eaters) and non-kissing days.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re cheap like moi and need black lipstick dis is da shit imo.</li>
            <li>When I do a 3 star rating, I mean i was satisfied but don&#x27;t use black often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>only complaint is that when I tried to take it off it smeared all over my face, but after a little more washing and wiping that came off as well.</li>

            <li> Love Love Love!!!</li>
            <li> I did, however, get a kick of being able to kiss the mirror and not worry about it taking great feats and miracles to get it off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I was very pleased with the quality</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with my lipstick.</li>
            <li> I just received this item yesterday, and I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick brand!</li>
            <li> I love this color!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll purchase more colors soon!</li>
            <li> I was able to exchange it though and the seller is SUPER awesome.</li>
            <li> And the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> and It&#x27;s amazing &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> The packaging is just amazing, so there is no way it could be damaged.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> It has a nice feeling as balm, but it wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works very well and smells good!!</li>
            <li> She loved it :-)</li>
            <li> It has a nice color</li>
            <li> Came fast, and looks great!</li>
            <li> Its kind of like a vanilla scent+ chocolate scent.</li>
            <li> Nice, black-black color</li>
            <li> still have it to this day and it smells kind of vanilla ish and tastes like birthday cake.</li>
            <li> It really is like a colored lip balm because it&#x27;s awesome on your lips.</li>
            <li> I liked this lipstick.</li>
            <li> Also, it smells quite nice and doesn&#x27;t taste too lipstick-y.</li>
            <li> but it is a great lipstick and is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this seller,  my lipstick came before the estimate date and it was packaged safely.  </li>
            <li> It smells very nice and it true to the name, it looks like velvet when applied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smudges very easily and rubs off on everything.</li>
            <li> Smears very easily.</li>
            <li> It rubs off very easily.</li>
            <li> It also comes off very easily, which is a pro</li>
            <li> This will be great for practicing shapes and contours while still being able to clean it off easily.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I got some of the &amp;#34;Black Velvet&amp;#34; color for cosplay, but I ended up wearing it for most of the day out of cosplay because I really liked it.</li>
            <li> it has good pigment and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I got this item for a cosplay and was surprised by how perfect it was.</li>
            <li> It got here so quickly it was amazing!</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love It !</li>
            <li> It applies very nicely and smoothly, and the pointed tip makes perfecting the look incredibly easy.</li>
            <li> Great for costumes or dress up but might not be the best for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I did /not/ anticipate something significantly better than many lipsticks I own.</li>
            <li> The lipstick looks great when you first put it on</li>
            <li> When it first arrived, I was happy to put it on</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on your lips, its very cheap.</li>
            <li> as long she&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and smells very good.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE LIPSTICKS...</li>
            <li> A matte lipstick or gloss would be a better long-lasting product.</li>
            <li> It took so many applications to get an even color.</li>
            <li> It went on smooth and the color is a nice matte finish.</li>
            <li> does not apply smoothing, and does not stay on for more than 5 min.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more for sure.</li>
            <li> I love the price, and for something</li>
            <li> I look forward to purchasing more lip products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this lipstick, and I may buy more colors too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s worth every penny, it really is a good lipstick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lovely, just a bit too shiny for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a matte kinda girl.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick.</li>
            <li> She plans on buying more of these</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick.</li>
            <li> But still it was fast shipping, product goes on great.</li>
            <li> Also gives it a better softer look.</li>
            <li> satisfied.</li>
            <li> i was really pleased with this lipstick--</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s just me :)</li>
            <li> I anticipated, based on the reviews, something better than the crappy stuff you get at costume shops...</li>
            <li> it was 3.75 which makes it even better</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m glad I made the purchased, was not unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick.</li>
            <li> I recommend it :)</li>
            <li> This lipstick goes on so smoothly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Nice And Smooth.</li>
            <li> I Love It.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick.</li>
            <li> Love the color... in the picture.</li>
            <li> the bottom came off, but it was in safe packaging, and applies well with patience.</li>
            <li> might want to wear a lip liner to be sure, though.</li>
            <li> I recommended frequently checking your lipstick to make sure it isn&#x27;t smeared on your face!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still a good buy, though!</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, glides on smoothly, and it&#x27;s not tinted chapstick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was pretty cheap too which was very nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable to wear and easy to remove.</li>
            <li> A good idea is to outline your lips with blackeyeliner first to keep the lipstick from running.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is pretty good, overall.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very nice, smooth, and bright red.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this in the mail!</li>
            <li> It feels nice, and it goes on alright, but it comes off extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> i would definitely buy this product again and recommend it to anyone else looking for some good lipstick for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> But its fine since its so cheap!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the other shades are great too!</li>
            <li> so I enjoy wearing it. :)</li>
            <li> It just sits on top of your lips and moves around freely.</li>
            <li> Got here a couple days early and works great</li>
            <li> I got the lipstick pretty fast in about 3 days which is nice, plus free shipping and a great cost.</li>
            <li> but then again, I wore chapstick underneath it so it would be sure to go on smoothly).  </li>
            <li> also looks very pretty :3 :3</li>
            <li> Needs reapplication often, wipes off easily.</li>
            <li> Like, really easily.</li>
            <li> I wiped it off, and it came off easily.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t wear off too easily, but when you go to remove it, it comes off quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> However, it comes off easily and smears off whenever it&#x27;s touched, so I have to reapply it every</li>
            <li> Comes off easily and will smear off if touched.</li>
            <li> It is soft, supple, smells lovely, produces a satin sheen finish (gorgeous) and doesn&#x27;t come off terribly easily based on my makeup test today.</li>
            <li> It goes on beautifully and gives you a nice depth of black.</li>
            <li> The color and consistency are great, not expected for the price.  </li>
            <li> Best black lipstick I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time user, so I&#x27;ll have to see what else this thing has in store for me, but I&#x27;m sure there will be more pros than cons.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered the black lipstick and it turned out perfect.</li>
            <li> I got the black I wanted and its perfect.</li>
            <li> It smells lovely, is not oily, and stays SUPER well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to buy more!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful rich color and definitely met my expectations!</li>
            <li> It stays on well and is very pretty!</li>
            <li> The lipstick is nice, and goes on very easily, but it seems to be able to come off just as easily as well, which would lead to more applications throughout the day than I&#x27;d probably like to mess with.</li>
            <li> THE COLOURS GO ON LIGHT...</li>
            <li> Think of it as a smooth, colored chapstick.</li>
            <li> I would say getting a pricier one would be worth the money and the better looks...</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I wanted something cheap and stumbled upon this...</li>
            <li> was hoping that for almost 4 dollars I would get something that glided on smoothly and evenly...</li>
            <li> this cheap</li>
            <li> It went on smoothly &amp; the aloe it has helped keep my lips moisturized.</li>
            <li> The lipstick itself smells like vanilla and applys smoothly.</li>
            <li> I also got a steel color and it was fantastic.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and does not irritate in any way.</li>
            <li> This is the best black lipstick that I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> Very good lipstick, is very black and full of pigment :3</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got it that I had to put it on.</li>
            <li> The ceolor is rich as reqired.  </li>
            <li> I was sketchy at first buying this, but I&#x27;m sooooo glad I did.</li>
            <li> Okay to be exact</li>
            <li> Some people think that&#x27;s very good, but since I have considerably large lips, it was different for me.</li>
            <li> It takes a couple of layers to get the right shade of black, but it is perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty color, and it&#x27;s smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful black and it glides on really smoothly.</li>
            <li> Nice and black and stayed on nicely AND came off super quick!</li>
            <li> Im satisfied with the procduct (slaso fast delivery)</li>
            <li> Good enough quality for the price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really soft and feels nice on my lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this brand, I bought this specific color for Halloween and regret nothing about it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful black color.&lt;br /&gt;-Does</li>
            <li> I was thrilled with how nice and dark the color was!</li>
            <li> quickly--</li>
            <li> The item even arrived quickly, in fact I&#x27;m ordering another for a friend.</li>
            <li> It fades rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Went on smooth and bold first time applying it.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and has a nice dark color.</li>
            <li> its moist and soft on the lips and fills it with a full black color and just looks wonderful on.</li>
            <li> Below is a list of all the great things the black lipstick has.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m always on the lookout for great black lipstick -- this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Maybe just for fun and quick pictures or something.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very moist and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Just do your research first!</li>
            <li> , it works pretty well!</li>
            <li> and when I did, it looked fantastic and the colour is a good black.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the PERFECT black lipstick and I highly recommend getting it if you&#x27;re in the market for some!</li>
            <li> Very nice, After a coat or too, its perfectly black.</li>
            <li> overall an amazing lip stick.</li>
            <li> THE STARLET SERIES ARE SOOO FUN...</li>
            <li> I CAN SAY THESE LA COLORS LIPSTICKS AND SHADOWS ARE WORTH IT...</li>
            <li> The lipstick was worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually so surprised everyone gave it better stars.</li>
            <li> but hey completely worth it</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a nice lipstick that she and I would recommend for the price.</li>
            <li> Wanted this lipstick to wear for fun</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely, like actual lipstick, rather than just a colored oil (again with those previos purchases).</li>
            <li> , well worth it.</li>
            <li> But It Was Worth</li>
            <li> I put it on for fun, ate dinner, and went to bed without ever looking in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> You cant eat or drink with it on, it&#x27;ll come right off.</li>
            <li> it Comes Right Off.</li>
            <li> I wear it when I want to stand out more and go for a more dark punk-ish look.</li>
            <li> The only issue was that it came off pretty easily, but that&#x27;s a fairly easy fix.</li>
            <li> The black lipstick&#x27;s color opacity was perfect for the multiple cosplays I needed it for during the season.</li>
            <li> This is a basic black lipstick, but it is perfect.  </li>
            <li> Once on, it was extremely greasy and unpleasant-feeling, didn&#x27;t look very nice, smudged easily and often, and the next day I had zits at the corners of my mouth</li>
            <li> PURE BLACKNESS WITH ONE COAT!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m still looking for a good black lipstick.</li>
            <li> This is a really good black lipstick for the price.</li>
            <li> Maybe the one I received was old or something, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay much for it.</li>
            <li> its not too shiny and its a really good black lipstick!&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it arrived super fast.</li>
            <li> Like another review stated, it has a kind of vanilla flavor, which is a great difference from previous black lipsticks I&#x27;ve purchased which just taste oily.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my lips pitch black, but pretty good</li>
            <li> I have never tried black before and is harder to put on correctly but the effect is great, i have even tried it on some friends and they love it also</li>
            <li> But, also like chapstick, the places where my lips were relatively dry were stained an unattractive shade of black/grey, but fortunately it came off easily with a bit of water.</li>
            <li> Because black lipstick smears easily I suggest dabbing your favorite eye shadow on your lips.</li>
            <li> The colour is pretty.</li>
            <li> Pretty matte finish.</li>
            <li> Shipping is fast!</li>
            <li> really recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The package arrived exactly on time and in tact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was very dissapointed!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> She loves them and said this is exactly what she had been looking for.</li>
            <li> that it doesn&#x27;t sink in that well at first.</li>
            <li> though.&lt;br /&gt;I will be keeping it, on the other hand, because of how easily it comes off and how easy it is to shape.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off with some of the cheap stuff you find in stores around Halloween if you&#x27;re looking for something short term -- you&#x27;ll get better depth to the black -- or</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not greasy, there are no purple undertones (a problem with most cheap black lipstick)</li>
            <li> i love the color, its exactly what i wanted, the only thing i can really say is the taste</li>
            <li> L.A Colors are made very well and is very much affordable.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister in black, and she was rather pleased with it!</li>
            <li> Because that&#x27;s pretty much it.</li>
            <li> Pretty much like halloween lipstick.</li>
            <li> This product is not only made with natural ingredients, it also applies smoothly and feels light on the lips.</li>
            <li> A big selling point for me is the scent: a really sweet vanilla!</li>
            <li> I got black velvet and it was amazing.</li>
            <li> Instead, it continued to smear until I could see the pinks of my lips easily, even after re-applying it multiple times.</li>
            <li> The black goes on super smooth and rarely needs to be reapplied, even if I eat/drink a lot.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly, was pretty darn waxy/greasy feeling on my lips, and didn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li> AND on top of all that ridiculousness, after i take it off, my lips were noticeably and uncomfortably dry.</li>
            <li> The lipstick goes on so smooth &amp; i only had to apply two coats for it to be exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> You need several coats, and it comes off easily onto cups and canned beverages.</li>
            <li> stays on nicely, but wipes off normally like other lipstick.</li>
            <li> Very soft on the lips, and removes fairly well for a black!</li>
            <li> The color is nice, I wish it was a little bit darker though</li>
            <li> SO VERY WORKABLE...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never thin or sticky.  </li>
            <li> only thing you would have to worry about is reapplying it every so often and maybe giving it a couple of layers since it applies on light.</li>
            <li> however, it wasn&#x27;t long-lasting, and when put into my shoulder bag, the cap wasn&#x27;t secure enough</li>
            <li> Really like the smell</li>
            <li> I really do recommend this lipstick ^.^</li>
            <li> it makes your lips very kissible.</li>
            <li> Be really cautious with L.A. Colors lipstick if you have any chemical allergies or sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it out, &amp; I really like it</li>
            <li> stays on very well during the day unless you eat something</li>
            <li> I had a very adverse reaction using this product.  </li>
            <li> The color goes on really well, and it softens your lips like no tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Creamy and very well pigmented.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> On lips, the product is very almost watery and it doesn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> It was a bit thin,and not as opaque as she would have liked, so she had to do a few coats, but it got the job done.</li>
            <li> It goes on super smooth, though a little light , but 2-3 thin coats makes it a perfect black.</li>
            <li> : Pure black color, and very smooth.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is its kind of greasy and wipes off easy, needs to be applied a lot.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a while for an economical black lipstick, since most I have seen cost nearly $20.</li>
            <li> It is very smooth and opaque, although it tends to rub off a little more than expected.  </li>
            <li> my opinion, this would be fine for a cosplay or dress up, but if you want a long lasting, every day lipstick, I suggest splurging a little more for a better brand since the frequent re-application of this lipstick gets annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really good solid black</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and stays on all day long.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s thin), and I DID have to wear it for a while before it seemed \\&quot;set\\&quot; and become mostly smudgeless, but I am overall thrilled.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dark and silky smooth!</li>
            <li> It looks good on and actually is pretty black, but is not very long-lasting.</li>
            <li> Got 136 Black Velvet lipstick for my friend who was having a hard time finding a good and affordable ($3.75 is pretty good and there was no s/h) black lipstick.  </li>
            <li> Black Velvet has and will always be my favorite lipstick &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I then proceeded to re-apply and eat a piece of pizza, mainly because I was hungry, but also because I wanted to see what would happen.</li>
            <li> but you have to use a decent amount and it tends to wear off.</li>
            <li> then its a decent product to get.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and gives a nice dark color after a few layers.</li>
            <li> The color is great, it&#x27;s shiny dark black.</li>
            <li> first time I put it on I had to put on quite a few layers before it would go on smoothly black, but now it goes on fine without having to put on more than a couple of layers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Save your dollars and don&#x27;t get your hopes up high about this product.</li>
            <li> leaves behind a slight gray tint to my lips after i wipe it off which is kinda awesome, haha.</li>
            <li> and it gets extremely blotchy, comes off easily etc etc.</li>
            <li> My favorite black lipstick by far!</li>
            <li> (more grey), it didn&#x27;t cover properly at all.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that its long lasting lipstick and when eating it doesn&#x27;t come off easyly.</li>
            <li> Ordered August 14th, its now October 28, wore the product almost everyday and still haven&#x27;t even went through half the product which is great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a lovely vanilla smell, and the only problem I did have is that after a while it would dry up, so I&#x27;d have to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone that&#x27;s looking a dark lip colour that comes off easy at night.</li>
            <li> New to the colored lipstick idea</li>
            <li> (and I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin at all)...</li>
            <li> highly recommend buying from this seller, I ordered this three days ago, got it today, two days early.</li>
            <li> Definitely needs to be lined, but thicker and more opaque than I expected for the price!</li>
            <li> The product actually came in a few days early, and was quite nice.</li>
            <li> If people could marry lipsticks I would totally get married to this lipstick.</li>
            <li> accidentally washed my first one in the washing machine, and I&#x27;m definitely planning on buying a replacement.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a product which would cover the lips with a bit of shine, but deep, dark, black color was the most important.</li>
            <li> Only issue I had with it would be true of any black lipstick, and that is the fact it makes your teeth look yellow when you smile!</li>
            <li> The color can be built up from a calm black, to an intense shade.</li>
            <li> It looks a little chalky, but goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> So pretty much if you&#x27;re cool with it coming off and only lasting a few minutes</li>
            <li> found a way around this by adding clear lip gloss over it, wiping the lip gloss applier off, and rubbing my lips together.&lt;br</li>
            <li> : There isn&#x27;t much to the actual lipstick.</li>
            <li> Not matte &amp;#34;velvet&amp;#34; it is a cheap waste of money.</li>
            <li> this lipstick far exceeded my expectations for the price.</li>
            <li> but it is very glossy, and regular touch ups are needed.</li>
            <li> It Just Feels Natural.</li>
            <li> Love the color, very shiny dark black color.</li>
            <li> I got this in black and it was really true to color.</li>
            <li> If you want TRUE black lips, you&#x27;ll need to use some face paint.</li>
            <li> The colour doesn&#x27;t show up well, and it doesn&#x27;t last very long at all -- although that was a blessing in disguise for me, as I found out quickly after application that I have a sensitivity to something in the product.</li>
            <li> My cousin recently bought a 3 pack form this seller and as usual, I was pleased.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I found it worked decently for was blending with a lighter lipstick to create a darker shade.</li>
            <li> I had needed black lipstick for every day use and in the area I live in people seem to think it&#x27;s only used for Halloween which really isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light black with light application, &amp; actually get&#x27;s darker black with multiple applications.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on long and you&#x27;ll have to keep retouching very often.</li>
            <li> Though the color was really great, I was a little disappointed with how easy it was to take it off.</li>
            <li> So when I found the LA Colors Black Velvet for only $5, I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear it often because black doesn&#x27;t go over well in all circumstances, but it feels great and looks dramatic.</li>
            <li> The middle of your lips stay their natural color while the outside has a cheap black tint to it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the color black for any lipstick on her or anyone mainly,</li>
            <li> Just make sure you put it on last and use a setting spray, it is so just creamy and thick</li>
            <li> : Moisturize your lips with a balm first, apply a coat of red lipstick second, apply this lip color last.</li>
            <li> Arrived several days early!</li>
            <li> I might just have to ware it with a black or dark gloss for it to look better</li>
            <li> I just walked into my local Dollar General and bought this same exact brand lipstick in Cherry Red for $1, where you guys are spending $5 online and waiting patiently for this to be shipped to you -</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it for how little it costs.</li>
            <li> This lipstick barely shows on your lips.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say the latter was entirely unexpected, however.</li>
            <li> Very moist and does the job as expected</li>
            <li> My order shipped within an hour of placing my order, and it came in the mail about five days later (a day before the first expected delivery date).</li>
            <li> You can get a nice black lip look but you have to lay it on thick</li>
            <li> I only give it 3 stars because it came late, other than that it&#x27;s amazing &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Sure, the container is average sized, but the actual black lipstick is only about an inch tall.</li>
            <li> She likes that it smells like vanilla, goes on smoothly, and isn&#x27;t waxy like some other black lipsticks.</li>
            <li> not dry out</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it comes off very easily.</li>
            <li> Great... when it stayed on my lips and not my teeth. :{</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty moisturizing and my lips don&#x27;t feel dried up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a dark blue or a dark purple it is a true black.</li>
            <li> I bought the black lipstick and it works really</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for anyone who wants black lips or even for cosplay.</li>
            <li> They should call it grey, not black.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of effort to get a true dark black color and it comes off quite easily, so if you don&#x27;t like reapplying lipstick every few hours of the day, preferably save it for non-eating (unless you&#x27;re one of those skillful eaters) and non-kissing days.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re cheap like moi and need black lipstick dis is da shit imo.</li>
            <li> When I do a 3 star rating, I mean i was satisfied but don&#x27;t use black often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only complaint is that when I tried to take it off it smeared all over my face, but after a little more washing and wiping that came off as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and I wore it for about 6 straight hours without it needing any serious touchups.</li>
            <li> I mix it with other colors to give it a a different look because by itself on your lips it looks very light and thin.</li>
            <li> lipstick is really oily and won&#x27;t stay on your lips for very long, even when closed for a long time.</li>
            <li> for this price, this is probably my new go-to black lipstick.</li>
            <li> Works very well, though it takes some rubbing on the lips to get past the shiny coating on the outside.</li>
            <li> My only problem is the wear isn&#x27;t long lasting, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend eating with this lipstick.</li>
            <li> It sets the lipsticks and makes it last long.</li>
            <li> I tried to shape the color a specific way, but the second I closed my mouth that shape smeared and was lost.</li>
            <li> You have to put it on a couple of times to really get it to look like a dark black.</li>
            <li> Like literally I put it on (heavily), and not only was it not black</li>
            <li> It actually came way earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> After getting it LATE, I can say it worked very well</li>
            <li> It lasted a long time, too.</li>
            <li> Got it 4 days earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Stays on fairly long.</li>
            <li> The lipstick does not fill in well and does not stay on the lips for to long.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> These have a pretty gross smell and creepy taste if you&#x27;re unlucky enough to lick you lips while wearing it, similar to talc or baby powder.</li>
            <li> This lipstick isn&#x27;t too sticky or clumpy and lasts long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had really bad ones in the past, but this one is actually very nice.</li>
            <li> spread very strangely and bled off of my lips...</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t feel costumes and doesn&#x27;t dry my mouth out</li>
            <li> Not only is it dark ( I did have to apply a layer or two)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out!</li>
            <li> I got the 136 Black Velvet color for a Homestuck troll cosplay (specifically Eridan - the only male character with noticeably black lips).</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a black lipstick for quite some time before finally ordering online...</li>
            <li> actually, I had this for less than a week before I tossed it out.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought the black lipstick for a cosplay recently.</li>
            <li> The only thing I have to complain about is that it only has a small amount of it in there</li>
            <li> This lipstick is actually opaque black, unlike others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found bigger lipsticks in my little sister&#x27;s play makeup kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not like other black lipstick that require re-applying constantly over the day.</li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> Five stars, will definitely recommend this to any other cosplayer who needs black lipstick!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t horrible but it wasn&#x27;t the best you have to apply it at least 10 times before it even starts to look black</li>
            <li> I was not too disappointed with this brand as I didn&#x27;t really expect much for the price</li>
            <li> I applied it and then reapplied on a couple of faded spots about 3 hours later, after having a drink and smoking (which usually kills any lipstick I&#x27;m wearing immediately</li>
            <li> Wore off extremely</li>
            <li> but I make due with what I got.</li>
            <li> To get the heavy black color, you need to apply it a little heavy, and somewhat frequently.</li>
            <li> so it just makes you.look messy, sloppy and very unattractive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the 136 Black Velvet shade for a cosplay and it came before my wig and all my other things, so</li>
            <li> This lipstick does go on dark</li>
            <li> It made my lips swell and turn dark.  </li>
            <li> I have problems with a lot of lipsticks drying out my lips (black or any other color), but this one didn&#x27;t at all!</li>
            <li> Got me into black lipstick.</li>
            <li> Ordered #136 Black Velvet on November 1 and got it on Nonmember 5  both 2011 of course ).</li>
            <li> greasy like the black lipsticks found in Halloween/Party stores</li>
            <li> Tried it on and you have to apply it a lot to get the desired black and it looks streaky.</li>
            <li> but you have to keep rubbing it on to get a really black color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s black.</li>
            <li> The blackiest black that ever blacked black.</li>
            <li> black tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, she has been looking for black lipstick for Cosplay.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 of these for my mom who loves black lipstick.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve wanted to try black lipstick for a while</li>
            <li> (Black Lipsticks)</li>
            <li> for those wondering i got my lipstick in black velvet</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a black lipstick this is it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wanted black lipstick.</li>
            <li> I bought this in black and it wouldn&#x27;t stick well to my lips whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It has a slight vanilla flavor.</li>
            <li> This is not a true black lipstick.</li>
            <li> I had to apply a few coats to get my desired dark black color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Had to apply a few layers to get the wanted dark black color.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the lipstick goes on thin, so you&#x27;ll have to apply several coats.</li>
            <li> Poorly made, apparently.</li>
            <li> I would recommend spulging a little, or just getting this to test out wearing black lipstick.</li>
            <li> I have just received this with in the last hour, and I&#x27;m already convinced it is not good for everyday use or cosplay.</li>
            <li> L. A. Colors Black Velvet has been my go-to lipstick color for a few years.  </li>
            <li> You have to rub it on a few times till it comes out totally black.</li>
            <li> It may take a few coats to get it black</li>
            <li> LIPSTICKS WERE NEATLY WRAPPED IN BUBBLE WRAP AND TUCKED INSIDE THE CUTEST LITTLE BOX...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little glossy, not matte, but it&#x27;s not TOO shiny.</li>
            <li> It may be a little translucent</li>
            <li> I was expect it to be a little bit darker</li>
            <li> you have to swipe it on a few times but the color is as dark as you can get!</li>
            <li> Very dark.</li>
            <li> and it ended up being a very dark cappuccino.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It also came off within a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment, but horrible quality for black lipstick its just awful...very messy, not solid black when applied</li>
            <li> This is the black lipstick I have ever used!</li>
            <li> and so it messed up the product pretty badly before I found and recovered it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even worse that it&#x27;s in black because I have to worry about having black splotches on my face or half of the lip</li>
            <li> Since it wasn&#x27;t very expensive, we weren&#x27;t expecting too much out of it.</li>
            <li> It took a couple coats to get it the dark shade I wanted, but it wasn&#x27;t too thick.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s not good for everyday use; it is literally black chapstick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Greasy, hardly shows up, and not worth it!</li>
            <li> Think before you purchase small items like this</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t rub off with small motions like that, maybe</li>
            <li> I got confused by the name, the fact it was called black velvet made me believe the finishing touch would be velvety.</li>
            <li> Overall though, it wasn&#x27;t a terrible purchase, and if you desperately need some black lipstick, it&#x27;s not a bad choice.</li>
            <li> to shiny, but not too dull.</li>
            <li> Despite those, it unfortunately was misshapen due to the lid pressing against the tip.</li>
            <li> I had a horrific burning sensation not long after application, and although I washed it off promptly, I had a visible burning itchy red rash for two days where it had smudged around my lips.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is awful - the stick broke out of the tube the very first time I opened it.</li>
            <li> This black lipstick is mad rad.</li>
            <li> gone, which is a very unsettling look with black lipstick.</li>
            <li> Very black just not for me :(</li>
            <li> It is dry and waxy and has terrible coverage.</li>
            <li> Over all don&#x27;t waste your money on this awful product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> Could not apply if my lips were anything but bone-dry to begin with, which was impossible.</li>
            <li> This is just bad all around.</li>
            <li> bad part about</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE quality.</li>
            <li> I hated it !</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s horrible.</li>
            <li> This is HORRIBLE!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the color, very shiny dark black color. Ordered August 14th, its now October 28, wore the product almost everyday and still haven&#x27;t even went through half the product which is great. My only problem is the wear isn&#x27;t long lasting, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend eating with this lipstick. Like it can be on for hours and it gets extremely blotchy, comes off easily etc etc. Regardless I still loooove this product</li>
            <li> I just walked into my local Dollar General and bought this same exact brand lipstick in Cherry Red for $1, where you guys are spending $5 online and waiting patiently for this to be shipped to you - I just tried the product and for a $1 lipstick it&#x27;s very nice, smooth, and bright red. I would buy it again, but you guys are getting screwed over online. Think before you purchase small items like this</li>
            <li> The colour is pretty. It lasts during the day &amp; it tastes like vanilla. I would recommend this to everyone that&#x27;s looking a dark lip colour that comes off easy at night.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a while for an economical black lipstick, since most I have seen cost nearly $20. So when I found the LA Colors Black Velvet for only $5, I was excited to try it. This lipstick is awful - the stick broke out of the tube the very first time I opened it. It is dry and waxy and has terrible coverage. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Smells like vanilla! Good coverage; takes about two swipes. Got me into black lipstick. Pretty matte finish. Needs reapplication often, wipes off easily. Like, really easily. But it doesn&#x27;t feel costumes and doesn&#x27;t dry my mouth out so I enjoy wearing it. :)</li>
            <li> Very nice, After a coat or too, its perfectly black.</li>
            <li> ***AFTER MY FAVOURITE LIPSTICK WAS DISCONTINED BY COVER GIRL...I WAS ON THE HUNT FOR SOMETHING SIMILAR IN COLOUR...AND ALSO MAYBE EVEN A BIT CHEAPER....I FOUND THESE LIPSTICKS AND ORDERED ABOUT 12 IN COLOURS I WOULD WEAR...I LOVE THESE LIPSTICKS...NOT THE PRETTIEST CASES, BUT WHO CARES?...I ALSO LIKE LA COLORS EYESHADOWS...THE STARLET SERIES ARE SOOO FUN...THE COLOURS GO ON LIGHT...NOT AS THEY LOOK IN THE PALETTES...SO VERY WORKABLE...BACK TO THE LIPSTICKS...THEY HAVE VITAMIN E AND ALOE...ALL OF THE COLOURS I ORDRERED WORKED EXCEPT FOR 2, WHICH I HANDED OFF TO A CO-WORKER...AND I LIKE HOW MISS*PINK*CAT PACAGES HER PRODUCTS FOR DELIVERY...LIPSTICKS WERE NEATLY WRAPPED IN BUBBLE WRAP AND TUCKED INSIDE THE CUTEST LITTLE BOX...SO WITH THE ECONOMY THW WAY THAT IT IS...I CAN SAY THESE LA COLORS LIPSTICKS AND SHADOWS ARE WORTH IT...</li>
            <li> I have just received this with in the last hour, and I&#x27;m already convinced it is not good for everyday use or cosplay. I got the 136 Black Velvet color for a Homestuck troll cosplay (specifically Eridan - the only male character with noticeably black lips). Think of it as a smooth, colored chapstick. Because that&#x27;s pretty much it. It applies very nicely and smoothly, and the pointed tip makes perfecting the look incredibly easy. The problem is that it is too moist, and smears almost immediately. I tried to shape the color a specific way, but the second I closed my mouth that shape smeared and was lost. But I kept it on to see if it would settle, like chapstick, and keep the color. This did not happen. Instead, it continued to smear until I could see the pinks of my lips easily, even after re-applying it multiple times. It just sits on top of your lips and moves around freely. I then proceeded to re-apply and eat a piece of pizza, mainly because I was hungry, but also because I wanted to see what would happen. I checked the mirror afterwards and about 75% of it was gone. I wiped it off, and it came off easily. Just like chapstick. But, also like chapstick, the places where my lips were relatively dry were stained an unattractive shade of black/grey, but fortunately it came off easily with a bit of water. I did, however, get a kick of being able to kiss the mirror and not worry about it taking great feats and miracles to get it off.&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION: It&#x27;s not good for everyday use; it is literally black chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;The color was very nice, though.&lt;br /&gt;I will be keeping it, on the other hand, because of how easily it comes off and how easy it is to shape. This will be great for practicing shapes and contours while still being able to clean it off easily.&lt;br /&gt;Also, my lips are no longer chapped.</li>
            <li> I bought this for its trendiness and great price. It has a nice feeling as balm, but it wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;The lipstick is really oily and won&#x27;t stay on your lips for very long, even when closed for a long time. A matte lipstick or gloss would be a better long-lasting product. I would say getting a pricier one would be worth the money and the better looks...</li>
            <li> This is the black lipstick I have ever used! I have problems with a lot of lipsticks drying out my lips (black or any other color), but this one didn&#x27;t at all! It goes on super smooth, though a little light , but 2-3 thin coats makes it a perfect black. It lasted a long time, too. I applied it and then reapplied on a couple of faded spots about 3 hours later, after having a drink and smoking (which usually kills any lipstick I&#x27;m wearing immediately and I have to reapply often). It&#x27;s a little glossy, not matte, but it&#x27;s not TOO shiny. This is absolutely the PERFECT black lipstick and I highly recommend getting it if you&#x27;re in the market for some! And as an added bonus, L.A. Colors do not test their products on animals!</li>
            <li> Best black lipstick I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on long and you&#x27;ll have to keep retouching very often.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a black lipstick for quite some time before finally ordering online...&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something cheap and stumbled upon this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap is right.&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping that for almost 4 dollars I would get something that glided on smoothly and evenly... Not so much.&lt;br /&gt;It spread very strangely and bled off of my lips...</li>
            <li> This worked great for my cosplay! I loved the look and i wish to incorporate it into my daily look!</li>
            <li> I got this lipstick for my Terezi Pyrope cosplay, and I must say, it&#x27;s fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;There are, however, pros and cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Pure black color, and very smooth. Doesn&#x27;t wear off too easily, but when you go to remove it, it comes off quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: There isn&#x27;t much to the actual lipstick. Sure, the container is average sized, but the actual black lipstick is only about an inch tall. Not even. Some people think that&#x27;s very good, but since I have considerably large lips, it was different for me. I&#x27;ve found bigger lipsticks in my little sister&#x27;s play makeup kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product! Five stars, will definitely recommend this to any other cosplayer who needs black lipstick!</li>
            <li> Havent worn it yet but seems to be just what i ordered. New to the colored lipstick idea so i will give it a try.</li>
            <li> L. A. Colors Black Velvet has been my go-to lipstick color for a few years.  My cousin recently bought a 3 pack form this seller and as usual, I was pleased.  The black goes on super smooth and rarely needs to be reapplied, even if I eat/drink a lot.  It&#x27;s never thin or sticky.  Black Velvet has and will always be my favorite lipstick &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> really good solid black</li>
            <li> Definitely needs to be lined, but thicker and more opaque than I expected for the price! Very soft on the lips, and removes fairly well for a black!</li>
            <li> The black lipstick&#x27;s color opacity was perfect for the multiple cosplays I needed it for during the season. And it&#x27;s an excellent price in comparison to brand name lipsticks like MAC, MUFE, or Kryolan and its quality still matches up.</li>
            <li> Purchased for cosplay purposes. Could not apply if my lips were anything but bone-dry to begin with, which was impossible. It took so many applications to get an even color. Wore off extremely quickly-- I felt like I couldn&#x27;t put it away because I was constantly reapplying. Once on, it was extremely greasy and unpleasant-feeling, didn&#x27;t look very nice, smudged easily and often, and the next day I had zits at the corners of my mouth (and I don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin at all)... I&#x27;m tossing it. I wouldn&#x27;t wish this lipstick on anyone.</li>
            <li> Works very well and smells good!!</li>
            <li> It may be a little translucent but hey, it&#x27;s a moisture lipstick. Of course it&#x27;s not going to be 100% color because it has moisturizing stuff in there too. You can get a nice black lip look but you have to lay it on thick so I&#x27;m still looking for a good black lipstick.</li>
            <li> This is a really good black lipstick for the price. I&#x27;ve had really bad ones in the past, but this one is actually very nice. I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> I bought the black lipstick and it works really great!&lt;br /&gt;The first time I put it on I had to put on quite a few layers before it would go on smoothly black, but now it goes on fine without having to put on more than a couple of layers.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that when I tried to take it off it smeared all over my face, but after a little more washing and wiping that came off as well.</li>
            <li> Ordered #136 Black Velvet on November 1 and got it on Nonmember 5  both 2011 of course ). Shipping is fast! I was so excited to receive this in the mail! I&#x27;m using it for my cosplays. Below is a list of all the great things the black lipstick has. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Not greasy like the black lipsticks found in Halloween/Party stores&lt;br /&gt;-Goes on the lips smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;-Not to shiny, but not too dull. Beautiful black color.&lt;br /&gt;-Does not dry out lips.&lt;br /&gt;-Smells like vanilla! &amp;lt;3&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to apply since the edge of the lipstick is pointed&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to remove&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t crack or get cakey&lt;br /&gt;-Pricing is acceptable&lt;br /&gt;-Does not unapply(?) itself when you purse your lips  which is a habit of mine )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing you would have to worry about is reapplying it every so often and maybe giving it a couple of layers since it applies on light. I&#x27;m a first time user, so I&#x27;ll have to see what else this thing has in store for me, but I&#x27;m sure there will be more pros than cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend this product! I&#x27;m sure the other shades are great too! Just do your research first! Good luck! (:</li>
            <li> Got 136 Black Velvet lipstick for my friend who was having a hard time finding a good and affordable ($3.75 is pretty good and there was no s/h) black lipstick.  It went on smooth and the color is a nice matte finish. She loved it :-)</li>
            <li> does not apply smoothing, and does not stay on for more than 5 min. Waste of money. would not buy again</li>
            <li> Got here a couple days early and works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the 136 Black Velvet shade for a cosplay and it came before my wig and all my other things, so I tried it on and I loved it. You have to put it on a couple of times to really get it to look like a dark black. It&#x27;s very comfortable to wear and easy to remove. Great for Homestuck cosplays.</li>
            <li> For only a few dollars I didn&#x27;t expect much.  It&#x27;s almost like a tinted lipbalm!  I would recommend spulging a little, or just getting this to test out wearing black lipstick.</li>
            <li> for the price I paid, I can&#x27;t complain. it worked well, it was moisturizing, etc. however, it wasn&#x27;t long-lasting, and when put into my shoulder bag, the cap wasn&#x27;t secure enough and so it messed up the product pretty badly before I found and recovered it. all in all, it&#x27;s great for the price. I&#x27;m gonna buy a different brand next time though.</li>
            <li> I just received this item yesterday, and I love it! It goes on smooth, works well when I use a brush to touch up, and smells awesome! I will be ordering more for sure. I wasn&#x27;t expecting suck a great product for this price.</li>
            <li> It looked used  when i got it</li>
            <li> This is not a true black lipstick. I mix it with other colors to give it a a different look because by itself on your lips it looks very light and thin. I was expect it to be a little bit darker but I make due with what I got. I&#x27;ll just never order it again.</li>
            <li> It has a nice color but you have to use a decent amount and it tends to wear off. Great for costumes or dress up but might not be the best for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Got it 4 days earlier than expected. Tried it on and you have to apply it a lot to get the desired black and it looks streaky. Deff not a lipstick to wear out. Maybe just for fun and quick pictures or something. Really like the smell though 😜😁😎💄</li>
            <li> Great color, great smell.</li>
            <li> I got this in black and it was really true to color. Very dark.</li>
            <li> The lipstick looks great when you first put it on but it doesn&#x27;t stay put at all. It&#x27;s smudges very easily and rubs off on everything. It&#x27;s even worse that it&#x27;s in black because I have to worry about having black splotches on my face or half of the lip gone, which is a very unsettling look with black lipstick. I have to reapply constantly to it looking neat.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear it often because black doesn&#x27;t go over well in all circumstances, but it feels great and looks dramatic.</li>
            <li> This lipstick barely shows on your lips.  They should call it grey, not black.  If you want TRUE black lips, you&#x27;ll need to use some face paint.</li>
            <li> Great for use. Stays on fairly long. L.A Colors are made very well and is very much affordable. I had needed black lipstick for every day use and in the area I live in people seem to think it&#x27;s only used for Halloween which really isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li> I love the price, and for something this cheap, it works pretty well! Doesn&#x27;t get all gross or get chewed away, it just stays! Def recommended.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a greasy crayon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But actually, I had this for less than a week before I tossed it out. It doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly, was pretty darn waxy/greasy feeling on my lips, and didn&#x27;t last at all. Like literally I put it on (heavily), and not only was it not black (more grey), it didn&#x27;t cover properly at all. It also came off within a few seconds. Waste of money. The only thing I found it worked decently for was blending with a lighter lipstick to create a darker shade.</li>
            <li> The lipstick was worth the buy. It actually came way earlier than expected! And I was very pleased with the quality</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with my lipstick. It went on smoothly &amp; the aloe it has helped keep my lips moisturized. I look forward to purchasing more lip products.</li>
            <li> I got the lipstick pretty fast in about 3 days which is nice, plus free shipping and a great cost. The lipstick itself is what you pay for. Pretty much like halloween lipstick. Very oily and messy. Smears very easily. But hey, it works. You have to rub it on a few times till it comes out totally black. You cant eat or drink with it on, it&#x27;ll come right off. So pretty much if you&#x27;re cool with it coming off and only lasting a few minutes then its a decent product to get.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick brand! It smells very nice and it true to the name, it looks like velvet when applied. The package arrived exactly on time and in tact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Moisturize your lips with a balm first, apply a coat of red lipstick second, apply this lip color last.</li>
            <li> This lipstick does go on dark but you have to keep rubbing it on to get a really black color. The lipstick does not fill in well and does not stay on the lips for to long. It rubs off very easily. Save your dollars and don&#x27;t get your hopes up high about this product.</li>
            <li> Greasy, hardly shows up, and not worth it! Not matte &amp;#34;velvet&amp;#34; it is a cheap waste of money. Was very dissapointed!</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love It ! I wear it when I want to stand out more and go for a more dark punk-ish look.</li>
            <li> Arrived several days early! Works very well, though it takes some rubbing on the lips to get past the shiny coating on the outside.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s black. The blackiest black that ever blacked black. That&#x27;s what I wanted, that&#x27;s what I gotted. It&#x27;s pointer shaped than in the picture, but that&#x27;s a good thing. The covering was good, and it lasted.</li>
            <li> Fantastic lipstick!!! Best I&#x27;ve owned! I ordered the black lipstick and it turned out perfect. PURE BLACKNESS WITH ONE COAT! I suggest putting a layer of eyeliner or lipliner under the lipstick to keep it from smudging. Plus, it smells just like cookies!! I was so excited when I got it that I had to put it on. This is perfect for my DHMIS cosplay of Notepad but any Homestuck troll could use this as well!!</li>
            <li> This lipstick is really good for the great price! It looks good on and actually is pretty black, but is not very long-lasting. But for this price it&#x27;s absolutely great!</li>
            <li> Great... when it stayed on my lips and not my teeth. :{</li>
            <li> My order shipped within an hour of placing my order, and it came in the mail about five days later (a day before the first expected delivery date). I got some of the &amp;#34;Black Velvet&amp;#34; color for cosplay, but I ended up wearing it for most of the day out of cosplay because I really liked it. It&#x27;s a pretty color, and it&#x27;s smooth and easy to apply. I lick my lips a lot and that didn&#x27;t cause it to come off. It DOES come off if you rub at it or touch your lips, though, but that was alright. If you don&#x27;t touch your lips it will stay on for hours. I&#x27;d recommend this lipstick, and I may buy more colors too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed with this product. I&#x27;m actually so surprised everyone gave it better stars. It doesn&#x27;t stay on your lips, its very cheap. The middle of your lips stay their natural color while the outside has a cheap black tint to it. Maybe the one I received was old or something, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay much for it.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought the black lipstick for a cosplay recently. Since it wasn&#x27;t very expensive, we weren&#x27;t expecting too much out of it. The product actually came in a few days early, and was quite nice. My only complaint is that the lipstick goes on thin, so you&#x27;ll have to apply several coats.</li>
            <li> Iove it. its not too shiny and its a really good black lipstick!&lt;br /&gt;It also looks very pretty :3 :3</li>
            <li> ppl keep asking me how I got such &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; black tone.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth every penny, it really is a good lipstick</li>
            <li> Loved the lipstick! Came fast, and looks great! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I put this lipstick on and.... it is so beautiful. It is a beautiful black and it glides on really smoothly. It&#x27;s also very moist and easy to use. If I use it up i&#x27;ll definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lovely, just a bit too shiny for me. I&#x27;m more of a matte kinda girl.</li>
            <li> stays on nicely, but wipes off normally like other lipstick. leaves behind a slight gray tint to my lips after i wipe it off which is kinda awesome, haha. I love this lipstick.</li>
            <li> Its perfect its nice and smooth once you put it on your lips! It will look great for my HS cosplay</li>
            <li> I love this color! This is the best black lipstick that I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> It looks a little chalky, but goes on smooth. Somewhat oily. A good idea is to outline your lips with blackeyeliner first to keep the lipstick from running. I&#x27;ll probably buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, she has been looking for black lipstick for Cosplay. I don&#x27;t really like the color black for any lipstick on her or anyone mainly, as long she&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> i love the color, its exactly what i wanted, the only thing i can really say is the taste but hey completely worth it</li>
            <li> The color is great, it&#x27;s shiny dark black. Unfortunately it comes off very easily. If you are going to eat, drink or kiss you don&#x27;t want to put this lipstick on. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> It got here so quickly it was amazing! It&#x27;s a beautiful rich color and definitely met my expectations! It was pretty cheap too which was very nice. I really do recommend this lipstick ^.^</li>
            <li> Love the fact that its long lasting lipstick and when eating it doesn&#x27;t come off easyly. Im satisfied with the procduct (slaso fast delivery)</li>
            <li> I bought 4 of these for my mom who loves black lipstick. She loves them and said this is exactly what she had been looking for. She plans on buying more of these</li>
            <li> It smells like vanilla. It feels nice and creamy and has a great color. I like it.</li>
            <li> This black lipstick is mad rad. Just make sure you put it on last and use a setting spray, it is so just creamy and thick that it doesn&#x27;t sink in that well at first.</li>
            <li> It feels nice, and it goes on alright, but it comes off extremely quickly. I wouldn&#x27;t say the latter was entirely unexpected, however. Just keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick. And it arrived super fast. I know it came from Cali. But still it was fast shipping, product goes on great. And the smell is amazing. Its kind of like a vanilla scent+ chocolate scent. Idk its great! I do recommend this item to everyone!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU! ^o^</li>
            <li> fantabulous!!! i&#x27;m not a makeup wearing person...but i&#x27;ve wanted to try black lipstick for a while and this was perfect!</li>
            <li> Very moist and does the job as expected</li>
            <li> It stays on well and is very pretty! Also smells like vanilla! SUGGESTION! Because black lipstick smears easily I suggest dabbing your favorite eye shadow on your lips. It sets the lipsticks and makes it last long. Also gives it a better softer look.</li>
            <li> Perfect, just perfect! I am very satisfied with the product and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Waxy, greasy and gross.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, glides on smoothly, and it&#x27;s not tinted chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;It has a lovely vanilla smell, and the only problem I did have is that after a while it would dry up, so I&#x27;d have to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;I found a way around this by adding clear lip gloss over it, wiping the lip gloss applier off, and rubbing my lips together.&lt;br /&gt;It works like a charm, and it&#x27;s like actual lipstick so it doesn&#x27;t rub off with small motions like that, maybe only slightly.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied. The item even arrived quickly, in fact I&#x27;m ordering another for a friend.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled with how nice and dark the color was! It took a couple coats to get it the dark shade I wanted, but it wasn&#x27;t too thick. Though the color was really great, I was a little disappointed with how easy it was to take it off. If you plan to wear it out and are going to be eating, drinking, kissing, etc.... I recommended frequently checking your lipstick to make sure it isn&#x27;t smeared on your face!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still a good buy, though! Good enough quality for the price.</li>
            <li> i was really pleased with this lipstick--it&#x27;s not greasy, there are no purple undertones (a problem with most cheap black lipstick) and it&#x27;s easy to apply. for this price, this is probably my new go-to black lipstick.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister in black, and she was rather pleased with it! It was a bit thin,and not as opaque as she would have liked, so she had to do a few coats, but it got the job done. She likes that it smells like vanilla, goes on smoothly, and isn&#x27;t waxy like some other black lipsticks. Overall, this is a nice lipstick that she and I would recommend for the price.</li>
            <li> (Black Lipsticks) HORRIBLE quality. Bleeds and wears off in seconds. I wouldn&#x27;t buy for a 11 yr olds Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick for a long period of time. I wore it the night before I needed to wear it and decided it was not the best lip stick to wear. It was on for about 10 minutes before it faded in the middle of my lips. I might just have to ware it with a black or dark gloss for it to look better but the product itself is a no go.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick.  The ceolor is rich as reqired.  it makes your lips very kissible. The price is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have never tried black before and is harder to put on correctly but the effect is great, i have even tried it on some friends and they love it also</li>
            <li> I hated it ! For starters I been purchased it and I just received it like maybe two weeks ago ! Two the color is soo blah on my lips I wanted to throw it away but instead I&#x27;m planning on giving it away ! To my niece !!!</li>
            <li> Wanted this lipstick to wear for fun but it&#x27;s so oily and rubs off everything that touches it-- in one swipe i could get it all off. withing 10 minutes after putting it on, it would start to gather in the creases of my lips. AND on top of all that ridiculousness, after i take it off, my lips were noticeably and uncomfortably dry. Please don&#x27;t get this, it&#x27;s horrible.</li>
            <li> When I do a 3 star rating, I mean i was satisfied but don&#x27;t use black often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the color was beautiful and because of that I am giving it a 5 star</li>
            <li> I like it. Good color coverage. I do have to keep reapplying it but that&#x27;s just me :)</li>
            <li> I got black velvet and it was amazing. I used it for my costume and everyone loved it. It may take a few coats to get it black but it last. I would definitely buy this in the future</li>
            <li> I was sketchy at first buying this, but I&#x27;m sooooo glad I did. The lipstick goes on so smooth &amp; i only had to apply two coats for it to be exactly what I wanted. Plus, it smells great. Smells like vanilla to me. Love Love Love!!!</li>
            <li> This lipstick was wonderful--I used it as part of my Harley Quinn costume for Halloween weekend shenanigans.  It stayed put all afternoon and I had no issues with pigmentation or my lips drying out (but then again, I wore chapstick underneath it so it would be sure to go on smoothly).  Only issue I had with it would be true of any black lipstick, and that is the fact it makes your teeth look yellow when you smile!</li>
            <li> These have a pretty gross smell and creepy taste if you&#x27;re unlucky enough to lick you lips while wearing it, similar to talc or baby powder. The colour doesn&#x27;t show up well, and it doesn&#x27;t last very long at all -- although that was a blessing in disguise for me, as I found out quickly after application that I have a sensitivity to something in the product. I had a horrific burning sensation not long after application, and although I washed it off promptly, I had a visible burning itchy red rash for two days where it had smudged around my lips. Another colour I tried, silver, turned out to do the same thing. Be really cautious with L.A. Colors lipstick if you have any chemical allergies or sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus point of frustration, I couldn&#x27;t find any listing of the ingredients on the package I received, so I still have no idea what I reacted to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always on the lookout for great black lipstick -- this isn&#x27;t it. You&#x27;re better off with some of the cheap stuff you find in stores around Halloween if you&#x27;re looking for something short term -- you&#x27;ll get better depth to the black -- or something more expensive if you&#x27;re going for daily use. This is just bad all around.</li>
            <li> This is a basic black lipstick, but it is perfect.  The color and consistency are great, not expected for the price.  I purchased this to use in costume, and it lasted hours, even through constant snacking and drinking.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> Quick shipment, but horrible quality for black lipstick its just awful...very messy, not solid black when applied so it just makes you.look messy, sloppy and very unattractive</li>
            <li> This lipstick is pretty good, overall.&lt;br /&gt;- Nice, black-black color&lt;br /&gt;- Smells like vanilla!&lt;br /&gt;- The price is right&lt;br /&gt;The bad part about it.&lt;br /&gt;- To get the heavy black color, you need to apply it a little heavy, and somewhat frequently.</li>
            <li> Works great! Like another review stated, it has a kind of vanilla flavor, which is a great difference from previous black lipsticks I&#x27;ve purchased which just taste oily. It goes on nicely, like actual lipstick, rather than just a colored oil (again with those previos purchases). It takes a couple of layers to get the right shade of black, but it is perfect. I&#x27;ll purchase more colors soon!</li>
            <li> The only thing I have to complain about is that it only has a small amount of it in there</li>
            <li> It arrived sooner than I expected. But you do get what you pay for. It fades rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for cosplay. I anticipated, based on the reviews, something better than the crappy stuff you get at costume shops... I did /not/ anticipate something significantly better than many lipsticks I own. It is soft, supple, smells lovely, produces a satin sheen finish (gorgeous) and doesn&#x27;t come off terribly easily based on my makeup test today. I did have to do two coats (it&#x27;s thin), and I DID have to wear it for a while before it seemed \\&quot;set\\&quot; and become mostly smudgeless, but I am overall thrilled. I literally recommended this to my friends.</li>
            <li> If people could marry lipsticks I would totally get married to this lipstick. Not only is it dark ( I did have to apply a layer or two) but it was only like 4.00 and that&#x27;s with shipping yo!! Okay to be exact it was 3.75 which makes it even better and it smells like vanilla. It&#x27;s also pretty moisturizing and my lips don&#x27;t feel dried up. Sure it doesn&#x27;t have the best staying power but yooooooooo 4.00! So if you&#x27;re cheap like moi and need black lipstick dis is da shit imo.</li>
            <li> this lipstick far exceeded my expectations for the price. it&#x27;s really soft and feels nice on my lips. it has good pigment and goes on smooth. it also smells and tastes really good so bonus points for that. i would definitely buy this product again and recommend it to anyone else looking for some good lipstick for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and for those wondering i got my lipstick in black velvet</li>
            <li> its moist and soft on the lips and fills it with a full black color and just looks wonderful on. and i would recommend this product and order again. when i run out.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot! It&#x27;s dark and silky smooth! Looks great in photo shoots! I would recommend this color/product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this seller,  my lipstick came before the estimate date and it was packaged safely.  The lipstick itself smells like vanilla and applys smoothly. If you are looking for a black lipstick this is it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wanted black lipstick. It arrived on time, in perfect condition. I tried it out, &amp; I really like it, I&#x27;m glad I made the purchased, was not unsatisfied. It&#x27;s a light black with light application, &amp; actually get&#x27;s darker black with multiple applications. I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. Stayed on for a grat length of time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for Halloween and it was perfect! Definitely worth it for how little it costs.</li>
            <li> Very black just not for me :( it looks like chalk or something.</li>
            <li> still have it to this day and it smells kind of vanilla ish and tastes like birthday cake.</li>
            <li> I was not too disappointed with this brand as I didn&#x27;t really expect much for the price and I tend to be a bargain hunter anyway. It takes a little bit of effort to get a true dark black color and it comes off quite easily, so if you don&#x27;t like reapplying lipstick every few hours of the day, preferably save it for non-eating (unless you&#x27;re one of those skillful eaters) and non-kissing days.</li>
            <li> Went on smooth and bold first time applying it. Not like other black lipstick that require re-applying constantly over the day. I&#x27;m ready to buy more!</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick. I put this on with a lip primer and a lip gloss. Really good lipstick.</li>
            <li> This is HORRIBLE! It wipes off and smears when you just talk... forget about eating with this on, unless you like eating lipstick. I wore this for a Halloween costume and it was a disaster. It chaps your lips like you&#x27;d never believe. And when you try to put chapstick on it just comes off (when you put it on before the lipstick your lips still chap...). Over all don&#x27;t waste your money on this awful product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my lips pitch black, but pretty good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this brand, I bought this specific color for Halloween and regret nothing about it. It really is like a colored lip balm because it&#x27;s awesome on your lips. I definitely recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> My favorite black lipstick by far! This lipstick isn&#x27;t too sticky or clumpy and lasts long. I recommend it :)</li>
            <li> Bought this for a cosplay and it is very good lipstick and even smells like vanilla! stays on very well during the day unless you eat something but of course why wouldnt it .</li>
            <li> Was looking for a product which would cover the lips with a bit of shine, but deep, dark, black color was the most important. It doesn&#x27;t give that look to the lips, and so we won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I had a very adverse reaction using this product.  It made my lips swell and turn dark.  Never happened to me before.</li>
            <li> When it first arrived, I was happy to put it on and when I did, it looked fantastic and the colour is a good black. I would recommend it for anyone who wants black lips or even for cosplay. *cough* Homestuck *cough*</li>
            <li> I had some problems with the Eggplant. I was expecting it to be a purple/black color and it ended up being a very dark cappuccino.  I was able to exchange it though and the seller is SUPER awesome. I got the black I wanted and its perfect. Would buy from again. I also got a steel color and it was fantastic. Great shine and everything.</li>
            <li> I got confused by the name, the fact it was called black velvet made me believe the finishing touch would be velvety. but it is very glossy, and regular touch ups are needed. you have to swipe it on a few times but the color is as dark as you can get!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a dark blue or a dark purple it is a true black. Great price for it, well worth it.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is wonderful! A big selling point for me is the scent: a really sweet vanilla! The color goes on really well, and it softens your lips like no tomorrow. The only issue was that it came off pretty easily, but that&#x27;s a fairly easy fix. For the price, it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally washed my first one in the washing machine, and I&#x27;m definitely planning on buying a replacement.</li>
            <li> One of the reviewers said that it was a cappucino color, but I loved it! Nice and black and stayed on nicely AND came off super quick! I thought it would smudge but it literally took one wipe to come off! I don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying a bunch either, so It was a weight off of my shoulders! I&#x27;m now going to use this for my Kanaya cosplay in July!</li>
            <li> After getting it LATE, I can say it worked very well and It&#x27;s amazing &amp;#60;3 I only give it 3 stars because it came late, other than that it&#x27;s amazing &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This lipstick goes on so smoothly! I&#x27;m happy I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Creamy and very well pigmented. Doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out! However, don&#x27;t put it on over lip balm- makes it look splotchy. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> It Took Awhile To Get Here But It Was Worth It. It&#x27;s Nice And Smooth. No Stain it Comes Right Off. It Just Feels Natural. I Love It.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and stays on all day long.  Perfect under a shiny gloss, changes the look of every gloss I have.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick. It goes on beautifully and gives you a nice depth of black. It goes on smoothly and does not irritate in any way. It thins a bit as the day wears on and needs to be reapplied but it is a great lipstick and is well worth the price! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love the color... in the picture. On lips, the product is very almost watery and it doesn&#x27;t stay. It looks like someone colored on they&#x27;re lips with a sharpie marker and didn&#x27;t finish</li>
            <li> Very good lipstick, is very black and full of pigment :3</li>
            <li> this is a great product!!! it came in 2 day of ordering and it smelled like marshmallows!!!</li>
            <li> The lipstick is nice, and goes on very easily, but it seems to be able to come off just as easily as well, which would lead to more applications throughout the day than I&#x27;d probably like to mess with. The color is nice, I wish it was a little bit darker though, it takes a couple of applications to get the shade you want. Overall though, it wasn&#x27;t a terrible purchase, and if you desperately need some black lipstick, it&#x27;s not a bad choice. I like it.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and has a nice dark color. Plus it smells good!</li>
            <li> I liked this lipstick. It&#x27;s soft and smells very good. I had to apply a few coats to get my desired dark black color. However, it comes off easily and smears off whenever it&#x27;s touched, so I have to reapply it every so often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this would be fine for a cosplay or dress up, but if you want a long lasting, every day lipstick, I suggest splurging a little more for a better brand since the frequent re-application of this lipstick gets annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Smells like vanilla!&lt;br /&gt;- Soft&lt;br /&gt;- Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Had to apply a few layers to get the wanted dark black color.&lt;br /&gt;- Comes off easily and will smear off if touched.</li>
            <li> It works for the price you pay. Only complaint is its kind of greasy and wipes off easy, needs to be applied a lot. But its fine since its so cheap!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t horrible but it wasn&#x27;t the best you have to apply it at least 10 times before it even starts to look black I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is actually opaque black, unlike others I have tried.  It smells lovely, is not oily, and stays SUPER well.  I put it on for fun, ate dinner, and went to bed without ever looking in the mirror.  When I woke up the next day I still had a bit on!  I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> This lipstick is perfect!  It is very smooth and opaque, although it tends to rub off a little more than expected.  All in all, I am very happy with the product!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even get to try it. As soon as I opened it, the bottom fell off and the lipstick itself broke. Poorly made, apparently.</li>
            <li> It works alright. You need several coats, and it comes off easily onto cups and canned beverages. Sealing it helps it stay on, but besides that, it has great color, shine, and smells like vanilla! Despite those, it unfortunately was misshapen due to the lid pressing against the tip. the bottom came off, but it was in safe packaging, and applies well with patience. I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> good color payoff and nice smell!  might want to wear a lip liner to be sure, though.</li>
            <li> This product is not only made with natural ingredients, it also applies smoothly and feels light on the lips. The color can be built up from a calm black, to an intense shade. It also comes off very easily, which is a pro and con.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend buying from this seller, I ordered this three days ago, got it today, two days early. The packaging is just amazing, so there is no way it could be damaged.&lt;br /&gt;Just overall an amazing lip stick.</li>
            <li> I bought this in black and it wouldn&#x27;t stick well to my lips whatsoever. Felt like if I put lip gloss on.</li>
            <li> I got this item for a cosplay and was surprised by how perfect it was. It goes on smoothly and gives a nice dark color after a few layers. It&#x27;s very soft and I wore it for about 6 straight hours without it needing any serious touchups. Also, it smells quite nice and doesn&#x27;t taste too lipstick-y. It has a slight vanilla flavor. ^u^</li>
