            <li>She is happy to have it</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s happy -</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Received in good order.</li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>Makes hair manageable and gives a good shine</li>
            <li>I just love this stuff, it&#x27;s great for styling and does not produce flakes......</li>
            <li>My hair is healthy looking!</li>
            <li>This is still one of my favorite hair dressings; I&#x27;ve used it since a teenager!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s manageable to comb nice and shines</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe that there is a better hair dressing out there, regardless of the price.  </li>
            <li>The lady who cuts my hair always asks me what I use to make it look so healthy.  </li>
            <li>When I tell her, she can&#x27;t believe that it isn&#x27;t something exotic.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I was able to find&lt;br /&gt;it on Amazon as I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in Reno/Sparks, NV nor could my son find it in The town in&lt;br /&gt;California where he lives.  </li>
            <li>I love the product</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it again--especiallly since my hair is now silver.</li>
            <li>and I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I love VO5.</li>
            <li>Glad to find on amazon.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for a family member living in another state - he hadn&#x27;t been able to find this, his favorite hairdressing, for two years.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Alberto VO5 Conditioning Hairdressing for years, have not been able to find anything better yet.</li>
            <li>Been using it for years, it makes your hair really easy to manage and shines your hair without the greasy look.</li>
            <li>(and it&#x27;s more economical).  </li>
            <li>it has a strong smell not bad though.</li>
            <li>love the large size tub also!</li>
            <li>While this product is worthwhile, the owners shipped it regular snail mail to my mailbox, packaged top to top, so that by the time I got home from work, they were both ALL LIQUID, and MELTED..</li>
            <li>great product for dry hair it gives shine and soften the hair</li>
            <li>Plus, the scent fades relatively quickly.</li>
            <li>Great product ,not found in retail stores anymore , HAD TO PAY DOUBLE NORMAL RETAIL but worth theprice to find the item</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>The same product I used to buy in stores but have not been able to find anymore, The price is right and if this is what you are looking for then</li>
            <li>This, however, is the first time I&#x27;ve bought it in a jar, and I&#x27;ve discovered that it&#x27;s easier to use this way</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;All is good,  I am now set for a few years.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for the hair -- it&#x27;s animal-based lanolin, and much closer to your hair&#x27;s natural oils than plant-based moisturizers.</li>
            <li>This is something that has been around a long time that I use for my hair and it keeps it healthy.</li>
            <li>I began using VO5 Conditioning Hairdressing in the early 90&#x27;s and somehow got off track over the years with all the cool looking and smelling &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; products out there for curly hair.</li>
            <li>Also, top to top is not good for MELTABLE ITEMS.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not always easy to find in stores, especially the jar.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way puts a nice shine on my hair and keeps it healthy.</li>
            <li>size a real buy.</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair look healthier.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Have it already and really like it.  </li>
            <li>I recently rediscovered my old favorite</li>
            <li>Due to the greasy exteriors, I realize that some of the precious VO5 was LOST through LEAKAGE!!!d</li>
            <li>Since my hair is fine and wavy, it tends to be dry.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it as it does not hold your hair like concrete.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product I received was old stock, the viscosity was very watery rather than the normal pomade texture of this product.  </li>
            <li>Works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty potent stuff so if you use too much your hair will be limp and oily so use just a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope the company corrected their shipping procedures so that the next time someone orders such a product, they protect the packaging better, and send it UPS so that it can at least be protected out of a hot mailbox, and instead in a roof-sheltered front door.</li>
            <li>Many people ask if I color my hair and the answer I tell them is that I only apply a small amount of VO5 every time after I was my hair.</li>
            <li>The is exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Years ago, I used this conditioner on my fine, but thick hair.</li>
            <li>When I put this on my hair it makes me look like a movie star!  :O )</li>
            <li>Unfortunately this product is not sold in many retail locations in this quantity and my 80+ year old mother-in-law uses only this!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and I am starting to have trouble finding it in stores but found this large economy size here!</li>

            <li> I apply it to towel dried hair and since I only wash my hair every 3-4 days, I reapply it to dry hair on the 2nd or 3rd day as well.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny bit of this calms down the frizz and makes my hair shinny.</li>
            <li> It smells a bit too herbal for my taste, but the benefits far exceed the one negative for me.</li>
            <li> I am 67 going on 68 and only have a few gray hairs.</li>
            <li> I put the product on when my hair is wet and also in between washing.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way in shiny hair management.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can apply other products over it if you like -</li>
            <li> only negative is the scent.</li>
            <li> No free shipping.</li>
            <li> I have been using VO5 for the past fifteen years.</li>
            <li> but I have been unable to find it in local stores or online</li>
            <li> Getting hard to find in drug stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find this product in stores.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for at least 25 years, probably longer.  </li>
            <li> Arrived in broken jars and melted butter</li>
            <li> expensive</li>
            <li> I hated to have to spend the amount per bottle for shipping instead of a bulk shipping rate which made it a very expensive purchase.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing!</li>

            <li> Unfortunately this product is not sold in many retail locations in this quantity and my 80+ year old mother-in-law uses only this! I hated to have to spend the amount per bottle for shipping instead of a bulk shipping rate which made it a very expensive purchase.  She is happy to have it and I don&#x27;t have to worry about them going from place to place  looking for it!</li>
            <li> There is a reason that this product has been around all these years:  It works.  I have been using it for at least 25 years, probably longer.  I don&#x27;t believe that there is a better hair dressing out there, regardless of the price.  The lady who cuts my hair always asks me what I use to make it look so healthy.  When I tell her, she can&#x27;t believe that it isn&#x27;t something exotic.</li>
            <li> USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS.  DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT I WILL DO IN THE FUTURE.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for decades. A little goes a long way in shiny hair management. 6 oz. size a real buy.</li>
            <li> Great product ,not found in retail stores anymore , HAD TO PAY DOUBLE NORMAL RETAIL but worth theprice to find the item</li>
            <li> Used this stuff for years and still have some hair. Getting hard to find in drug stores.</li>
            <li> I have been using Alberto Vo5 for over 50 years.  I cannot do without it.  I am so glad I was able to find&lt;br /&gt;it on Amazon as I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in Reno/Sparks, NV nor could my son find it in The town in&lt;br /&gt;California where he lives.  I do not understand why the drugstores quit stocking it.&lt;br /&gt;All is good,  I am now set for a few years.</li>
            <li> The is exactly what I expected.  I have been using this hairdressing for several years and cannot find it in stores anylonger</li>
            <li> I used this product for years it keeps my hair heathly and it&#x27;s manageable to comb nice and shines I love the product</li>

            <li> Arrived in broken jars and melted butter</li>
            <li> Received in good order.</li>
            <li> This product was a gift for my wife. I am forever ordering this product,because she uses it often.I hope this is the last time I view this product!</li>
            <li> What more can I say? The same product I used to buy in stores but have not been able to find anymore, The price is right and if this is what you are looking for then I suggest you purchase it.</li>

Just a tiny bit of this calms down the frizz and makes my hair shinny. I am so glad I found it again--especiallly since my hair is now silver. It really makes my hair look healthier.</li>
            <li> Good. Fast shipping. No free shipping.</li>
            <li> When I put this on my hair it makes me look like a movie star!  :O )</li>
            <li> Being a hairstylist,I have used 1,000&#x27;s of products..VO5 stands alone..nothing compares</li>
            <li> While this product is worthwhile, the owners shipped it regular snail mail to my mailbox, packaged top to top, so that by the time I got home from work, they were both ALL LIQUID, and MELTED..

            <li> I began using VO5 Conditioning Hairdressing in the early 90&#x27;s and somehow got off track over the years with all the cool looking and smelling &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; products out there for curly hair. None of them measured up to VO5 and they were a lot more expensive. I recently rediscovered my old favorite and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long curly hair that tends to frizz and VO5 tames my frizz and defines my curls. I apply it to towel dried hair and since I only wash my hair every 3-4 days, I reapply it to dry hair on the 2nd or 3rd day as well. Works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty potent stuff so if you use too much your hair will be limp and oily so use just a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can apply other products over it if you like - but it&#x27;s not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only negative is the scent. It smells a bit too herbal for my taste, but the benefits far exceed the one negative for me. Plus, the scent fades relatively quickly. VO5 did have an unscented version but I have been unable to find it in local stores or online so maybe it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and has a pleasant smell.  I have used it off and on over decades.  I highly recommend it as it does not hold your hair like concrete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ron P.</li>
            <li> great product for dry hair it gives shine and soften the hair it has a strong smell not bad though. expensive</li>
            <li> This is something that has been around a long time that I use for my hair and it keeps it healthy. love the large size tub also!</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff, it&#x27;s great for styling and does not produce flakes......I give it 7 out of 6 if I could</li>
            <li> Have it already and really like it.  Makes hair manageable and gives a good shine</li>
            <li> Awsome product! My hair is healthy looking!</li>
            <li> USING THIS PRODUCT FOR OVER 50 YEARS, AND IT STILL IS THE SAME.  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Been using it for years, it makes your hair really easy to manage and shines your hair without the greasy look. It&#x27;s hard to find this product in stores.</li>
            <li> The product I received was old stock, the viscosity was very watery rather than the normal pomade texture of this product.  Very disappointing!</li>
            <li> I have been using VO5 on my hair for 50 plus years. Many people ask if I color my hair and the answer I tell them is that I only apply a small amount of VO5 every time after I was my hair. I am 67 going on 68 and only have a few gray hairs. I love VO5.</li>
            <li> es lo mejor que hay para el cabello, no hay ningun producto similar a este, el cabello luce humedo todo el dia.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years, had problems finding it local anymore. A little goes a long way puts a nice shine on my hair and keeps it healthy. I put the product on when my hair is wet and also in between washing. My hair is dry and this product put a little oil back and also makes it feel soft. Works great.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my husband and he likes it a lot.  He has used it for years.  Glad to find on amazon.  It&#x27;s not always easy to find in stores, especially the jar.</li>
            <li> This is still one of my favorite hair dressings; I&#x27;ve used it since a teenager!  This, however, is the first time I&#x27;ve bought it in a jar, and I&#x27;ve discovered that it&#x27;s easier to use this way (and it&#x27;s more economical).  Great product.  Delivered on time, too.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a family member living in another state - he hadn&#x27;t been able to find this, his favorite hairdressing, for two years.  We decided to go check Amazon... He&#x27;s happy - I&#x27;m happy!  Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have been using Alberto VO5 Conditioning Hairdressing for years, have not been able to find anything better yet. Using it sparingly it will give my hair a natural shine without weighing it down.</li>
