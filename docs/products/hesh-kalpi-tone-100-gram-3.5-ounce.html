            <li>Great product can&#x27;t stand the smell</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t get over how great it smells</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>very very great product and works great love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve successfully \\&quot;dye\\&quot;</li>
            <li>, I decided to try some Ayurvedic powders to make sure that I was doing the best for my hair health.  </li>
            <li>Colors gray, smells good, just mix with water.</li>
            <li>I loved this product.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel really good.</li>
            <li>An Indian classmate at school turned me on to this &amp; she has gorgeous hair</li>
            <li>I love the product, get complements on my hair and no one believes I&#x27;m 50!</li>
            <li>love the indian powders!</li>
            <li>amazing.</li>
            <li>Being from Jamaica, I&#x27;m used to strong herbal smells, so I did not mind the spicy smell, but if you&#x27;re used to the fragrances of most popular hair products, then this product may offend your nose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying more soon.</li>
            <li>Most times I mix it with bentonite clay and aloe vera juice.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>So if you wish to keep your gray (as I do) I recommend skipping the Kalpi, to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li>(Think Lucille Ball in \\&quot;I Love</li>
            <li>If my results match those of Krissu&#x27;s mother, more luxuriant hair growth will follow.</li>
            <li>If my results match those of Krissu&#x27;s mother, more luxuriant hair growth will follow.</li>
            <li>If You Love It, It Will Grow &lt;/u</li>
            <li>so my hair is already healthy &amp; well-conditioned.</li>
            <li>Each way provides soft and beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine graying, light brown hair.</li>
            <li>For me best results are, wet the hair some and work the Hesh Kalpi Tone throughout the hair, leave it on for 25-30 minutes and wash out.</li>
            <li>First of all, Kalpi Tone has no added fragrance, it&#x27;s just natural herbs &amp; it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Following Krissu&#x27;s detailed instructions</li>
            <li>After coating and lightly massaging my scalp and extending the paste to the roots, I ran water over a bandana, lightly squeezed it out, and wrapped it around my hair 1940&#x27;s style.</li>
            <li>The other ingredients look very good.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re interested in restoring your hair to your original color, the Kalpi seems to be a healthy and natural approach to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair darker, healthy in shine and color, this is an all natural product.</li>
            <li>basically, if you&#x27;re trying to find a more natural route to dying your hair, this might be the product for you.</li>
            <li>Topping that with a shower cap keeps the paste moist, which I&#x27;m guessing is useful.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s economical, gets the oil out and also promotes silky hair.</li>
            <li>To be fair, my hair and scalp is already pretty healthy so the impact might be bigger on someone with dandruff or dry hair.</li>
            <li>It also felt very drying and gritty (kind of like mud/sand).</li>
            <li>I love this product, but my local Indian store does not carry it.</li>
            <li>the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>It made a pretty good paste, but applying it was pretty messy.</li>
            <li>Sounds like results vary, depending on what triggers hair loss in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see!on what triggers hair loss in the first</li>
            <li>After the first couple of weeks, I noticed a decrease in shedding.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s grown more than an inch in only 7 wks.!</li>
            <li>I mix this powder with my favorite non-silicone conditioner and some castor oil or a lighter oil and use that very messy but pleasantly spicy smelling concoction as a deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I am in a falling phase right now, or if the product needs an adptation period ,but I have to use at least 6 times over a 2 month or 3 month period to get fair results.</li>
            <li>You can leave it on for as long as you like (the longer the better) and wash off with water without shampoo.</li>
            <li>(I had some leftover pure Castor oil, so that&#x27;s what I used.)</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t see much change with my hair</li>
            <li>I wish the shipping charge wasnt as much.</li>
            <li>I like not having to mix separate powders and getting it together in one ready to use mixture.</li>
            <li>so you really have to give it a try to see if you like it or</li>
            <li>: To really see the effect on your hair, do it without any DC</li>
            <li>: To really see the effect on your hair, do it without any DC</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice that much of a difference after washing it out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think it made my roots darker.</li>
            <li>So I now rinse my hair out in a stainless steel sink.</li>
            <li>I went natural to have an easier time dealing with my hair, this wasn&#x27;t Worth the results.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really worry about it.)</li>
            <li>Quality herbal hair powder and the price is quite reasonable too</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m interested to learn whether this mixture stimulates growth of new hair.</li>
            <li>Not sure how effective this product is.....</li>
            <li>My hair definitely has a darker hue and is full.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely easier if you soak your hair completely in a bowl or a filled tub.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>But I have noticed fewer hairs in my comb &amp; brush after normal grooming (&amp; esp.</li>
            <li>Which means I&#x27;ll be back at the salon for a color touch-up sooner than usual, but that&#x27;s a fair trade for faster hair growth.</li>
            <li>My hair, which had been quite dull and dry, developed a lovely sheen and became very silky right away!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend if you are looking for natural tone.</li>
            <li>I have not had the opportunity to try it yet, however, I am new to using ayurvedic products for my natural hair...</li>
            <li>I was amazed how soft my hair became and</li>
            <li>, I am a natural and I was impress.</li>
            <li>Hesh Kalpi Tone works really well, only a couple of tablespoons are used with water or oil.</li>
            <li>(The powder definitely had a very earthy smell...</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft.</li>
            <li>so am thinking of getting Lush&#x27;s caca noir for that.</li>
            <li>It smells strongly of sandalwood (chandan), also very floral (due to the kapur kachri, which is ginger lily) with an earthy undertone (from other herbs).</li>
            <li>: -I have natural dark brown-raven black hair that takes on color very easily.</li>
            <li>When I used it for the first time,I thought my hair is very dry followed the wash</li>
            <li>When I used it for the first time,I thought my hair is very dry followed the wash</li>
            <li>Other than that my hair just felt dry and still had that strong smell stuck onto it.</li>
            <li>New hair is definitely growing!</li>
            <li>New hair is definitely growing!</li>
            <li>I did notice that my hair was very soft the day after using it, but the effect didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>I already have pretty dark hair</li>
            <li>I have used it twice so far and definitely notice a difference.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only way you can get all the herb bits out of your hair)Depend on the condition of your hair, you may want to follow up with a deep conditioning.&lt;br /&gt; - mix the powder with natural conditioner, a bit of oil (amla oil/ bhringaraj</li>
            <li>so my hair is a cross between typical pin straight Southeast Asian hair and Middle Eastern</li>

            <li> Colors gray, smells good, just mix with water. Make a thin paste of water and Hesh Kalpi Tone and apply on your hair, comb it through. You can leave it on for as long as you like (the longer the better) and wash off with water without shampoo.</li>
            <li> I use this once already but I didn&#x27;t see much change with my hair so I have to keep using this kalpi tone.</li>
            <li> I expected this powder to have a majorly noticeable effect, like the shine and bounce you get from henna without the color. I did notice that my hair was very soft the day after using it, but the effect didn&#x27;t last. To be fair, my hair and scalp is already pretty healthy so the impact might be bigger on someone with dandruff or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I did some reading about indian products. So I want to try it. I was amazed how soft my hair became and very&lt;br /&gt;soft , I am a natural and I was impress. I will include it my hair regimen always.</li>
            <li> Great product can&#x27;t stand the smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying more soon. This powder is wonderful and smells like sandalwood! I usually mix a tablespoon or two to various conconctions that I am preparing. Most times I mix it with bentonite clay and aloe vera juice. Other times I mix it with other powders with coconut milk. Makes my hair feel really good. Sometimes I mix it with my deep conditioner. Each way provides soft and beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> very very great product and works great love it!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure how effective this product is.....I don&#x27;t know if I am in a falling phase right now, or if the product needs an adptation period ,but I have to use at least 6 times over a 2 month or 3 month period to get fair results.</li>
            <li> I wish the shipping charge wasnt as much. I love this product, but my local Indian store does not carry it. I buy four at a time to save on shipping costs. I apply this once - twice a week and leave it on for atleast three hours. I like not having to mix separate powders and getting it together in one ready to use mixture. I have relatively short hair and one box lasts me four uses. Use it in a metal mixing container and prepare it atleast two hours before use (for the black color to appear - the mixture will change color when in water)</li>
            <li> Hesh Kalpi Tone works really well, only a couple of tablespoons are used with water or oil. For me best results are, wet the hair some and work the Hesh Kalpi Tone throughout the hair, leave it on for 25-30 minutes and wash out. It does have some grainy feel, so wash several times and condition. It leaves the hair darker, healthy in shine and color, this is an all natural product. It is a fine delicate powder, open the package slowly. I love the product, get complements on my hair and no one believes I&#x27;m 50! I highly recommend if you are looking for natural tone.</li>
            <li> +Scent: amazing. I could not stop smelling my hair (^0^). It smells strongly of sandalwood (chandan), also very floral (due to the kapur kachri, which is ginger lily) with an earthy undertone (from other herbs). but again, scent is a very objective thing so you really have to give it a try to see if you like it or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+How to use: There is 2 ways&lt;br /&gt; -makes into a paste (not to thick, think of a thin pudding consistency) with hot water or tea. Apply on water-washed hair (wash only with water, massage your scalp to cleanse off dirt)and leave on for at least 30 mins to 1hr. Rinse your hair thoroughly with cool/warm water by doing the mermaid soak (Trust me! That&#x27;s the only way you can get all the herb bits out of your hair)Depend on the condition of your hair, you may want to follow up with a deep conditioning.&lt;br /&gt; - mix the powder with natural conditioner, a bit of oil (amla oil/ bhringaraj oil/ argan oil/ etc) and some liquid. Apply on hair and put on a plastic cap. Let it sit for 30&#x27; to 1&#x27; for a deep conditioning treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+What I use for: controlling my psoriasis, peeling scalp. It does work. It relieves the itchy and \\&quot;tight\\&quot; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+How often: It&#x27;s addicting ^-^ I just can&#x27;t get over how great it smells lol. I will keep on using this hair pack, maybe with red rooibo/ rashberry tea or with some hibiscus powder to add some redish hightlight/ tinge to it. I&#x27;m used to my cherry chocolate henna hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+Background of my hair: -I have natural dark brown-raven black hair that takes on color very easily. I&#x27;ve successfully \\&quot;dye\\&quot; and  highlighted my own hair in the past into a medium dark brown with hazel highlight using honey/lemon juice in less then 4 days and then \\&quot;redye\\&quot; it again using black tea or other herb within 2 days. Just for fun.&lt;br /&gt;  - I&#x27;ve been henna my hair for about a year now, so it&#x27;s a dark cherry chocolate brown shade now, unless I&#x27;m experimenting with coloring my hair with herbal stuff again.&lt;br /&gt;  -Length: the tip of my hair is just above my hip.&lt;br /&gt;  -I&#x27;m mix so my hair is a cross between typical pin straight Southeast Asian hair and Middle Eastern hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+Color: This powder gives my hair a dark black tinge, like raven black, but again, my hair absorbs color ridiculously easy (read my hair background above)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+Tip: To really see the effect on your hair, do it without any DC the first time you use it. When I used it for the first time,I thought my hair is very dry followed the wash but when it&#x27;s a different story once it&#x27;s dried: very soft, shiny (and smells like heaven)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** One of the ingredients in Kalpi Tone is mandoor, which is iron oxide or in plain term, iron rust. So PLEASE be careful if you have chemically treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope I help!!!ength: the tip of my hair is just above my hip.&lt;br /&gt;  -I&#x27;m mix so my hair is a cross between typical pin straight Southeast Asian hair and Middle Eastern hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+Color: This powder gives my hair a dark black tinge, like raven black, but again, my hair absorbs color ridiculously easy (read my hair background above)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+Tip: To really see the effect on your hair, do it without any DC the first time you use it.

            <li> Love this. I definitely recommend it and this seller.  I will definitely be doing a lot of repeat business.</li>
            <li> Mmm I&#x27;m still not sure how I feel about this product. The amount that is in the box isn&#x27;t really enough for multiple applications if you have longer hair. I did what a lot of people recommended. I mixed the powder with a conditioner and a little bit of water. It made a pretty good paste, but applying it was pretty messy. It also felt very drying and gritty (kind of like mud/sand). I left this on a little over an hour. After when I was washing it out, it definitely was messy and extremely difficult. Trying to remove all the grittiness was a little bit of a pain. It&#x27;s definitely easier if you soak your hair completely in a bowl or a filled tub. I didn&#x27;t notice that much of a difference after washing it out. I already have pretty dark hair but my roots are slightly lighter than my dark/black ends. I don&#x27;t really think it made my roots darker. Maybe half a shade. Other than that my hair just felt dry and still had that strong smell stuck onto it. (The powder definitely had a very earthy smell...you either love it or hate it. I happen to not like it. )  basically, if you&#x27;re trying to find a more natural route to dying your hair, this might be the product for you. Just don&#x27;t expect immediate results. I may or may not try this again in the future.</li>
            <li> The stuff is great! love the indian powders! this is the best because it has all of them together!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended. I was inspired by Krissu&#x27;s and others&#x27; reviews on the Hesh Pharma Amla Hair Powder product page. So I bought Amla, Brahmi, and Kalpi, which I have used 3 times a week for 4 weeks. My hair, which had been quite dull and dry, developed a lovely sheen and became very silky right away! I have very fine graying, light brown hair. I do want to mention that although I did not prepare the Kalpi powder in a metal/cast iron container, I found that my hair has in fact lost its gray since using it. So if you wish to keep your gray (as I do) I recommend skipping the Kalpi, to be on the safe side. However, if you&#x27;re interested in restoring your hair to your original color, the Kalpi seems to be a healthy and natural approach to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following Krissu&#x27;s detailed instructions, I prepared a paste of the powders and a conditioner, to which I added oil. (I had some leftover pure Castor oil, so that&#x27;s what I used.) After coating and lightly massaging my scalp and extending the paste to the roots, I ran water over a bandana, lightly squeezed it out, and wrapped it around my hair 1940&#x27;s style. (Think Lucille Ball in \\&quot;I Love Lucy\\&quot; on housecleaning day.) Topping that with a shower cap keeps the paste moist, which I&#x27;m guessing is useful. I leave it on as long as possible, sometimes overnight. The difference in Krissu&#x27;s mother&#x27;s experience and mine re whether the Kalpi imparts a darker tone may be due to the length of time I left it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a mess to wash out, and if you have an old fiberglass tub, it can be hard to eradicate the stain. So I now rinse my hair out in a stainless steel sink. I sometimes use a paste of baking soda and water for the last shampoo - it&#x27;s economical, gets the oil out and also promotes silky hair. I then follow with a rinse of 1T vinegar and 2 cups water, or nettle tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m interested to learn whether this mixture stimulates growth of new hair. I&#x27;ll report back in a few months. Sounds like results vary, depending on what triggers hair loss in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now reporting back after a few months of using the products mentioned above. New hair is definitely growing! A small amount now. If my results match those of Krissu&#x27;s mother, more luxuriant hair growth will follow.

            <li> In fairness, I have only used this twice. It has not dyed any of my hair, at all. I leave it on for 4 hrs. It doesn&#x27;t tint, due a little bit, nothing. I have a few gray strands and it does nothing to them or my other hair. I will continue using it to see if it does and if it does, I WILL update ASAP. Also, this has done nothing for conditioning my hair either. It feels like putting mud in your hair and rinsing isn&#x27;t too big of a pain, but you MUST use conditioner after to get your hair comb-able. What&#x27;s the point of this stuff? If I have to use a conditioner anyway? I&#x27;m not buying into it yet, sorry. Beginning to wonder if other reviews are fake. I used it in combination with amla oil, Brahmi &amp; amla powders.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long and getting thinner. I am 31 and have gray strands. I am white/native american in descent. Today I decides not to put any product in my hair after rinsing it---and my hair doesn&#x27;t apper conditioned at all. It looks a bit stripped. I will update if, over time, this product does goo things to my hair. For now, it&#x27;s a dud.</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft. I can feel that my hair was getting nourishment. Also I noticed after a couple use-i use it every weekend with my deep conditioner, that my gray hair in the front of my head, were less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I hated the smell of this, i smelled like a curry house! Anyway i applied it on my head in sections and covered my head using cling film topped with a shower cap. i let it sit in y head for an hour and a half then the drama begun. the washing process SUCKED! I&#x27;ve done henna treatments and they are messy but this topped it! I washed and washed and washed til i couldn&#x27;t wash anymore. Two shampoos later and half a bottle of conditioner and a lot of scrubbing and rinsing to get the grit out. while i was styling my hair i noticed i still had grit on my fingers! The results? My hair was softer like i had deep conditioned and slightly darker. Other than that am not planning on repeating the experience! I went natural to have an easier time dealing with my hair, this wasn&#x27;t Worth the results. I like the darker tint so am thinking of getting Lush&#x27;s caca noir for that. This isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the curly girl method does not provide enough moisture for my tightly-coiled African-textured 3c hair.  After reading Dr. Phoenyx Austin&#x27;s &lt;u&gt; If You Love It, It Will Grow &lt;/u&gt;, I decided to try some Ayurvedic powders to make sure that I was doing the best for my hair health.  I mix this powder with my favorite non-silicone conditioner and some castor oil or a lighter oil and use that very messy but pleasantly spicy smelling concoction as a deep conditioner.  Being from Jamaica, I&#x27;m used to strong herbal smells, so I did not mind the spicy smell, but if you&#x27;re used to the fragrances of most popular hair products, then this product may offend your nose.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t realize that this product has metal oxides and I prefer not to use that in my hair. The other ingredients look very good.</li>
            <li> An Indian classmate at school turned me on to this &amp; she has gorgeous hair so I decided to try it. First of all, Kalpi Tone has no added fragrance, it&#x27;s just natural herbs &amp; it smells wonderful! However, I didn&#x27;t follow the directions on the box. About 7 wks ago I made a hair-growth oil by simmering Kalpi Tone in coconut oil for 3 days (in a crock pot), then filtering the mixture to remove the herbs. I apply a small amt. of the infused oil to my scalp 3x then give myself a godo massage. After the first couple of weeks, I noticed a decrease in shedding. (I&#x27;ve always shed a lot, but less than the 100-hairs-per-day range, which is considered average. I still have lotsa hair so I don&#x27;t really worry about it.) But I have noticed fewer hairs in my comb &amp; brush after normal grooming (&amp; esp. after shampooing). I&#x27;ve used coconut oil for years so my hair is already healthy &amp; well-conditioned. But it&#x27;s grown more than an inch in only 7 wks.! (Half an inch per month is considered &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; growth rate.) Which means I&#x27;ll be back at the salon for a color touch-up sooner than usual, but that&#x27;s a fair trade for faster hair growth. This stuff works!</li>
            <li> Quality herbal hair powder and the price is quite reasonable too but i sourced a vendor who sells organic Henna powder and other herbal powders for way cheaper.</li>
            <li> Simply put it does what it says.  I have used it twice so far and definitely notice a difference. My hair definitely has a darker hue and is full.</li>
            <li> This product was received in the time promised and in mint condition...I have not had the opportunity to try it yet, however, I am new to using ayurvedic products for my natural hair...update is forthcoming.</li>
