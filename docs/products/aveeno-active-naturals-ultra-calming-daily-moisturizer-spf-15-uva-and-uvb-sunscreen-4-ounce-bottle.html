            <li>I find myself going, hey, I&#x27;m not feeling so flushed and stuff, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>Great product...</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for a year with great results!  </li>
            <li>This lotion feels good.  </li>
            <li>It is light yet creamy, and does an awesome job at evening out skin tone.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer alone is great, but when I paired with with the facewash it was even better.</li>
            <li>I have used this stuff for years and LOVE it!</li>
            <li>It is amazing what a difference this moisturizer makes for me.  </li>
            <li>It feels really nice</li>
            <li>Nice moisturizer and it does as advertised and&lt;br /&gt;calms</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing moisturizer ever made.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes well without being overpowering and the scent is very light which I like.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>and I just love it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been quite satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I love Aveeno products.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve started using this I&#x27;m not seeing so many flareups.</li>
            <li>I now use it on a daily basis to keep my skin perfectly moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t perfect of course, I still have some rosiness, but I&#x27;m also only using it once a day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the longer</li>
            <li>and I love the calming effect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve most recently tried Mary Kay, thinking that the expense would make it a great product.</li>
            <li>I use Aveeno&#x27;s Overnight cream at night instead of this because my face needs the extra moisturizing power, but I love this for the day, the 15 SPF is also really great.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving it a try if you&#x27;re looking for a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I realize that this product will not work for everyone, and certainly those of us with the most sensitive skin are probably going to be the most apt to try it -- hence why there are more people than</li>
            <li>But Aveeno leaves my skin so smooth, and relieves the redness from my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and effective.</li>
            <li>I personally find that when I use this product regularly along with Aveeno&#x27;s positively ageless exfoliating cleanser and a really nice foundation, people see me and go on and on about how flawless my skin is.  </li>
            <li>I would then put on moisturizer and my face would hurt even more because the moisturizer stung so much.</li>
            <li>My skin breaks out to most moisturizers (even ones that are for sensitive skin and perfume free.)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works for other skin types but my skin type does not fall into the &#x27;dry&#x27; or &#x27;oily&#x27; categories, which is what most moisturizers are designed for, and it works perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase Aveeno as long as it feels good</li>
            <li>Before using Aveeno I would have to use a tinted moisturizer to create super smooth looking skin, but now that I use Aveeno I can skip the second layer :)</li>
            <li>just helps to calm the redness and burning sensations.</li>
            <li>For people who cannot tolerate daily exfoliating, the foaming cleanser is nice</li>
            <li>For the first time there was no redness or stinging with an SPF product and my mild rosacea noticeably lightened.  </li>
            <li>A couple of months later, the bottle still sits prominently on my counter suckering me in with the words \\&quot;ultra calming\\&quot;</li>
            <li>it just leaves my face soft and smooth.      </li>
            <li>On the other hand, for those of us for whom it works, it works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>It completely soothes my skin, makes it feel incredibly cool, smooth, soft, without having an oily or greasy look or feel.  </li>
            <li>I had tried other aveeno products before and have liked them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched from clean and clear to this</li>
            <li>It will reduce redness for the most part, it will make your dry skin softer, and all round it just feel good to have it on your face.  </li>
            <li>Update: after finishing my regular facewash, I decided to try the ultra calming facewash and it really helped reduce the redness in my face even more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many over the years, but every time I stray (ie find a product that seems like it would be fantastic), my face hates me the next day... and shows it with a gross break out.</li>
            <li>so I can get red blotchy easily.</li>
            <li>I have written Aveeno praising them for creating such a fine</li>
            <li>Most daily facial lotions with SPF are too greasy or have a distinct odor (that I DON&#x27;T like).</li>
            <li>and if I were to use it twice a day it would really help with the redness of my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have skin that tends to flush red easily, and it&#x27;s on the sensitive side.</li>
            <li>Aveeno, please notify me if this line is ever going to be discontinued so I can rent a warehouse and stock it full of this stuff to last the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>-- my face felt as if I had started working in a fast food restaurant, then had to walk home through a desert sandstorm every day to give some idea of what my skin is like normally.  </li>
            <li>I cannot live without it!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much, and usually not at all.</li>
            <li>It only stings mildly on very sensitive and super dry areas, but is otherwise pain free.</li>
            <li>Only took me 15 years to find the right face products.</li>
            <li>It does feel cool when I apply it, but it really hasn&#x27;t helped all that much, however, for the casual customer who doesn&#x27;t have a major health problem it should make your skin feel better...</li>
            <li>When I had tried other facial moisturizers with SPF (all of them for sensitive skin), within 2 or 3 days my face would be bright red</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even consider my skin to be sensitive, either!</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just that my skin has absorbed the acne treatment (Acne.org benzoyl peroxide) and refuses to absorb anything else, but other than that small problem, I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product in combination w/ Aveeno Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser for a couple of years</li>
            <li>With my skin being so sensitive to break outs and feeling</li>
            <li>I would describe my skin as moderately sensitive (I do get some redness with the cleanser)</li>
            <li>After a shower my face would be completely inflamed</li>
            <li>This made my skin feel soft and wasn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to almost every face lotion out there.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin, so I am careful to choose a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Actually, my skin became so enflamed with another sensitive skin lotion that a co-worker asked me if I had gotten a glycolic face peel!  </li>
            <li>and it makes my face very, very dry, and also very irritable.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry, sensitive skin, particularly to any product with SPF, and went through a long list of sensitive skin moisturizers before I stumbled upon Aveeno Ultra-Calming.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would calm the burning...or at least not add to it.</li>

            <li> \\&quot;I take it back, your skin is so dry and flaky that you probably should exfoliate and moisturize every day.\\</li>
            <li> I am having regular microdermabrasion treatments to help revive the skin that the other moisturizers ruined and left scarred.</li>
            <li> However, it stung my eyes and made them water all day long.</li>

            <li> I have really bad combination skin -- in addition to being very red/pink all the time, it is also very oily in some places, but extremely dry in others...</li>
            <li> I tried it for a few days initially and then had to move on to something else.</li>
            <li> and in the past I would constantly swing between dry skin and breakouts.</li>
            <li> It also works to reduce the redness and my face looks a little less red through out the day as well.</li>
            <li> I have extreme rosaeca and acne.  </li>
            <li> I use just one pump; it takes verrry long for it to absorb, and usually I have to pat off whats not absorbed.</li>
            <li> It stopped the irritation, the itching, and even helped tone down the redness.  </li>
            <li> typical saying they&#x27;ve had allergic reactions to this product.  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s little chance aveeno could do anything about that and still have a product that works.  </li>
            <li> I had a bad interaction with the sun and a new facial product that I had tried.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m a pale redhead</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I am left with some acne scars on my face from years of using and trying the wrong products, I&#x27;d like to say BRAVO to Aveeno for making this one.</li>
            <li> I have tried some of the expensive department store moisturizers and this works just as well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this did NOT do it.</li>
            <li> It stung when I applied the moisturizer to my uncomfortably irritated skin and the redness and inflammation increased.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately, this moisturizer, for me, is anything but calming.</li>
            <li> After all, the price range isn&#x27;t bad ...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d have a painful burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> where I could not use it because of a medication and it was awful</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin, so I am careful to choose a moisturizer. Most daily facial lotions with SPF are too greasy or have a distinct odor (that I DON&#x27;T like). But Aveeno leaves my skin so smooth, and relieves the redness from my cheeks and chin. Before using Aveeno I would have to use a tinted moisturizer to create super smooth looking skin, but now that I use Aveeno I can skip the second layer :) I use this along with the Ultra Calming night creme.</li>
            <li> I use just one pump; it takes verrry long for it to absorb, and usually I have to pat off whats not absorbed. So I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just that my skin has absorbed the acne treatment (Acne.org benzoyl peroxide) and refuses to absorb anything else, but other than that small problem, I love this moisturizer. Very soothing and effective.</li>
            <li> love this product. this the only moisturizer that does not make me break out after i tried almost every product in the market. Thank you Aveeno please don&#x27;t stop making it . i wish they had a night cream from the same line...</li>
            <li> I have extreme rosaeca and acne.  I received a sample of this lotion from my derm dr and I just love it.  With my skin being so sensitive to break outs and feeling like I have wind burn, this stuff soothes and calms just like it says.  It feels really nice and I don&#x27;t break out with it!  It does not cure the rosaeca or acne just helps to calm the redness and burning sensations.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for years and LOVE it! I&#x27;ve tried many over the years, but every time I stray (ie find a product that seems like it would be fantastic), my face hates me the next day... and shows it with a gross break out. I don&#x27;t even consider my skin to be sensitive, either! I&#x27;ve most recently tried Mary Kay, thinking that the expense would make it a great product. Nope. I broke out like I was 16! I&#x27;m done with straying. This stuff is amaaaazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product in combination w/ Aveeno Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser for a couple of years and I&#x27;ve been quite satisfied with the results. I would describe my skin as moderately sensitive (I do get some redness with the cleanser) and in the past I would constantly swing between dry skin and breakouts. I find that this moisturizer has been just the thing to keep my skin balanced.</li>
            <li> I love Aveeno products. And when I saw they had an ultra calming moisturizer, I had to try it. After all, the price range isn&#x27;t bad ... I have skin that tends to flush red easily, and it&#x27;s on the sensitive side. Since I&#x27;ve started using this I&#x27;m not seeing so many flareups. I find myself going, hey, I&#x27;m not feeling so flushed and stuff, so I&#x27;m happy. Plus there&#x27;s no strong scent, and it feels really gentle, it&#x27;s not sticky or goopy, so I am very happy. And you get a bit of sun protection, to boot.</li>
            <li> I have tried some of the expensive department store moisturizers and this works just as well.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist said everyone should put sunscreen on their face and hands each day.  This is a wonderful moisturizer and sunscreen combined, and being a gardener, it seems to be very effective. It is also recommended in an article in WEB MD magazine.</li>
            <li> I bought this one of the last times my face went through one of its catastrophic episodes. My face was red, irritated, and burning. I was looking for something that would calm the burning...or at least not add to it. Second to that objective was moisturization and diminishing of redness. Unfortunately this did NOT do it. It stung when I applied the moisturizer to my uncomfortably irritated skin and the redness and inflammation increased. I tried it for a few days initially and then had to move on to something else. My face is not usually dry but during these episodes it gets painfully dry. I did not find that the Aveeno Ultra-Calming moisturizer helped soothe the dryness either.     A couple of months later, the bottle still sits prominently on my counter suckering me in with the words \\&quot;ultra calming\\&quot; and I give it another go. But unfortunately, this moisturizer, for me, is anything but calming.</li>
            <li> I had a bad interaction with the sun and a new facial product that I had tried.  This lotion was my saving grace.  It stopped the irritation, the itching, and even helped tone down the redness.  I now use it on a daily basis to keep my skin perfectly moisturized.  I don&#x27;t know how it works for other skin types but my skin type does not fall into the &#x27;dry&#x27; or &#x27;oily&#x27; categories, which is what most moisturizers are designed for, and it works perfectly for me.  It&#x27;s not greasy or oily... it just leaves my face soft and smooth.      Update: after finishing my regular facewash, I decided to try the ultra calming facewash and it really helped reduce the redness in my face even more.  The moisturizer alone is great, but when I paired with with the facewash it was even better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week, and only once a day. I&#x27;m using Retin A and it makes my face very, very dry, and also very irritable. After a shower my face would be completely inflamed and I&#x27;d be as red as a cherry. I would then put on moisturizer and my face would hurt even more because the moisturizer stung so much. I then discovered this item and decided to order it because I&#x27;d had enough of my face hurting all the time.     I really love it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt nearly as much, and usually not at all. It only stings mildly on very sensitive and super dry areas, but is otherwise pain free. It also works to reduce the redness and my face looks a little less red through out the day as well. It isn&#x27;t perfect of course, I still have some rosiness, but I&#x27;m also only using it once a day. I&#x27;m sure the longer I use it and if I were to use it twice a day it would really help with the redness of my cheeks. I use Aveeno&#x27;s Overnight cream at night instead of this because my face needs the extra moisturizing power, but I love this for the day, the 15 SPF is also really great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched from clean and clear to this and I love the calming effect. Since starting to use it my face isn&#x27;t as blotchy. And I&#x27;m a pale redhead so I can get red blotchy easily.</li>
            <li> Great product...non greasy and calms skin redness just does what it says...Both hubby and I only use this...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the feeling I have when I apply moisturizer, make-up or sunscreen.  This lotion feels good.  I will continue to purchase Aveeno as long as it feels good and I can afford it.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I have written Aveeno praising them for creating such a fine product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have numerous autoimmune conditions and am allergic to everything. My skin breaks out to most moisturizers (even ones that are for sensitive skin and perfume free.) BUT, not to this product. The \\&quot;Ultra Calming\\&quot; is the only line I have ever found that my skin can tolerate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I am left with some acne scars on my face from years of using and trying the wrong products, I&#x27;d like to say BRAVO to Aveeno for making this one. I am having regular microdermabrasion treatments to help revive the skin that the other moisturizers ruined and left scarred. Aveeno, please notify me if this line is ever going to be discontinued so I can rent a warehouse and stock it full of this stuff to last the rest of my life. I cannot live without it! Only took me 15 years to find the right face products.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist urged me to find a moisturizer with SPF to protect my skin from the sun.  I have extremely dry, sensitive skin, particularly to any product with SPF, and went through a long list of sensitive skin moisturizers before I stumbled upon Aveeno Ultra-Calming.  When I had tried other facial moisturizers with SPF (all of them for sensitive skin), within 2 or 3 days my face would be bright red and I&#x27;d have a painful burning sensation.  Actually, my skin became so enflamed with another sensitive skin lotion that a co-worker asked me if I had gotten a glycolic face peel!  After reading the reviews in Amazon regarding Aveeno Ultra-Calming, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  For the first time there was no redness or stinging with an SPF product and my mild rosacea noticeably lightened.  I love this product and have been using it for a year with great results!  Thank you, Aveeno.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing moisturizer ever made.  It is light yet creamy, and does an awesome job at evening out skin tone.</li>
            <li> This made my skin feel soft and wasn&#x27;t greasy. However, it stung my eyes and made them water all day long. I am returning it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was diagnosed with Rosacea.  I thought this calming lotion would alleviate the reddness of my cheeks.  It does feel cool when I apply it, but it really hasn&#x27;t helped all that much, however, for the casual customer who doesn&#x27;t have a major health problem it should make your skin feel better...</li>
            <li> I have really bad combination skin -- in addition to being very red/pink all the time, it is also very oily in some places, but extremely dry in others... so dry that a person giving me a facial once balked initially when I said that I exfoliate every day, but by the end of the facial said, \\&quot;I take it back, your skin is so dry and flaky that you probably should exfoliate and moisturize every day.\\&quot;  I personally find that when I use this product regularly along with Aveeno&#x27;s positively ageless exfoliating cleanser and a really nice foundation, people see me and go on and on about how flawless my skin is.  It is amazing what a difference this moisturizer makes for me.  For people who cannot tolerate daily exfoliating, the foaming cleanser is nice -- I sometimes use that if I have a breakout, or feel I need the extra washing without the exfoliating, but I never stray from using this lotion -- for me it has been heaven sent.  It completely soothes my skin, makes it feel incredibly cool, smooth, soft, without having an oily or greasy look or feel.  I went through a stretch recently where I could not use it because of a medication and it was awful -- my face felt as if I had started working in a fast food restaurant, then had to walk home through a desert sandstorm every day to give some idea of what my skin is like normally.  To go from that to having people compliment me on my \\&quot;flawless complexion\\&quot;, I can&#x27;t help but give this product the highest reviews.     I realize that this product will not work for everyone, and certainly those of us with the most sensitive skin are probably going to be the most apt to try it -- hence why there are more people than typical saying they&#x27;ve had allergic reactions to this product.  But I would venture to guess that those people have allergic reactions to almost everything and there&#x27;s little chance aveeno could do anything about that and still have a product that works.  On the other hand, for those of us for whom it works, it works amazingly well.  It will reduce redness for the most part, it will make your dry skin softer, and all round it just feel good to have it on your face.  I highly recommend giving it a try if you&#x27;re looking for a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> buy it all the time great stuff!</li>
            <li> I use this every day after shaving and it soothes my skin.  I am sensitive to almost every face lotion out there.  Amazon has the best price.  A bottle sells for $18 at the drug store.</li>
            <li> I had tried other aveeno products before and have liked them. I found this and thought to try it. It moisturizes well without being overpowering and the scent is very light which I like.</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer and it does as advertised and&lt;br /&gt;calms down the red in my skin.  Would recommend&lt;br /&gt;and purchase again.</li>
