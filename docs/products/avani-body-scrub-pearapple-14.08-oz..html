            <li>It is a bit oily, but for the money, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It does a good job, but requires cleaning up after use.</li>
            <li>I would buy this product and give it as a gift to all of my friends and feel good about what I was giving.</li>

            <li>I know they would want to know where I got it once they used it so they could buy their own.</li>
            <li>This body scrub has a very nice light scent.</li>
            <li>i am thrilled and am going to order more</li>
            <li>The pear/apple smells wonderful and leaves your skin hydrated and soft for hours.  </li>
            <li>My skin has a nice sheen to it afterwards making it look more youthful with a glow.</li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>When I first use it, it works great</li>
            <li>This product is GREAT if you want to feel like you just stepped out of a high class spa!!  </li>
            <li>ive tried every scrub i could find over the last 12 years and this one is the best there</li>
            <li>Love the feel of it on;my</li>
            <li>I wish I would have bought more.</li>
            <li>I still love it.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>but it sure does hide a multitude of sins---</li>
            <li>Try it and you will love it too</li>
            <li>Very mild odor.</li>
            <li>so i can have jars for gifts available..</li>
            <li>I used it first on my arms, hands, and elbows because they were so dry, and it&#x27;s marvelous.</li>
            <li>it smelled nice but the oil to salt ratio was too high</li>
            <li>if you like a litte more oil and a better product for the same price then De Jevu and is far superior</li>
            <li>I love this body scrub so much I use it 3 times a week instead of every 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super effective and leaves my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>sea dry scrub far more superior and would get.  </li>
            <li>It really is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I usually shop at bath and body works, but this stuff far surpasses even their best lines!</li>
            <li>I use a warm wet washcloth in the shower so as not to get the product all over the bottom of the shower and make it slippery.</li>
            <li>YOu almost have to pour some of teh excess oil off the top when you open it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>I love scrubs and use them daily.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t one of those super, creamy, highly processed products.</li>
            <li>Waste of money - some fine salt with mostly oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>In the past I have used different brands of body scrubs and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>thanks .</li>
            <li>is!!!!.leaves the most rough patches of skin feeling like baby skin</li>
            <li>and this product helps so much.  </li>
            <li>It smells like candy ... not exactly the &#x27;refreshing&#x27; scent one would look for in a body scrub.  </li>
            <li>The order processed quickly and it arrived on my doorstep much sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li>The smell of this stuff is awesome -- and I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells and normally hate scented products</li>
            <li>leaving only the grit which is very abrassive without the oil.</li>
            <li>No irritation, and so soft.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and moisturized for days after using.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a salt scrub soaked in natural oils.</li>
            <li>other one is fine only one of the items was damaged..</li>
            <li>---so be super careful not to fall!!!  </li>
            <li>Apparently it works well with the Avani Body Butter as well.</li>
            <li>I learned this the hard way: I had forgotten that my kitty had mildly scratched me</li>
            <li>Result: pure agony for a few seconds.</li>

            <li> Result: pure agony for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I have bought 10 jars of it and I will continue to buy it, especially now that it is dry skin season.  </li>
            <li> It not only makes your skin soft, but it DOES remove the dead skin on the surface, unlike a lot of products that say they do but don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave the skin dry at all, in fact, the oil the salts are in stays on the skin long enough to absorb, yet it&#x27;s not real sticky like some scrubs are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to use it on my dry legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed it does tend to dry out you skin after prolonged</li>
            <li> but after about 30 mins my hands are dry all over again.</li>
            <li> My favorite dead sea scrub is Savon but its expensive.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> , I spent longer getting the off me than I spent using the scrub.</li>
            <li> our water--even with a filter is so harsh here---I can sometimes actually smell bleach in the tap water!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely greasy and runny.</li>
            <li> If also makes the shower extremely slippery.</li>
            <li> But be careful using this on cracked skin; it&#x27;ll burn the hell out of you!</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The smell is yummy, but I will not buy this again due to the heavy oil they use in it.</li>
            <li> i had ordered this previously.</li>
            <li> long winded as usual!  </li>
            <li> This product takes a little orientation before using.</li>
            <li> not sure why</li>
            <li> ---I should not admit--being a redhead who tans is a dangerous thing to do...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s downright awful -- I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> The oil they use is horribly greasy and does not wash off.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> i had ordered this previously. this one came damaged to my home cracked so all of the oil inside is gone. leaving only the grit which is very abrassive without the oil. this is second report of this damaged item. please advise. thanks . other one is fine only one of the items was damaged.. not sure why</li>
            <li> it smelled nice but the oil to salt ratio was too high, I spent longer getting the off me than I spent using the scrub.</li>
            <li> This product takes a little orientation before using. It does a good job, but requires cleaning up after use.</li>
            <li> This scrub rocks. There&#x27;s actually no need for the body butter that I got to go along with this. It doesn&#x27;t leave the skin dry at all, in fact, the oil the salts are in stays on the skin long enough to absorb, yet it&#x27;s not real sticky like some scrubs are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to use it on my dry legs. I used it first on my arms, hands, and elbows because they were so dry, and it&#x27;s marvelous. No irritation, and so soft. Just love it!</li>
            <li> ive tried every scrub i could find over the last 12 years and this one is the best there is!!!!.leaves the most rough patches of skin feeling like baby skin..could not find it in the malls-looked even when i traveled-and finally found it on amazon.com...the ad said it would arrive in 2 months and it came in 2 weeks..i am thrilled and am going to order more so i can have jars for gifts available..my skin never felt so good!</li>
            <li> It smells like candy ... not exactly the &#x27;refreshing&#x27; scent one would look for in a body scrub.  It&#x27;s downright awful -- I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> This body scrub has a very nice light scent. A small amount goes a long way. My skin is so soft and moisturized for days after using. I use a warm wet washcloth in the shower so as not to get the product all over the bottom of the shower and make it slippery. Works great!!!</li>
            <li> Waste of money - some fine salt with mostly oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the price range.....&lt;br /&gt;dead sea dry scrub far more superior and would get.  if you like a litte more oil and a better product for the same price then De Jevu and is far superior</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Love the feel of it on;my skin and how my skin feels after I use it.  Very mild odor.</li>
            <li> I like this scrub. Smells great. It is a bit oily, but for the money, it&#x27;s great. My favorite dead sea scrub is Savon but its expensive.</li>
            <li> as a gift for someone else. She told me it has been some of the best scrub she&#x27;s ever used and I&#x27;ve even heard her friends say they are jealous she has this and they don&#x27;t. Apparently it works well with the Avani Body Butter as well.</li>
            <li> The Avani Mineral Body Scrub is excellent.  I have very dry skin and this product helps so much.  I recommend the pear/apple over the citrus/vanilla.  The citrus/vanilla makes you smell like you are wearing Pledge.  The pear/apple smells wonderful and leaves your skin hydrated and soft for hours.  I have bought 10 jars of it and I will continue to buy it, especially now that it is dry skin season.  It really is worth every penny.  Their body butter is great too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed it does tend to dry out you skin after prolonged usage(no I don&#x27;t use it every day). YOu almost have to pour some of teh excess oil off the top when you open it. It&#x27;s extremely greasy and runny. When I first use it, it works great and I apply the body butter almost immediately after, but after about 30 mins my hands are dry all over again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stuff! I usually shop at bath and body works, but this stuff far surpasses even their best lines! The fragrance is exhilarating - I just love it! The way it makes my skin feel afterwards is like stepping out a spa for a 1% of the price. I wish I would have bought more. I hope Amazon continues to carry this line, especially the body scrub. It not only makes your skin soft, but it DOES remove the dead skin on the surface, unlike a lot of products that say they do but don&#x27;t. My skin has a nice sheen to it afterwards making it look more youthful with a glow. I bought some for my daughter for x-mas as well in the milk n honey.</li>
            <li> The oil they use is horribly greasy and does not wash off. If also makes the shower extremely slippery. The smell is yummy, but I will not buy this again due to the heavy oil they use in it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It isn&#x27;t one of those super, creamy, highly processed products. It&#x27;s just a salt scrub soaked in natural oils. It&#x27;s super effective and leaves my skin soft and moisturized. But be careful using this on cracked skin; it&#x27;ll burn the hell out of you! I learned this the hard way: I had forgotten that my kitty had mildly scratched me and I used this scrub in the shower. Result: pure agony for a few seconds. Can&#x27;t blame the product though! I still love it.</li>
            <li> In the past I have used different brands of body scrubs and this is by far the best. The order processed quickly and it arrived on my doorstep much sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> wife very happy with product</li>
            <li> This product smells just like what it says it smells like. Love the product. I gave it a 4/5 though because I was expecting it to be well mixed. However I do understand that things do settle. Give it a quick stir before using it and it&#x27;s wonderful. Leaves skin very soft.</li>
            <li> The smell of this stuff is awesome -- and I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells and normally hate scented products but if I could just by the scent, I would!</li>
            <li> Great scrub!!!  Thanks!  I love scrubs and use them daily.  I have to change to sugar scrub in the winter---our water--even with a filter is so harsh here---I can sometimes actually smell bleach in the tap water!  The tub does get slippery---so be super careful not to fall!!!  Scrubs are a skin-saver for me--I&#x27;ve been an outdoor sun lover all my life.  Running, swimming, tennis,horse back riding---sunning too ---I should not admit--being a redhead who tans is a dangerous thing to do...but it sure does hide a multitude of sins---well flaws.......long winded as usual!  Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel like a baby&#x27;s but!!!  I have some weird skin and have tried many products but this one is perfect for all skin types and makes you feel clean and new!&lt;br /&gt;MIFF</li>
            <li> I love this body scrub so much I use it 3 times a week instead of every 2 weeks.  Try it and you will love it too</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT if you want to feel like you just stepped out of a high class spa!!  It makes your skin feel so soft and smooth, you feel like a milliion bucks! I would buy this product and give it as a gift to all of my friends and feel good about what I was giving. I know they would want to know where I got it once they used it so they could buy their own.</li>
