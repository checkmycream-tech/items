            <li> amazing. love this product.</li>
            <li> I love these products. I use this plus Enlighten on problem areas. I have seen results in about 3 weeks. My skin looks softer and rosier and my spots are beginning to fade slightly.  The prices here are so much better than in a salon. I will definitely continue to use these products - they are worth the extra cost!</li>
            <li> Made my skin dry. Went through whole bottle and noticed no change to my skin. Save your money.</li>
            <li> This product cleared my skin in less than a week.  acne scars, age spots, fine lines all improved.  After a month, I dont even wear face makeup anymore.  I know its expensive but it is worth every penny</li>
            <li> I truly like this product unlike all the others I have tried.  I feel the ingredients which comes out as a serum it more effective on your skin. Since I have been using it I like the way my skin feels and looks.  The OSMOSIS product line surpasses over other products for skin.</li>
            <li> I have bought every product known to man... I came across a lady that sells Osmosis and I bought a trial pack.  My skin began to look better within days.  It has been almost 3 weeks now and I can honestly say my skin has never looked better. I just turned 50 and this product, has far exceeded my expectations.  I use the purify exfoliating cleanser, the correct, the stem factor and the Quench Plus.  It all goes a long way and I have only continued to notice improvement in the texture of my skin.  The tightness, smaller pores and overall glow.  I have had coworkers remark at how great my skin looks...</li>
            <li> This product is absolution to skin hydrations. It really does work! Clean and remove your makeup everyday with a mild soap or makeup removal wipes. Use a toner, then apply this product. Your face feels softer and lighter. Try it after a week you can visibility see  results.</li>
            <li> love it , love it, love it!</li>
            <li> Good product . You use this with other osmosis products.</li>
            <li> Great product for your face!!!! Will buy again</li>
            <li> I have just started using Osmosis and I already know any thing Dr. Johnson produces is great! All I know right now is that my skin feels and looks better, more supple and nourished. It feels great going on my skin too!</li>
            <li> Love the product. Fast delivery.</li>
