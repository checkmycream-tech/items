    <ol>
            <li>What a great product!!</li>
            <li>I have been using \\&quot;nailtek 2\\&quot; which works wonderful but</li>
            <li>this had been a the best thing yet.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the product and seller.</li>
            <li>As a top-coat, it is marvelous.</li>
            <li>I have the best luck with an Acetone remover.</li>
            <li>My nails look great!</li>
            <li>It looked real nice</li>
            <li>I have not yet experienced any bubbles or &amp;#34;stringy-ness&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>100% GREAT</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!!  </li>
            <li>I think this is a good product and works well for me.</li>
            <li>(One good thing about acetone:  </li>
            <li>It strengthens your nails good.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not as good as this at 34 W..</li>
            <li>so I have used my fair share of polishes.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t even on my nails a good 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I did get a good deal on it</li>
            <li>and it looks good on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for the price-</li>
            <li>When I realized my mistake I tried it anyway with good results.</li>
            <li>For those of you looking for a great top coat: Seche Vite.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!!</li>
            <li>For the love of god, don&#x27;t shake it!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>this is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff really is amazing once u figure out to get it to work</li>
            <li>The shine is really nice</li>
            <li>I also suggest a really good top coat.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I bought this without reading any reviews.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product it helps give your nail strength and protects.</li>
            <li>I just got engaged and needed to make my nails look nice...</li>
            <li>I am surprised many times having removed it to find the nail perfect as before.  </li>
            <li>But after even 20 mins mine were still all gooey to the touch, and that was applying a very light coat.  </li>
            <li>It puts a layer of protectant on top of the nail therefore making the nail stronger.</li>
            <li>I love that it makes my manicure go the distance.</li>
            <li>I have ok nails</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;ve used it on top of nail polish, it smudges the nail polish.</li>
            <li>However, for someone who is more into their polishes, I can see how it would be a pain.</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m okay with reapplying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I applied another coat on top and finished it with my Seche Vite from Sallys.  </li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li>It does smooth out your nails and make them feel stronger so that your color goes on nicely and evenly.</li>
            <li>Since this turned into a longer nail job, I decided to put some color and top coat over the HAW.  </li>
            <li>LOVE EET!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Usually I love Sally Hanson products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m personally not too concerned about the bubbling because I care more about not having my nails break than having them flawlessly shiny.</li>
            <li>becauase i love the way it makes my nail polish look...</li>
            <li>It hardens your nail quickly and beautifully (with the right technique).</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>I ended up removing it and reapplied a much thinner coat, the results were amazing!</li>
            <li>I LOVE how strong this polish is.</li>
            <li>it peels off really easy ( after just one day) and it did more damage to my nails.</li>
            <li>Dries surprisingly fast and gives a great smooth glossy finish.</li>
            <li>Didnt feel much difference, Seller good.</li>
            <li>I use this both under nailpolish &amp; also on top of nailpolish to smooth out the texture of gritty glitter polish (it does this beautifully).</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t bite them as easily.</li>
            <li>I would rate this as 5-star if it were easy to remove.</li>
            <li>the drying time was very quick.</li>
            <li>It helps strengthen my nails so they don&#x27;t bend or chip as easily</li>
            <li>Well ... not so easy.</li>
            <li>at first i was in love with it.. went on so smooth, made my nail polish VERY smooth and gel-like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine though I like having to do them over.</li>
            <li>It works just fine.</li>
            <li>If the nails are not matte after that, I lightly buff with a fine</li>
            <li>And when I started reading the reviews, I thought I made a huge mistake.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great, if you only use one coat.</li>
            <li>I have used it like 3 or 4 times already and upon putting it on my nail it does not go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I do not use a UV light</li>
            <li>By the time I switched hands I could get it bubble and streak free.</li>
            <li>and I noticed a significant difference in the hardness of my nails</li>
            <li>my original nails are not getting stronger.</li>
            <li>It is SUPER shiny and lovely if you get it right.</li>
            <li>I will have to continue testing it out to really decide how good of a product this really is.</li>
            <li>Pure acetone from beauty supply stores work better then non acetone (which I used to us)</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t chip as much but by day 4 I was able to peel the paint and polish off.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how much you&#x27;ll love</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start with the scrub, move on to my polish or acrylic fill-in and my nails look gorgeous again in ten minutes!</li>
            <li>Hit up that 60 second manicure afterward and your hands will look gorgeous and revitalized once again.</li>
            <li>Then put lots of good lotion on your hands, fingers, cuticles and nails and give &#x27;em a rest for a day before the next polishing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said for the two days it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>I tried the Sally Hansen Hard as Wraps nail treatment and although my results weren&#x27;t great they were not horrible</li>
            <li>It can un-stick your finger from a bottle, for example, that you&#x27;re glued to by super glue.)Pure acetone</li>
            <li>It dries out quickly and you nails will be a lot</li>
            <li>Quick drying</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even gone so far as to purchase this product for several relatives after they remarked on how beautiful my hands/nails are.</li>
            <li>I saw on Pinterest how one can create their own gelish nail art w/o paying an arm and a leg for the actual gel nail polish.  </li>
            <li>It chips after a day or two and is not thick and doesn&#x27;t make my nails strong at all.</li>
            <li>However, if your nails are dry/brittle and you need this product, it might be a wise idea to lay off the other polish and just use this for a while until they are rehabilitated.</li>
            <li>It hardened my nails so they don&#x27;t flex when I press on them, and the flat tips have curled nicely.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Right now, I have on about 9 or 10 coats.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using seche vite dry fast top coat and love it.</li>
            <li>A good product to protect bare nails, just with constant reapplying.ays and 2) my original nails are not getting stronger.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s better than bare nails, but it won&#x27;t replace a an acrylic/gel manicure or a salon treatment.</li>
            <li>I can rarely afford a professional manicure so this product is a wonderful investment for under $10 because a professional manicure where I live cost between $13 and $15 and only lasts for 2 to 3 days.</li>
            <li>My nails grow to lengths longer than an inch naturally and by themselves are quite strong.</li>
            <li>Luckily since I had a darker strip design, the imperfections weren&#x27;t really that visible.</li>
            <li>I even tried not shaking it and being very gentle, but still bubbles.</li>
            <li>I have been using SH products for years and have come to associate the name with quality products at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>My first order, I purchased five (5).</li>
            <li>nails did appear stronger when I first applied this product which is why I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li>A good product to protect bare nails, just with constant reapplying.</li>
            <li>I bought this along with the Sally Hansen No Chip Acrylic top coat after reading that using the two together provides for longer lasting nail polish.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a top coat so that my SH nail polish strip manicure would last longer.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to try this one because it looked better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve scrubbed by nails first with a product (I use Dawn dish detergent) which removes residual oils.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I noticed air bubbles</li>
            <li>But this is the next best thing and much less time consuming!!</li>
            <li>My nails still look amazing after 4days and they are hard and smooth.</li>
            <li>I DO start with clean, oil free and dry nails which I buff a bit to help with product adhesion.  </li>
            <li>I read both the bad and good reviews and decided to take a chance on the good reviews.   </li>
            <li>This stuff sticks to natural nails better than any polish I have ever seen, and I have natural nails that are always painted (by me)</li>
            <li>I read through all the tips, made sure I didn&#x27;t shake the bottle only gently rolled it</li>
            <li>I just wish it would last longer and not try to peel off so easily.</li>
            <li>I have been painting my nails for a long time and this is something that really seems to be better than all the rest.</li>
            <li>I waited 20 to 30 mins just to be safe and my single-coated nails were already dry.</li>
            <li>I use the scrub before EVERY manicure, even if it&#x27;s just slapping on a quick coat of clear polish or just going \\&quot;naked.\\</li>
            <li>I will definitely keep using this product to keep my nails long and strong!!</li>
            <li>Once the top layer peels off my nails feel weak and in need of another top</li>
            <li>, I applied it on smoothly and all seemed fine, but then as it dried it started bubbling.</li>
            <li>I have very brittle nails that break and crack all the time.</li>
            <li>Tomorrow I&#x27;ll take off the old and put on a fresh coat.</li>
            <li>she then applied the NailTek2, my nail color and Sceche Vite fast drying topcoat.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you apply too much it could get bubbly, but I did NOT have that issue.</li>
            <li>For those having issues with bubbles; don&#x27;t shake the bottle but gently roll it.</li>
            <li>I love the nail polish strips, but this will be the last clear polish I buy from SH.</li>
            <li>Based on other reviews I garnered that this product can peel, needs multiple coats, bubbles, but also is a good hardener.</li>
            <li>You will be amazed at how your rough cuticles and little hang-nails disappear and are replaced with a beautiful salon-worthy look in just a moment.</li>
            <li>Your hands and nails will be free of that white dry skin that appears in the winter and feel so soft and look so lovely.</li>
            <li>I was just trying to be cheap, but I think it&#x27;s time to pay a little extra and try out some better brands.</li>
            <li>Just gently brush on in that area so the polish soaks underneath the lift and file smooth once dry.</li>
            <li>This stuff alone takes nearly an hour to dry, with a top coat a couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li>Normally my nails would have all broken by now, but they are long and beautiful!</li>
            <li>I used a quick dry top coat almost immediately after applying the gel and it was dry within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>True Blue Spa 60-second Manicure Hand Scrub - Just a Minute]]</li>
            <li>Overall, I would say this is not a bad product.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would say this is not a bad product.</li>
            <li>The best part is once the product is on and dry, it keeps your nail a little flexible so if you hook it or it gets jammed, or bumped, it wont crack like a real acrylic or gel</li>
            <li>but I wait until they are almost dry and rub the bubbles to help smooth them.</li>
            <li>is highly flammable and remains in the air in your home for a while.</li>
            <li>It has a high shine and provides strength.</li>
            <li>Next time, I&#x27;ll use the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat.</li>
            <li>The most durable clear polish I&#x27;ve ever used... however this one comes in too large a bottle, once you hit the halfway point the rest is pretty thick from the air drying it out inside the bottle...</li>
            <li>Its not thick, it&#x27;s shiny, but it DOES bubble.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not thick like gel.  </li>
            <li>I then applied several more coats, one coat at a time, waiting several hours between for complete drying.</li>
            <li>Wash with warm water, use nail polish remover on bare nails to dry them out(only thing that makes polish last a day instead of hours), wash again scrubbing with a nail brush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s where I live</li>
            <li>It bubbles now, it did not bubble when it was new</li>
            <li>I have to buy a new bottle every so often</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the reviews saying it took an hour to dry because it dries pretty fast for me.</li>
            <li>This first time I applied on my nails, I applied it like regular nail polish.</li>
            <li>so I an constantly sticking my hands in hot water.</li>
            <li>When I first bought my bottle it peeled off like a rubberized layer after the second day.</li>
            <li>the main problems I read in many reviews were the thick viscosity (consistency), air bubbles, and peeling.</li>
            <li>Bath &amp; Body Works 60 Second Manicure Hand Scrub from their True Blue Line.</li>
            <li>It is the first nail polish product (besides pure acetone) that I am actually buying a second bottle of.</li>
            <li>This polish is an excellent base coat if you desire a high shine on your natural nails.</li>
            <li>and then I just smooth it down with a professional file</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t necessarily find that it was as strong as getting Shellac or fake nails, but overall, I was pleased!</li>
            <li>But I figured if it worked to keep my nails strong while I had them covered with the polish, I could forgive the long dry time.  </li>
            <li>It took me a hour and a half to clean that thing</li>
            <li>I save TONS of money by using this product for my clear acrylic fills.</li>
            <li>It looks like clear polish.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t chip, came completely off.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t feel completely solidified.</li>
            <li>The HAW did not chip; however, today, the polish on my thumbs peeled off in one complete piece.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used it 3 different times and each time it chips very soon..</li>
            <li>I work in a profession in which I must wash my hands frequently.</li>
            <li>Which leaves me right back to where I left off.</li>
            <li>While it does help my strips manicure last (after 3 days, they still look decent)</li>
            <li>Even if I try applying it every day or every other day it still peels right off.</li>
            <li>My nails are still long and have not broken or cracked</li>
            <li>In order for me to grow my nails normally, I need something to hold my nail in proper shape while it grows out.</li>
            <li>&quot; You will soon find yourself making little gift bags of these two products plus a nice file as little gifts for all of your girlfriends ...</li>
            <li>ALso takes a SUPER long time to dry.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just not strong enough, so I&#x27;m always searching for and trying anything that will help them grow and be strong.</li>
            <li>My nails do feel a little harder but still looking for a better product..</li>
            <li>This is the product i use to keep them hard and strong  </li>
            <li>It took much longer than 1 minute to dry.  </li>
            <li>Allowed to dry - it really took almost an hour with blowing on it.</li>
            <li>I even use it in lieu of harsh super glues or nail glues when I get a nail edge lifting a bit.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m either not applying it right or using my hands rough enough to strip  my nails.</li>
            <li>the serious business: If it stays on so darn well, how easily does it come off?</li>
            <li>For me, I don&#x27;t wear regular nail polish, just clear or nude colors, so that doesn&#x27;t matter to me.</li>
            <li>After drying, my nails feel harder but there is still some small bending which I&#x27;m okay with.</li>
            <li>I recently got my acrylic nails off after my wedding and, of course, my natural nails were wrecked.</li>
            <li>(It thickens to soft plastic over time), so I&#x27;ve learned to roll it between my hands and then set it under one of my hotter desk lamps for ten minutes or so before using.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the gel bubbling like many of the poor reviews said.</li>
            <li>Also, pure acetone is extremely drying to nails and skin.</li>
            <li>I was at first put off by the thickness, bubbles and how long it took to dry.</li>
            <li>And here&#x27;s the worst part of all: it DOES ahere to the nail quite strongly, which sounds like a good thing, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>I find that this product really IS a powerful acrylic gel - the 1st one I&#x27;ve found on the market that actually has a gel texture rather than regular liquid nail polish like all the other so-called \\&quot;gel\\</li>
            <li>I use Onyx Professional 100% Pure Acetone Remover in the little dipping pot with the plastic scrubbing bristles at the bottom.</li>
            <li>it not only make my nails harder while wearing it and more durable but it also acts as an amazing base coat; extending the life of my manicure to about 7 days with constant and repeated hand washing.</li>
            <li>It is NOT dry in 60 seconds.</li>
            <li>Woke up the next morning and not only were there more bubbles, but every single nail was smudged because after an hour and a half, it still wasn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li>By rolling it in my hand and tilting it upside gently a few times, I was able to get a nice shiny base coat that nail polish adhered to well.</li>
            <li>DO highly recommend you have one other product on-hand when you use this stuff:</li>
            <li>It does dry relatively fast, but keep in mind, if you&#x27;re going to do multiple coats, give each layer about 2-3 mins to really dry, it will also help reduce bubbling.</li>
            <li>At first it didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference, however after a few hours I definitely noticed strengthening of the Acrylic gel.</li>
            <li>I store it at normal room temp with my other polishes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually extremely rough with my hands/nails and have no trouble breaking a nail while putting on jeans, taking off running shoes, etc, but as of right now, all my nails (except my left thumb) are past my finger</li>
            <li>You really have to use as little polish as you can, scraping off any access on the sides of the bottle before you apply to the nail.</li>
            <li>before buying this product, I read every review, good and bad to get an idea of what to expect.</li>

            <li> What a great product!!</li>
            <li> I have been using \\&quot;nailtek 2\\&quot; which works wonderful but</li>
            <li> this had been a the best thing yet.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product and seller.</li>
            <li> As a top-coat, it is marvelous.</li>
            <li> I have the best luck with an Acetone remover.</li>
            <li> My nails look great!</li>
            <li> It looked real nice</li>
            <li> I have not yet experienced any bubbles or &amp;#34;stringy-ness&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> 100% GREAT</li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!  </li>
            <li> I think this is a good product and works well for me.</li>
            <li> (One good thing about acetone:  </li>
            <li> It strengthens your nails good.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not as good as this at 34 W..</li>
            <li> so I have used my fair share of polishes.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t even on my nails a good 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I did get a good deal on it</li>
            <li> and it looks good on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price-</li>
            <li> When I realized my mistake I tried it anyway with good results.</li>
            <li> For those of you looking for a great top coat: Seche Vite.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> For the love of god, don&#x27;t shake it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> this is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff really is amazing once u figure out to get it to work</li>
            <li> The shine is really nice</li>
            <li> I also suggest a really good top coat.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I bought this without reading any reviews.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product it helps give your nail strength and protects.</li>
            <li> I just got engaged and needed to make my nails look nice...</li>
            <li> I am surprised many times having removed it to find the nail perfect as before.  </li>
            <li> But after even 20 mins mine were still all gooey to the touch, and that was applying a very light coat.  </li>
            <li> It puts a layer of protectant on top of the nail therefore making the nail stronger.</li>
            <li> I love that it makes my manicure go the distance.</li>
            <li> I have ok nails</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve used it on top of nail polish, it smudges the nail polish.</li>
            <li> However, for someone who is more into their polishes, I can see how it would be a pain.</li>
            <li> AND I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m okay with reapplying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I applied another coat on top and finished it with my Seche Vite from Sallys.  </li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li> It does smooth out your nails and make them feel stronger so that your color goes on nicely and evenly.</li>
            <li> Since this turned into a longer nail job, I decided to put some color and top coat over the HAW.  </li>
            <li> LOVE EET!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually I love Sally Hanson products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m personally not too concerned about the bubbling because I care more about not having my nails break than having them flawlessly shiny.</li>
            <li> becauase i love the way it makes my nail polish look...</li>
            <li> It hardens your nail quickly and beautifully (with the right technique).</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> I ended up removing it and reapplied a much thinner coat, the results were amazing!</li>
            <li> I LOVE how strong this polish is.</li>
            <li> it peels off really easy ( after just one day) and it did more damage to my nails.</li>
            <li> Dries surprisingly fast and gives a great smooth glossy finish.</li>
            <li> Didnt feel much difference, Seller good.</li>
            <li> I use this both under nailpolish &amp; also on top of nailpolish to smooth out the texture of gritty glitter polish (it does this beautifully).</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t bite them as easily.</li>
            <li> I would rate this as 5-star if it were easy to remove.</li>
            <li> the drying time was very quick.</li>
            <li> It helps strengthen my nails so they don&#x27;t bend or chip as easily</li>
            <li> Well ... not so easy.</li>
            <li> at first i was in love with it.. went on so smooth, made my nail polish VERY smooth and gel-like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine though I like having to do them over.</li>
            <li> It works just fine.</li>
            <li> If the nails are not matte after that, I lightly buff with a fine</li>
            <li> And when I started reading the reviews, I thought I made a huge mistake.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, if you only use one coat.</li>
            <li> I have used it like 3 or 4 times already and upon putting it on my nail it does not go on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> I do not use a UV light</li>
            <li> By the time I switched hands I could get it bubble and streak free.</li>
            <li> and I noticed a significant difference in the hardness of my nails</li>
            <li> my original nails are not getting stronger.</li>
            <li> It is SUPER shiny and lovely if you get it right.</li>
            <li> I will have to continue testing it out to really decide how good of a product this really is.</li>
            <li> Pure acetone from beauty supply stores work better then non acetone (which I used to us)</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t chip as much but by day 4 I was able to peel the paint and polish off.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how much you&#x27;ll love</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start with the scrub, move on to my polish or acrylic fill-in and my nails look gorgeous again in ten minutes!</li>
            <li> Hit up that 60 second manicure afterward and your hands will look gorgeous and revitalized once again.</li>
            <li> Then put lots of good lotion on your hands, fingers, cuticles and nails and give &#x27;em a rest for a day before the next polishing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said for the two days it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> I tried the Sally Hansen Hard as Wraps nail treatment and although my results weren&#x27;t great they were not horrible</li>
            <li> It can un-stick your finger from a bottle, for example, that you&#x27;re glued to by super glue.)Pure acetone</li>
            <li> It dries out quickly and you nails will be a lot</li>
            <li> Quick drying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even gone so far as to purchase this product for several relatives after they remarked on how beautiful my hands/nails are.</li>
            <li> I saw on Pinterest how one can create their own gelish nail art w/o paying an arm and a leg for the actual gel nail polish.  </li>
            <li> It chips after a day or two and is not thick and doesn&#x27;t make my nails strong at all.</li>
            <li> However, if your nails are dry/brittle and you need this product, it might be a wise idea to lay off the other polish and just use this for a while until they are rehabilitated.</li>
            <li> It hardened my nails so they don&#x27;t flex when I press on them, and the flat tips have curled nicely.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> Right now, I have on about 9 or 10 coats.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using seche vite dry fast top coat and love it.</li>
            <li> A good product to protect bare nails, just with constant reapplying.ays and 2) my original nails are not getting stronger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s better than bare nails, but it won&#x27;t replace a an acrylic/gel manicure or a salon treatment.</li>
            <li> I can rarely afford a professional manicure so this product is a wonderful investment for under $10 because a professional manicure where I live cost between $13 and $15 and only lasts for 2 to 3 days.</li>
            <li> My nails grow to lengths longer than an inch naturally and by themselves are quite strong.</li>
            <li> Luckily since I had a darker strip design, the imperfections weren&#x27;t really that visible.</li>
            <li> I even tried not shaking it and being very gentle, but still bubbles.</li>
            <li> I have been using SH products for years and have come to associate the name with quality products at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> My first order, I purchased five (5).</li>
            <li> nails did appear stronger when I first applied this product which is why I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li> A good product to protect bare nails, just with constant reapplying.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the Sally Hansen No Chip Acrylic top coat after reading that using the two together provides for longer lasting nail polish.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a top coat so that my SH nail polish strip manicure would last longer.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to try this one because it looked better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve scrubbed by nails first with a product (I use Dawn dish detergent) which removes residual oils.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I noticed air bubbles</li>
            <li> But this is the next best thing and much less time consuming!!</li>
            <li> My nails still look amazing after 4days and they are hard and smooth.</li>
            <li> I DO start with clean, oil free and dry nails which I buff a bit to help with product adhesion.  </li>
            <li> I read both the bad and good reviews and decided to take a chance on the good reviews.   </li>
            <li> This stuff sticks to natural nails better than any polish I have ever seen, and I have natural nails that are always painted (by me)</li>
            <li> I read through all the tips, made sure I didn&#x27;t shake the bottle only gently rolled it</li>
            <li> I just wish it would last longer and not try to peel off so easily.</li>
            <li> I have been painting my nails for a long time and this is something that really seems to be better than all the rest.</li>
            <li> I waited 20 to 30 mins just to be safe and my single-coated nails were already dry.</li>
            <li> I use the scrub before EVERY manicure, even if it&#x27;s just slapping on a quick coat of clear polish or just going \\&quot;naked.\\</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep using this product to keep my nails long and strong!!</li>
            <li> Once the top layer peels off my nails feel weak and in need of another top</li>
            <li> , I applied it on smoothly and all seemed fine, but then as it dried it started bubbling.</li>
            <li> I have very brittle nails that break and crack all the time.</li>
            <li> Tomorrow I&#x27;ll take off the old and put on a fresh coat.</li>
            <li> she then applied the NailTek2, my nail color and Sceche Vite fast drying topcoat.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you apply too much it could get bubbly, but I did NOT have that issue.</li>
            <li> For those having issues with bubbles; don&#x27;t shake the bottle but gently roll it.</li>
            <li> I love the nail polish strips, but this will be the last clear polish I buy from SH.</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews I garnered that this product can peel, needs multiple coats, bubbles, but also is a good hardener.</li>
            <li> You will be amazed at how your rough cuticles and little hang-nails disappear and are replaced with a beautiful salon-worthy look in just a moment.</li>
            <li> Your hands and nails will be free of that white dry skin that appears in the winter and feel so soft and look so lovely.</li>
            <li> I was just trying to be cheap, but I think it&#x27;s time to pay a little extra and try out some better brands.</li>
            <li> Just gently brush on in that area so the polish soaks underneath the lift and file smooth once dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff alone takes nearly an hour to dry, with a top coat a couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li> Normally my nails would have all broken by now, but they are long and beautiful!</li>
            <li> I used a quick dry top coat almost immediately after applying the gel and it was dry within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> True Blue Spa 60-second Manicure Hand Scrub - Just a Minute]]</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say this is not a bad product.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say this is not a bad product.</li>
            <li> The best part is once the product is on and dry, it keeps your nail a little flexible so if you hook it or it gets jammed, or bumped, it wont crack like a real acrylic or gel</li>
            <li> but I wait until they are almost dry and rub the bubbles to help smooth them.</li>
            <li> is highly flammable and remains in the air in your home for a while.</li>
            <li> It has a high shine and provides strength.</li>
            <li> Next time, I&#x27;ll use the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat.</li>
            <li> The most durable clear polish I&#x27;ve ever used... however this one comes in too large a bottle, once you hit the halfway point the rest is pretty thick from the air drying it out inside the bottle...</li>
            <li> Its not thick, it&#x27;s shiny, but it DOES bubble.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not thick like gel.  </li>
            <li> I then applied several more coats, one coat at a time, waiting several hours between for complete drying.</li>
            <li> Wash with warm water, use nail polish remover on bare nails to dry them out(only thing that makes polish last a day instead of hours), wash again scrubbing with a nail brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s where I live</li>
            <li> It bubbles now, it did not bubble when it was new</li>
            <li> I have to buy a new bottle every so often</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the reviews saying it took an hour to dry because it dries pretty fast for me.</li>
            <li> This first time I applied on my nails, I applied it like regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> so I an constantly sticking my hands in hot water.</li>
            <li> When I first bought my bottle it peeled off like a rubberized layer after the second day.</li>
            <li> the main problems I read in many reviews were the thick viscosity (consistency), air bubbles, and peeling.</li>
            <li> Bath &amp; Body Works 60 Second Manicure Hand Scrub from their True Blue Line.</li>
            <li> It is the first nail polish product (besides pure acetone) that I am actually buying a second bottle of.</li>
            <li> This polish is an excellent base coat if you desire a high shine on your natural nails.</li>
            <li> and then I just smooth it down with a professional file</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t necessarily find that it was as strong as getting Shellac or fake nails, but overall, I was pleased!</li>
            <li> But I figured if it worked to keep my nails strong while I had them covered with the polish, I could forgive the long dry time.  </li>
            <li> It took me a hour and a half to clean that thing</li>
            <li> I save TONS of money by using this product for my clear acrylic fills.</li>
            <li> It looks like clear polish.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t chip, came completely off.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t feel completely solidified.</li>
            <li> The HAW did not chip; however, today, the polish on my thumbs peeled off in one complete piece.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used it 3 different times and each time it chips very soon..</li>
            <li> I work in a profession in which I must wash my hands frequently.</li>
            <li> Which leaves me right back to where I left off.</li>
            <li> While it does help my strips manicure last (after 3 days, they still look decent)</li>
            <li> Even if I try applying it every day or every other day it still peels right off.</li>
            <li> My nails are still long and have not broken or cracked</li>
            <li> In order for me to grow my nails normally, I need something to hold my nail in proper shape while it grows out.</li>
            <li> &quot; You will soon find yourself making little gift bags of these two products plus a nice file as little gifts for all of your girlfriends ...</li>
            <li> ALso takes a SUPER long time to dry.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just not strong enough, so I&#x27;m always searching for and trying anything that will help them grow and be strong.</li>
            <li> My nails do feel a little harder but still looking for a better product..</li>
            <li> This is the product i use to keep them hard and strong  </li>
            <li> It took much longer than 1 minute to dry.  </li>
            <li> Allowed to dry - it really took almost an hour with blowing on it.</li>
            <li> I even use it in lieu of harsh super glues or nail glues when I get a nail edge lifting a bit.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m either not applying it right or using my hands rough enough to strip  my nails.</li>
            <li> the serious business: If it stays on so darn well, how easily does it come off?</li>
            <li> For me, I don&#x27;t wear regular nail polish, just clear or nude colors, so that doesn&#x27;t matter to me.</li>
            <li> After drying, my nails feel harder but there is still some small bending which I&#x27;m okay with.</li>
            <li> I recently got my acrylic nails off after my wedding and, of course, my natural nails were wrecked.</li>
            <li> (It thickens to soft plastic over time), so I&#x27;ve learned to roll it between my hands and then set it under one of my hotter desk lamps for ten minutes or so before using.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the gel bubbling like many of the poor reviews said.</li>
            <li> Also, pure acetone is extremely drying to nails and skin.</li>
            <li> I was at first put off by the thickness, bubbles and how long it took to dry.</li>
            <li> And here&#x27;s the worst part of all: it DOES ahere to the nail quite strongly, which sounds like a good thing, but it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> I find that this product really IS a powerful acrylic gel - the 1st one I&#x27;ve found on the market that actually has a gel texture rather than regular liquid nail polish like all the other so-called \\&quot;gel\\</li>
            <li> I use Onyx Professional 100% Pure Acetone Remover in the little dipping pot with the plastic scrubbing bristles at the bottom.</li>
            <li> it not only make my nails harder while wearing it and more durable but it also acts as an amazing base coat; extending the life of my manicure to about 7 days with constant and repeated hand washing.</li>
            <li> It is NOT dry in 60 seconds.</li>
            <li> Woke up the next morning and not only were there more bubbles, but every single nail was smudged because after an hour and a half, it still wasn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> By rolling it in my hand and tilting it upside gently a few times, I was able to get a nice shiny base coat that nail polish adhered to well.</li>
            <li> DO highly recommend you have one other product on-hand when you use this stuff:</li>
            <li> It does dry relatively fast, but keep in mind, if you&#x27;re going to do multiple coats, give each layer about 2-3 mins to really dry, it will also help reduce bubbling.</li>
            <li> At first it didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference, however after a few hours I definitely noticed strengthening of the Acrylic gel.</li>
            <li> I store it at normal room temp with my other polishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually extremely rough with my hands/nails and have no trouble breaking a nail while putting on jeans, taking off running shoes, etc, but as of right now, all my nails (except my left thumb) are past my finger</li>
            <li> You really have to use as little polish as you can, scraping off any access on the sides of the bottle before you apply to the nail.</li>
            <li> before buying this product, I read every review, good and bad to get an idea of what to expect.</li>
            <li> It does take at least 3 coats to get a really good thickness in your nail because you have to apply it so thinly, and this is the downside</li>
            <li> If I accidentally bump or smudge the Hard as Nails, I just dab on a bit more to fill in the spot, let dry, and file down any lumps or bumps just like an acrylic.</li>
            <li> Not as thick obviously but done right</li>
            <li> Then it takes literally at least one full hour to dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find this polish to be any different from any other clear polish.</li>
            <li> I had a big party last week and wanted to keep my nails long, but was worried they would break before the end of the week.</li>
            <li> Have used this for around a month now, it did make my nails harder and the first few times removing and reapplying wasn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried pure acetone yet be cause I&#x27;m not sure I want it in my home.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to no less than a dozen other women.</li>
            <li> My nails are super bendy and weak and every time they bend, I get cracks in the polish.  </li>
            <li> It works good but just a little too thick for me, if you don&#x27;t like thick nail polish you probably shouldn&#x27;t purchase this.</li>
            <li> taking layers of your own nail with it!!I tried so hard to like this product, but after a few weeks of using it, my own weak and peeling nails had gotten perhaps ten times worse!</li>
            <li> and I received A clear bottle and the actual product comes in a blue bottle was a dead give away...</li>
            <li> i finally had long nails underneath.</li>
            <li> They are also fairly flat at the tips.</li>
            <li> You can buff down any bumpy spots with a soft file meant for buffing and polishing acrylic nails [[ASIN:B0037O2J7I 4 Way Shiny Block / 4 Step Buffing Block Shine Nail Buffer]].</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product at such a discounted price which should definitely have clued me in on the fact that it could be a fake...</li>
            <li> , if you use this as top coat, it definitely works and makes your nails hard and prolongs your nail color, but the drying time is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> After the last attempt all seemed to be going well, but then it wouldn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> And, even when it is &#x27;dry&#x27;, for instance, an entire day later, it still doesn&#x27;t feel dry.</li>
            <li> dried really quickly for me, not sure what drying problem everyone else is running into.</li>
            <li> tried it as a base coat and painted my toenails a bright color.</li>
            <li> I can never grow long nails.</li>
            <li> No matter how careful, tiny bubbles are visable when it (eventually) dries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty annoyed that this polish is such a pain to work</li>
            <li> I wiped it off and reapplied it 2 more times trying different methods, thin layer, thick layer, medium layer and every time it still bubbled no matter what I did.</li>
            <li> has done wonders for my very weak short nails that has now grown tremendously</li>
            <li> but this product takes too long to dry, so I always use a quick-dry topcoat over it.</li>
            <li> If it takes too long to dry try using a thinner coat.  </li>
            <li> I finally got it opened and used pure acetone to thin it because it had thickened over time.</li>
            <li> so my other nails would require lesser amount.</li>
            <li> Gives me an excuse to sit still and not move while my nails Set !</li>
            <li> Instead of working to actually strengthen and heal the natural nail, it just sticks to it really hard, and then within 2-3 days, it will start peeling....</li>
            <li> Both times the product didn&#x27;t dry well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have 2 hours to wait for this product to dry.</li>
            <li> and the humidity does something to the dry time.</li>
            <li> The double-layered was dry to the touch</li>
            <li> Also, it takes FOREVER TO DRY, like I&#x27;m talking about an hour.</li>
            <li> I immediately applied this to my nail polish strips and it took forever to dry.</li>
            <li> This does dry the fastest of the three.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> It took forever to dry - about 2 hrs.</li>
            <li> So I was looking for something to dry out/harden my nails and polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will take a while to dry, but be patient and use a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> But then I read a few other reviews and realized the reason for that was because the shaking action was causing the air bubbles.</li>
            <li> I am including photos of the longest my nails ever were before using this product and where my nails are today approximately 8 weeks after the first application.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thin and brittle fingernails</li>
            <li> Bought this at a local drugstore for a nail that had split but ended up breaking the nail before I could apply this product,  I used it anyway after filing the chipped nail down.</li>
            <li> My nails normally are thin, flexible and peel easily especially if using polish &amp; remover.</li>
            <li> I must note, that i have soft weak nails because of the acrylics and had been trying for a year to get my nails back on track..</li>
            <li> It makes quick work of the polish, but your fingers come out white and dry as a bone and nails look very sad and malnourished.</li>
            <li> After a few uses removing it I saw my nail bed was flaking, next time it was a little rough, last time it was very rough and DRY.</li>
            <li> but this one is a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> It makes my nails harder and thicker</li>
            <li> harder-</li>
            <li> Your nails do get harder and thicker like nail wraps when the product is on.    </li>
            <li> After 2 tries, it went into the garbage.</li>
            <li> one adds appreciable thickness to my nails in 1 coat (sometimes I&#x27;ll use 2 coats on my really thin nails) &amp; makes my nails become very hard &amp; strong after they dry.</li>
            <li> It blends right in at the base of my nail, dries fast</li>
            <li> nails are thick, long nail beds, and very moist and flexible, but not very good</li>
            <li> I sat up for an hour and a half and eventually dozed off waiting for it to dry.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see any bubbles as other reviewers have expressed.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work though, this seems to make your nail polish peel off in bigger chunks instead of chipping like usual.</li>
            <li> Some other posters complain that this peels off, but I haven&#x27;t found that to occur if  </li>
            <li> So, not great under nail color or as topcoat, which is a shame because otherwise it would be great hardening long-lasting base coat.    </li>
            <li> Bubbles like crazy from the very first use.  </li>
            <li> Hate it because I spent an hour giving myself an at home manicure with this as my base coat, 2 coats of a matte dry China Glaze color and a gel top coat with my Sally Hansen LED light.</li>
            <li> I can flail borishly and if my nails happen to connect with a hard surface the only thing that cracks is the laquer and not my nail.</li>
            <li> Woke up the next morning and my nails looked considerably dull, the shine was gone, and looked smudged.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I usually have very papery thin nails, that tend to shred rather than break, So after months and months of Falsie&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I have tried all of Sally Hansen&#x27;s nail products that claim to harden nails, with no success.</li>
            <li> I figured I could at least get a lasting mani out of the long-drying basecoat.  </li>
            <li> You definitely need at LEAST 3 coats to get any sort of structure.</li>
            <li> There are much better base coats out there.</li>
            <li> If you messed up, you can apply a 2nd thin coat but there will be chance of bubbles and it will take even longer to dry.</li>
            <li> I did my nails as soon as I got my kids down for their naps.  </li>
            <li> I shaped and filed the tips, then buffed my nail beds and swiped everything down with polish remover.  </li>
            <li> my nails have never naturally grown past an active length, but for the first time in my life I have to keep filing or even cutting my nails as a result of using this product.</li>
            <li> it does take a little bit of time to dry but with proper application it dries to a very hard surface.</li>
            <li> I applied the polish and waited - there was the first disappointment.  </li>
            <li> As a test, I decided to see how this would work as just a bare coat on my nails, a thin layer applied gingerly...</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this for anyone who has weak or brittle nails.</li>
            <li> The coat forms little bubbles and dries like that.  </li>
            <li> I buy it at Walmart for a little over $2.</li>
            <li> It dried in about 10 minutes</li>
            <li> BUT IF YOU TAKE THESE EVERYDAY</li>
            <li> a person who does their nails every week I will say don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  </li>
            <li> it looks like you have thin wraps on, especially with polish.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ll add on to this review once I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s almost impossible to remove, even with polish remover that has acetone as its first ingredient.</li>
            <li> The product does give you a thick hard coating for your nails, however it bubbles and it takes forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> the drying time is super annoying.</li>
            <li> she applied 2 to 3 very thin layers and had me to dry my nails in front of a fan as she applied to the other hand.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, at the moment I placed a regualr OPI base coat down on my bare nails for some shine and added Hard As Wraps for an extra pop of shine and smoothness.</li>
            <li> If someone lights a cigarette near you, it might be dangerous.</li>
            <li> , I know it&#x27;s small)</li>
            <li> Try applying only ONE THIN layer (it even indicated that step on the bottle!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about chipped nails since I&#x27;m wearing this to prevent chipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about chipped nails since I&#x27;m wearing this to prevent chipping.</li>
            <li> - there was no peeling of the nail material whatsoever, but how disappointing that it did not adhere nearly as well as it should have done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people are saying that this is hard to remove-</li>
            <li> however the fact that the product packaging says hard as wraps and</li>
            <li> but this hard as wraps peeled off my nails like plastic</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m hard on my nails.</li>
            <li> So, I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this product for anybody, and especially not for people who have weak nails - this will make them worse!</li>
            <li> It chips after a day or 2, and is hard to remove.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this by accident, thinking I had grabbed a bottle of Hard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product two stars because at least it did not damage my nail</li>
            <li> This stuff is THICK and bubbles with every coat I use.</li>
            <li> Cons: you need to apply it really thick, like 4 or 5 coats.</li>
            <li> But, its probably because you have to apply it so thick.</li>
            <li> do become thick like wraps.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a gel base coat, i know this isn&#x27;t really it</li>
            <li> Not acrylic thick, but protected.</li>
            <li> Typically, this process will give me a lasting manicure of at least 5 days with no chips, using this as the base</li>
            <li> Seriously, It&#x27;s THAT thick.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product, I hated it because the finishing product always had air bubbles in it.</li>
            <li> It takes at least a week for it to start wearing off, and even then it is very hard to pick off.</li>
            <li> but several reviews said it bubbled really bad</li>
            <li> but it starts chipping really bad the next day.</li>
            <li> This is quite painful obviously.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not good</li>
            <li> IT DOES NOT MAKE YOUR NAILS WEAK</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a wrap this weak and flimsy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff.</li>
            <li> One thin coat protects my nails for a week.</li>
            <li> The stuff is extremely thick and globby,and forms annoying little &#x27;strings&#x27;; it is very hard to work with when painting it on.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have very weak, thin, peeling/splitting nails.</li>
            <li> did not do as expected but will continue to use as a base</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this item is difficult to find in the shops, which is not surprising.</li>
            <li> Not a great product!</li>
            <li> That is wrong.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> It always retains that horrible &#x27;tacky&#x27; feeling, no matter how long it&#x27;s been on there.</li>
            <li> Crazy.</li>
            <li> I tried everything to speed up the drying process, running my hands over cold water,and even after 15 minutes my nails still felt sticky and tacky to the touch.</li>
            <li> This bubbles and peels and is not a great base coat.</li>
            <li> Bad move on my part.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I recommend you use something else as a base coat to protect your nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using this sally product but NOT as a base coat.</li>
            <li> BUT I&#x27;ve used it and both hate it</li>
            <li> I did as the instructions stated but used water base acrylic paint instead.  </li>
            <li> then tried to put it on as just a base coat.  </li>
            <li> As a base coat, it&#x27;s a joke.</li>
            <li> I bought this and a gel  base coat and a rubber base coat  to compare.</li>
            <li> I hate it, too.</li>
            <li> but I did shake the bottle up violently.</li>
            <li> but this one is horrible.  </li>
            <li> My nails look awful.</li>
            <li> It makes me wonder what nasty ingredients are in it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It works good but just a little too thick for me, if you don&#x27;t like thick nail polish you probably shouldn&#x27;t purchase this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shake the bottle at all. I know it says to but several reviews said it bubbled really bad so I just didn&#x27;t shake it at all. Still works. If you are expecting this to strengthen the nail it does not. It puts a layer of protectant on top of the nail therefore making the nail stronger. I am a nail biter and use this product to help me stop. It makes my nails harder and thicker so I can&#x27;t bite them as easily. So far, so good! I don&#x27;t understand the reviews saying it took an hour to dry because it dries pretty fast for me. All in all I think this is a good product and works well for me.</li>
            <li> I have very brittle nails that break and crack all the time. I can never grow long nails. I had a big party last week and wanted to keep my nails long, but was worried they would break before the end of the week. I bought this product about three days before the party and painted on several coats. My nails are still long and have not broken or cracked and it&#x27;s a week later. Normally my nails would have all broken by now, but they are long and beautiful! I will definitely keep using this product to keep my nails long and strong!! I would definitely recommend this for anyone who has weak or brittle nails.</li>
            <li> I LOVE how strong this polish is. It&#x27;s so shiny and the shine lasts. I have not yet experienced any bubbles or &amp;#34;stringy-ness&amp;#34;. I feel like it helps prevent my nails from splitting and flaking while the polish is on. However, it&#x27;s almost impossible to remove, even with polish remover that has acetone as its first ingredient. I haven&#x27;t tried pure acetone yet be cause I&#x27;m not sure I want it in my home. (One good thing about acetone:  It can un-stick your finger from a bottle, for example, that you&#x27;re glued to by super glue.)Pure acetone is highly flammable and remains in the air in your home for a while. If someone lights a cigarette near you, it might be dangerous. Also, pure acetone is extremely drying to nails and skin. It removes the oils in your nails and skin while it removes polish. I would rate this as 5-star if it were easy to remove.</li>
            <li> I find that this product really IS a powerful acrylic gel - the 1st one I&#x27;ve found on the market that actually has a gel texture rather than regular liquid nail polish like all the other so-called \\&quot;gel\\&quot; treatments I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one adds appreciable thickness to my nails in 1 coat (sometimes I&#x27;ll use 2 coats on my really thin nails) &amp; makes my nails become very hard &amp; strong after they dry. I use this both under nailpolish &amp; also on top of nailpolish to smooth out the texture of gritty glitter polish (it does this beautifully). The shine is really nice but this product takes too long to dry, so I always use a quick-dry topcoat over it. It tends to bubble as it dries (hence 4 stars), so adding the topcoat corrects that problem. Using this gel makes my manicure last well over a week w/no chipping or cracking - I love that it makes my manicure go the distance.</li>
            <li> It works for about 3-4 days before I find that the product starts to peel off.  I DO start with clean, oil free and dry nails which I buff a bit to help with product adhesion.  At any rate - it&#x27;s helped protect my nails for that short period of time before I need to reapply.</li>
            <li> This polish is an excellent base coat if you desire a high shine on your natural nails. I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this product at such a discounted price which should definitely have clued me in on the fact that it could be a fake...however the fact that the product packaging says hard as wraps and then the product says nail hardener and I received A clear bottle and the actual product comes in a blue bottle was a dead give away...I guess this is a case of u get what u pay for...smh</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, if you only use one coat. It strengthens your nails good.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!  The most durable clear polish I&#x27;ve ever used... however this one comes in too large a bottle, once you hit the halfway point the rest is pretty thick from the air drying it out inside the bottle...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;got a UV kit, and it&#x27;s not as good as this at 34 W.. but I have not tried the Sally Gel Polish either... could be the polish and not the type.  But this is the next best thing and much less time consuming!!</li>
            <li> Have used this for around a month now, it did make my nails harder and the first few times removing and reapplying wasn&#x27;t an issue. After a few uses removing it I saw my nail bed was flaking, next time it was a little rough, last time it was very rough and DRY. I recommend you use something else as a base coat to protect your nails. I also suggest a really good top coat. This stuff alone takes nearly an hour to dry, with a top coat a couple of minutes.  It will also help keep it from wearing off at the tips or peeling/seperating at the tips. I&#x27;m using seche vite dry fast top coat and love it. I&#x27;ll keep using this sally product but NOT as a base coat.</li>
            <li> I have ok nails but I was hoping to get something that would strengthen my nails enough so it could grow out.  I bought this product hoping it would do just that.  I have used it like 3 or 4 times already and upon putting it on my nail it does not go on smoothly.  The coat forms little bubbles and dries like that.  I don&#x27;t know what that means but it&#x27;s happened every time I have used it.  This has never happened to me before.  My nails do feel a little harder but still looking for a better product..</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local Walgreens and tried it the next day. I read both sides of the reviews online and decided to give it a shot. At first it didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference, however after a few hours I definitely noticed strengthening of the Acrylic gel. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the gel bubbling like many of the poor reviews said. I used a quick dry top coat almost immediately after applying the gel and it was dry within 5 minutes. I didn&#x27;t necessarily find that it was as strong as getting Shellac or fake nails, but overall, I was pleased!</li>
            <li> did not do as expected but will continue to use as a base</li>
            <li> Tried this product twice. Both times the product didn&#x27;t dry well. I don&#x27;t have 2 hours to wait for this product to dry. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s where I live and the humidity does something to the dry time. When I&#x27;ve used it on top of nail polish, it smudges the nail polish. Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is THICK and bubbles with every coat I use. Every morning after my shower I have chips on the tips of my nails and have to refresh the coat. My nails normally are thin, flexible and peel easily especially if using polish &amp; remover. I&#x27;m trying to hydrate them 3x a day but this stuff isn&#x27;t doing anything to help. I&#x27;m on day 5. I&#x27;m getting some polish thinner tonight (needed it anyway) and thinning it out. Tomorrow I&#x27;ll take off the old and put on a fresh coat. We&#x27;ll see if it makes a difference in the bubbles.</li>
            <li> has done wonders for my very weak short nails that has now grown tremendously</li>
            <li> I recently got my acrylic nails off after my wedding and, of course, my natural nails were wrecked. I picked this product up at my local Walgreens. I trust SH products and have been using them for years, this stated on the package that it was for hardening dry/brittle nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dried really quickly for me, not sure what drying problem everyone else is running into. I shook the bottle twice and applied a medium thickness layer to each nail. It dried in about 10 minutes and I noticed a significant difference in the hardness of my nails right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 star off because it does have tiny bubbles in it after it dries. For me, I don&#x27;t wear regular nail polish, just clear or nude colors, so that doesn&#x27;t matter to me. However, for someone who is more into their polishes, I can see how it would be a pain. However, if your nails are dry/brittle and you need this product, it might be a wise idea to lay off the other polish and just use this for a while until they are rehabilitated.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is even on the market. It doesn&#x27;t do anything but start chipping the second it dries.</li>
            <li> OMG. What a great product!!</li>
            <li> I came upon this item on a regular visit to the shops and decided to give it a try. My nails grow to lengths longer than an inch naturally and by themselves are quite strong. However, I am something of a klutz, constantly walking into things, grabbing borishly at times and on occasion, slamming into something my nails would bend backward and break at the flesh. This is quite painful obviously. Using this product I have found a remedy to the results of being a klutz. I can flail borishly and if my nails happen to connect with a hard surface the only thing that cracks is the laquer and not my nail. I am surprised many times having removed it to find the nail perfect as before.  Unfortunately, this item is difficult to find in the shops, which is not surprising. However, through diligent searching I found a place here on Amazon.com offering the item. My first order, I purchased five (5).</li>
            <li> My nails are always constantly chipping and peeling. They&#x27;re just not strong enough, so I&#x27;m always searching for and trying anything that will help them grow and be strong. I tried the Sally Hansen Hard as Wraps nail treatment and although my results weren&#x27;t great they were not horrible either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails did appear stronger when I first applied this product which is why I&#x27;m not complaining. The problem lies with the coat just peeling off in one big sheet. It only lasted about 2 days. Even if I try applying it every day or every other day it still peels right off. Which leaves me right back to where I left off. Once the top layer peels off my nails feel weak and in need of another top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said for the two days it&#x27;s not bad. I just wish it would last longer and not try to peel off so easily.</li>
            <li> LOOK I JUST STARTED USING THIS AND I LOVE IT 100% GREAT IT DOES NOT MAKE YOUR NAILS WEAK I ALSO TAKE PRENATAL VITS. I&#x27;M NOT PG NEVER HAVE NEVER WILL BUT IF YOU TAKE THESE EVERYDAY THEY WILL MAKE YOUR HAIR GROW AND NAILS</li>
            <li> Not a great product! This bubbles and peels and is not a great base coat. There are much better base coats out there.</li>
            <li> This stuff sticks to natural nails better than any polish I have ever seen, and I have natural nails that are always painted (by me) so I have used my fair share of polishes. I am also a nail polish \\&quot;picker\\&quot; and when my nails start chipping I cant help from trying to scratch it all of. Not so with this. It takes at least a week for it to start wearing off, and even then it is very hard to pick off. However, the thickness of the product means it somehow gets TONS of tiny bubbles in it when you&#x27;re painting it on. I even tried not shaking it and being very gentle, but still bubbles. ALso takes a SUPER long time to dry. So, not great under nail color or as topcoat, which is a shame because otherwise it would be great hardening long-lasting base coat.    Update - For those of you looking for a great top coat: Seche Vite. I have been painting my nails for a long time and this is something that really seems to be better than all the rest. Dries surprisingly fast and gives a great smooth glossy finish. Love it. It is the first nail polish product (besides pure acetone) that I am actually buying a second bottle of.</li>
            <li> FYI Didn&#x27;t purchase from buyer BUT I&#x27;ve used it and both hate it and like it. Hate it because I spent an hour giving myself an at home manicure with this as my base coat, 2 coats of a matte dry China Glaze color and a gel top coat with my Sally Hansen LED light. Typically, this process will give me a lasting manicure of at least 5 days with no chips, using this as the base however my nail color literally popped off my nails in 2 days. Didn&#x27;t chip, came completely off. Crazy. HOWEVER, at the moment I placed a regualr OPI base coat down on my bare nails for some shine and added Hard As Wraps for an extra pop of shine and smoothness. This seems to be working well, no issues with them peeling off and I don&#x27;t see any bubbles as other reviewers have expressed. I will have to continue testing it out to really decide how good of a product this really is.</li>
            <li> Because I used to bite my nails, I have affected my nail bed which led to one or two constant growing chipped nails. In order for me to grow my nails normally, I need something to hold my nail in proper shape while it grows out. I searched online and arrived to this product. Honestly, I bought this without reading any reviews. And when I started reading the reviews, I thought I made a huge mistake. Still, I tried the product out to see why was there mixed reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the main problems I read in many reviews were the thick viscosity (consistency), air bubbles, and peeling. Here&#x27;s what I did. This first time I applied on my nails, I applied it like regular nail polish. That is wrong. I got all the problems on the reviews. So I tried a different technique. Never shake the bottle. That causes air bubbles. When applying, try taking out the brush without stirring the liquid (I don&#x27;t know if this help with lessening air bubbles, but this is what I did). Wipe the excess off one side of the brush. That was enough to cover my thumbnail (about 1cm x 0.5cm, I know it&#x27;s small) so my other nails would require lesser amount. I also re-dip the brush after each nail, only dipping the bristle part. Wipe the excess and repeat. Try applying only ONE THIN layer (it even indicated that step on the bottle!). If you messed up, you can apply a 2nd thin coat but there will be chance of bubbles and it will take even longer to dry. I waited 20 to 30 mins just to be safe and my single-coated nails were already dry. The double-layered was dry to the touch but it doesn&#x27;t feel completely solidified. After drying, my nails feel harder but there is still some small bending which I&#x27;m okay with. The coating still fell off after 2 to 3 days but I&#x27;m okay with reapplying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works as it said it would. It hardens your nail quickly and beautifully (with the right technique). Does it actually strengthen my nails? Only temporarily because 1) the product peels off after 2 to 3 days and 2) my original nails are not getting stronger. They&#x27;re just wearing armor. The product does hold and hide cracked, torn, and peeled nails. I&#x27;m not sure about chipped nails since I&#x27;m wearing this to prevent chipping. Overall, I would say this is not a bad product. A good product to protect bare nails, just with constant reapplying.ays and 2) my original nails are not getting stronger. They&#x27;re just wearing armor.

            <li> Bought this at a local drugstore for a nail that had split but ended up breaking the nail before I could apply this product,  I used it anyway after filing the chipped nail down. I was at first put off by the thickness, bubbles and how long it took to dry. I ended up removing it and reapplied a much thinner coat, the results were amazing! it does take a little bit of time to dry but with proper application it dries to a very hard surface. my nails have never naturally grown past an active length, but for the first time in my life I have to keep filing or even cutting my nails as a result of using this product. it not only make my nails harder while wearing it and more durable but it also acts as an amazing base coat; extending the life of my manicure to about 7 days with constant and repeated hand washing. I am a home health care provider so I must wash my hands several times an hour. I can rarely afford a professional manicure so this product is a wonderful investment for under $10 because a professional manicure where I live cost between $13 and $15 and only lasts for 2 to 3 days. This product basically prevents my polish from chipping. I have recommended this product to no less than a dozen other women. I am including photos of the longest my nails ever were before using this product and where my nails are today approximately 8 weeks after the first application. I&#x27;ve even gone so far as to purchase this product for several relatives after they remarked on how beautiful my hands/nails are.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the Sally Hansen No Chip Acrylic top coat after reading that using the two together provides for longer lasting nail polish. It didn&#x27;t work though, this seems to make your nail polish peel off in bigger chunks instead of chipping like usual. I work in a bar though so I an constantly sticking my hands in hot water.</li>
            <li> I saw on Pinterest how one can create their own gelish nail art w/o paying an arm and a leg for the actual gel nail polish.  This was one of the items to use.  I did as the instructions stated but used water base acrylic paint instead.  It looked real nice like I had a coat of glass over my nail art work and I was pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less than 24 hours later by paint began to chip.  So I applied another coat on top and finished it with my Seche Vite from Sallys.  It didn&#x27;t chip as much but by day 4 I was able to peel the paint and polish off.  That&#x27;s not good seeing I can keep my polish on my nails for about 6-7 days w/o it chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a cashier and I stock things too so imagine how often I have to repair my nails.  With this it was a lot sooner than later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried to put it on as just a base coat.  I put my Seche Vite over it and washed out my deep fryer.  Bad move on my part.  It took me a hour and a half to clean that thing and I&#x27;m still not done but this hard as wraps peeled off my nails like plastic and it wasn&#x27;t even on my nails a good 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have six bottles of this and I did get a good deal on it but I&#x27;m so disappointed.  I like the Sally Hansen line of nail polishes but this one is horrible.  I can&#x27;t even wash my hands w/o this stuff chipping or peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a person who does their nails every week I will say don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  It&#x27;s not worth the price.</li>
            <li> it peels off really easy ( after just one day) and it did more damage to my nails.After using it for a week my nails started broking. Some pros- It dries out quickly and you nails will be a lot harder- but this just until it peels off.</li>
            <li> I usually have very papery thin nails, that tend to shred rather than break, So after months and months of Falsie&#x27;s i finally had long nails underneath. This is the product i use to keep them hard and strong  The best part is once the product is on and dry, it keeps your nail a little flexible so if you hook it or it gets jammed, or bumped, it wont crack like a real acrylic or gel can.  It does take at least 3 coats to get a really good thickness in your nail because you have to apply it so thinly, and this is the downside It is NOT dry in 60 seconds. If you have a UV gel and acrylic Lamp, it might, But after even 20 mins mine were still all gooey to the touch, and that was applying a very light coat.  I do luv this product and will continue to use it though!!! Gives me an excuse to sit still and not move while my nails Set !</li>
            <li> I have pretty thin and brittle fingernails so I bought this product one day at the drug store. Here are the pros and cons:    Pros: the product does work. Your nails do get harder and thicker like nail wraps when the product is on.    Cons: you need to apply it really thick, like 4 or 5 coats. Also, it takes FOREVER TO DRY, like I&#x27;m talking about an hour. But, its probably because you have to apply it so thick. Finally, you have to apply it neatly and presisely, cause if not you get air bubbles.    So overall, it does its job and your nails do become thick like wraps. Not as thick obviously but done right it looks like you have thin wraps on, especially with polish.</li>
            <li> Last for days. Quick drying</li>
            <li> I bought this as a top coat so that my SH nail polish strip manicure would last longer. I immediately applied this to my nail polish strips and it took forever to dry. I tried everything to speed up the drying process, running my hands over cold water,and even after 15 minutes my nails still felt sticky and tacky to the touch. My nails were still tacky after 45 minutes so I just went to bed. Woke up the next morning and my nails looked considerably dull, the shine was gone, and looked smudged. Luckily since I had a darker strip design, the imperfections weren&#x27;t really that visible. While it does help my strips manicure last (after 3 days, they still look decent) the drying time is super annoying. As a test, I decided to see how this would work as just a bare coat on my nails, a thin layer applied gingerly...the drying time was very quick. Go figure?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it as a base coat and painted my toenails a bright color. After two days, color was fading and chipping. I paid almost 5 bucks for this bottle at Walmart and since there was only a couple left, I took a chance. I&#x27;m pretty annoyed that this polish is such a pain to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to summarize, if you use this as top coat, it definitely works and makes your nails hard and prolongs your nail color, but the drying time is ridiculous.You really have to use as little polish as you can, scraping off any access on the sides of the bottle before you apply to the nail. As a base coat, it&#x27;s a joke. I love the nail polish strips, but this will be the last clear polish I buy from SH. Next time, I&#x27;ll use the Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat.</li>
            <li> I bought this and a gel  base coat and a rubber base coat  to compare. This does dry the fastest of the three. However all three start chipping within two to three days after application. So I&#x27;m either not applying it right or using my hands rough enough to strip  my nails. It&#x27;s fine though I like having to do them over.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy!  I read both the bad and good reviews and decided to take a chance on the good reviews.   The product does give you a thick hard coating for your nails, however it bubbles and it takes forever to dry.  I read through all the tips, made sure I didn&#x27;t shake the bottle only gently rolled it, I applied it on smoothly and all seemed fine, but then as it dried it started bubbling. I wiped it off and reapplied it 2 more times trying different methods, thin layer, thick layer, medium layer and every time it still bubbled no matter what I did. After the last attempt all seemed to be going well, but then it wouldn&#x27;t dry. I sat up for an hour and a half and eventually dozed off waiting for it to dry. Woke up the next morning and not only were there more bubbles, but every single nail was smudged because after an hour and a half, it still wasn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> I have mixed emotions about this polish. When I first bought my bottle it peeled off like a rubberized layer after the second day. Then the bottle got locked shut from the polish drying around the threads. I finally got it opened and used pure acetone to thin it because it had thickened over time. It bubbles now, it did not bubble when it was new but I wait until they are almost dry and rub the bubbles to help smooth them. It helps strengthen my nails so they don&#x27;t bend or chip as easily and it looks good on. The tips start to chip on the third day but I&#x27;m hard on my nails. Pure acetone from beauty supply stores work better then non acetone (which I used to us) non acetone takes forever to dissolve this.</li>
            <li> This stuff could not be more useless.  I&#x27;ve never had a wrap this weak and flimsy, that&#x27;s for sure.  Bubbles like crazy from the very first use.  Does NOT add any strength at all.  My nails are super bendy and weak and every time they bend, I get cracks in the polish.  No.  Just no.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product it helps give your nail strength and protects.</li>
            <li> I have read the reviews..good and bad..and what I&#x27;ve found is that there is a technique to this nail polish. I have been using \\&quot;nailtek 2\\&quot; which works wonderful but over time i think your nails become a bit immune to it. so i tried this HAW. after applying it myself at home i noticed it was sticky and bubbly..well i took it to the nail salon along with my NailTek2 and had my manicurist to apply it..and whowhee...this is amazing. she applied 2 to 3 very thin layers and had me to dry my nails in front of a fan as she applied to the other hand. she then applied the NailTek2, my nail color and Sceche Vite fast drying topcoat. My nails still look amazing after 4days and they are hard and smooth. This stuff really is amazing once u figure out to get it to work it is actually a must have. I must note, that i have soft weak nails because of the acrylics and had been trying for a year to get my nails back on track..this had been a the best thing yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people are saying that this is hard to remove- I had NO issue taking this off when I wanted to paint my nails again! I don&#x27;t experience any bubbles, either! Maybe if you apply too much it could get bubbly, but I did NOT have that issue. It&#x27;s good for the price- I&#x27;ll say that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better than bare nails, but it won&#x27;t replace a an acrylic/gel manicure or a salon treatment. It does smooth out your nails and make them feel stronger so that your color goes on nicely and evenly.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product and seller.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have very weak, thin, peeling/splitting nails. I have tried all of Sally Hansen&#x27;s nail products that claim to harden nails, with no success. I finally decided to try this one because it looked better. I hate it, too. The stuff is extremely thick and globby,and forms annoying little &#x27;strings&#x27;; it is very hard to work with when painting it on. Then it takes literally at least one full hour to dry. It always has air bubbles when it dries. And, even when it is &#x27;dry&#x27;, for instance, an entire day later, it still doesn&#x27;t feel dry. It always retains that horrible &#x27;tacky&#x27; feeling, no matter how long it&#x27;s been on there. And here&#x27;s the worst part of all: it DOES ahere to the nail quite strongly, which sounds like a good thing, but it&#x27;s not. Instead of working to actually strengthen and heal the natural nail, it just sticks to it really hard, and then within 2-3 days, it will start peeling....taking layers of your own nail with it!!I tried so hard to like this product, but after a few weeks of using it, my own weak and peeling nails had gotten perhaps ten times worse! That is NOT what I wanted, obviously. So, I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this product for anybody, and especially not for people who have weak nails - this will make them worse! I have also come to the conclusion that all of Sally Hansen&#x27;s products are nothing but junk. I was just trying to be cheap, but I think it&#x27;s time to pay a little extra and try out some better brands.</li>
            <li> I have been using SH products for years and have come to associate the name with quality products at a very reasonable price.  I have been looking for something to use at-home that would give the same manicure-staying-potential as a salon soak-off mani.  I purchased this product earlier this week from my local big box store.  I figured it was Sally Hansen and I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  I did my nails as soon as I got my kids down for their naps.  I shaped and filed the tips, then buffed my nail beds and swiped everything down with polish remover.  I applied the polish and waited - there was the first disappointment.  It took much longer than 1 minute to dry.  But I figured if it worked to keep my nails strong while I had them covered with the polish, I could forgive the long dry time.  Since this turned into a longer nail job, I decided to put some color and top coat over the HAW.  I figured I could at least get a lasting mani out of the long-drying basecoat.  The HAW did not chip; however, today, the polish on my thumbs peeled off in one complete piece.  I&#x27;m giving this product two stars because at least it did not damage my nail - there was no peeling of the nail material whatsoever, but how disappointing that it did not adhere nearly as well as it should have done.</li>
            <li> I have relied on this product for years. As a top-coat, it is marvelous. 2 coats and your nails are almost like acrylics. You can buff down any bumpy spots with a soft file meant for buffing and polishing acrylic nails [[ASIN:B0037O2J7I 4 Way Shiny Block / 4 Step Buffing Block Shine Nail Buffer]]. I have to buy a new bottle every so often or I DO get bubbles (It thickens to soft plastic over time), so I&#x27;ve learned to roll it between my hands and then set it under one of my hotter desk lamps for ten minutes or so before using. I store it at normal room temp with my other polishes. I save TONS of money by using this product for my clear acrylic fills. Seriously, It&#x27;s THAT thick. It blends right in at the base of my nail, dries fast and then I just smooth it down with a professional file and I can go for months without seeing the nail tech. I even use it in lieu of harsh super glues or nail glues when I get a nail edge lifting a bit. Just gently brush on in that area so the polish soaks underneath the lift and file smooth once dry. YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO highly recommend you have one other product on-hand when you use this stuff: Bath &amp; Body Works 60 Second Manicure Hand Scrub from their True Blue Line. [[ASIN:B006T8C8MA True Blue Spa 60-second Manicure Hand Scrub - Just a Minute]] You will be amazed at how your rough cuticles and little hang-nails disappear and are replaced with a beautiful salon-worthy look in just a moment. Your hands and nails will be free of that white dry skin that appears in the winter and feel so soft and look so lovely. I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff. A must-have with or without the Sally Hansen product, but they go SO WELL together! I use the scrub before EVERY manicure, even if it&#x27;s just slapping on a quick coat of clear polish or just going \\&quot;naked.\\&quot; You will soon find yourself making little gift bags of these two products plus a nice file as little gifts for all of your girlfriends ... that&#x27;s how much you&#x27;ll love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start with the scrub, move on to my polish or acrylic fill-in and my nails look gorgeous again in ten minutes! If I accidentally bump or smudge the Hard as Nails, I just dab on a bit more to fill in the spot, let dry, and file down any lumps or bumps just like an acrylic. No big deal. Polish underneath unharmed! LOVE EET!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the serious business: If it stays on so darn well, how easily does it come off? Well ... not so easy. I have the best luck with an Acetone remover. Before you cringe, let me finish out my review. I use Onyx Professional 100% Pure Acetone Remover in the little dipping pot with the plastic scrubbing bristles at the bottom. I buy it at Walmart for a little over $2. It makes quick work of the polish, but your fingers come out white and dry as a bone and nails look very sad and malnourished. Hit up that 60 second manicure afterward and your hands will look gorgeous and revitalized once again. Then put lots of good lotion on your hands, fingers, cuticles and nails and give &#x27;em a rest for a day before the next polishing. Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27; t take a risk using this product. I did and I am going in to my third week of issues from using this product followed the direction that came with the kit wore them for 2 days then had to remove them on the second day because my fingers were swelling up red and itching then my nail beds.</li>
            <li> Usually I love Sally Hanson products but this one is a huge disappointment.  After a shower or dishes or whatnot it just peels off like a nail sticker. You may as well save your money and apply elmers school glue if thats the sort of thing you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> I just applied it 15 minutes ago. It&#x27;s dry. There&#x27;s no bubbles. It works just fine. I definitely buy some again. And I&#x27;ll add on to this review once I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> For the love of god, don&#x27;t shake it! When I first bought this product, I hated it because the finishing product always had air bubbles in it. But then I read a few other reviews and realized the reason for that was because the shaking action was causing the air bubbles. By rolling it in my hand and tilting it upside gently a few times, I was able to get a nice shiny base coat that nail polish adhered to well.</li>
            <li> before buying this product, I read every review, good and bad to get an idea of what to expect. Based on other reviews I garnered that this product can peel, needs multiple coats, bubbles, but also is a good hardener. Based on my experience, 1 coat isn&#x27;t going to help you. You definitely need at LEAST 3 coats to get any sort of structure. Right now, I have on about 9 or 10 coats. Its not thick, it&#x27;s shiny, but it DOES bubble. It does dry relatively fast, but keep in mind, if you&#x27;re going to do multiple coats, give each layer about 2-3 mins to really dry, it will also help reduce bubbling. I&#x27;m personally not too concerned about the bubbling because I care more about not having my nails break than having them flawlessly shiny. I&#x27;m usually extremely rough with my hands/nails and have no trouble breaking a nail while putting on jeans, taking off running shoes, etc, but as of right now, all my nails (except my left thumb) are past my finger tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I WOULD buy this again and would recommend to anyone looking for an affordable nail hardener.</li>
            <li> No matter how careful, tiny bubbles are visable when it (eventually) dries. It chips after a day or 2, and is hard to remove.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not thick like gel.  After 2 tries, it went into the garbage.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a gel base coat, i know this isn&#x27;t really it but i wanted to try it. at first i was in love with it.. went on so smooth, made my nail polish VERY smooth and gel-like. but it starts chipping really bad the next day. i&#x27;ve used it 3 different times and each time it chips very soon.. i wont buy again but i wish it didn&#x27;t chip so soon becauase i love the way it makes my nail polish look...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I work in a profession in which I must wash my hands frequently. As a result, my nails are constantly peeling. I bought this by accident, thinking I had grabbed a bottle of Hard As Nails. When I realized my mistake I tried it anyway with good results. One thin coat protects my nails for a week. It has a high shine and provides strength. I often gets compliments on my manicure and have been asked which salon I use. For those having issues with bubbles; don&#x27;t shake the bottle but gently roll it. If it takes too long to dry try using a thinner coat.  It&#x27;s not the same consistency as a nail polish/color so it does take a slightly different technique to get desired results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find this polish to be any different from any other clear polish. It chips after a day or two and is not thick and doesn&#x27;t make my nails strong at all.</li>
            <li> Some other posters complain that this peels off, but I haven&#x27;t found that to occur if  I&#x27;ve scrubbed by nails first with a product (I use Dawn dish detergent) which removes residual oils.  It seems to be protecting a nail which was damaged by an infection, as it grows in.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the blue color in/of the bottle is invisible in use.  It looks like clear polish.</li>
            <li> It took forever to dry - about 2 hrs. And about an hour to remove it!! My nails look awful. It makes me wonder what nasty ingredients are in it.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Sally&#x27;s for twice the price! It works great. I do not use a UV light but I do recommend it if you have one. The first time I used it I noticed air bubbles but I did shake the bottle up violently. This is what causes bubbles. I cleaned my nails, filed, and then placed a coat. Allowed to dry - it really took almost an hour with blowing on it. But my nails feel protected. Not acrylic thick, but protected. I then applied several more coats, one coat at a time, waiting several hours between for complete drying. My nails look great! I have had it on a week now, I do dishes, diapers, typing, banging on stuff, cleaning, snagging etc and I just noticed a teansy tiny chip on my thumb. Love it!</li>
            <li> I did not buy this through Amazon, big mistake because I paid 2x this price, but I was in a hurry. I just got engaged and needed to make my nails look nice... Everyone is looking at my hands. But nail polish does not stay on my nails AT ALL. It peels off in sheets, which had just happened after a day. So I was looking for something to dry out/harden my nails and polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails are thick, long nail beds, and very moist and flexible, but not very good a growing long(I&#x27;m a klutz and work with kids and am always in a hurry). They are also fairly flat at the tips. I bought this and started prepping my nails. Wash with warm water, use nail polish remover on bare nails to dry them out(only thing that makes polish last a day instead of hours), wash again scrubbing with a nail brush. If the nails are not matte after that, I lightly buff with a fine file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This polish takes practice. Do not shake it, it will bubble! This is way thicker than regular polish and you have to put a thick-ish layer to make it spread. But once it dries it is a lot thinner than you think it will be. It will take a while to dry, but be patient and use a hair dryer. I practiced on one hand after seeing how it came out of the bottle. By the time I switched hands I could get it bubble and streak free. It is SUPER shiny and lovely if you get it right. It hardened my nails so they don&#x27;t flex when I press on them, and the flat tips have curled nicely. Combined with frenchtips, it looks awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I will buy this again.</li>
