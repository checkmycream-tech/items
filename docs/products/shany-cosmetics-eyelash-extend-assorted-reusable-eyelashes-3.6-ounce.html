            <li>This set contains a nice variety of quality eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I used my own lash adhesive and had no problems with them falling off.</li>

            <li>and ive been trying to find good lashes for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>I loved the variety and fit of the lashes.</li>
            <li>Pricing was amazing but the product was outstanding.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t need them to be, I am a photographer as well as a makeup artist and these photograph beautifully.</li>
            <li>It is rare to find a good quality set of false lashes but SHANY has truly delivered excellent quality for an exceptional price!!</li>
            <li>i just simply love them.</li>
            <li>I have wore them more than once.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love these lashes.</li>
            <li>Most of the lash sets look hideous once they are on.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off just buying Ardell lashes at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>Great lashes, really.  </li>
            <li>Some lashes are more complimenting than others</li>
            <li>The pair I love most is Set 2-8.</li>
            <li>I love these lashes....</li>
            <li>also I get about 5 or more uses out of a pair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I just love these....</li>
            <li>and I love love the feathery looking ones.</li>
            <li>I love these lashes .</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I love these lashes, I will definetley rebuy these</li>
            <li>And they&#x27;re reusable, which makes it even better.</li>
            <li>i love each model of them...</li>
            <li>Recommended..:)</li>
            <li>These are ok...</li>
            <li>Some of these design were cute..</li>
            <li>I was in love with each and every style.</li>
            <li>so cute.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the variety of these.</li>
            <li>Affordable, Cute</li>
            <li>I love these eyelashes.</li>
            <li>and I love the way they look.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>Though I reccomended buying a better lash glue.</li>
            <li>I would say the tend to lean a bit more toward overthetop however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure you have some eyelash glue separately though, because most of the mini glue containers that were packaged with the lashes</li>
            <li>Have you tried these eyelash extenders yet?Well, you have to they look so cute and sexy on your eyes and so easy to remove afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited because I&#x27;ve been waiting for kits like these to come out!</li>
            <li>would say it is definitely worth the money since these are reusable and each pack comes with its own bottle of glue.&lt;br /&gt;A+++++</li>
            <li>These lashes are worth the price! :)</li>
            <li>These lashes are easy to use and put on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Trust me they do not tear easily.  </li>
            <li>For less than a dollar a pair, these are a great value and very cute lashes.</li>
            <li>They are so much more easier to take care and hold their shape very nicely which means they last longer.</li>
            <li>they feel like dollar store barbie hair very cute but very plastic.</li>
            <li>I would have given it a full 5 stars if it came with a better eyelash glue.  </li>
            <li>I love that they are all in a sleek box very pretty styles and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>are cute, chosen because I like good but two pairs are equal in the box are filled, the price was good I highly!</li>
            <li>They are all super cute</li>
            <li>Dont fit correctly.</li>
            <li>The lashes don&#x27;t seem to be made cheaply...</li>
            <li>They dont look as cheap as I had thought they would although they are synthetic.</li>
            <li>fit definatly would buy again</li>
            <li>These lashes can be cut to fit, can be put in you pocket and do not fall apart.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have to trim them to fit with my lashes :</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>But if you don&#x27;t, they bend easily to fit the shape of your eye and</li>
            <li>This product saved me from purchasing lashes that are much more costly from high on brands like M.A.C, as you get many lashes in one box.</li>
            <li>Am having fun with them!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pleased with these.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering a few more boxes These lashes will look great with the  looks</li>
            <li>i really like these lashes easy to put on and the different kind went really nice with each out</li>
            <li>have not used the individual lashes because, well , I just don&#x27;t know exactly how to use them lol.  </li>
            <li>Anyways , the full un-used box just sits on a shelf until I figure out who to give to give them to .</li>
            <li>I can put these on much easier than most</li>
            <li>Overall though, they were good color and quality.  </li>
            <li>I just wash the glue off with warm water and let dry in the container they came in :)</li>
            <li>Even still, they were easy to apply and this was my first time applying strip lashes on myself.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the many eyelash selections this product offers.</li>
            <li>If you get decent glue they&#x27;ll probably be ok.</li>
            <li>They look super cheap and they feel funny .i</li>
            <li>Very pleased and definitely will order this time and time again..</li>
            <li>I love these new lashes I got from SHANY.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li>These lashes look nice but are kind of hard to put on.  </li>
            <li>Pros: cute packaging, thick gorgeous lashes, cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: feels alot like plastic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are more natural looking ones out there.</li>
            <li>Just got them in the mail today and they are bold, beautiful and thick.</li>
            <li>This is the best synthetic lash ive ever seen (especially fo less than a dollar a pair!).</li>
            <li>Good quality lashes don&#x27;t look like plastic like other lashes on the market do.</li>
            <li>It is just much too strong; Unlike Mac, Ardell or Andrea lashes that are much easier to peel from the casing.</li>
            <li>With false eyelashes, you do not have to use as much mascara, and you look great and sexy in them.  </li>
            <li>Good thing this set was less than $10.</li>
            <li>Most definitely.</li>
            <li>I wear fake lashes every day and these were absolutely perfect.  </li>
            <li>They do have more of a solid band that holds the lash together as opposed to lashes you buy at a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>So if you are going to wear them, be ready to just peel them off and not use a remover!</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more of her lashes to test out.</li>
            <li>The reason they got a 4 is because the bands are so thick and the glue is not thaattt great</li>
            <li>lashes arrived packed in a pretty box set.</li>
            <li>and since Halloween is coming up would really recommend for those costumes or face paints where you want your eyes to stand out!</li>
            <li>Love these and you will have endless hours of fun while using these!</li>
            <li>I love the packaging and the way all 10 lash sets look however the lashes are very low quality.</li>
            <li>I ruined the first pair I tried to get out because of it.</li>
            <li>Be aware that the eyelashes are synthetic I prefer synthetic eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I love these lashes, lots of different styles to try-</li>
            <li>I like some better than others personally.</li>
            <li>I first tried SHANY eyelashes</li>
            <li>However it also makes them better for wearing multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I definitely plan to purchase more really soon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to get multiple wears out of mine which I really like.</li>
            <li>The eyelashes aren&#x27;t too long like some more inexpensive brands.</li>
            <li>so I almost not sure how they would handle a good night&#x27;s sleep.  </li>
            <li>I bought some new excellent adhesive which last longer than Duo, which is what  I usually buy, these will sty on well with that adhesive.</li>
            <li>Mine were easy enough to remove from the package .</li>
            <li>Bought these for a play, and they are dramatic and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Lashes were very bold &amp; dramatic but not too long which I loved!</li>
            <li>They were VERY plastic - and they poke your eyes.</li>
            <li>I really like these lashes by SHANY.</li>
            <li>I really dislike this eyelash set.</li>
            <li>The price for the lashes are very inexpensive and can be used over and over again.</li>
            <li>Ounce]]metics.the eyelashes are very slick,thick,shiny and voulumous.it makes makeup go</li>
            <li>I really like Darkness lashes</li>
            <li>I really do.</li>
            <li>Holds there shape very well.</li>
            <li>With that in mind, do not order these if you want a real hair lash because they are not comparable.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I really like the lashes, but for some reason, lash glue was not included.  </li>
            <li>Received these today I ordered from Shanycosmetics.com site and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses them for competitive dance and they hold up very well.</li>
            <li>They are very durable</li>
            <li>and wasent really felling them.</li>
            <li>My wife says she has saved so much money using these.</li>
            <li>others were too much.</li>
            <li>OK I was SHOCKED at the quality of these lashes--considering there were SO MANY and CHEAP!</li>
            <li>They may not be real hair</li>
            <li>I wish they were available individually.</li>
            <li>I was really exicted about ordering these lashes .</li>
            <li>Great for beginners who are just learning to use false eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I like the lashes made of human hair, they look more natural.</li>
            <li>I usually buy drug store eyelashes, but this set is a way better deal!</li>
            <li>(And not repeating sets like most other brands.)</li>
            <li>These lashes are great with any outfit or hairstyle, and I would reccommend to anyone who is going for a dramatic look.</li>
            <li>For special occasions especially when there will be photography, lashes are a must!</li>
            <li>They are glamorous, dramatic, and intense and Their quality is amazing!</li>
            <li>use tweezers--look DOWN and put em on :)  </li>
            <li>However, not all of these shapes and styles are particularly flattering.</li>
            <li>At first they felt a little cheap</li>
            <li>Have fun trying the different lengths and types.  </li>
            <li>Normally eyelashes are like 4 bucks for one pair.</li>
            <li>Wheither it&#x27;s a set of full lashes or single lashes , you have your pick in this assortment.</li>
            <li>Just try something new.</li>
            <li>I bought these lashes after loving the colored set I bought a few weeks back.</li>
            <li>They stay on BETTER and EASIER than the more expensive ones!</li>
            <li>they will last multiple uses if you carefully clean them.</li>
            <li>Really thick and full but super soft looking and feeling too.</li>
            <li>But if you want a ton of black lashes for cheap, these will do the job.</li>
            <li>So far, I have been able to wear each pair at least twice if you clean them carefully.</li>
            <li>I tore half of the top of the band off , where only the clear band showed .</li>
            <li>However, since the audience is far enough, this wasn&#x27;t too large a problem.</li>
            <li>out of this whole box i only used one pair and the rest are sitting in my drawer.</li>
            <li>I must say I was very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>most of them feel fake and plastic, out of the entire box, I was only able to use about 4 pair.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and have a flexible lash line.</li>
            <li>I really like the face that their all different styles.</li>
            <li>The description &amp;#34;from subtle to overthetop&amp;#34; is very accurate.</li>
            <li>But the other lashes are well worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;You can wear these whether you want to go out or even for halloween.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something that was a little less costume-y for  more normal wear.</li>
            <li>Perhaps for a really, over the top event these might work, but for a date night or night out, too fake looking.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it was cheap and not too hard to use.</li>
            <li>They are definitely reusable, just avoid applying mascara directly onto eyelash.</li>
            <li>The eyelashes are very well made and last through several days of use with proper wearing, handling, and care.</li>
            <li>SO DISAPPOINTED!Lost 3 sets so far and have 5 left.</li>
            <li>They can be classy yet costumey depending on the type of makeup you pair up with it.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing eyelashes from SHANY again!</li>
            <li>I liked some but some where too think and looked weird on mee</li>
            <li>Though I do not have this product, I know that very long, thick and dramatic lashes are valued greatly by women, and I have tried eyelash extensions in the past, and was quite pleased with them.  </li>
            <li>If you are into the dramatic, sexy look.  </li>
            <li>I use false eyelashes frequently for performances and these are wonderfully dramatic and great for show.</li>

            <li> This set contains a nice variety of quality eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I used my own lash adhesive and had no problems with them falling off.</li>
            <li> Of the 10 eyelash options in the kit, I liked about 7.</li>

            <li> and ive been trying to find good lashes for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I loved the variety and fit of the lashes.</li>
            <li> Pricing was amazing but the product was outstanding.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t need them to be, I am a photographer as well as a makeup artist and these photograph beautifully.</li>
            <li> It is rare to find a good quality set of false lashes but SHANY has truly delivered excellent quality for an exceptional price!!</li>
            <li> i just simply love them.</li>
            <li> I have wore them more than once.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes.</li>
            <li> Most of the lash sets look hideous once they are on.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off just buying Ardell lashes at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Great lashes, really.  </li>
            <li> Some lashes are more complimenting than others</li>
            <li> The pair I love most is Set 2-8.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes....</li>
            <li> also I get about 5 or more uses out of a pair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I just love these....</li>
            <li> and I love love the feathery looking ones.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I love these lashes, I will definetley rebuy these</li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re reusable, which makes it even better.</li>
            <li> i love each model of them...</li>
            <li> Recommended..:)</li>
            <li> These are ok...</li>
            <li> Some of these design were cute..</li>
            <li> I was in love with each and every style.</li>
            <li> so cute.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the variety of these.</li>
            <li> Affordable, Cute</li>
            <li> I love these eyelashes.</li>
            <li> and I love the way they look.</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> Though I reccomended buying a better lash glue.</li>
            <li> I would say the tend to lean a bit more toward overthetop however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sure you have some eyelash glue separately though, because most of the mini glue containers that were packaged with the lashes</li>
            <li> Have you tried these eyelash extenders yet?Well, you have to they look so cute and sexy on your eyes and so easy to remove afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited because I&#x27;ve been waiting for kits like these to come out!</li>
            <li> would say it is definitely worth the money since these are reusable and each pack comes with its own bottle of glue.&lt;br /&gt;A+++++</li>
            <li> These lashes are worth the price! :)</li>
            <li> These lashes are easy to use and put on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trust me they do not tear easily.  </li>
            <li> For less than a dollar a pair, these are a great value and very cute lashes.</li>
            <li> They are so much more easier to take care and hold their shape very nicely which means they last longer.</li>
            <li> they feel like dollar store barbie hair very cute but very plastic.</li>
            <li> I would have given it a full 5 stars if it came with a better eyelash glue.  </li>
            <li> I love that they are all in a sleek box very pretty styles and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> are cute, chosen because I like good but two pairs are equal in the box are filled, the price was good I highly!</li>
            <li> They are all super cute</li>
            <li> Dont fit correctly.</li>
            <li> The lashes don&#x27;t seem to be made cheaply...</li>
            <li> They dont look as cheap as I had thought they would although they are synthetic.</li>
            <li> fit definatly would buy again</li>
            <li> These lashes can be cut to fit, can be put in you pocket and do not fall apart.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have to trim them to fit with my lashes :</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> But if you don&#x27;t, they bend easily to fit the shape of your eye and</li>
            <li> This product saved me from purchasing lashes that are much more costly from high on brands like M.A.C, as you get many lashes in one box.</li>
            <li> Am having fun with them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pleased with these.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering a few more boxes These lashes will look great with the  looks</li>
            <li> i really like these lashes easy to put on and the different kind went really nice with each out</li>
            <li> have not used the individual lashes because, well , I just don&#x27;t know exactly how to use them lol.  </li>
            <li> Anyways , the full un-used box just sits on a shelf until I figure out who to give to give them to .</li>
            <li> I can put these on much easier than most</li>
            <li> Overall though, they were good color and quality.  </li>
            <li> I just wash the glue off with warm water and let dry in the container they came in :)</li>
            <li> Even still, they were easy to apply and this was my first time applying strip lashes on myself.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the many eyelash selections this product offers.</li>
            <li> If you get decent glue they&#x27;ll probably be ok.</li>
            <li> They look super cheap and they feel funny .i</li>
            <li> Very pleased and definitely will order this time and time again..</li>
            <li> I love these new lashes I got from SHANY.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> These lashes look nice but are kind of hard to put on.  </li>
            <li> Pros: cute packaging, thick gorgeous lashes, cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: feels alot like plastic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are more natural looking ones out there.</li>
            <li> Just got them in the mail today and they are bold, beautiful and thick.</li>
            <li> This is the best synthetic lash ive ever seen (especially fo less than a dollar a pair!).</li>
            <li> Good quality lashes don&#x27;t look like plastic like other lashes on the market do.</li>
            <li> It is just much too strong; Unlike Mac, Ardell or Andrea lashes that are much easier to peel from the casing.</li>
            <li> With false eyelashes, you do not have to use as much mascara, and you look great and sexy in them.  </li>
            <li> Good thing this set was less than $10.</li>
            <li> Most definitely.</li>
            <li> I wear fake lashes every day and these were absolutely perfect.  </li>
            <li> They do have more of a solid band that holds the lash together as opposed to lashes you buy at a beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> So if you are going to wear them, be ready to just peel them off and not use a remover!</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more of her lashes to test out.</li>
            <li> The reason they got a 4 is because the bands are so thick and the glue is not thaattt great</li>
            <li> lashes arrived packed in a pretty box set.</li>
            <li> and since Halloween is coming up would really recommend for those costumes or face paints where you want your eyes to stand out!</li>
            <li> Love these and you will have endless hours of fun while using these!</li>
            <li> I love the packaging and the way all 10 lash sets look however the lashes are very low quality.</li>
            <li> I ruined the first pair I tried to get out because of it.</li>
            <li> Be aware that the eyelashes are synthetic I prefer synthetic eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes, lots of different styles to try-</li>
            <li> I like some better than others personally.</li>
            <li> I first tried SHANY eyelashes</li>
            <li> However it also makes them better for wearing multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I definitely plan to purchase more really soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to get multiple wears out of mine which I really like.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes aren&#x27;t too long like some more inexpensive brands.</li>
            <li> so I almost not sure how they would handle a good night&#x27;s sleep.  </li>
            <li> I bought some new excellent adhesive which last longer than Duo, which is what  I usually buy, these will sty on well with that adhesive.</li>
            <li> Mine were easy enough to remove from the package .</li>
            <li> Bought these for a play, and they are dramatic and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Lashes were very bold &amp; dramatic but not too long which I loved!</li>
            <li> They were VERY plastic - and they poke your eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like these lashes by SHANY.</li>
            <li> I really dislike this eyelash set.</li>
            <li> The price for the lashes are very inexpensive and can be used over and over again.</li>
            <li> Ounce]]metics.the eyelashes are very slick,thick,shiny and voulumous.it makes makeup go</li>
            <li> I really like Darkness lashes</li>
            <li> I really do.</li>
            <li> Holds there shape very well.</li>
            <li> With that in mind, do not order these if you want a real hair lash because they are not comparable.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I really like the lashes, but for some reason, lash glue was not included.  </li>
            <li> Received these today I ordered from Shanycosmetics.com site and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses them for competitive dance and they hold up very well.</li>
            <li> They are very durable</li>
            <li> and wasent really felling them.</li>
            <li> My wife says she has saved so much money using these.</li>
            <li> others were too much.</li>
            <li> OK I was SHOCKED at the quality of these lashes--considering there were SO MANY and CHEAP!</li>
            <li> They may not be real hair</li>
            <li> I wish they were available individually.</li>
            <li> I was really exicted about ordering these lashes .</li>
            <li> Great for beginners who are just learning to use false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I like the lashes made of human hair, they look more natural.</li>
            <li> I usually buy drug store eyelashes, but this set is a way better deal!</li>
            <li> (And not repeating sets like most other brands.)</li>
            <li> These lashes are great with any outfit or hairstyle, and I would reccommend to anyone who is going for a dramatic look.</li>
            <li> For special occasions especially when there will be photography, lashes are a must!</li>
            <li> They are glamorous, dramatic, and intense and Their quality is amazing!</li>
            <li> use tweezers--look DOWN and put em on :)  </li>
            <li> However, not all of these shapes and styles are particularly flattering.</li>
            <li> At first they felt a little cheap</li>
            <li> Have fun trying the different lengths and types.  </li>
            <li> Normally eyelashes are like 4 bucks for one pair.</li>
            <li> Wheither it&#x27;s a set of full lashes or single lashes , you have your pick in this assortment.</li>
            <li> Just try something new.</li>
            <li> I bought these lashes after loving the colored set I bought a few weeks back.</li>
            <li> They stay on BETTER and EASIER than the more expensive ones!</li>
            <li> they will last multiple uses if you carefully clean them.</li>
            <li> Really thick and full but super soft looking and feeling too.</li>
            <li> But if you want a ton of black lashes for cheap, these will do the job.</li>
            <li> So far, I have been able to wear each pair at least twice if you clean them carefully.</li>
            <li> I tore half of the top of the band off , where only the clear band showed .</li>
            <li> However, since the audience is far enough, this wasn&#x27;t too large a problem.</li>
            <li> out of this whole box i only used one pair and the rest are sitting in my drawer.</li>
            <li> I must say I was very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> most of them feel fake and plastic, out of the entire box, I was only able to use about 4 pair.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and have a flexible lash line.</li>
            <li> I really like the face that their all different styles.</li>
            <li> The description &amp;#34;from subtle to overthetop&amp;#34; is very accurate.</li>
            <li> But the other lashes are well worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;You can wear these whether you want to go out or even for halloween.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something that was a little less costume-y for  more normal wear.</li>
            <li> Perhaps for a really, over the top event these might work, but for a date night or night out, too fake looking.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it was cheap and not too hard to use.</li>
            <li> They are definitely reusable, just avoid applying mascara directly onto eyelash.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes are very well made and last through several days of use with proper wearing, handling, and care.</li>
            <li> SO DISAPPOINTED!Lost 3 sets so far and have 5 left.</li>
            <li> They can be classy yet costumey depending on the type of makeup you pair up with it.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing eyelashes from SHANY again!</li>
            <li> I liked some but some where too think and looked weird on mee</li>
            <li> Though I do not have this product, I know that very long, thick and dramatic lashes are valued greatly by women, and I have tried eyelash extensions in the past, and was quite pleased with them.  </li>
            <li> If you are into the dramatic, sexy look.  </li>
            <li> I use false eyelashes frequently for performances and these are wonderfully dramatic and great for show.</li>
            <li> Packaging was nice and nothing was missing or broken.</li>
            <li> You get 9 full lashes (which are a bit dramatic so if you like natural get set 1), and one set of single lashes.</li>
            <li> At least three pair of the eyelashes just ripped apart when I was trying to pull them from the package, and very gently I might add.</li>
            <li> Every lash set I have tried using (3 so far) has resulted in the lash hairs falling out or the lashes simply breaking in half.</li>
            <li> I just received mines today and I was thrilled with the lashes, and gave me the definite dramatic affect I was looking for!!</li>
            <li> I also bought the less dramatic #1 set and love them as well.</li>
            <li> I had to throw out two sets of lashes so far because they were glued to tight to the packing and the lashes rip off.</li>
            <li> You can go for your everyday eyelash, to a more dramatic lash, too.</li>
            <li> No I didn&#x27;t wear any of them ( I already have long lashes ) .</li>
            <li> I ripped one off my eye after a long night of partying and it did not rip apart.  </li>
            <li> Just be extra careful.</li>
            <li> Usually my wife uses a new pair every time my daughter goes on stage.</li>
            <li> When I used the glue the lashes did not stick for very long, however when I bought glue from the store they stayed on all night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are two pairs I feel are not as thick, which is nice when you want a casual look.</li>
            <li> 10 pairs for a single digit cost.</li>
            <li> They put a strip of glue down THE ENTIRE EYELASH!</li>
            <li> Theses cover everything I could need for a basic black lash style.</li>
            <li> They come all individually packaged in little cases--</li>
            <li> I hate to write a bad review because I love the company so much, but these lashes arent worth buying.</li>
            <li> However have worn a few pairs multiple times with no problem.  </li>
            <li> I like looking like a drag queen</li>
            <li> Because she is 6, she isn&#x27;t careful with the lashes.</li>
            <li> They hurt my eyes, i was scractching so much i irritated my eye and when you are trying to put them on its so hard because the lashes are so stiff!</li>
            <li> Other lashes I have purchased, might wear twice  and the start to come apart.</li>
            <li> I have no need for my other lashes now.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews for this product where there was no problem like this.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are nice and thick for that dramatic look looooove them!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely new to false eyelashes but the instructions are easy and the application isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> i bought their thin version too, same price but different design.</li>
            <li> I am definitely going to try the THIN collection next!</li>
            <li> From dramatic to an everyday look these will help complete your makeup look definitely!</li>
            <li> You know the trick...put glue on the lashes..blow a few seconds to dry it a bit..</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick hence the two stars but the lashes were so uncomfortable!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when I used a remover to loosen the glue, they fell apart.  </li>
            <li> My only problem was the band was thick</li>
            <li> I actually re-ordered them from before, and I didn&#x27;t see that they no longer had the fun colors, so I was disappointed that these were all black.</li>
            <li> My biggest peeve is the glue they are secured down to the case with.</li>
            <li> At less than $1.00 for each set</li>
            <li> either I couldn&#x27;t get any glue to come out of, or what did come out was slightly hardened and didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> so big and thick, without being so very heavy.</li>
            <li> but i wanted my eyes to look a little bit fuller</li>
            <li> so i was a little nervous</li>
            <li> These are synthetic lashes so expect a little \\&quot;shine\\&quot; to them.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t have the heavy weight that some do....</li>
            <li> if you wear lashes everyday you know that the price is immaculate</li>
            <li> lots of choices for everyday wear....</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the band is a little thick which will be hard for beginners and they dont come with glue.</li>
            <li> I live for thick and dramatic lashes!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very thick &amp; dramatic so they&#x27;re definitely not an everyday thing.</li>
            <li> sometimes, these lashes are obviously fake ones, a little long so you will have to trim them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with the glue included though!</li>
            <li> The bands are very stiff.</li>
            <li> so they were hard to apply to the lash line .</li>
            <li> I have worn them each at least 5 times a pair.</li>
            <li> I have practically negative lash that no amount of miracle mascara helps.  </li>
            <li> I bought the thick shany eyelash set...</li>
            <li> Also, they are thick and durable.</li>
            <li> The lash band is a bit on the thick side , but nonetheless I dont think I will find this quality and variety</li>
            <li> I mean  I got what I paid for</li>

            <li> I bought this lashes because i had bought the thin version before</li>
            <li> These feel really fake and the band is really thick.  </li>

            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to come with glue though which is annoying, but other than that</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a big fan of any Shany product. But these I wasn&#x27;t too happy with. At least three pair of the eyelashes just ripped apart when I was trying to pull them from the package, and very gently I might add. They were VERY plastic - and they poke your eyes. Dont fit correctly. I did find two pair that I managed to make work though. I hate to write a bad review because I love the company so much, but these lashes arent worth buying.</li>
            <li> This product saved me from purchasing lashes that are much more costly from high on brands like M.A.C, as you get many lashes in one box. They are also all reusable.</li>
            <li> LOVE! Just got them in the mail today and they are bold, beautiful and thick. There is plenty of options to choose from. Can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
            <li> I use false eyelashes frequently for performances and these are wonderfully dramatic and great for show. However, the lashes are somewhat weakly attached to the base, making it difficult to detach each lash from the plastic container. I have had some lashes fall off in the process. However, since the audience is far enough, this wasn&#x27;t too large a problem. Otherwise, the selection and price is great. Would I purchase this again? Most definitely.</li>
            <li> No I didn&#x27;t wear any of them ( I already have long lashes ) . Bought these for my girlfriend hoping she would wear them to highlight her eyes but she never even tried any on . Something about her not wanting to put glue on her eye lids or whatever . Anyways , the full un-used box just sits on a shelf until I figure out who to give to give them to .</li>
            <li> Awesome collection of showy eyelashes. I have used almost all of them and they have made my eyes POP!</li>
            <li> I bought this lashes because i had bought the thin version before and i liked them but i wanted my eyes to look a little bit fuller so i decided to purchase these. The shipping was quick hence the two stars but the lashes were so uncomfortable! They hurt my eyes, i was scractching so much i irritated my eye and when you are trying to put them on its so hard because the lashes are so stiff! out of this whole box i only used one pair and the rest are sitting in my drawer. Dont buy unless your trying to waste money!!!</li>
            <li> Ive been wearing lashes for a while and ive been trying to find good lashes for a cheap price. These are it! You get 9 full lashes (which are a bit dramatic so if you like natural get set 1), and one set of single lashes. At first they felt a little cheap so i was a little nervous but they look great on. For the price and quality, you cant go wrong. I love them! My only complaint is the band is a little thick which will be hard for beginners and they dont come with glue.</li>
            <li> I bought these lashes after loving the colored set I bought a few weeks back. I wanted something that was a little less costume-y for  more normal wear. I loved the variety and fit of the lashes. They shipped incredibly quickly and came in perfect condition. The glue that is included actually works and there is enough for multiple wears. Perfect!!</li>
            <li> i love these!!! they&#x27;re all nicely put in the box (exactly the one showed in the picture) and the effect just great! i bought their thin version too, same price but different design. i just simply love them. 10 pairs for a single digit cost. go for it!</li>
            <li> I must say I was very pleasantly surprised.  These are extremely great eyelashes....If you are into the dramatic, sexy look.  I wear fake lashes every day and these were absolutely perfect.  They didn&#x27;t have the heavy weight that some do....they shine, which makes your eyes pop, and are of good quality.  I will be purchasing more!!!  GREAT JOB!!!!!</li>
            <li> I liked some but some where too think and looked weird on mee</li>
            <li> I really like these lashes by SHANY. The lashes don&#x27;t seem to be made cheaply...I have wore them more than once.Other lashes I have purchased, might wear twice  and the start to come apart.</li>
            <li> i loved this eyelashes so much&lt;br /&gt;i can wear diffrent lash every day&lt;br /&gt;i recommend it to every one .</li>
            <li> These lashes are great. They are easy to use and they give your eyes a beautiful look.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Lashes were very bold &amp; dramatic but not too long which I loved! They do have more of a solid band that holds the lash together as opposed to lashes you buy at a beauty supply store. Even still, they were easy to apply and this was my first time applying strip lashes on myself. They are definitely reusable, just avoid applying mascara directly onto eyelash. Will be purchasing more! Great buy!</li>
            <li> I bought the thick shany eyelash set... Blown away by the quality &amp; quantity for the price. The only con is that the set doesn&#x27;t come with glue... There is adhesive on the lashes but no extra glue to set them. I&#x27;ll just run to Sallys to pick that up.</li>
            <li> most of them feel fake and plastic, out of the entire box, I was only able to use about 4 pair. too sad, very disappointed</li>
            <li> Enjoy the many eyelash selections this product offers. Have fun trying the different lengths and types.  This is a good product, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes. They are nice for the price and each pair comes with a tube of glue.</li>
            <li> I really dislike this eyelash set. The bands are very stiff. Most of the lash sets look hideous once they are on. There were only 1 or 2 varieties in the set that I could actually wear. You&#x27;re better off just buying Ardell lashes at the drugstore. They look so much better and aren&#x27;t expensive. I threw this eyelash set in the trash because I was so aggravated with it.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes! Great set!</li>
            <li> These lashes are great with any outfit or hairstyle, and I would reccommend to anyone who is going for a dramatic look. There are two pairs I feel are not as thick, which is nice when you want a casual look. I am definitely going to try the THIN collection next! The fact they are reusable is also great because you get your money&#x27;s worth and then some!</li>
            <li> Bought these for a play, and they are dramatic and beautiful.  Great lashes, really.  My only complaint is that when I used a remover to loosen the glue, they fell apart.  So if you are going to wear them, be ready to just peel them off and not use a remover!</li>
            <li> The eyelashes are very well made and last through several days of use with proper wearing, handling, and care. The eyelashes aren&#x27;t too long like some more inexpensive brands. Some lashes are more complimenting than others and I wished Shany sold one pair per set. The pair I love most is Set 2-8.</li>
            <li> These are the best eyelashes thank you for your great price</li>
            <li> I love these lashes!!! 1st if you wear lashes everyday you know that the price is immaculate but it doesn&#x27;t stop there.  These lashes are beautiful.  They are reusable if you take care of them.  I have not slept in them so I almost not sure how they would handle a good night&#x27;s sleep.  However have worn a few pairs multiple times with no problem.  I will definitely order more of her lashes to test out.</li>
            <li> These false lashes are like luxury! Really thick and full but super soft looking and feeling too. A good variety in this package as well.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes....lots of choices for everyday wear....also I get about 5 or more uses out of a pair. I just wash the glue off with warm water and let dry in the container they came in :)</li>
            <li> I just received these lashes from Amazon.ca and Shany Cosmetics and I absolutely love them!!! I&#x27;ve read reviews before that they don&#x27;t come with the glue, but the glue is on the lashes which works well for me because otherwise I&#x27;d glue my eye shut! At less than $1.00 for each set you really can&#x27;t go wrong with these!</li>
            <li> For Great Sexy Looks! If you wear lashes these are great. The variety of styles is great as well. From dramatic to an everyday look these will help complete your makeup look definitely!</li>
            <li> I live for thick and dramatic lashes! This was something I just had to get because there reusesble and they last depending on how you care for them!</li>
            <li> Have you tried these eyelash extenders yet?Well, you have to they look so cute and sexy on your eyes and so easy to remove afterwards. The price for the lashes are very inexpensive and can be used over and over again.</li>
            <li> the price for this is unbeatable. 10 sets of different lashes and 1 set of individual lashes. This set is for dramatic look !</li>
            <li> These lashes are easy to use and put on. Great for beginners who are just learning to use false eyelashes. Also, they are thick and durable. I would definitely recommend these to people.</li>
            <li> it came in one piece not  torn or damadge.shipping was fast.im very happy with shany cos[[ASIN:B008R56PVI SHANY Cosmetics Eyelash Extend Assorted Reusable Eyelashes Thick and Dramatic, 3.6 Ounce]]metics.the eyelashes are very slick,thick,shiny and voulumous.it makes makeup go boom!..i will order from this company again.thank you amazon!!</li>
            <li> Ihave not tryed all of them yet but the ones I have I am completely happy with. Will order again</li>
            <li> I really like Darkness lashes but I wanted to add to my variety. Just try something new. I&#x27;m so glad I did. I just love these....I really do. Plus, the price is great. I definitely plan to purchase more really soon. Love them!</li>
            <li> I love love love these eyelashes!!! They are reusable and don&#x27;t bend up. Holds there shape very well. Plan on reordering these again!!</li>
            <li> SO DISAPPOINTED!Lost 3 sets so far and have 5 left.They put a strip of glue down THE ENTIRE EYELASH! Getting them out is ridiculously difficult. Like doing neurosurgery with tweezers. So mad! These are great lashes and are made to be worn over and over. The patterns are gorgeous. None of that matters because the glue destroys them. Now I&#x27;m trying UNDU adhesive remover to get them off the plastic. What a bummer. Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the value. It arrived in perfect condition. I&#x27;m rating it 4 stars because some of the eye lashes are uncomfortable to wear. Also, I didn&#x27;t like that the eyelashes are synthetic.</li>
            <li> I love almost all of the styles! They dont look as cheap as I had thought they would although they are synthetic. This is the best synthetic lash ive ever seen (especially fo less than a dollar a pair!). They all come with glue as well so thats a plus if you dont have any glue on hand. The reason they got a 4 is because the bands are so thick and the glue is not thaattt great but hey, you get a tiny glue for each pair so its a great deal</li>
            <li> These are synthetic lashes so expect a little \\&quot;shine\\&quot; to them. With that in mind, do not order these if you want a real hair lash because they are not comparable.&lt;br /&gt;My lashes arrived packed in a pretty box set. The designs are all wearable and they apply well. So far, I have been able to wear each pair at least twice if you clean them carefully. For less than a dollar a pair, these are a great value and very cute lashes. I am a performer and wear lashes 2-4x per week and will order these again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited because I&#x27;ve been waiting for kits like these to come out! I&#x27;m extremely new to false eyelashes but the instructions are easy and the application isn&#x27;t bad. They look very good! I will be wearing the dramatic ones at a dance coming up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the way these look! I have no need for my other lashes now. Theses cover everything I could need for a basic black lash style. They are all super cute and I love love the feathery looking ones.</li>
            <li> I really like the lashes, but for some reason, lash glue was not included.  I read other reviews for this product where there was no problem like this.</li>
            <li> I like looking like a drag queen sometimes, these lashes are obviously fake ones, a little long so you will have to trim them. I like the lashes made of human hair, they look more natural.</li>
            <li> THis is a great deal. Normally eyelashes are like 4 bucks for one pair. These are great and work well! You can use the same pair FOREVER!</li>
            <li> I love these lashes . Great shape &amp; designs . Mine were easy enough to remove from the package . I didn&#x60;t know they came with glue ! I went out and bought duo glue because that&#x60;s just my fav on any lashes . My only problem was the band was thick so they were hard to apply to the lash line . I tore half of the top of the band off , where only the clear band showed . Works great . I&#x60;ve used 4 sets since December 25th twice a piece .</li>
            <li> These lashes look nice but are kind of hard to put on.  If you get decent glue they&#x27;ll probably be ok.</li>
            <li> Pros: cute packaging, thick gorgeous lashes, cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: feels alot like plastic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love these lashes, I will definetley rebuy these &lt;3 (:</li>
            <li> These lashes are so beautiful!! They are glamorous, dramatic, and intense and Their quality is amazing! They are so soft and have a flexible lash line. I can put these on much easier than most I have tried.</li>
            <li> Received these today I ordered from Shanycosmetics.com site and shipping was fast. They are very very pretty with a great packaging . I love that they are all in a sleek box very pretty styles and easy to work with. I will be ordering a few more boxes These lashes will look great with the  looks I&#x27;m going to doing with the 7 layer Masterpiece Box. Good quality lashes don&#x27;t look like plastic like other lashes on the market do.</li>
            <li> great product.  Am having fun with them!</li>
            <li> They look super cheap and they feel funny .i dont like synthetic lashes  at all. They have a shine fake look to them</li>
            <li> i really like these lashes easy to put on and the different kind went really nice with each out fit definatly would buy again i purchased two boxes at one time and one of the really nice things is it comes with its own glue in each container keep up the great work you have a fan &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> First of all, I have to say that these lashes are good quality! They are dramatic! Also, these lashes are reusable! How awesome is that! These lashes are worth the price! :)</li>
            <li> This set contains a nice variety of quality eyelashes. My daughter uses them for competitive dance and they hold up very well.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing assortment of lashes for this price! They&#x27;re very thick &amp; dramatic so they&#x27;re definitely not an everyday thing. I&#x27;ve been able to get multiple wears out of mine which I really like. They don&#x27;t seem to come with glue though which is annoying, but other than that I&#x27;m pretty pleased with these.</li>
            <li> are cute, chosen because I like good but two pairs are equal in the box are filled, the price was good I highly!</li>
            <li> My sister and I are obsessed with false eye lashes! These are so great and since Halloween is coming up these will be great!</li>
            <li> This set of assorted lashes are great! You can go for your everyday eyelash, to a more dramatic lash, too. And they&#x27;re reusable, which makes it even better.</li>
            <li> These lashes are what they say Thick and Dramatic! Love them great for that pop you want on your eyes. and they are reusable which is a plus for me! and since Halloween is coming up would really recommend for those costumes or face paints where you want your eyes to stand out!</li>
            <li> It is rare to find a good quality set of false lashes but SHANY has truly delivered excellent quality for an exceptional price!! Love these and you will have endless hours of fun while using these!</li>
            <li> Though I do not have this product, I know that very long, thick and dramatic lashes are valued greatly by women, and I have tried eyelash extensions in the past, and was quite pleased with them.  With false eyelashes, you do not have to use as much mascara, and you look great and sexy in them.  I do feel, that if you want to go out on the night scene, false lashes are something to consider.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 4 pairs now and I love these lashes! They are very durable I have worn them each at least 5 times a pair. Don&#x27;t waste your time with the glue included though! I used my own lash adhesive and had no problems with them falling off. I would recommend these to anyone! I&#x27;ll be getting them again when I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> I must say these items were to die for. Pricing was amazing but the product was outstanding. I just received mines today and I was thrilled with the lashes, and gave me the definite dramatic affect I was looking for!! Very pleased and definitely will order this time and time again..</li>
            <li> I mean  I got what I paid for they feel like dollar store barbie hair very cute but very plastic. and wasent really felling them.</li>
            <li> Wheither it&#x27;s a set of full lashes or single lashes , you have your pick in this assortment. I bought some new excellent adhesive which last longer than Duo, which is what  I usually buy, these will sty on well with that adhesive.</li>
            <li> The lashes are GORGEOUS ...i love each model of them... each pack of lashes gives you a different look... i just wish they come with glue as it was difficult to look for one ...Recommended..:)</li>
            <li> I love these new lashes I got from SHANY. They came in a beautiful box that I will keep for storage. I tried a air on and loved them. I cant wait to wear them out!</li>
            <li> I love the packaging and the way all 10 lash sets look however the lashes are very low quality. Every lash set I have tried using (3 so far) has resulted in the lash hairs falling out or the lashes simply breaking in half. The adhesive holding the lashes together must be very weak. Good thing this set was less than $10.</li>
            <li> These lashes are well made and a very easy to put on . My only concern was that the glue that is put on them so that they stay on the plastic was a tad overwhelming and was difficult to take off .</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are gorgeous and very easy to put on.  I would have given it a full 5 stars if it came with a better eyelash glue.  When I used the glue the lashes did not stick for very long, however when I bought glue from the store they stayed on all night.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me they do not tear easily.  I ripped one off my eye after a long night of partying and it did not rip apart.  I was definitely amazed here.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the individual lashes because, well , I just don&#x27;t know exactly how to use them lol.  But the other lashes are well worth the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;You can wear these whether you want to go out or even for halloween.  They can be classy yet costumey depending on the type of makeup you pair up with it.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing eyelashes from SHANY again!</li>
            <li> so big and thick, without being so very heavy. these look great with anything you wear and they feel fantastic</li>
            <li> I have practically negative lash that no amount of miracle mascara helps.  For special occasions especially when there will be photography, lashes are a must! This collection is perfect for opening my eyes and I love that I can reuse them!</li>
            <li> These feel really fake and the band is really thick.  Perhaps for a really, over the top event these might work, but for a date night or night out, too fake looking.</li>
            <li> These are ok... Good for the price. I actually re-ordered them from before, and I didn&#x27;t see that they no longer had the fun colors, so I was disappointed that these were all black. But if you want a ton of black lashes for cheap, these will do the job.</li>
            <li> Threw them away -- they look really fake... too shiny or something. Wore them for halloween and people asked me if they were fake. There are more natural looking ones out there. Get those.</li>
            <li> Of course I have no actual experience with these, but my wife gives a big thumbs up. My daughter dances competitively and wears false eyelashes on stage. Because she is 6, she isn&#x27;t careful with the lashes. Usually my wife uses a new pair every time my daughter goes on stage. These lashes can be cut to fit, can be put in you pocket and do not fall apart. My wife says she has saved so much money using these.</li>
            <li> Some of these design were cute.. others were too much. I tried trimming some of them but it just messes the lashes up. I think these would be perfect for performers and clubbers. Otherwise, it was cheap and not too hard to use.</li>
            <li> So I ordered this on Tuesday and received it just 2 days after! I was SUPER pleased!&lt;br /&gt;All 10 packs of lashes are gorgeous! The second I opened up my box I was in love with each and every style. Not only that, but I don&#x27;t have to trim them to fit with my lashes :P&lt;br /&gt;I would say it is definitely worth the money since these are reusable and each pack comes with its own bottle of glue.&lt;br /&gt;A+++++</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are nice and thick for that dramatic look looooove them!! Great price too and each package comes with a mini tube of eye lash glue. I will definitely buy more! Reviews@shanycosmetics.com</li>
            <li> OK I was SHOCKED at the quality of these lashes--considering there were SO MANY and CHEAP! They come all individually packaged in little cases--so cute. They stay on BETTER and EASIER than the more expensive ones! You know the trick...put glue on the lashes..blow a few seconds to dry it a bit..use tweezers--look DOWN and put em on :)  You will NOT be disappointed ordering these lashes! love them!</li>
            <li> These lashes are definitely not quality but they are good for what you pay for. I have doubled two sets of these for concerts and they worked well. However, not all of these shapes and styles are particularly flattering. They are also plastic, so they&#x27;re shiny. My biggest peeve is the glue they are secured down to the case with. I ruined the first pair I tried to get out because of it. It is just much too strong; Unlike Mac, Ardell or Andrea lashes that are much easier to peel from the casing. Just be extra careful. In conclusion, I won&#x27;t be reordering.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the variety of these. They may not be real hair but I really don&#x27;t need them to be, I am a photographer as well as a makeup artist and these photograph beautifully. I also bought the less dramatic #1 set and love them as well. The lash band is a bit on the thick side , but nonetheless I dont think I will find this quality and variety any where else. Shipping time was awesome, got them in 2 days. Packaging was nice and nothing was missing or broken. Affordable, Cute and they come with variety. I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with this purchase. Of the 10 eyelash options in the kit, I liked about 7. I wish they were available individually. I would buy a ton.  Overall though, they were good color and quality.  You don&#x27;t want to cut off the ends of these though, they will fall apart. But if you don&#x27;t, they bend easily to fit the shape of your eye and they will last multiple uses if you carefully clean them. I actually prefer day 2 sometimes! This is the nicest packaging I have seen though. Would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li> I love these eyelashes. These eyelashes are so dramatic and I love the way they look. Be aware that the eyelashes are synthetic I prefer synthetic eyelashes. They are so much more easier to take care and hold their shape very nicely which means they last longer. I had no problem with these eyelashes I love them and  I will totally recommend this product</li>
            <li> I was really exicted about ordering these lashes . But when it came to taking them out of the package it was a different story. I had to throw out two sets of lashes so far because they were glued to tight to the packing and the lashes rip off. The ones that I got off with out distroying look great, I&#x27;m just looking for better quality lashes.</li>
            <li> I love the lashes they are pretty good and the price is awesome! Look just like in the picture, and will buy again when i run out.</li>
            <li> I love these eyelashes!!  I usually buy drug store eyelashes, but this set is a way better deal! I will buy more for sure!</li>
            <li> I really like the face that their all different styles. (And not repeating sets like most other brands.) Though I reccomended buying a better lash glue.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes, lots of different styles to try- I like some better than others personally. The description &amp;#34;from subtle to overthetop&amp;#34; is very accurate. I would say the tend to lean a bit more toward overthetop however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried SHANY eyelashes they have a thicker base that I was used to, which took a bit getting used to the feel of. However it also makes them better for wearing multiple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you have some eyelash glue separately though, because most of the mini glue containers that were packaged with the lashes either I couldn&#x27;t get any glue to come out of, or what did come out was slightly hardened and didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
