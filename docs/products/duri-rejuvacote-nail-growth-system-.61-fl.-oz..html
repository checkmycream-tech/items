            <li>I never have been able to grow my nails</li>
            <li>For me, Sally Hansen works better.  </li>

            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>After using Duri a few months, my nails were gorgeous; even my friend could not believe how beautiful they were.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it depends on one&#x27;s metabolism, or even (allergy) medications, but I find it peels off very, very quickly,</li>
            <li>Peels off easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen tremendous growth!</li>
            <li>Now they look pretty and are VERY strong.  </li>
            <li>It makes my nails super strong, and I&#x27;m no longer worried about them peeling.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for stronger/longer nails, I would definately tell you to try this out, its well worth it!</li>
            <li>This really strengthens them and makes a huge improvement!  </li>
            <li>It was a really nice purchase through Amazon with reasonable price and free fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but my nails definitely LOOK good.</li>
            <li>So, I incorporated the Rejuvacote to help, but it peels off around the edges too quickly, even without pre-applying oils.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited about adding Duri Rejuvacote Nail Growth System to my new regimen.  </li>
            <li>It is totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I convinced her to try this after I had success</li>
            <li>Rejuvacote it worth its waight in gold.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li>now I have nails for the first time in more than ten years!</li>
            <li>I first had nails.  </li>
            <li>but they never really looked nice.  </li>
            <li>Even my manicurist cannot believe they are really my nails and not acrylics!</li>
            <li>Using rejuvacote 2 time first day then add a coat every day for a week.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in my life MY real nails look pretty.  </li>
            <li>My nails are growing and growing very fast, thanks to a nail strengthener oil and nail growth oil on [...].</li>
            <li>I wish I had a before and after photo to show the drastic and positive change in my nails since I started using Rejuvacote.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to grow long nails b/c</li>
            <li>When a nail breaks, it grows back very quickly.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t speak to whether it&#x27;s really making my nails stronger</li>
            <li>but it really worked and</li>
            <li>I tried this, not thinking much of it</li>
            <li>Within 3 weeks I had the longest and strongest (real) nails I have ever had.</li>
            <li>stuff really does work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it really does work.  </li>
            <li>My nails are growing and have not broken since using Rejuvacote.  </li>
            <li>and my nails feel so much thicker and they haven&#x27;t peeled once.</li>
            <li>No other product that I have tried worked this well and this quickly.</li>
            <li>my nails started to peel, I was trying to find a solution, I came across a few things and this being one, and was the most reasonably priced as well...</li>
            <li>I did have nails, as I did stop biting them in high school (over 50 yrs ago)</li>
            <li>With a normal manicure</li>
            <li>Both my Mom and I have very soft nails that peel and split.  </li>
            <li>My nails are nearly grown out (you can see the ridge of new nail vs old nail)  and are white and MUCH stronger.  </li>
            <li>My nails have always been short and I could never get them to really grow-</li>
            <li>mom has the same issues with her nails as I did, I gave her a bottle and her nails have grown and are much stronger</li>
            <li>I had gel nails for years and after removing them, my natural nails were split and peeling.  </li>
            <li>My nails were sensitive and hurt quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>I think if I didnt do that they would be a couple inches long (from the tip) and thats too much for</li>
            <li>A co-worker recommended this when I was having such a problem with my natural nails after having acrylic nails removed.  </li>
            <li>It helps the polish last longer, does not peel with mere handwashing and looks nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;People think my nails are fake because of how long and nice looking they are.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I wish I had a before and after photo to show the drastic and positive change in my nails since I started using Rejuvacote.  I have tried practically every nail product out there for my weak, pealing, breaking and disgusting looking nails. A co-worker suggested Rejuvacote and I purchased it immediately.  I had nothing to lose.  I saw results within 7 days!!!  I have since then recommended it to everyone with the same results.  Some of my friends have stopped putting tips/acrylic on their nails for good. I get compliments on my nails all the time now. IT WORKS!! GET IT!! [[ASIN:B000RW6EAQ Duri Rejuvacote Nail Growth System .61 Fl. Oz.]]</li>
            <li> I love this product!!  With a normal manicure my polish chips after four days.  When I use Rejuvacote my polish EASILY looks great for a full 7 days.  Not just chip-free but SHINY.  Yes, it does take a little effort to slap a coat on daily. It is totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to whether it&#x27;s really making my nails stronger but my nails definitely LOOK good.</li>
            <li> Someone recommended Rejuvacote to help me keep my nails and I was skeptical but it really worked and now I have nails for the first time in more than ten years!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! I was having issues with my nails peeling, just started happening out of the blue. My nails have always been short and I could never get them to really grow- once the nail would hit the tip of my finger- that is it, it wouldnt grow past that. My nails were also very weak they would bend- and I just assumed unless I went and got fake nails (which I used to do- but that damaged my nails even more) thats how my nails would be.&lt;br /&gt;When my nails started to peel, I was trying to find a solution, I came across a few things and this being one, and was the most reasonably priced as well... I tried this, not thinking much of it ( I was skeptical to say the least )&lt;br /&gt;I followed directions and within a week I saw that my nails were no longer peeling and my nails were actually growing. Within 3 weeks I had the longest and strongest (real) nails I have ever had. I have been using this stuff for about 4 months now- I have had one nail break on me (but it literally grew back within a week).&lt;br /&gt;People think my nails are fake because of how long and nice looking they are.&lt;br /&gt;I do file and shape them- I think if I didnt do that they would be a couple inches long (from the tip) and thats too much for me.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really does work.&lt;br /&gt;My mom has the same issues with her nails as I did, I gave her a bottle and her nails have grown and are much stronger and she just asked a couple days ago where I got it and that she wanted to buy a couple bottles.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for stronger/longer nails, I would definately tell you to try this out, its well worth it!</li>
            <li> Love this and it really does work.  Both my Mom and I have very soft nails that peel and split.  I convinced her to try this after I had success and she loves it too.  AWESOME PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> This is a good product. My nails are growing and have not broken since using Rejuvacote.  I apply it over nail color and there is no chipping; color stay till next manicure.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Does what it supposed to do. Hard to find in stores. It was a really nice purchase through Amazon with reasonable price and free fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I had gel nails for years and after removing them, my natural nails were split and peeling.  Someone at work recommended this to me after she had similar problems.  After using for 2 weeks, I haven&#x27;t had too many rips in my nails.  It does sting after the 1st 2 applications.</li>
            <li> I was having an awful time with my nails splitting so I tried this product.  My nails look so good!  This really strengthens them and makes a huge improvement!  I could not be happier and most definately will buy this again!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  A co-worker recommended this when I was having such a problem with my natural nails after having acrylic nails removed.  I was tired of the hassle of having acrylic nails so I had them removed.  I work with the public so I must have nice looking nails.  I had tried several other products that were for natural nail strength &amp; growth. Some even said they were specifically for nails after artificial nail removal but none worked.  I used this product as instructed, twice daily and my nails stopped peeling &amp; became stronger in a few days of use.  I don&#x27;t use it as frequently now but still use it as a base coat or if I am doing a lot of house cleaning with my bare hands.  Duri Rejuvacote definitely protects your nails. I would recommend this to anyone, even if you are not having any nail issues because it will strengthen your nails.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product to give you long, beautiful, strong nails. My nails don&#x27;t do well without it. It was recommended to me by a friend and I have used it for a long time. I hope to keep it on hand at all times.</li>
            <li> I have been using Rejuvacote for about 3 years when I stopped having my nails done with wraps.  I never have been able to grow my nails but now my nails are strong and great.  I recently purchased Rejuvacote for my friend and she could not believe that it would work but now her nails are growing and not breaking and she is just thrilled.</li>
            <li> I was a nail biter from the day I first had nails.  A few years ago a friend introduced me to Duri rejuvenate and I cannot tell you what beautiful nails I do now have.  I did have nails, as I did stop biting them in high school (over 50 yrs ago) but they never really looked nice.  After using Duri a few months, my nails were gorgeous; even my friend could not believe how beautiful they were.  I still use the product, and will continue to do so.  I cannot thank you enough for having a product such as this; it is indeed a miracle worker on my nails.  Even my manicurist cannot believe they are really my nails and not acrylics!</li>
            <li> This is the best strengthener for nails that split and crack.  It is easy to use and it works!  You can see the difference in only one week.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about adding Duri Rejuvacote Nail Growth System to my new regimen.  Perhaps it depends on one&#x27;s metabolism, or even (allergy) medications, but I find it peels off very, very quickly, same day it&#x27;s applied.  I try to wear gloves when using cleansers and cleaning.  My nails are growing and growing very fast, thanks to a nail strengthener oil and nail growth oil on [...]. I&#x27;ve seen tremendous growth! Nails that had never grown without artificial wraps or such are now growing long and strong. When a nail breaks, it grows back very quickly. So, I incorporated the Rejuvacote to help, but it peels off around the edges too quickly, even without pre-applying oils.  I will use the remainder of the bottle, but would not buy again.  For me, Sally Hansen works better.  It helps the polish last longer, does not peel with mere handwashing and looks nice.</li>
            <li> Who wudda thunk?  Tried everything know to humankind.  This actually works.&lt;br /&gt;I did put a coat on most every day, though.  Probably not good for the environment or YOU,&lt;br /&gt;but it DID help my nails, ALLOT!</li>
            <li> I took my acrylic nails off 7 months ago.  My nails were sensitive and hurt quite a bit.  Using rejuvacote 2 time first day then add a coat every day for a week.  FYI, the nail bed will feel burning for a while every time you add a coat.  This will last for a month or 2.  Remove every week and start again.  They gradually get better &amp; better.  My nails are nearly grown out (you can see the ridge of new nail vs old nail)  and are white and MUCH stronger.  For the first time in my life MY real nails look pretty.  Rejuvacote it worth its waight in gold.&lt;br /&gt;I also used on my very thin toe nails which kept spliting. Now they look pretty and are VERY strong.  They only took a month or 2 to see results.</li>
            <li> Peels off easily. Didn&#x27;t harden my nails as claimed it would. Would not recommend this product if you are trying to harden nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with thin brittle nails that often peeled. I&#x27;ve never been able to grow long nails b/c as soon as they grew any length they would peel so bad. So I bought this and I&#x27;ve been using it for two months now and my nails feel so much thicker and they haven&#x27;t peeled once. This product takes time to work but if you stick with it you will see great results. I don&#x27;t believe it makes your nails grow any faster though but if you&#x27;re looking for a great nail hardener this is it.</li>
            <li> This does what it says it will do and in a very short period of time.  No other product that I have tried worked this well and this quickly. My nails kept spliting and breaking off.  They were growing well in about 10 days.  Definitely worth trying to see if it works for you. I think you will love it.</li>
            <li> rejuvacote . . . .prompt delivery, undamaged packaging, EXCELLENT product!!!  would purchase from this seller again!</li>
            <li> I have the worst nails ever!  Fragile, paper thin, ripping nails so to speak.  After reading the great reviews, I decided to try it out.  What a difference! Nothing works overnight but within a week or so I could see the difference.  You must follow the directions though!  Otherwise you will waste your time.  I would recommend this definitely!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It makes my nails super strong, and I&#x27;m no longer worried about them peeling.  I&#x27;ve tried other nail strengtheners in the past, but nothing compares to the results I&#x27;ve gotten with Duri.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when a friend told me about this product.  She said it would keep my nails from breaking and splitting, and she was 100% correct!  I followed the directions on the package, and my nails look great.</li>
            <li> this is great for your nails aids in growing and strengthening them. my friend was using it so i tried it and it helped my split nails. you jut follow the instructions.</li>
