            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I use it at bedtime and cover the area, and seem to be better when I wake in the morning.  </li>

            <li>My husband and I love it.  </li>
            <li>get it, use it , love it...repeat</li>
            <li>My family has used Unkers for years for a variety of uses and believe it or not, and in many cases, it has provided better solutions than a doctors prescription.  </li>
            <li>Excellent and has multiple uses.</li>
            <li>Love it helps me a lot</li>
            <li>one of my favorite products</li>
            <li>It serves so many purposes, and truly helps everything from colds to sore muscles.</li>
            <li>Maybe the longer you use it the better it will get, but we&#x27;re not holding our breath.  </li>
            <li>Kind of pricy but worth it.</li>
            <li>but it really feels good.  </li>
            <li>More likely it is because Unker&#x27;s received a great promo on MPR (or NPR), which is where I heard about the product, so like me, arthritis and chronic pain sufferers</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell</li>
            <li>For the first time in a year I am able to sleep with my shoulder injury pain free!  </li>
            <li>Works great when me feet start to hurt I rub it on and put on a pair of socks and believe me it does help big time</li>
            <li>He uses it nightly and it works great for his knee and back pain.</li>
            <li>but it truly is a Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>We have been using Unkers for several years and find it works great on arthritic knees,</li>
            <li>was happy with the transaction and the product arrived in a very short time.</li>
            <li>It really works!!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a strong oro but that dissipates quickly, which is a plus</li>
            <li>The Amish Original is a knock off that does not work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for colds, sore muscles, and dry cracked skin.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best rub I&#x27;ve ever used on my back and neck.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff every household should have this on hand doesgreat on bug bites, minor cuts and bruises, super for nasal congestion</li>
            <li>Makes all your sore muscles feels better fast.  </li>
            <li>Cool and soothing.</li>
            <li>quick delivery and fulfillment</li>
            <li>Make sure it is the Original Formula as more active ingredients are in it.  </li>
            <li>We love this product we use it for many purposes, allergie relief, neuropothy pain, cuts, burns, dry skin, every household she have this salve!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad to be able to buy it in such a large quantity</li>
            <li>We love that it is made from natural products.</li>
            <li>Unker&#x27;s is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Really great for aches, pains and stiff muscles.</li>
            <li>I often get relief from fairly significant pain with just using this and not having to take any pills, which I really appreciate.  </li>
            <li>It is good to use on all of your little hurts, itches, bruises and stiffness&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>and I could not believe how well and fast it worked!</li>
            <li>we will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>It is similar smelling and texture to Vicks salve but truly works better.</li>
            <li>we even use this on our dog who gets hot spots in the summer she will take hair off her tail and sides.</li>
            <li>so do be aware of that if you buy it.</li>
            <li>I love this salve, it has multiple uses</li>
            <li>Thanks Unker&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>I will be back again to buy more.</li>
            <li>I am only able to sleep when in that amount of pain with this salve.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended to us last summer for pain relief, but weren&#x27;t all that satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>great for back rubs too, among other things</li>
            <li>Much better than Icy Hot or other salves in my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it  After years with pain in my elbow and no golf, I was pain free after four applications and hit my first round of golf pain free too!</li>
            <li>It really is a cure-all for so many things - sore muscles, joints, coughs, sore throat, dry skin, etc.</li>
            <li>but it really works.  </li>
            <li>my whole family uses it.....</li>
            <li>It has really helped my husbands feet when his diabetic neuropathy flares up.</li>
            <li>Unkers medicated salve works very well for me.</li>
            <li>I also used it for pain and got much needed relief.</li>
            <li>and it really helps.</li>
            <li>Really works to ease pain of sore muscles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shared it with a couple of people, one of whom says it really helped.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t really know if this is a cure-all</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed how fast it starts working.</li>
            <li>and she says it really helps her.  </li>
            <li>This product does absolutely everything it says it does.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I use it on my knees, shoulders and hands when they really are bothering me.</li>
            <li>It really does work</li>
            <li>since he&#x27;s used it his pain has decreased greatly.</li>
            <li>It has a pungent odor and is very sticky.</li>
            <li>Not only does it help keep my feet soft but also helps with pain relief better than any product I purchased at a pharmacy.  </li>
            <li>Better than bengay and other products.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say it helped any more than other products we have used, but we&#x27;re still using it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure he&#x27;d be thrilled.</li>
            <li>and it is mild enough to use on my children.  </li>
            <li>It works also as a decongestant, better than vicks, and a sleep aid when rubbed on your back or even on the balls of your feet and covered with white socks.</li>
            <li>this Particular bottle was bought for a friend with severe leg pain.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Effective,,The high odor leaves after a while.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for others who may have problems of achy joints and muscles.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>well I highly recommened Unkers.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Unker&#x27;s is a great product with a weird name.</li>
            <li>and I believe it helped heal the break faster than normal.</li>
            <li>What can I say but this is one fine product for aches and pains plus other remedies I have heard mentioned.</li>
            <li>Not long after that, I was cooking dinner, and decided to show my brilliance and grab the hot burner.</li>
            <li>but I can live with it.</li>
            <li>,does have a slight medicine smell to it,but seams to help with my aches and pains and is also good for other things like colds,burns ect...</li>
            <li>This product does an amazing job after only a few applications.</li>
            <li>It feels like my skull is crushing down onto my spine</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of the product - getting the large size this time, so I must believe it&#x27;s helping.</li>
            <li>NOTHING SPECIAL- NOT WORTH THE MONEY</li>
            <li>I have tried several over the products and this product Unkers has been a real blessing to me.</li>
            <li>This product really works, especially on sprains, pulled muscles, injuries,...</li>
            <li>all natural ingredientshttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X1Q2GM/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0</li>
            <li>It helps endure the aches and pain that my old orn out body has</li>
            <li>I use this occasionally for general aches and pains and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>It is like no other you can buy, and I would heartily recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but, because you only need to use a little at a time, it lasts a long time, so it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>The price was right and a little goes a long way!  </li>

            <li> I Friggen love this stuff,</li>
            <li> lots more.  </li>
            <li> Of course, it didn&#x27;t get rid of the flu, but it made things more bearable.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I use it at bedtime and cover the area, and seem to be better when I wake in the morning.  </li>
            <li> It can be used for so many ills including sore throat, chest colds,  burns, itchy areas, etc.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I love it.  </li>
            <li> get it, use it , love it...repeat</li>
            <li> My family has used Unkers for years for a variety of uses and believe it or not, and in many cases, it has provided better solutions than a doctors prescription.  </li>
            <li> Excellent and has multiple uses.</li>
            <li> Love it helps me a lot</li>
            <li> one of my favorite products</li>
            <li> It serves so many purposes, and truly helps everything from colds to sore muscles.</li>
            <li> Maybe the longer you use it the better it will get, but we&#x27;re not holding our breath.  </li>
            <li> Kind of pricy but worth it.</li>
            <li> but it really feels good.  </li>
            <li> More likely it is because Unker&#x27;s received a great promo on MPR (or NPR), which is where I heard about the product, so like me, arthritis and chronic pain sufferers</li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell</li>
            <li> For the first time in a year I am able to sleep with my shoulder injury pain free!  </li>
            <li> Works great when me feet start to hurt I rub it on and put on a pair of socks and believe me it does help big time</li>
            <li> He uses it nightly and it works great for his knee and back pain.</li>
            <li> but it truly is a Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> We have been using Unkers for several years and find it works great on arthritic knees,</li>
            <li> was happy with the transaction and the product arrived in a very short time.</li>
            <li> It really works!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a strong oro but that dissipates quickly, which is a plus</li>
            <li> The Amish Original is a knock off that does not work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for colds, sore muscles, and dry cracked skin.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best rub I&#x27;ve ever used on my back and neck.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff every household should have this on hand doesgreat on bug bites, minor cuts and bruises, super for nasal congestion</li>
            <li> Makes all your sore muscles feels better fast.  </li>
            <li> Cool and soothing.</li>
            <li> quick delivery and fulfillment</li>
            <li> Make sure it is the Original Formula as more active ingredients are in it.  </li>
            <li> We love this product we use it for many purposes, allergie relief, neuropothy pain, cuts, burns, dry skin, every household she have this salve!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad to be able to buy it in such a large quantity</li>
            <li> We love that it is made from natural products.</li>
            <li> Unker&#x27;s is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Really great for aches, pains and stiff muscles.</li>
            <li> I often get relief from fairly significant pain with just using this and not having to take any pills, which I really appreciate.  </li>
            <li> It is good to use on all of your little hurts, itches, bruises and stiffness&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> and I could not believe how well and fast it worked!</li>
            <li> we will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> It is similar smelling and texture to Vicks salve but truly works better.</li>
            <li> we even use this on our dog who gets hot spots in the summer she will take hair off her tail and sides.</li>
            <li> so do be aware of that if you buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this salve, it has multiple uses</li>
            <li> Thanks Unker&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I will be back again to buy more.</li>
            <li> I am only able to sleep when in that amount of pain with this salve.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to us last summer for pain relief, but weren&#x27;t all that satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> great for back rubs too, among other things</li>
            <li> Much better than Icy Hot or other salves in my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it  After years with pain in my elbow and no golf, I was pain free after four applications and hit my first round of golf pain free too!</li>
            <li> It really is a cure-all for so many things - sore muscles, joints, coughs, sore throat, dry skin, etc.</li>
            <li> but it really works.  </li>
            <li> my whole family uses it.....</li>
            <li> It has really helped my husbands feet when his diabetic neuropathy flares up.</li>
            <li> Unkers medicated salve works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I also used it for pain and got much needed relief.</li>
            <li> and it really helps.</li>
            <li> Really works to ease pain of sore muscles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shared it with a couple of people, one of whom says it really helped.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t really know if this is a cure-all</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed how fast it starts working.</li>
            <li> and she says it really helps her.  </li>
            <li> This product does absolutely everything it says it does.</li>

            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I use it on my knees, shoulders and hands when they really are bothering me.</li>
            <li> It really does work</li>
            <li> since he&#x27;s used it his pain has decreased greatly.</li>
            <li> It has a pungent odor and is very sticky.</li>
            <li> Not only does it help keep my feet soft but also helps with pain relief better than any product I purchased at a pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> Better than bengay and other products.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say it helped any more than other products we have used, but we&#x27;re still using it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure he&#x27;d be thrilled.</li>
            <li> and it is mild enough to use on my children.  </li>
            <li> It works also as a decongestant, better than vicks, and a sleep aid when rubbed on your back or even on the balls of your feet and covered with white socks.</li>
            <li> this Particular bottle was bought for a friend with severe leg pain.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Effective,,The high odor leaves after a while.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for others who may have problems of achy joints and muscles.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> well I highly recommened Unkers.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Unker&#x27;s is a great product with a weird name.</li>
            <li> and I believe it helped heal the break faster than normal.</li>
            <li> What can I say but this is one fine product for aches and pains plus other remedies I have heard mentioned.</li>
            <li> Not long after that, I was cooking dinner, and decided to show my brilliance and grab the hot burner.</li>
            <li> but I can live with it.</li>
            <li> ,does have a slight medicine smell to it,but seams to help with my aches and pains and is also good for other things like colds,burns ect...</li>
            <li> This product does an amazing job after only a few applications.</li>
            <li> It feels like my skull is crushing down onto my spine</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of the product - getting the large size this time, so I must believe it&#x27;s helping.</li>
            <li> NOTHING SPECIAL- NOT WORTH THE MONEY</li>
            <li> I have tried several over the products and this product Unkers has been a real blessing to me.</li>
            <li> This product really works, especially on sprains, pulled muscles, injuries,...</li>
            <li> all natural ingredientshttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X1Q2GM/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0</li>
            <li> It helps endure the aches and pain that my old orn out body has</li>
            <li> I use this occasionally for general aches and pains and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> It is like no other you can buy, and I would heartily recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but, because you only need to use a little at a time, it lasts a long time, so it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> The price was right and a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s releases tremendous about of muscle tension, and it doesn&#x27;t do that hot cold thing and stink up the room.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, the scent is very pleasing, and it works.  </li>
            <li> other similar products on market do same thing...</li>
            <li> I have chronic back pain due to scoliosis.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it for other medical uses like colds etc, so can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t comment on them.</li>
            <li> it got the same smell and consistency of Vaseline, but with a little something extra/awesome thrown in.</li>
            <li> This stuff works on dry skin, itchy skin, calluses, stuffy noses, coughs, sore muscles and joints, wounds, and other things.</li>
            <li> Careful to wash hands after use.</li>
            <li> Takes only a few minutes</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it can be because the price of eucalyptus, wintergreen, menthol, pine needle oil, and camphor shot up by 30% in the last few months?</li>
            <li> Warnings are posted to&lt;br /&gt;apply carefully and to keep away from eyes.</li>
            <li> Used for allergies, migraines, hemerroids, dry skin and sciatic pain!!</li>
            <li> When we see her doing this we put on unkers and with in a week her hair will grow back and no more biting herself.</li>
            <li> I understand it helps cure other ailments as well by putting it on your feet at night.</li>
            <li> I now have other family members using this.  </li>
            <li> The 13.5 oz unkers will last us at least a year.</li>
            <li> not worth the money...</li>
            <li> I have someone rub this all over my back and neck, put a towel under my head/body to sleep, and this takes the pain down to a dull roar or less.</li>
            <li> Not a good as last jar.</li>
            <li> (I checked the market prices, and if anything, they went down!)</li>
            <li> I get really severe, tight muscle pain and tension migraines from my back up into the base of my skull.</li>
            <li> Sorry it is not available in any store near us.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s in as it&#x27;s a bit messy -</li>
            <li> : Why on god&#x27;s green earth has the price of Unker&#x27;s salve gone up by Unkers Medicated Salve 13.5 oz from $23.02 to 29.98 - by ca 30% since January this year?</li>
            <li> It  has a medicinal scent, but not nearly as strong as Vicks Salve.  </li>
            <li> I have serious bronchial problems and several times during the cold winter times I have to rub a generous amount on my chest, throat and back.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and it always helps!  </li>
            <li> I have put it on serious burns and it works wonders.  </li>
            <li> Use it on chest, feet, behind ears, and on pains and sprains.  </li>
            <li> In addition to applying it to areas infected with arthritis, I also apply it over some Baker cystes I have behind my knee.</li>
            <li> I either put on thin gloves or put my hands under the covers for a while.</li>
            <li> the next day, it was like I had never been sick!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too crazy about the white petroleum base</li>
            <li> I rub some on the bottom of my feet every day and hardly ever get sick.</li>
            <li> so bad I feel like I&#x27;m going blind.</li>
            <li> I always thought she was crazy, until she let me use some for a sinus infection and</li>
            <li> Crazy stuff.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my neck/chest when have a cold or sinus infection and it helps relieve the congestion.  </li>
            <li> Bug Bites, Rash, Hemroids, Sore Muscles, Head Ache, Cold &amp; Cough, Etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I find that it makes my hands cold if I use it before bed.</li>
            <li> I have a cold put this on the soles of your feet and then your nostrils.</li>
            <li> I had a cold and used this.  </li>
            <li> Rather awkward to utilize upon retiring.</li>
            <li> Try it you cant go wrong!</li>
            <li> I have bad arthritis in my hands and joint/muscle pain &amp; aches.</li>
            <li> Inkers doesn&#x27;t just help pain, it HELPS painful joints, hands, Muscles, headaches, breathing, sinus headaches you have to try it to believe it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it was an impulsive move on my part  :(</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worst</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great stuff, my husband swears by it!</li>
            <li> Good product, good service!</li>
            <li> Just follow the directions and you will feel much better! I rub some on the bottom of my feet every day and hardly ever get sick.</li>
            <li> Not for the timid, but it does work on pain!  Can feel &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;, but that is why it works - it gets in there and kicks it!</li>
            <li> Works great when me feet start to hurt I rub it on and put on a pair of socks and believe me it does help big time</li>
            <li> Unker&#x27;s is a great product with a weird name. A friend let me borrow some for a sinus infection and I could not believe how well and fast it worked! It really is a cure-all for so many things - sore muscles, joints, coughs, sore throat, dry skin, etc. It&#x27;s pricey but, because you only need to use a little at a time, it lasts a long time, so it&#x27;s worth the money. Very effective. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had a neighbor that just kept going on about how great Unkers was. I always thought she was crazy, until she let me use some for a sinus infection and the next day, it was like I had never been sick! Not long after that, I was cooking dinner, and decided to show my brilliance and grab the hot burner. I used some, and it was like the burn never happened. I now keep my own stock of it!</li>
            <li> This salve is amazing. .works on sore muscles....low back pain....headaches...you name it. 5 stars definitely.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and it always helps!  It doesn&#x27;t smell but it really works.  The price was right and a little goes a long way!  Very good investment.</li>
            <li> It arrived extremely fast and works great! Love it!</li>
            <li> We have used Unker&#x27;s for years, but, we didn&#x27;t know Amazon sold it until recently. We love Unker&#x27;s. It&#x27;s great for colds, sore muscles, and dry cracked skin. The price on Amazon is amazing compared to what we have been paying so we will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> This salve is good for anything that ails you - arthritis, strains, sore throat, etc. It is similar smelling and texture to Vicks salve but truly works better.</li>
            <li> I use this occasionally for general aches and pains and it works very well.  I am prone to headaches and I sometimes use this.  It works quite well in alleviating the pain.  I would have given it 5 stars, but it is quite greasy which I don&#x27;t like, hence 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This salve is awesome.....it is good for so many things....my whole family uses it.....thank you I luv using it and will continue to tell all my friends</li>
            <li> Always on time, no troubles!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years.  would not be without it!!! Make sure it is the Original Formula as more active ingredients are in it.  Use it on chest, feet, behind ears, and on pains and sprains.  Wonderful.  If you put it on the balls of your feet, which corresponds to sinuses, you can immediately smell it in your nose.  Crazy stuff.  It works</li>
            <li> We use this product for all joint pain, muscle aches, and stuffy noses.   It has really helped my husbands feet when his diabetic neuropathy flares up.</li>
            <li> Only Salve that works for my sore knees and back. I have given it others and they get the same relief. The Amish Original is a knock off that does not work.</li>
            <li> I have neuropathy and arthritis, and use this product regularly on my feet.  Not only does it help keep my feet soft but also helps with pain relief better than any product I purchased at a pharmacy.  I wholeheartedly believe in Unkers Salve.  I also use it on my neck/chest when have a cold or sinus infection and it helps relieve the congestion.  Please don&#x27;t discontinue this product!</li>
            <li> Really great for aches, pains and stiff muscles. Better than bengay and other products.</li>
            <li> It seems to help with arthritis aches and pains. I use it daily.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He uses it nightly and it works great for his knee and back pain.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with Unker&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> The best analgesic I&#x27;ve ever used.  My son&#x27;s family is also hooked.  My husband and I use it for many things.</li>
            <li> The 13.5 oz unkers will last us at least a year. This product is great for everything from colds, coughs, insect bites, arthritis, even sore throats.Plus many more things.   we even use this on our dog who gets hot spots in the summer she will take hair off her tail and sides. When we see her doing this we put on unkers and with in a week her hair will grow back and no more biting herself.</li>
            <li> Not a good as last jar. What is different</li>
            <li> I have tried several over the products and this product Unkers has been a real blessing to me. I have given it to others who have had good results.</li>
            <li> Use it for muscle pain and joint problems and it is also great to use when you have a&lt;br /&gt;cold.  The eucalyptus and wintergreen are a winning combination.</li>
            <li> Best product of this type that I&#x27;ve found.  It is really good on sore, achy muscles and helps a lot with arthritis.  I often get relief from fairly significant pain with just using this and not having to take any pills, which I really appreciate.  A little goes a long way, the scent is very pleasing, and it works.  What else is there to say?</li>
            <li> I love this muscle cream. It does have a strong smell so do be aware of that if you buy it.</li>
            <li> We love this product we use it for many purposes, allergie relief, neuropothy pain, cuts, burns, dry skin, every household she have this salve!</li>
            <li> A helpful salve for arthritic pain and sore muscles, though it is greasy, so you&#x27;ll have to keep the areas to which it is applied covered.</li>
            <li> I have been using Unkers Medicated Salve for about 3 years now for almost ache and pain.  It works on my sore feet, my aching knee and even my sore throat.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th container of the stuff. I love the smell and the benefits even more. It is good to use on all of your little hurts, itches, bruises and stiffness&#x27;s.  I am working on empting the largest container. I keep Unker&#x27;s Medicated salve on my desk and beside my bed.</li>
            <li> Perfect for any body aches. I have used this product for years and wont go a day without it. Try it you cant go wrong!</li>
            <li> Effective,,The high odor leaves after a while. Actually soften the skin which was a bonus. Careful to wash hands after use.</li>
            <li> It works good when I rubbed it on my knee and legs. It helped a lot with the pain in my knee.</li>
            <li> Heaven in a jar what a great product</li>
            <li> not worth the money...other similar products on market do same thing...&lt;br /&gt;it was an impulsive move on my part  :(</li>
            <li> It is great. Works for my athritis and migraines. I rub on my temples for my migraines and knees for my athritis.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as scheduled and packaging was in tact.  Did not work as well as I had hoped.  Did not work for my purpose.</li>
            <li> It seems to help where I need all the help I can get. This is my second purchase of the product - getting the large size this time, so I must believe it&#x27;s helping. In addition to applying it to areas infected with arthritis, I also apply it over some Baker cystes I have behind my knee. It does help there and the cysts are softening and getting smaller. I&#x27;m not too crazy about the white petroleum base it&#x27;s in as it&#x27;s a bit messy - but I can live with it.</li>

            <li> it has helped my feet to heal. I found out about it by word only. I understand it helps cure other ailments as well by putting it on your feet at night.</li>
            <li> This product really works, especially on sprains, pulled muscles, injuries,... It does have an odor of Vicks (same warnings as using Vicks). Also works great for colds, sore throats, sinus problems... We rub it on the bottom of our feet, neck and chest.</li>

            <li> We love Unkers Medicated Salve!!! It helped us through the flu. Of course, it didn&#x27;t get rid of the flu, but it made things more bearable. We used it on our chests, necks, and feet at night and slept well. I also used it for pain and got much needed relief. It&#x27;s a must-have for any medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Unker&#x27;s is the best!!!</li>
            <li> The Amish know how to make this soothing relief. It is the best product I have ever used. My grandson plays football and it is a great product for him. Takes only a few minutes and it really helps.</li>

            <li> It helps a variety of joint issues. I gave a jar to my sister and she is happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a strong oro but that dissipates quickly, which is a plus</li>

            <li> Best pain salve my husband has used ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> Bunkers is a great product. Really works to ease pain of sore muscles. Works to ease pain tom sore joints.</li>
            <li> This seems helpful for knee and back pain.  I use it at bedtime and cover the area, and seem to be better when I wake in the morning.  I&#x27;ve shared it with a couple of people, one of whom says it really helped. It  has a medicinal scent, but not nearly as strong as Vicks Salve.  I&#x27;ve used it off and on for two or three weeks.</li>
            <li> very good product it&#x27;s helps the aches and pains, i would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;very good, very good, very good,very good.</li>
            <li> Unker&#x27;s is good for just about anything.  I have serious bronchial problems and several times during the cold winter times I have to rub a generous amount on my chest, throat and back.  Now I don&#x27;t really know if this is a cure-all but it really feels good.  I have put it on serious burns and it works wonders.  All around great stuff to have on hand at home or on vacation.</li>
            <li> This product is a sleeper in my experience.  It can be used for so many ills including sore throat, chest colds,  burns, itchy areas, etc.  Would not be without it!!!</li>
            <li> brought needed relief for shingles treatment</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  My husband and I love it.  I was amazed how fast it starts working.</li>
            <li> get it, use it , love it...repeat</li>
            <li> We use it for sore mucles and colds and arthritous.  Is works as we have heard that it works wonders on aches and pains.</li>
            <li> This medication works like advertised.  Highly recommend for others who may have problems of achy joints and muscles.  My sister and her husband use it for getting over chest heaviness during colds as well as muscle relief after cramps.</li>
            <li> It is great !  What else am I to say? I liked it, I like it. I like it  I like it.</li>
            <li> if  you have neuropathy, definintely try this. when the pain is at it&#x27;s worst, just rub this on, i get immediate relief. great for back rubs too, among other things</li>
            <li> great service Unkers  is the best .</li>
            <li> Invented years ago.  Back on market.  Best I ever found for healing hurts, bruses, and chapped lips</li>
            <li> My wife uses this cream to help with her knee pains and she says it really helps her.  She duffers from Osteoarthritis and at times her knees give her a lot of pain.</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived open in the package and was basically unusable.</li>
            <li> Vow, this stuff is incredible. I have bad arthritis in my hands and joint/muscle pain &amp; aches. This is better than any pain relief drug I&#x27;ve taken - and it feels SOoooo good. Cool and soothing. It arrived in what... 2 days? I bought the big jar, so it&#x27;ll last a while, but I will definitely buy it again. Highly recommended.  Edit of reviw: Why on god&#x27;s green earth has the price of Unker&#x27;s salve gone up by Unkers Medicated Salve 13.5 oz from $23.02 to 29.98 - by ca 30% since January this year? I don&#x27;t think it can be because the price of eucalyptus, wintergreen, menthol, pine needle oil, and camphor shot up by 30% in the last few months? (I checked the market prices, and if anything, they went down!) More likely it is because Unker&#x27;s received a great promo on MPR (or NPR), which is where I heard about the product, so like me, arthritis and chronic pain sufferers rab to amazon (or where ever Unkers is sold) to buy this wonderful - which it is indeed - salve. But I will not let greedy sellers make money of my pain. I prefer to suffer. &amp;#34;To God be the Glory&amp;#34; indeed. I&#x27;m not sure he&#x27;d be thrilled.</li>
            <li> This salve works alright i put it on at nite before i retire,does have a slight medicine smell to it,but seams to help with my aches and pains and is also good for other things like colds,burns ect...</li>
            <li> This product does an amazing job after only a few applications. I highly recommend it  After years with pain in my elbow and no golf, I was pain free after four applications and hit my first round of golf pain free too!</li>
            <li> I have used Unkers for 30 years it is answer for whatever ails.</li>
            <li> This stuff works on dry skin, itchy skin, calluses, stuffy noses, coughs, sore muscles and joints, wounds, and other things. I reorder before I run out. I&#x27;ve used it for about 16 years. I especially like buying a product that says ,&amp;#34;To God be the glory.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It is greasy and I find that it makes my hands cold if I use it before bed. I either put on thin gloves or put my hands under the covers for a while.</li>
            <li> Inkers doesn&#x27;t just help pain, it HELPS painful joints, hands, Muscles, headaches, breathing, sinus headaches you have to try it to believe it.</li>
            <li> It really works!!!  We love that it is made from natural products. And it is effect for the entire day.</li>
            <li> My family has used Unkers for years for a variety of uses and believe it or not, and in many cases, it has provided better solutions than a doctors prescription.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product for men, women and children alike.</li>
            <li> I was told about this from a good friend. This product does absolutely everything it says it does. For the first time in a year I am able to sleep with my shoulder injury pain free!  It works also as a decongestant, better than vicks, and a sleep aid when rubbed on your back or even on the balls of your feet and covered with white socks. My sister rubs in on both her hands and wears white gloves to sleep, it has healed her cracked fingertips and taken the arthritic pain away. I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> I have a cold put this on the soles of your feet and then your nostrils. Helps with pain in the back in the feet everywhere I use it on my neck. we have been using this product for over 15 years and would not be without it i buy the liesdelete delete</li>
            <li> This is Good Stuff , recently found it is very good on insect bites also.</li>
            <li> Excellent and has multiple uses.</li>
            <li> Love it helps me a lot</li>
            <li> one of my favorite products</li>
            <li> This works on everything.  I had a cold and used this.  It was Great!</li>
            <li> quick delivery and fulfillment</li>
            <li> This stuff is the miracle of miracles for me. I get really severe, tight muscle pain and tension migraines from my back up into the base of my skull. It feels like my skull is crushing down onto my spine and I get eyeball headaches so bad I feel like I&#x27;m going blind. I have someone rub this all over my back and neck, put a towel under my head/body to sleep, and this takes the pain down to a dull roar or less. I am only able to sleep when in that amount of pain with this salve. Much better than Icy Hot or other salves in my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. it helps with aches and pains. I will purchase it again. Very good service. thanks</li>
            <li> Many uses! Great product!</li>
            <li> We have used Unkers for years. It serves so many purposes, and truly helps everything from colds to sore muscles.</li>
            <li> I use it on my knees, shoulders and hands when they really are bothering me.It really does work well I highly recommened Unkers.</li>
            <li> I have chronic back pain due to scoliosis.  This is by far the best rub I&#x27;ve ever used on my back and neck.  It&#x27;s releases tremendous about of muscle tension, and it doesn&#x27;t do that hot cold thing and stink up the room.  Unker&#x27;s is a miracle for my back.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to us last summer for pain relief, but weren&#x27;t all that satisfied with the results.  Can&#x27;t say it helped any more than other products we have used, but we&#x27;re still using it.  Maybe the longer you use it the better it will get, but we&#x27;re not holding our breath.  Haven&#x27;t tried it for other medical uses like colds etc, so can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t comment on them.</li>
            <li> Unker&#x27;s is well worth the money.  From sore muscles, joints to sinuses it works.  It is an awesome product.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years. given to my by my grandmother. this Particular bottle was bought for a friend with severe leg pain. since he&#x27;s used it his pain has decreased greatly. it got the same smell and consistency of Vaseline, but with a little something extra/awesome thrown in.</li>
            <li> Salve was helpful in reducing pain. It has a pungent odor and is very sticky. Warnings are posted to&lt;br /&gt;apply carefully and to keep away from eyes. Rather awkward to utilize upon retiring.</li>
