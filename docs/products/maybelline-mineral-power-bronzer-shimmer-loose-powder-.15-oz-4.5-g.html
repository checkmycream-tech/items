            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and it blends perfectly.</li>
            <li>But after I blend it for awhile it looks nice</li>
            <li>This is nice, but I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li>I love this product and strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I still love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried this one.</li>
            <li>Does not make my skin more greasy.</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li>I am so glad I took the plunge and ordered this product.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Pleased with product.</li>
            <li>this product arrived on time and i love it...</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The colour (sunset bronze) should suggest that it is more for medium brown to dark hues for best bronzing effect, and indeed, it is.</li>
            <li>My face is a little lighter than the rest of my body and this bronzer matches my face to the rest of my body perfectly!</li>
            <li>a light brown</li>
            <li>This product is great for highlighting cheek bones and giving that extra bronze feel in summer.</li>
            <li>It is light on the face, and doesn&#x27;t feel as if you&#x27;re wearing any makeup.</li>
            <li>The brush handle is tiny but the bristles are very effective; they don&#x27;t shed on your face and the powder does not cake either.</li>
            <li>When I first tried it on, it looked as if nothing was on my face, so I put a bit more, trying to build it up...</li>
            <li>its not to shiney, it got the right amount of glitter!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great buy compared to many tanning brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>Color looks nice and natural.</li>
            <li>easy to apply and an overall nice colour.</li>
            <li>I guess you need a lot of light and/or the sun to really see the application.&lt;br /&gt;The brush..</li>
            <li>It is smaller then it looks like which kind of dissipating but</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t worth the struggle.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the brush it came with, but worked fine with one of my other brushes.</li>
            <li>The color was pretty.</li>
            <li>and it works really well with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Not too much shimmer.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>and this worked very well with it.</li>
            <li>I really like the brush that it came with.</li>
            <li>Really like this.  </li>
            <li>and it has too much shimmer.</li>
            <li>and it comes really fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s was too bronzy/shimmery and just a mess if you spill it on something like your shirt or a counter top or anything like that.</li>
            <li>I recommend using a high quality brush than the one that comes with the product.</li>
            <li>This bronzer is a little more on the shimmery side</li>
            <li>It has a little too much glitter in it which is why i stopped wearing it , other than that it is a good product .</li>
            <li>This is just right for that extra glow!</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change is it does have a little more glitter than I was expecting, but not so much that I won&#x27;t wear it.</li>
            <li>It looks so natural</li>
            <li>A little bit does go a long way, so it&#x27;s easy to put too much on.</li>
            <li>two hours later my face was extra crispy orange, hahaha...</li>
            <li>I ordered sunset bronze (I wouldn&#x27;t order this color unless you have pretty tan skin because it is dark!)</li>
            <li>If you use a little bit it just shimmers up your whole face like a disco ball!</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot for this dark bronzer Maybelline!</li>

            <li> Thanks a lot for this dark bronzer Maybelline!</li>
            <li> hmmm, is somewhat stiff, and does not blend it well, as well as is hard to grab product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not in love with the product.</li>
            <li> It can either give you a subtle glow or a distinct bronze look.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t run out for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dark though, so it I recommend only putting a TINY bit on.</li>
            <li> Im quite dark as i am half african american</li>
            <li> then I expected - a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and this has lasted for about a year now.</li>
            <li> I think that a little bit goes a long way with this bronzer</li>
            <li> You only need very little of it</li>
            <li> and I only used a small amount.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t break me out like a previous bronzer I used to use.</li>
            <li> Depending on how dark of a bronzer you want, you can put either a little or a lot of the product on a brush and blend it into your skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product online, but in-store a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now.</li>
            <li> The hairs are were very rough, stiff and hard; makes it very hard to control the amount you actually use.</li>
            <li> and I would give it a 5 sttar if it had just a touch less glitter!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect miracles with less than 5 dollars!</li>
            <li> It is too shimmery and very messy.</li>
            <li> shipping took around 4 weeks so not to bad.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t the worst.</li>
            <li> The brush is terrible!</li>

            <li> I guess I underestimated the shimmer. It was everywhere and I only used a small amount. The color was pretty.</li>
            <li> Really good bronzer! its not to shiney, it got the right amount of glitter! easy to apply and an overall nice colour. Im quite dark as i am half african american so im a light brown and it works really well with my skin tone. shipping took around 4 weeks so not to bad. I love this product and strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This bronzer is awesome! I ordered sunset bronze (I wouldn&#x27;t order this color unless you have pretty tan skin because it is dark!) My face is a little lighter than the rest of my body and this bronzer matches my face to the rest of my body perfectly! GREAT for the price and I got it only 3 days after I ordered! The only thing I would change is it does have a little more glitter than I was expecting, but not so much that I won&#x27;t wear it. I still love it and I would give it a 5 sttar if it had just a touch less glitter!</li>
            <li> I put it on forgetting that it had shimmer in it. I don&#x27;t hate it, but it&#x27;s okay. Now I just use it after I finish putting on foundation and put it in my t-zone to add a glowly look..just don&#x27;t over-do it like I did lol!</li>
            <li> This product is great for highlighting cheek bones and giving that extra bronze feel in summer. It is light on the face, and doesn&#x27;t feel as if you&#x27;re wearing any makeup.</li>
            <li> I love it! I use this bronzer all the time. It is very lightweight and it blends perfectly. I use a foundation brush to apply/blend, not the brush provided. A little goes a long way and this has lasted for about a year now. I don&#x27;t see it in stores so i will continue to buy online.</li>
            <li> If I had bought this in the store, this would not be a color I would have chosen. It looked like a good color in the picture. I guess that&#x27;s what I get for buying things like this online. I will not do it again.</li>
            <li> Beauty! This is just right for that extra glow! Not too much shimmer. The colour (sunset bronze) should suggest that it is more for medium brown to dark hues for best bronzing effect, and indeed, it is. The brush handle is tiny but the bristles are very effective; they don&#x27;t shed on your face and the powder does not cake either. Thanks a lot for this dark bronzer Maybelline!</li>
            <li> It is smaller then it looks like which kind of dissipating but either way it still does its job as a bronzer.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used a bronzer in awhile - I&#x27;m so glad I tried this one. I have very oily skin and this worked very well with it. Does not make my skin more greasy. Color looks nice and natural. I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the brush it came with, but worked fine with one of my other brushes. Great product and value!</li>
            <li> Beautiful bronze glisten on my skin tone. Love it! Doesn&#x27;t break me out like a previous bronzer I used to use.</li>
            <li> I use bronzers on my very fair skin.  This wasn&#x27;t my favorite but it wasn&#x27;t the worst. It covers well but has a lot of shimmer. When I went outside and looked at my arms I was sparkling.</li>
            <li> This product does not make you look orange. A little bit does go a long way, so it&#x27;s easy to put too much on. But overall value for the money.</li>
            <li> Adds a great glow, shine and sun kiss tan color.  It&#x27;s a great buy compared to many tanning brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product online, but in-store a few years ago. Oh, the HORROR! It is too shimmery and very messy. If you use a little bit it just shimmers up your whole face like a disco ball! The brush is terrible! The hairs are were very rough, stiff and hard; makes it very hard to control the amount you actually use. I remember putting this in my makeup pouch and the next time I opened my pouch the bronzer had somehow opened and was all over EVERYTHING! It was cray! So, overall I WOULD NOT recommend this product. It&#x27;s was too bronzy/shimmery and just a mess if you spill it on something like your shirt or a counter top or anything like that. Isn&#x27;t worth the struggle.</li>
            <li> This is the bronzer that I use every day. I really like the brush that it came with. This bronzer is a little more on the shimmery side but it still does the job.</li>
            <li> Really like this.  It&#x27;s very dark though, so it I recommend only putting a TINY bit on.</li>
            <li> The color is darker then I expected - a little bit goes a long way! It does give you a nice sunglow kiss!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect miracles with less than 5 dollars! When I first tried it on, it looked as if nothing was on my face, so I put a bit more, trying to build it up...two hours later my face was extra crispy orange, hahaha...I had to take it off. I guess you need a lot of light and/or the sun to really see the application.&lt;br /&gt;The brush..hmmm, is somewhat stiff, and does not blend it well, as well as is hard to grab product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not in love with the product.</li>
            <li> Way too orange for me and it has too much shimmer. But after I blend it for awhile it looks nice</li>
            <li> It has a little too much glitter in it which is why i stopped wearing it , other than that it is a good product .</li>
            <li> I bought this product for use during the summer months as I build up my tan and I love it!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I took the plunge and ordered this product. Depending on how dark of a bronzer you want, you can put either a little or a lot of the product on a brush and blend it into your skin. It can either give you a subtle glow or a distinct bronze look. I think that a little bit goes a long way with this bronzer and I absolutely love it. It looks so natural and it comes really fast. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is nice, but I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> It is just as described. And maybelline makes the best products. Great to use as a bronzer or blush according to your skin color.&lt;br /&gt;Great buy!</li>
            <li> Pleased with product.</li>
            <li> This is light and and it applies thinly. It does not come off on my clothes etc matches my shade perfectly!</li>
            <li> great way to bring a nice tan look to your face without having to spend alot of money...this product arrived on time and i love it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years now. You only need very little of it so it doesn&#x27;t run out for a long time. I use it for contouring and blush. I recommend using a high quality brush than the one that comes with the product. Love it.</li>
