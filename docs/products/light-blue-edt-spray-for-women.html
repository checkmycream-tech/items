            <li>I will admit to being a snob when it comes to fragrances, I have splurged on many that were heavenly and many that were not as good as I thought after wearing them for a while.  </li>

            <li>i can say she was happy of this perfume and its worth it.</li>

            <li> I was very leery after reading the reviews. I got this a day before I was supposed to. I opened it up and instantly put it on. I put it on 4 hours ago and the fragrance is still very noticeable. I will definitely buy from them again</li>
            <li> I will admit to being a snob when it comes to fragrances, I have splurged on many that were heavenly and many that were not as good as I thought after wearing them for a while.  THIS fragrance is by far my fave for the last 2 years.  It will continue to be my go-to fragrance.  The best part is that it is a really good deal here on Amazon.
