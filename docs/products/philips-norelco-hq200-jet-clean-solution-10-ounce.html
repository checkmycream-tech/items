            <li>So let&#x27;s assume this is good stuff, and necessary to keep your Norelco razon performing at its best!</li>
            <li>Wish they can make one do not need to refill and just replace it directly to the machine, very good and smell nice too.</li>
            <li>i always struggled to find the perfect combo until now, and this was the missing peaice, very happy with it, well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Easy to store and have handy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t catch that nuance, but Amazon accepted the return, so things turned out OK.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure that you don&#x27;t repeat my error--</li>
            <li>I found that is a perfect substitute if you wish to do the same.</li>
            <li>It will give your razor blades a longer life and the result is a better cut after each cleaning.</li>
            <li>use it after most every shave and</li>
            <li>Love the shaver, but think this stuff could be a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>The razor worked much better with cleaner blades.  </li>
            <li>it comes out 100% better with the solution than just to rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works weel with my Norelco razor and reminds me I need to order some more.</li>
            <li>This product is working as advertised and I am pleased with this Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li>easier to use this liquid to wash away hair particles from shaver heads;  much better than having to wash them with soap and water</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite amazing how well this product and the cleaning station clean the shaver.</li>
            <li>The blades appear nice and shiny and clean.</li>
            <li>Cleans well and has a nice clean odour.</li>
            <li>Keeps heads very clean.</li>
            <li>Make shaving smooth and easy!</li>
            <li>I am excited to use this product!</li>
            <li>Keeps razor clean!</li>
            <li>Overall it is a very good product</li>
            <li>And with a Prime membership you get free two day shipping, making it even more affordable to stock up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>After I clean most of the hair from the head, I pour this solution over the head and let soak for a day.  </li>
            <li>Razor heads move smoothly and cleanly!</li>
            <li>I swish the head around and it loosens the fine hairs I hadn&#x27;t cleaned out.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>The Jet clean foams, fizzes and may do a good job, but frankly the cost is conducive to going back to a nice cheap blade.....which rinses in water.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge Plus that Amazon has plenty in stock and at a discounted price to boot.</li>
            <li>Easy to use solution and makes heads smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Signing up for the recurring delivery from Amazon is cheaper than buying it in stores (if it were available) and with the cost of gas, probably a lot cheaper than running all over town looking for it.</li>
            <li>It lets the shaving head run smoothly.   </li>
            <li>It is smooth and light.</li>
            <li>purchased to easily maintain and clean my norelco razor.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase :) It is very practical and very efficient.</li>
            <li>and you will enjoy s quick comfortable shave</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the equivalent of more hot dogs than buns in the package.</li>
            <li>The original solution from Philips Norelco is the way to go...</li>
            <li>Been using it on my Phillips shaver and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping any more vs hot water.  </li>
            <li>It keep the shaver clean.    </li>
            <li>Seems to clean just like it</li>
            <li>I found that the razor sits in its cradel, rocking merrily and ingesting the jet clean material through two cycles each time I shave.   </li>
            <li>Philips Norelco HQ200 Jet Clean Solution (Pack of 3)]]  Arrived on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li>I clean the heads on my razor with this solution about every 3 weeks, and this bottle lasts about 4 months...</li>
            <li>I realize these are supposed to be used with a device that uses the solution to clean your razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Keeps the blades really clean and extends the life of the blades.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;for clean up after shaving.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your sensotouch smelling clean and lubricated.</li>
            <li>Used it to clean my razor...</li>
            <li>Just maintain the shaver like you used to in the days before Jet Clean</li>
            <li>What a world of difference between rinsing the razor heads with water verses soaking them in the Jet Clean Solution and then rinsing with water.</li>
            <li>I do not have a Jet Clean Solution tank</li>
            <li>I put about 1/2 inch of Jet Clean Solution in the container and when I put the razor in</li>
            <li>I use this to clean my XL shavers of which I have two.  </li>
            <li>What can I say about Jet Clean solution</li>
            <li>Keeps my Norelco shaver clean.</li>
            <li>The solutions serves its purpose rather then just using water to clean the razor.</li>
            <li>HE WAS RIGHT!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Norelco Clean an Charge station.</li>
            <li>I just changed the solution for the first time, very easy to change, no expensive cartriges to deal with.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It definitely does a good a job and compared to the cost of the Braun cartridges</li>
            <li>but why it&#x27;s called \\&quot;Cool Breeze\\</li>
            <li>Fast shipping on one of the better sites..</li>
            <li>I chatted with someone at the Norelco website, and they pointed me to an updated HQ200 -- \\&quot;Cool Breeze.\\</li>
            <li>The bottle is only good for about 2 months of cleaning (three if you don&#x27;t shave that often and can stretch your cleaning periods).</li>
            <li>Shaving heads seem to last longer and shave is good.</li>
            <li>get a cleaner now made with cool breeze and it smell and if you have problems with you skin this will make it redder, and you smell too....</li>
            <li>I purchased a new Norelco razor and of course needed the appropriate accessories....including the Norelco Jet Clean.    </li>
            <li>maybe once a week is adequate</li>
            <li>One problem is that it can evaporate quickly it you dont use it often.</li>
            <li>The shaver that goes with the solution is so wonderful that I will do whatever it takes to keep it clean and going as long as possible.</li>
            <li>so I have a fresh shave every time.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Both the produce and the price was right..</li>
            <li>My husband has never had a moment&#x27;s worry with his razors, thanks to the Jet Clean Solution.</li>
            <li>Works very well to keep my Norelco razor clean between uses.</li>
            <li>As for results, the solution is very effective the blades and foil come out gleaming  and exceptionally clean - which means longer blade life and having to replace the head less frequently -</li>
            <li>When Braun introduced the first automatic cleaning system I grabbed one right</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you have the jet clean system for the norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Very Very easy to use and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>If you have the new Jet Clean system with your Philips Norelco shaver then I recommend this product...</li>
            <li>This is exactly what my husband and I have looked all over Nashville for and could not find it anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I rinse the blades first in water, so they don&#x27;t leave a lot of debris in the cleaner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have done it many times since the same way.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li>This just came in and it appears to be exactly whay</li>
            <li>My only criticism is that it is a bit more pricey that it probably needs to be.</li>
            <li>I guess this is okay, but I actually wash my razor head under running water every time I shave anyway...</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t exactly what I intended to order, but it does extend the life of the razor heads..</li>
            <li>/&gt;so be aware....</li>
            <li>From such a great company, and after such a high priced product, this monthly \\&quot;cleaning fee\\&quot; seems tacky.</li>
            <li>So, obviously, you do have to clean the razor periodically!  </li>
            <li>This order was delivered extremely fast and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>I think its purely cosmetic though so continue to use water if you can do a no shaving cream shave.</li>
            <li>their \\&quot;Clean and Renew\\&quot; system were soon put to rest and the cost of the cleaning cartridges  soon became insignificant in comparison to how well my blades and razor head were kept sharp, perfectly clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having switched to Norelco Sensotouch 3D 1200 -</li>
            <li>this item was in a different packaging but still the same  amount as advertised and works amazing</li>
            <li>Have been very satified with it.</li>
            <li>VERY WELL</li>
            <li>AND AT A REASONABLE COST.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted to ask why it&#x27;s so much?</li>
            <li>Cleaned razor very thoroughly even a year after the blade should have been replaced.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t really missed it.</li>
            <li>very well thanl you for seanding it so fast we will order again from you company.</li>
            <li>A Review really?</li>
            <li>I am instructed to replenish the Jet Clean on a regular basis.....</li>
            <li>This bottle will last you 30 washes or cycles with the Jet Clean device.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a month now, and do not see any reason for buying this specific clean solution.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used up the bottle that came with the razor and ordered a couple of refills of the same solution and one of the \\&quot;Cool</li>
            <li>A bottle of solution lasts ten cleanings(almost a full year)</li>
            <li>Been using vinegar for several months and it does same with better smell.</li>
            <li>There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a price break for buying these in quantity, and I&#x27;m surprised there&#x27;s not a larger bottle available.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>it cleans without costing a lot of money, no smell what so ever after cleaning, it is highly recommended for any type of shaver</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>My shaver is now well over a year old and has gone through several refills and everything is clean and new looking, still.</li>
            <li>and it really keeps the razor heads clear of deposits that build up.  </li>
            <li>a soapy residue does build up, especially with constant use a quick swish under hot water should remove</li>
            <li>This stuff made my shaver like new.      </li>
            <li>It makes it look, smell, and feel brand new.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like waking up to a new razor every day.</li>
            <li>They were shiny and looked new.  </li>
            <li>Thank you very much for such products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty conservative with it, adding just enough new solution to the old to cover the blades, making up for evaporation.  </li>
            <li>My jet clean unit broke down after a year or two</li>
            <li>It is like they knew that you won&#x27;t have enough for two whole uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Delivery was completely satisfactory.</li>
            <li>I am an old retired geezard(according to you young people)</li>
            <li>I cannot say the same for older shavers that did not use a cleaning system.</li>
            <li>meant for use with high price cleaning device but also works as a simple &amp;#34;soak and rinse&amp;#34; cleaner.</li>
            <li>Personally the Jet Clean system makes for one less thing I have to worry about...</li>
            <li>Seemed to work okay in combination with this cleaning fluid, but mouthwash has a number of ingredients, and not knowing whether it would have negative impacts on the razor</li>
            <li>After trying it, I personally think the whole Jet Clean setup for Norelco shavers is pretty silly.</li>
            <li>I have tried and owned all the major brands.</li>
            <li>My 9160x is almost 11 yrs old and still continuning on with every 2nd day rinising off.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a much cleaner razor even after I previously rinsed it out completely.</li>
            <li>I used it to clean my electric razor, as usual ,it is the product I have used since I bought the razor several years ago.</li>
            <li>It was hard to find at a reasonable price before, but now is very afortable.</li>
            <li>I could never eem to find this electric shave lubricant in my area due to it being in high demand.  </li>

            <li> It will give your razor blades a longer life and the result is a better cut after each cleaning.</li>
            <li> use it after most every shave and</li>
            <li> Love the shaver, but think this stuff could be a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> The razor worked much better with cleaner blades.  </li>
            <li> it comes out 100% better with the solution than just to rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works weel with my Norelco razor and reminds me I need to order some more.</li>
            <li> This product is working as advertised and I am pleased with this Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li> easier to use this liquid to wash away hair particles from shaver heads;  much better than having to wash them with soap and water</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite amazing how well this product and the cleaning station clean the shaver.</li>
            <li> The blades appear nice and shiny and clean.</li>
            <li> Cleans well and has a nice clean odour.</li>
            <li> Keeps heads very clean.</li>
            <li> Make shaving smooth and easy!</li>
            <li> I am excited to use this product!</li>
            <li> Keeps razor clean!</li>
            <li> Overall it is a very good product</li>
            <li> And with a Prime membership you get free two day shipping, making it even more affordable to stock up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> After I clean most of the hair from the head, I pour this solution over the head and let soak for a day.  </li>
            <li> Razor heads move smoothly and cleanly!</li>
            <li> I swish the head around and it loosens the fine hairs I hadn&#x27;t cleaned out.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> The Jet clean foams, fizzes and may do a good job, but frankly the cost is conducive to going back to a nice cheap blade.....which rinses in water.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a huge Plus that Amazon has plenty in stock and at a discounted price to boot.</li>
            <li> Easy to use solution and makes heads smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Signing up for the recurring delivery from Amazon is cheaper than buying it in stores (if it were available) and with the cost of gas, probably a lot cheaper than running all over town looking for it.</li>
            <li> It lets the shaving head run smoothly.   </li>
            <li> It is smooth and light.</li>
            <li> purchased to easily maintain and clean my norelco razor.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase :) It is very practical and very efficient.</li>
            <li> and you will enjoy s quick comfortable shave</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the equivalent of more hot dogs than buns in the package.</li>
            <li> The original solution from Philips Norelco is the way to go...</li>
            <li> Been using it on my Phillips shaver and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping any more vs hot water.  </li>
            <li> It keep the shaver clean.    </li>
            <li> Seems to clean just like it</li>
            <li> I found that the razor sits in its cradel, rocking merrily and ingesting the jet clean material through two cycles each time I shave.   </li>
            <li> Philips Norelco HQ200 Jet Clean Solution (Pack of 3)]]  Arrived on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> I clean the heads on my razor with this solution about every 3 weeks, and this bottle lasts about 4 months...</li>
            <li> I realize these are supposed to be used with a device that uses the solution to clean your razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Keeps the blades really clean and extends the life of the blades.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;for clean up after shaving.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your sensotouch smelling clean and lubricated.</li>
            <li> Used it to clean my razor...</li>
            <li> Just maintain the shaver like you used to in the days before Jet Clean</li>
            <li> What a world of difference between rinsing the razor heads with water verses soaking them in the Jet Clean Solution and then rinsing with water.</li>
            <li> I do not have a Jet Clean Solution tank</li>
            <li> I put about 1/2 inch of Jet Clean Solution in the container and when I put the razor in</li>
            <li> I use this to clean my XL shavers of which I have two.  </li>
            <li> What can I say about Jet Clean solution</li>
            <li> Keeps my Norelco shaver clean.</li>
            <li> The solutions serves its purpose rather then just using water to clean the razor.</li>
            <li> HE WAS RIGHT!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Norelco Clean an Charge station.</li>
            <li> I just changed the solution for the first time, very easy to change, no expensive cartriges to deal with.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It definitely does a good a job and compared to the cost of the Braun cartridges</li>
            <li> but why it&#x27;s called \\&quot;Cool Breeze\\</li>
            <li> Fast shipping on one of the better sites..</li>
            <li> I chatted with someone at the Norelco website, and they pointed me to an updated HQ200 -- \\&quot;Cool Breeze.\\</li>
            <li> The bottle is only good for about 2 months of cleaning (three if you don&#x27;t shave that often and can stretch your cleaning periods).</li>
            <li> Shaving heads seem to last longer and shave is good.</li>
            <li> get a cleaner now made with cool breeze and it smell and if you have problems with you skin this will make it redder, and you smell too....</li>
            <li> I purchased a new Norelco razor and of course needed the appropriate accessories....including the Norelco Jet Clean.    </li>
            <li> maybe once a week is adequate</li>
            <li> One problem is that it can evaporate quickly it you dont use it often.</li>
            <li> The shaver that goes with the solution is so wonderful that I will do whatever it takes to keep it clean and going as long as possible.</li>
            <li> so I have a fresh shave every time.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Both the produce and the price was right..</li>
            <li> My husband has never had a moment&#x27;s worry with his razors, thanks to the Jet Clean Solution.</li>
            <li> Works very well to keep my Norelco razor clean between uses.</li>
            <li> As for results, the solution is very effective the blades and foil come out gleaming  and exceptionally clean - which means longer blade life and having to replace the head less frequently -</li>
            <li> When Braun introduced the first automatic cleaning system I grabbed one right</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you have the jet clean system for the norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Very Very easy to use and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> If you have the new Jet Clean system with your Philips Norelco shaver then I recommend this product...</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my husband and I have looked all over Nashville for and could not find it anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I rinse the blades first in water, so they don&#x27;t leave a lot of debris in the cleaner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have done it many times since the same way.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> This just came in and it appears to be exactly whay</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that it is a bit more pricey that it probably needs to be.</li>
            <li> I guess this is okay, but I actually wash my razor head under running water every time I shave anyway...</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t exactly what I intended to order, but it does extend the life of the razor heads..</li>
            <li> /&gt;so be aware....</li>
            <li> From such a great company, and after such a high priced product, this monthly \\&quot;cleaning fee\\&quot; seems tacky.</li>
            <li> So, obviously, you do have to clean the razor periodically!  </li>
            <li> This order was delivered extremely fast and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I think its purely cosmetic though so continue to use water if you can do a no shaving cream shave.</li>
            <li> their \\&quot;Clean and Renew\\&quot; system were soon put to rest and the cost of the cleaning cartridges  soon became insignificant in comparison to how well my blades and razor head were kept sharp, perfectly clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having switched to Norelco Sensotouch 3D 1200 -</li>
            <li> this item was in a different packaging but still the same  amount as advertised and works amazing</li>
            <li> Have been very satified with it.</li>
            <li> VERY WELL</li>
            <li> AND AT A REASONABLE COST.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted to ask why it&#x27;s so much?</li>
            <li> Cleaned razor very thoroughly even a year after the blade should have been replaced.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t really missed it.</li>
            <li> very well thanl you for seanding it so fast we will order again from you company.</li>
            <li> A Review really?</li>
            <li> I am instructed to replenish the Jet Clean on a regular basis.....</li>
            <li> This bottle will last you 30 washes or cycles with the Jet Clean device.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a month now, and do not see any reason for buying this specific clean solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used up the bottle that came with the razor and ordered a couple of refills of the same solution and one of the \\&quot;Cool</li>
            <li> A bottle of solution lasts ten cleanings(almost a full year)</li>
            <li> Been using vinegar for several months and it does same with better smell.</li>
            <li> There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a price break for buying these in quantity, and I&#x27;m surprised there&#x27;s not a larger bottle available.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> it cleans without costing a lot of money, no smell what so ever after cleaning, it is highly recommended for any type of shaver</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> My shaver is now well over a year old and has gone through several refills and everything is clean and new looking, still.</li>
            <li> and it really keeps the razor heads clear of deposits that build up.  </li>
            <li> a soapy residue does build up, especially with constant use a quick swish under hot water should remove</li>
            <li> This stuff made my shaver like new.      </li>
            <li> It makes it look, smell, and feel brand new.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like waking up to a new razor every day.</li>
            <li> They were shiny and looked new.  </li>
            <li> Thank you very much for such products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty conservative with it, adding just enough new solution to the old to cover the blades, making up for evaporation.  </li>
            <li> My jet clean unit broke down after a year or two</li>
            <li> It is like they knew that you won&#x27;t have enough for two whole uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Delivery was completely satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I am an old retired geezard(according to you young people)</li>
            <li> I cannot say the same for older shavers that did not use a cleaning system.</li>
            <li> meant for use with high price cleaning device but also works as a simple &amp;#34;soak and rinse&amp;#34; cleaner.</li>
            <li> Personally the Jet Clean system makes for one less thing I have to worry about...</li>
            <li> Seemed to work okay in combination with this cleaning fluid, but mouthwash has a number of ingredients, and not knowing whether it would have negative impacts on the razor</li>
            <li> After trying it, I personally think the whole Jet Clean setup for Norelco shavers is pretty silly.</li>
            <li> I have tried and owned all the major brands.</li>
            <li> My 9160x is almost 11 yrs old and still continuning on with every 2nd day rinising off.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a much cleaner razor even after I previously rinsed it out completely.</li>
            <li> I used it to clean my electric razor, as usual ,it is the product I have used since I bought the razor several years ago.</li>
            <li> It was hard to find at a reasonable price before, but now is very afortable.</li>
            <li> I could never eem to find this electric shave lubricant in my area due to it being in high demand.  </li>
            <li> It is a cheap investment to keep an expensive shaver running well.</li>
            <li> A long time fan of Braun razors, I&#x27;ve been using them for 35 years.</li>
            <li> Breeze\\&quot; They both work equally well but to my nose there&#x27;s absolutely no difference in</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for over 5 years and will continue doing so for as long as I need it.</li>
            <li> The only down side is there isn&#x27;t exactly enough for 2 cleanings in one bottle.</li>
            <li> I have 2 Norelco shaving heads that I alternate keeping one in the cleaning solution when using the other head.</li>
            <li> It does clean the razor well, however does leave a weird smell from the solution.</li>
            <li> I air dry it and then replace it on the razor</li>
            <li> 59.99 for ten ounces when other company&#x27;s price is 14.00 for two 10 oz bottles!</li>
            <li> The ingredients seem mundane enough, so why the cost......are we purchasing the product or the Trademark?</li>
            <li> Hope this last for a few years that is why you need to buy a case.</li>
            <li> delivered as expected</li>
            <li> so I use a small container just big enough to set the razor in upside down.</li>
            <li> plain water wont keep the blades lubed -- if you use this razor daily, dont skimp on the cleaning.</li>
            <li> I would not trade it for any other razor on the market.</li>
            <li> I just use a small liquid container,  in about an inch deep of solution, then run the shaver dipping it down into the solution.  </li>
            <li> no issues - got what i wanted, simple to choose &amp; complete purchase, received within time specified, less expensive than other sites</li>
            <li> so I actually get a few months out of each change!!  </li>
            <li> every time I need to replace it, I throw in a few other items I order -- water filters, etc.</li>
            <li> I subscribed to a monthly delivery and it was always on time, and I saved a little bit of money.</li>
            <li> it works not sure if there are other products like it</li>
            <li> any case, I have been away from my cleaner for a few weeks and have been using water to wash it out.</li>
            <li> I run the razor for just a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.  </li>
            <li> The cleaner suggest you change it every few weeks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the device, I just poured some of this into a small container and put my blades out of my norelco razor and let them sit overnight in the solution.  </li>
            <li> There is no better cleaner out on the market then this.</li>
            <li> cleanin solution seems hard to find in stores - even those that carry my razor.</li>
            <li> Even my late father who always used a safety razor, once I got him a Norelco never went back&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Apparently skin oils, lip balm, etc coat the cutting edges making for poor shaves.  </li>
            <li> After each charging cycle (approximately every 5 weeks), I add Jet solution to a small container and drop each head and screen in the solution swirl and rinse off.</li>
            <li> My son has never said a negative thing about his shaver or the solution!</li>
            <li> Too expensive but no alternative product found.</li>
            <li> Def recommend to anyone with an expensive beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is impossible to find in stores.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I order this cleaning solution for my razor stand periodically to keep my razor running in the best condition.  This order was delivered extremely fast and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I knew for years that Norelco made the best razor with this system they have outdone themselves. I have tried and owned all the major brands. Even my late father who always used a safety razor, once I got him a Norelco never went back&lt;br /&gt; Follow their directions and you will enjoy s quick comfortable shave</li>
            <li> This stuff is impossible to find in stores. If a store sells it, there&#x27;s always a blank space where the product should be. Signing up for the recurring delivery from Amazon is cheaper than buying it in stores (if it were available) and with the cost of gas, probably a lot cheaper than running all over town looking for it. The shaver that goes with the solution is so wonderful that I will do whatever it takes to keep it clean and going as long as possible.</li>
            <li> I have used this before, it works very good in my container that I have to clean and charge the shaver.  It keep the shaver clean.    Joe</li>
            <li> I thought my shaver head was worn out after only 3 months.  A friend said that it probably only needed to be cleaned.  I bought this HQ200.  HE WAS RIGHT!  Apparently skin oils, lip balm, etc coat the cutting edges making for poor shaves.  This stuff made my shaver like new.      I think of all the shaver heads I&#x27;ve prematurely thrown away over the years.  DOH!</li>
            <li> In the short time ive used this product it works as advertised. I just changed the solution for the first time, very easy to change, no expensive cartriges to deal with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite amazing how well this product and the cleaning station clean the shaver. It makes it look, smell, and feel brand new.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. Seems to clean just like it should.&lt;br /&gt;The price I paid thru Amazon was the best I could find.&lt;br /&gt;R A Y</li>
            <li> I purchased a new Norelco razor and of course needed the appropriate accessories....including the Norelco Jet Clean.    I found that the razor sits in its cradel, rocking merrily and ingesting the jet clean material through two cycles each time I shave.   I am instructed to replenish the Jet Clean on a regular basis.....of course this is even including blowing the heads after each shave with compressed air.    The Jet clean foams, fizzes and may do a good job, but frankly the cost is conducive to going back to a nice cheap blade.....which rinses in water.   The ingredients seem mundane enough, so why the cost......are we purchasing the product or the Trademark?</li>
            <li> Just note that this is a fluid to be used in a Norelco cleaning system, not as a stand alone cleaner and lubricant.  I didn&#x27;t catch that nuance, but Amazon accepted the return, so things turned out OK.  Just make sure that you don&#x27;t repeat my error--THIS PRODUCT REQUIRES A NORELCO JET SYSTEM and can&#x27;t be used by itself.</li>
            <li> this was a great price for two bottles of the cleaner, the fast service was great too.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001E96UZU Philips Norelco HQ200 Jet Clean Solution (Pack of 3)]]  Arrived on time and as advertised. I can feel a difference in the comfort of a shave when using it compared to not using it. The local drug store does not carry it so thank you!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my husband and I have looked all over Nashville for and could not find it anywhere.  We have purchased this before from Amazon.  Have been very satified with it.</li>
            <li> This does a great job of cleaning and lubricating my Norelco razor in the cleaning system. Shaving after using this feels great. The only down side is there isn&#x27;t exactly enough for 2 cleanings in one bottle. It&#x27;s the equivalent of more hot dogs than buns in the package.</li>
            <li> I brought this under a subscription on Amazon. It does clean the razor well, however does leave a weird smell from the solution. In order to save money and be greener (this is made in Holland, and to save plastic) I switched to vinegar. I found that is a perfect substitute if you wish to do the same. Don&#x27;t fall for the \\&quot;you must use norelco solution\\&quot; like I did. Been using vinegar for several months and it does same with better smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleaning solution for quite a while now and it really keeps the razor heads clear of deposits that build up.  It will give your razor blades a longer life and the result is a better cut after each cleaning.</li>
            <li> I bought my son the top-of-the-line Norelco shaver as a gift.  He loves it.  So, obviously, you do have to clean the razor periodically!  I bought this Norelco cleaner for him at a great price on Amazon.com.  My son has never said a negative thing about his shaver or the solution! So let&#x27;s assume this is good stuff, and necessary to keep your Norelco razon performing at its best!</li>
            <li> A long time fan of Braun razors, I&#x27;ve been using them for 35 years. When Braun introduced the first automatic cleaning system I grabbed one right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any thoughts I had about their \\&quot;Clean and Renew\\&quot; system were soon put to rest and the cost of the cleaning cartridges  soon became insignificant in comparison to how well my blades and razor head were kept sharp, perfectly clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having switched to Norelco Sensotouch 3D 1200 - I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Norelco Clean an Charge station. It&#x27;s a sensation piece of ingenuity and the kid in me never tires of watching it raise, lowed and tilt the razor into the solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it after most every shave and it&#x27;s like waking up to a new razor every day. It&#x27;s a bit soapy compared to the Braun which is alcohol based and strips the blades of any residue while lubricating them at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a soapy residue does build up, especially with constant use a quick swish under hot water should remove it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely does a good a job and compared to the cost of the Braun cartridges it&#x27;s a bargain. I&#x27;ve used up the bottle that came with the razor and ordered a couple of refills of the same solution and one of the \\&quot;Cool Breeze\\&quot; They both work equally well but to my nose there&#x27;s absolutely no difference in scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that this matters, it&#x27;s not cologne but why it&#x27;s called \\&quot;Cool Breeze\\&quot; is beyond me. As for results, the solution is very effective the blades and foil come out gleaming  and exceptionally clean - which means longer blade life and having to replace the head less frequently - or so I hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanin solution seems hard to find in stores - even those that carry my razor. It&#x27;s a huge Plus that Amazon has plenty in stock and at a discounted price to boot. And with a Prime membership you get free two day shipping, making it even more affordable to stock up.</li>
            <li> This solution does work well in the Norelco razor cleaning system.  It lets the shaving head run smoothly.   It is pricy though.</li>
            <li> Love the shaver, but think this stuff could be a lot cheaper. From such a great company, and after such a high priced product, this monthly \\&quot;cleaning fee\\&quot; seems tacky.</li>
            <li> I used it to clean my electric razor, as usual ,it is the product I have used since I bought the razor several years ago.</li>
            <li> Both the produce and the price was right.. Fast shipping on one of the better sites.. Hope this last for a few years that is why you need to buy a case.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT FUNCTIONS VERY WELL AND AT A REASONABLE COST.  I WOULD DEFINITELY PURCHASE THIS ITEM IN THE FUTURE IF I HAD A NEED.  I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re gonna need it after the trail bottle from the shaver package runs out. The bottle is the same size that comes the shaver package. This bottle will last you 30 washes or cycles with the Jet Clean device. You&#x27;ll reuse 1/2 of this solution for about 15 washes and then dump out &amp; resupply w/last 1/2 of solution into tray for washes 16 - 30.</li>
            <li> i used to always use a razor for my neck as my religion doesn&#x27;t allow razors  on the face, and an electric shaver for my face. i always struggled to find the perfect combo until now, and this was the missing peaice, very happy with it, well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this product from Norelco for years.  After I clean most of the hair from the head, I pour this solution over the head and let soak for a day.  I swish the head around and it loosens the fine hairs I hadn&#x27;t cleaned out.  I air dry it and then replace it on the razor and it gives a smoother and softer shave.</li>
            <li> rip off!!!&lt;br /&gt;wrrrrrrrrrr&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;guys do not be fooled by the price, at walmart you get that way cheaper - 4.60$</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used two bottles, and just ordered another two.  There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a price break for buying these in quantity, and I&#x27;m surprised there&#x27;s not a larger bottle available.  I clean the heads on my razor with this solution about every 3 weeks, and this bottle lasts about 4 months... I&#x27;m pretty conservative with it, adding just enough new solution to the old to cover the blades, making up for evaporation.  I rinse the blades first in water, so they don&#x27;t leave a lot of debris in the cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I ran out, so I added mouthwash.  Seemed to work okay in combination with this cleaning fluid, but mouthwash has a number of ingredients, and not knowing whether it would have negative impacts on the razor, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.  So I&#x27;m going to order two at a time, and reorder when I start the second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars for doing the job it is supposed to do.  Three stars for size of container.  Two stars for price.</li>
            <li> I see no use in paying for this.  Just fill you cleaner with a bit of liquid shower soap and water.</li>
            <li> This Norelco razor is superb. The closest shave ever. It is smooth and light. It is a superior product. I would not trade it for any other razor on the market.</li>
            <li> I realize these are supposed to be used with a device that uses the solution to clean your razor.  I don&#x27;t have the device, I just poured some of this into a small container and put my blades out of my norelco razor and let them sit overnight in the solution.  When they came out they were a lot cleaner.  They were shiny and looked new.  The razor worked much better with cleaner blades.  I have done it many times since the same way.  It works.  I like it.</li>
            <li> A bottle gets me 1.8 refils. It is like they knew that you won&#x27;t have enough for two whole uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I have been away from my cleaner for a few weeks and have been using water to wash it out. it comes out 100% better with the solution than just to rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use foam and the foam leaves a gunk in the blades. I think its purely cosmetic though so continue to use water if you can do a no shaving cream shave.</li>
            <li> Hubby&#x27;s Norelco shaver does not require this type of cleaner.  Seller said it was not defective so this was not returnable.  My loss of approx 8.00 +  The cleaner solution also requires a razor that has some sort of cup to pour the solution into.  Before ordering this item, double check with Norelco to see if this cleaner is necessary and ask for instruction as to how solution should be used with your model razor.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I find it easier to just order this from Amazon than go find it in my local retail store. My shaver is now well over a year old and has gone through several refills and everything is clean and new looking, still. I cannot say the same for older shavers that did not use a cleaning system. It is a cheap investment to keep an expensive shaver running well. (And, I use this as a reminder -- every time I need to replace it, I throw in a few other items I order -- water filters, etc. And no fighting crowds at Wal-Mart...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/20/2012: When I went to reorder, I noticed the price had gone up. I chatted with someone at the Norelco website, and they pointed me to an updated HQ200 -- \\&quot;Cool Breeze.\\&quot; It is in a different style bottle and package, but was $4.99 with Amazon Prime shipping. So, that appears to be the replacement for this product.</li>
            <li> purchased to easily maintain and clean my norelco razor. Just place in cleaner and press button and forget. Am very pleased with results.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a very good product&lt;br /&gt;Keeps the blades really clean and extends the life of the blades. I like it.</li>
            <li> delivered as expected</li>
            <li> My husband has the shaver and can&#x27;t find the solution in the local stores, not even Wal-Mart? Keeps razor clean!</li>
            <li> I have used the product before and it really is good&lt;br /&gt;for clean up after shaving.  I will continue to use this&lt;br /&gt;product.</li>
            <li> Very Very easy to use and lasts a long time.  Keeps heads very clean. Easy to store and have handy.</li>
            <li> 59.99 for ten ounces when other company&#x27;s price is 14.00 for two 10 oz bottles! I just wanted to ask why it&#x27;s so much?</li>
            <li> A++++++++++ item.so good.</li>
            <li> Too expensive but no alternative product found.</li>
            <li> I loved this item. It was exactly what I thought it was going to be. I had purchased this item locally before and could no longer find. That &#x27;s when I decided to buy it on line.  I would use this site again. I have used this product for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for such products. I am very pleased with this purchase :) It is very practical and very efficient. Thank you very much. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> this is a necessary item if you have a philips razor.  easy to use and great for razor maintainance.  a great buy!</li>
            <li> The bottle is only good for about 2 months of cleaning (three if you don&#x27;t shave that often and can stretch your cleaning periods). It leaves your sensotouch smelling clean and lubricated.</li>
            <li> I subscribed to a monthly delivery and it was always on time, and I saved a little bit of money. After some time my circumstances changed and I needed to cancel, it was a no-hassle experience. It&#x27;s a good product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Works well.  My husband loves this brand of cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> Leaves a much cleaner razor even after I previously rinsed it out completely.</li>
            <li> If you have the new Jet Clean system with your Philips Norelco shaver then I recommend this product...highly recommend.  Personally the Jet Clean system makes for one less thing I have to worry about...it cleans and lubricates my shaver.  The original solution from Philips Norelco is the way to go...have it on hand and just replenish when necessary.</li>
            <li> Used it to clean my razor... Good stuff.</li>
            <li> My husband uses a Norelco electric razor and he says this is perfect for cleaning it. Brochure claims proper cleaning will lengthen life of razor.</li>
            <li> Works weel with my Norelco razor and reminds me I need to order some more.</li>
            <li> Cleaned razor very thoroughly even a year after the blade should have been replaced.  Will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Great razor needs to be cleaned periodically, and I&#x27;ve used this solution for quite a while.  Works great.  Couldn&#x27;t find it in the local store where I had purchased it before, so I checked Amazon.  It was in stock.  Delivery was completely satisfactory.</li>
            <li> My husband swears by his Norelco electric razors.  He has used them for over 40 years.  The Phillips Norelco Jet Clean Solution is the perfect cleaner for the Norelco razor.  My husband has never had a moment&#x27;s worry with his razors, thanks to the Jet Clean Solution.</li>
            <li> After trying it, I personally think the whole Jet Clean setup for Norelco shavers is pretty silly. My jet clean unit broke down after a year or two and I haven&#x27;t really missed it. Just maintain the shaver like you used to in the days before Jet Clean and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> I have 2 Norelco shaving heads that I alternate keeping one in the cleaning solution when using the other head. Shaving heads seem to last longer and shave is good.</li>
            <li> This product is working as advertised and I am pleased with this Amazon purchase. I am excited to use this product!</li>
            <li> What a world of difference between rinsing the razor heads with water verses soaking them in the Jet Clean Solution and then rinsing with water. I do not have a Jet Clean Solution tank so I use a small container just big enough to set the razor in upside down. I put about 1/2 inch of Jet Clean Solution in the container and when I put the razor in I run the razor for just a few seconds. The next morning I let the extra solution drip out of the heads and use the razor with out rinsing the heads. The solution acts as a lubricant between the razor heads and your face. Great product, I wish I had used it sooner.</li>
            <li> meant for use with high price cleaning device but also works as a simple &amp;#34;soak and rinse&amp;#34; cleaner. maybe once a week is adequate</li>
            <li> it cleans without costing a lot of money, no smell what so ever after cleaning, it is highly recommended for any type of shaver</li>
            <li> I have used it for a month now, and do not see any reason for buying this specific clean solution.</li>
            <li> Picture shown is different than the bottle what we received. Name is same,however.</li>
            <li> I use this to clean my XL shavers of which I have two.  I just use a small liquid container,  in about an inch deep of solution, then run the shaver dipping it down into the solution.  Then I rinse off the shaver under the faucet in water.  The result is a sparkling clean shaver head that continues to shave perfectly.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my don and he is very pleased with it it cleansit very well thanl you for seanding it so fast we will order again from you company. Thank you  ottilie Boris.</li>
            <li> Easy to use solution and makes heads smooth and clean. Razor heads move smoothly and cleanly! Make shaving smooth and easy!</li>
            <li> Product does the job! Recommended for cleaning electric razors!</li>
            <li> no issues - got what i wanted, simple to choose &amp; complete purchase, received within time specified, less expensive than other sites</li>
            <li> plain water wont keep the blades lubed -- if you use this razor daily, dont skimp on the cleaning. great product.</li>
            <li> All the comments about needing a cleaning system and the solution not working without one appears to be incorrect. My 9160x is almost 11 yrs old and still continuning on with every 2nd day rinising off.  After each charging cycle (approximately every 5 weeks), I add Jet solution to a small container and drop each head and screen in the solution swirl and rinse off. The blades appear nice and shiny and clean. A spray of lubricant on the heads and we are good for another 5 weeks. A bottle of solution lasts ten cleanings(almost a full year) and I  see no reason why I need a cleaning system. The heads are replaced every 18 months. So, a bottle of electric shave, Jet solution and spray lubricant results in a very good shave. I am an old retired geezard(according to you young people) but I stay with what works for me.</li>
            <li> Been using it on my Phillips shaver and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping any more vs hot water.  Dont waste your money.  Just use rubbing alcohol and water.</li>
            <li> This just came in and it appears to be exactly whay I was looking for, now husband has a two year supply!!</li>
            <li> Works well with shaving system</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for use in the Jet cleaning apparatus that goes with the high-end Norelco razor.  My only criticism is that it is a bit more pricey that it probably needs to be.</li>
            <li> No problem with cleaning solution.  Works like supposed to in philips automatic shaver cleaning system.  I rinse my shaver before running through the cleaner so I actually get a few months out of each change!!  The cleaner suggest you change it every few weeks</li>
            <li> Nice compliment to the shaver!!!</li>
            <li> A Review really? What can I say about Jet Clean solution but it works cleaning my razor so I have a fresh shave every time.</li>
            <li> I guess this is okay, but I actually wash my razor head under running water every time I shave anyway...</li>
            <li> Great product for keeping your electric razor clean and in good working order.  Purchased for my husband and he uses it all the time.  It was hard to find at a reasonable price before, but now is very afortable.</li>
            <li> I could never eem to find this electric shave lubricant in my area due to it being in high demand.  I got this necessary lubricant for my shaver in excellent time and it was a welcome product for my Noreleco shaver...and skin.</li>
            <li> easier to use this liquid to wash away hair particles from shaver heads;  much better than having to wash them with soap and water</li>
            <li> this item was in a different packaging but still the same  amount as advertised and works amazing you can literally see it consolidate the hair and skin particulates at the bottom and this helps the cleaning solution last longer then before</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t exactly what I intended to order, but it does extend the life of the razor heads.. so it has turned out to be a good product to have on hand.</li>
            <li> Cleans well and has a nice clean odour.</li>
            <li> Wish they can make one do not need to refill and just replace it directly to the machine, very good and smell nice too.</li>
            <li> Keeps my Norelco shaver clean. One problem is that it can evaporate quickly it you dont use it often.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of reconditioning blades.</li>
            <li> CLEANS MY RAZOR WHAT CAN I SAY</li>
            <li> The solutions serves its purpose rather then just using water to clean the razor.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Works perfectly.  Does what it is supposed to do.  Can&#x27;t find it in local stores.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find it in stores. works good</li>
            <li> pulled the paint off my fountain.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for over 5 years and will continue doing so for as long as I need it.</li>
            <li> Works very well to keep my Norelco razor clean between uses.</li>
            <li> This stuff  CLEANS AMD REJUVENATES THE BLADES!!! I DEFENITLY GET SOME MORE OF THIS STUFF! PLUS IT HELPS THE BLADES LAST LONGER!!!</li>
            <li> Those of you out there they not longer make this cleaner anymore.. what you see is not what you get.&lt;br /&gt;you get a cleaner now made with cool breeze and it smell and if you have problems with you skin this will make it redder, and you smell too.... I have a call into the corp office,,,,,&lt;br /&gt;so be aware....</li>
            <li> There is no better cleaner out on the market then this. I use it on my Phillips beard trimmer weekly and have had nothing but good luck with it. Def recommend to anyone with an expensive beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> sent it with the razor it works not sure if there are other products like it but you need it when you spend the big bucks on a razor lol</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you have the jet clean system for the norelco shaver.  Over all very satisfied with the product.</li>
