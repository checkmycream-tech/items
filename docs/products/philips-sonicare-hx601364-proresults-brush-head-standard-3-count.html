            <li>Really does an excellent job cleaning the teeth.  </li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;ve used this sonicare for years and not had that kind of problem.</li>
            <li>If you own a Philips Sonicare toothbrush then you&#x27;re locked into eventually purchasing replacement brush heads.</li>
            <li>&gt; The tooth brush is as effective as always</li>
            <li>I love my toothbrush, the replacement heads Were on sale for a good price on here.</li>
            <li>Nice to have an enclosure for the brush heads in a bathroom environment.  </li>
            <li>Nice plastic cover for each brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles immediately deformed and were no longer cleaning teeth effectively after 2 days, and after a week, not at all, leaving food on molars.</li>

            <li>Make sure you match up your model correctly though.</li>
            <li>I love the Philips Sonicare tooth brush ultrasonic system.  </li>
            <li>I am quite satisfied with the job those brushes do and would recommend it to a friend.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Amazon one more time on this item -- this time I got all three.</li>
            <li>Love my Phillips Skincare tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>Look nice but didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>They sure are toothbrushes</li>
            <li>The Phillips Sonicare toothbrush is a proven, outstanding way to avoid dental bills.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought the Philips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad Amazon carries them.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Pro Results\\&quot; print doesn&#x27;t look authentic, for example.</li>
            <li>The BB&amp;B product (which I am assuming to be the legit Sonicare product) feels much better on my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>#34;a healthy smile&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Make sure you buy the correct model of brush as they are not interchangeable.  </li>

            <li>Each brush lasts a month or more.</li>
            <li>Love these heads.</li>
            <li>.....but you just get so much more life out of the name brand ones.</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t use any of the heads for a month or more.</li>
            <li>Who knows how many months ago that was.</li>
            <li>What more can I say?</li>
            <li>I had a dental appointment, my hygienist noticed more stains from coffee.  </li>
            <li>This time I found  provider that had a better prize.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>and I love my tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>Better price than what I found in many stores.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>These cost much more any where else that you buy them, and you want to have spares on hand for then</li>
            <li>I like the system because I was able to pick up the sterilizer attachment here at Amazon, and, am comforted by the fact that the brush heads will be sterilized before each use.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get a better price or quality.  </li>

            <li>Fast delivery and great pricing.  </li>
            <li>To me, this makes sense as it needs to be able to vibrate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will like them</li>
            <li>even more after I use it for awhile.</li>

            <li>I love my Philips sonic toothbrush and these replacement heads.</li>

            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Purchased actual Philips replacements at a store and they work great!  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many packs of brush heads for my Sonicare -</li>
            <li>This brand gives you better checkups at the dentist.</li>
            <li>I should have trusted my better judgement when I saw the price on these.</li>
            <li>Glad they changed the style...</li>
            <li>Paid a premium price thinking I was getting an authentic Philips brush.  </li>
            <li>I am really pleased with the Sonicare brushing device</li>
            <li>If they were to lower the price on these devices I would be completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have use a sonic are toothbrush for about 25 years and love them...</li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s even better.  </li>
            <li>I love that it lets you know when you are done with each quadrant of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>These are probably my favorite Sonicare brush heads.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t seem any better.</li>
            <li>Of course, they were cheaper than the ones that fit!</li>
            <li>I love the Philips Sonicare toothbrushes...</li>
            <li>It has happened to me more than once</li>
            <li>these brushes are perfect and save toothpaste since the brush is smaller and the vibrating gets between the teeth and gum</li>
            <li>We have been using these for many years</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t buy them, or buy from a more legit source (the Philips website)</li>
            <li>Love Philips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much to keep this consumer happy.  </li>
            <li>Under $20 for each purchase. :)</li>
            <li>Love the Sonicare system.</li>
            <li>I love my sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li>Buy genuine philips!</li>
            <li>I have used this brand for many years.  </li>
            <li>We both love it and it had made a huge difference!</li>
            <li>Excellent quality and such a bargain at these prices.</li>
            <li>Glad i searched at Amazon to find these brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I can get these on line.</li>
            <li>Subscribe and Save lowers the price even more and makes sure that you are changing brush heads when they need to be.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why Amazon continues to sell these when so many of the reviews let it be know that they are counterfeit.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>These brushes and the entire Sonicare system of brushing my teeth were recommended by my dentist, and they are excellent.  </li>
            <li>I have been pleased with the toothbrush and often wonder how I got along without it for all those years.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll buy them from a more trusted source from now on.</li>
            <li>I found out these heads should be changed more often than what I was doing.  </li>
            <li>I have my Sonicare for more than two years now</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I find myself more inclined to do a much better job brushing my tooth.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>These work perfectly for our Sonicare Healthy White electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I have had a Sonicare for many years.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure this type head was what I needed when I ordered.  </li>
            <li>Please contact the manufacturer as they are better equipped at diagnosing any type of problem and making sure you purchased the correct heads for your toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Sincerely, Sue Bargain OTC\\&quot;</li>
            <li>purchased along with the charger on the assumption that the charger would allow me to invest in more brushes.  </li>
            <li>The remaining bristles do their job, and I love the toothbrush itself, but Philips needs to step up their quality control on the brush heads.</li>
            <li>These cannot be authentic toothbrush replacements.</li>
            <li>Great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found the deal at Costco to be better.</li>
            <li>The 3-pack lasts me most of a year (changing once every 3-4 months).</li>
            <li>looked ok but</li>
            <li>What more can you ask.</li>
            <li>So if you love your teeth and your Sonicare, this is the place to buy your replacement heads.</li>
            <li>Not all that pleased.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I love my sonicare tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>It has made my gums so much more healthy.  </li>
            <li>I have used sonicare system for as many years as i can remember, from the 80s or before...never a problem like this.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the quality, no problems.</li>
            <li>Love my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The brush head that came with the toothbrush is in better condition after three months use than these &amp;#34;replacements&amp;#34; are after a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>They work okay for a bit</li>
            <li>When I bought authentic heads from sonicare, they were quite different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AVOID</li>
            <li>I love sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Great replacement and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I like the compact size better for my size mouth.  </li>
            <li>although I&#x27;m sure my dentist would recommend changing them every 3 months.  </li>
            <li>Probably could do better shopping with a coupon in the stores.</li>
            <li>I travel to underdeveloped countries for work (as I am now) and would be a hassle to return this, much more hassle than its worth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to Philips for a great product, and amazon for bring it to there customers.</li>
            <li>The packaging seemed authentic and the markings on the heads seemed authentic as well.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with my replacement brushes that I want to order some more.  </li>
            <li>Better than the generation  </li>
            <li>I think ProResults feels much better than DiamoncClean.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>AND I CAN HONESTLY SAY MY TEETH HAVE NEVER FELT MORE CLEAN OR POLISHED.</li>
            <li>We all have our own brush heads now and clean teeth,</li>
            <li>The brushes came at a great price and high quality.</li>
            <li>I have not used the HX6013 heads, but they were delivered on time and in good condition at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised, good price, delivered on time</li>
            <li>So happy to have these new tootbrushes.</li>
            <li>have tried to use the brush head with it not fully attached so that it would be easy to remove; however, most attempts resulted in the brush head sliding off the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The brushes i get from Walmart stays for 3 months or more easily.</li>
            <li>I love brushing my teeth with this for over a year and it really cleans them and feels good in the process..</li>
            <li>I bought 3 more at Walmart and they work fine</li>
            <li>These work just fine, but make sure it is compatible with your Sonicare system.</li>
            <li>However, for that, we anticipated consistent exceptional quality.</li>
            <li>Shipment came on time, I like the bristle design which seems to be able to reach and clean teeth better.  </li>
            <li>but they are very good replacement brushed fort</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!!</li>
            <li>This is much more cheaply made than my known Philips brush heads.</li>
            <li>This is great buy and fast shipping, the price is great and beats out the Big box store.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;ProResults&amp;#34; print on the shaft of the tooth brush head appear faded and cheaply printed compared to my authentic toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>I received these toothbrush heads and thought since they were coming in philips sonicare packaging instead of the frustration free that they would be more legitimate...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Actually I&#x27;ve had more luck with the 6014 4-pack model they sell here on Amazon in frustration free packaging.</li>
            <li>Cleans teeth much better that the cheap battery types.</li>
            <li>Since that time and after more than 50 tight-fitting mate and de-mate cycles there has not been any noticeable loosening of the brush head to toothbrush fit.</li>
            <li>It may have been a faulty batch, or perhaps they&#x27;re just more cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure you know that it will fit your toothbrush before buying.</li>
            <li>Thanks 4 good product.</li>
            <li>They are a real help in keeping my teeth in good condition.</li>
            <li>The price of the product is compareable and the quality of this product is also good, But I would like to know, How much is the comlit set price ?</li>
            <li>Absolutely keeps my teeth at the optimum health.</li>
            <li>good price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This pack fits my Sonicare toothbrush very well and comes at a good price.</li>
            <li>I popped these in and was looking forward to a nice clean brushing experience, but I found them to be uncharacteristically and significantly softer-feeling than I was used to.</li>
            <li>Easy and quick to use, and really works great.</li>
            <li>The Brush Head HX6013 is a high quality product fitting a top sonic toothbrush, which is effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The original head looks and is in better shape than the replacement head</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t buy healthy original teeth on here or anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Excellent product but over priced...can find them cheaper other places</li>
            <li>I charged the toothbrush overnight as per the user&#x27;s manual which is also well written and easily understandable.  </li>
            <li>Love those clean teeth</li>
            <li>The Diamond Clean version is much better.</li>
            <li>Great low price for a name brand product; not an off-brand product as most others for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>The brush head can be replaced easily.</li>
            <li>The brush heads are easy to change and have a dye incorporated that indicates when it&#x27;s time to replace the brush.</li>
            <li>lightweight and easy to use..</li>
            <li>If you want to have the clean teeth and gums that are healthy than this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li>It is great to be able to find the brush heads for Sonicare and not to have to replace the entire assembly.  </li>
            <li>These brush heads wear out very quickly.</li>
            <li>It was easy to find and purchase.  </li>
            <li>The wear strip makes it easy to keep track of when to change the brush.</li>
            <li>I saved money The easy way..</li>
            <li>/&gt;After ordering (and receiving) these I saw that the Diamond clean were supposed to be better</li>
            <li>Sonicare is a great brush, and we like these larger ones--they cover more of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>now.&lt;br /&gt;It shipped very quick.</li>
            <li>It was easy to select this product and have it shipped to my home.  </li>

            <li>Received these brush heads quickly, makes brushing your teeth more invigorating, love the clean feel I get after brushing, and the compliments from my dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li>exactly the kind i needed bought my sonicare at the dental office</li>
            <li>as the original toothbrush, so I was sure would fit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are genuine and cost more but they are worth it!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;deal\\&quot; was certainly too good to be true...</li>
            <li>The price is a bit high, would be nice to see a better deal on them.</li>
            <li>The brushes work fine.  </li>
            <li>They now work fine.</li>

            <li>I replaced the head on my toothbrush and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>The bristles look fine</li>
            <li>and they have worked just fine.</li>

            <li>but they are fine to me.</li>
            <li>They are fine.</li>
            <li>These are a fine product.</li>
            <li>so for two of the six are working fine.</li>
            <li>Everything is fine with them.  </li>
            <li>I used one for 3 months and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>These work just fine.  </li>
            <li>The brush is fine but it spins off the &amp;#34;easy care&amp;#34; brush we have when being used.</li>
            <li>The Phillips Sonicare Proresult  brush heads are easy to fit onto the power supply.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fine.  </li>
            <li>Works fine, I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>

            <li>I really like the way these toothbrushes keep my teeth and gums healthy!  </li>
            <li>Amazon needs to clean up the counterfeit goods, it&#x27;s becoming a problem.</li>
            <li>very good, as expected.</li>
            <li>the original manufacturer&#x27;s brush heads, I easily give out a five-star rating.  </li>
            <li>and I think these replacements are just as strong as the ones that originally came with it</li>
            <li>I have seen some comments about the fit of these heads, but my original heads had a less than perfect fit, too.</li>
            <li>The fact they come with a rubber seal attached to the bottom is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I have been using my Sonicare for years and it makes a huge difference to replace the head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping Philips reads these reviews because for such a great electric toothbrush they went totally cheap on the heads.</li>
            <li>There is a huge difference in quality.</li>
            <li>I ordered this Easy Clean Rechargeable toothbrush on 5/23/2013</li>
            <li>I never used Sonicare before and purchased this Easy Clean version based on the customer reviews I had read here</li>
            <li>They fit and work well.</li>
            <li>They fit Sonicare HX6710 which I also bought from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>These are NOT Philips products, they are cheap counterfeit brushes that are rubbish.</li>
            <li>They fit my sonicare.</li>
            <li>Received cheap copies from seller RNTOD.</li>
            <li>and they confirmed that the legitimate Philips brush heads should not suffer from these issues.</li>
            <li>I have been using them for a few months now and they deliver what they are made for, the quality is excellent.</li>
            <li>They are now cheaply manufactured.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As advertised, god fit on end of toothbrush head, comfortable to use, would buy again.</li>
            <li>the brush heads are easy to change and clean often.</li>
            <li>They said its fit on all.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what was going to fit my son&#x27;s tooth brush</li>
            <li>A package of three gets me through the year comfortably.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any difference in quality or fit.  </li>
            <li>Purchase additional heads to have an available supply</li>
            <li>I am happy with the product and regularly change my brush heads every 3 months like clockwork.  </li>
            <li>The heads fit snugly on the attachment post</li>
            <li>The seller was very prompt and courteous with my request.</li>
            <li>It does not even fit well and cannot be used at all.</li>
            <li>These Brush Heads are cheap fakes.</li>
            <li>These are fakes... Sonic Care confirmed them as counterfeit...</li>
            <li>Tooth brush heads fit.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t know which brush head would fit my toothbrush</li>
            <li>Also, I wanted the easy clean model.  </li>
            <li>It really is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are cheap and after one use the toothbrush head looks like it has been used for a year.</li>
            <li>I have used the Sonicare toothbrush system for about 4 months now and really enjoy the way it cleans my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Do not buy, cheap product.  </li>
            <li>Brush heads fit well with our flex-care brush.</li>
            <li>I appreciate having a source that makes using my cordless toothbrush more economical.</li>
            <li>They are cheap knock-offs.</li>
            <li>Great product, however, they stated they were not going to be in one of those plastic packages so it would easier to open, and it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>and they are replacing the heads free of charge so my faith in the company is restored probably just got a defective package</li>
            <li>I wish the seven-packs were still available.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads wouldn&#x27;t fit my sonic unit, so I had to return them.</li>
            <li>It fits on to the head, but does not feel or function like a correct fit.</li>
            <li>even though the image is not a product photo, rest assured these brush heads will fit.</li>
            <li>they are genuine  FAKES.  </li>
            <li>it said it will fit, Philips Soniccare HealthyWhite.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>Product fit and worked per instructions.</li>
            <li>These replacement brush heads fit my machine like a glove.  </li>
            <li>They fit the toothbrush but bristles wear out after a week or so.  </li>
            <li>They are a great value and they each last about 4 months.</li>
            <li>The brushes &amp;#34;collapsed&amp;#34; after about 4-5 days of light use.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the heads which do fit correctly are showing signs of rust, which I never noticed with the heads I received with my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>it is easy to clean and replace .</li>
            <li>I tried the off-brand version that didn&#x27;t fit at all.  </li>
            <li>Cheap knock offs.</li>
            <li>Important.  </li>
            <li>This does not fit perfectly with the Diamond system.</li>
            <li>I accidentally bought this thinking it would fit my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t fit the Sonicare toothbrush that I have.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Then as well I noticed the brushs of the 1 head I removed, the brush bristles were already worn out just after 2 months of light use....  </li>
            <li>What can I say, the brushes fit and work well.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.....</li>
            <li>I question if these are genuine Philips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Thank goodness amazon does free returns</li>
            <li>The genuine item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;One thing to note, I use frustration free packaging, but this time I accidentally ordered blister pack.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>So happy that i have back ups</li>
            <li>These are cheap knock off brush heads.  </li>
            <li>I am happy that we made the switch from the traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li>WITHOUT the ultra violate light.</li>
            <li>I used this for the out of country travels - it is convenient to have everything in one secure location</li>
            <li>The genuine brush head changes color</li>
            <li>So far so good with that one.</li>
            <li>The set I got is definitely the real thing and perfect.</li>
            <li>they look good tho,  but don&#x27;t last more than a week</li>
            <li>My teeth feel super clean!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used these yet; still on the first brush head that came with my new Healthywhite, but the pricing was great.  </li>
            <li>love this toothbrush and these are required items for right functioning</li>
            <li>These heads fit my Flex care and will fit Diamond Clean, Flex Care</li>
            <li>the Diamond Clean brush heads that came with my Sonicare and do just about as good of a cleaning job as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>I paid quite a bit for the sonic toothbrush device itself and am happy with it but surely at the price they charge they could make the bristles of these brush heads out of a higher quality, longer lasting material.</li>
            <li>Made my teeth feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Kept my teeth so clean my dentist quit as soon as she saw how plaque and cavity free</li>
            <li>I honestly thought I was buying a decent product.  </li>
            <li>The price is competitive, ordering is easy, and delivery is quick.</li>
            <li>For long term use, this product makes the most sense for me money wise.</li>
            <li>Never buy things with not sale by Amazon directly!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Ordered these to go with my new Hx6731/34 toothbrush that I purchased at the same time, they&#x27;re as advertised and the best price I found.</li>
            <li>My original brush lasted 6 months with no problem.  </li>
            <li>These brush heads differ materially in quality and build from the original brush head that came with the brush and the replacement brush heads I purchased at BB&amp;B (lasted ~1.5 weeks).</li>
            <li>These are the original brushes that come from Philips when you purchase your toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The original brush was wearing out.</li>
            <li>I think they are counterfeit brushes, because it looks nothing like the original.</li>
            <li>--Original--</li>
            <li>Came as promised in original packaging.</li>
            <li>Brush Heads lasted 3 - 4 weeks rather than 2 - 3 months, compared to the brush heads purchased with original  toothbrush</li>
            <li>and one from Philips, you can see a lot of details indicating it was copied from the original product</li>
            <li>Having gone through many replacement toothbrush heads, this is a first.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I am not buying original brushes anymore.</li>
            <li>These do not seem to be original.  </li>
            <li>Stick with the original.</li>
            <li>The original head on the brush lasted over 3 months.  </li>
            <li>So, i have been using a manual toothbruse and also hunting for one powered one that may just come close to my original sonicare.</li>
            <li>The Philips are identitical to the original and perform well.  </li>
            <li>Just like the original, get the job well done.</li>
            <li>They match original.</li>
            <li>Not at all like the ones that came with the sonicare originally.  </li>
            <li>Each one wares out in 2 months (the original lasted over 6).  </li>
            <li>and I am pretty sure they will work well.</li>
            <li>After a week of brushing the bristles are splayed out and are not holding their form, as the original did.</li>
            <li>Sonicare original product.  </li>
            <li>work just like the original brush heads</li>
            <li>They clean my teeth well.</li>
            <li>These heads work just find and clean the teeth and gums well.</li>
            <li>before three months was even up, and our teeth did not feel clean by the end of the day (</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with removing the heads to clean the brush.</li>
            <li>It was nice to be able to purchase a three brush set&lt;br /&gt;rather than one at a time or five in the big box stores.</li>
            <li>I got the shipping free (Amazon Prime member), and they came quickly and well protected.  </li>
            <li>My teeth always feel so clean after each use.</li>
            <li>Dental hygene techs comment on my clean teeth.</li>
            <li>My teeth are clean and I didn&#x27;t pay a boatload for them.</li>
            <li>my teeth do not feel clean if I</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt as clean since we started using these.  </li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel really clean.</li>
            <li>These do not compare to the diamond clean heads at all.</li>
            <li>Ahh, clean teeth.</li>
            <li>Perfect cleaning, but soft enough not to damage the mouth tissues.</li>
            <li>With the Sonicare and flossing, I get complements on my clean teeth when I visit the dentist.</li>
            <li>It is a bummer as my teeth dont get as clean as they used to.</li>
            <li>With regualr size my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean as they do with compact brush.</li>
            <li>Teeth didn&#x27;t feel nearly as clean.</li>
            <li>He asked me what I used to clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Some of the bristles are falling out and the brush heads are pretty new, so I don&#x27;t think they are as good a quality as the ones originally with the tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I love being able to just order stuff like this on Amazon and not have to worry about going down to the store just to buy this, it&#x27;s so handy get it now</li>
            <li>Original head will last a good 3/4 - to 1 year before noticing signs of wear and time to exchange.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s more hassle to return just one brush out of three we have discarded it; but it certainly shades our opinion of this Philips product.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly order more when I need too.</li>
            <li>; ordered the right brushes!</li>
            <li>These rotate right off the toothbrush as soon as the toothbrush is turned on!</li>
            <li>I love it that I can easily order and receive new brush heads for my sonicare ....</li>
            <li>Not too hard on my teeth, yet does a wonderful job</li>
            <li>I have bought these several times and they hold up fairly well and work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This tooth brush is so cool.</li>
            <li>Not a dentist, so have no way of judging how good a job it is actually doing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: after requesting a refund through Amazon, the China-based seller promptly responded and offered a full refund.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are much whiter and the automatic toothbrush does a much better job than manually.</li>
            <li>and I now brush a full 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After spending two years using generics, and being somewhat pleased with them, I decided to order the real deal.</li>
            <li>but these are full retail prices.</li>
            <li>As much as I love the toothbrush, I really appreciate the replacement heads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is good price with coupon,but there is only 2 pack ,not 3.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Are these really Philips&#x27; authentic products?  </li>
            <li>In fact, I switched the whole family over to these electric brushes and they all love them.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy the knock-offs, buy the real thing as the cleaning function is much better.</li>
            <li>I do know is that when I&#x27;m ready to buy more brush heads, I&#x27;m going to seek out Braun Wholesale.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;ProResults&amp;#34; labeled on the brush heads are more raised and appear as a &amp;#34;bold&amp;#34; font in comparison to the real Phillips heads.  </li>
            <li>Same as described, good product..</li>
            <li>Apart for some initial miscommunications, Product arrived in timely and good</li>
            <li>Only time will tell if the quality is as good as the origional?  </li>
            <li>Replacement the heads regularly and rinse it good in hottest faucet water after each use.  </li>
            <li>Tried and true perfiormance.</li>
            <li>ordered these, name brand, and my teeth are super clean again!&lt;br</li>
            <li>but before I bought from there the replacements as well as the full set</li>
            <li>Thanks guys :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to buy from Costco b/c they only sell the newer styled brushes and this is a good deal.</li>
            <li>These brushes for and by Sonicare are good quality and last for months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several Sonicare&#x27;s and loved every one.</li>
            <li>Oh it&#x27;s cool</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t fit exactly right</li>
            <li>Again, I give credit to the China-based company for responding quickly to my concerns and allowing me a full refund no questions asked.</li>
            <li>I am glad I made the switch because these actual gave me a better clean in my opinion than the compact.</li>
            <li>But no that I am used to it, I feel that my teeth are getting more clean using this rather than just a normal tooth brush.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll continue buying them because they are great and cheaper than other stores sells them.</li>
            <li>Good quality sonicare brushes, my old brush was worn and the new one made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel fresh and clean after brushing.</li>
            <li>Having them delivered to my home was convenient and quick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal fan of Sonicare products for years, ever since my dentist recommended that I purchase and use one.</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean and are holding up very well.</li>
            <li>I ordered from Amazon, and received the replacement brushes quickly.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if a larger economy pack were available to save everyone costs.</li>
            <li>butr do a tremendous job.</li>
            <li>They both love it as they share the main electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>they fit my toothbrush and are so much better than my old ones.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky to get 6-8 weeks from a brush head.</li>
            <li>These brush heads fall apart so quickly, I would imagine my teeth to be made of steel.</li>
            <li>arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Product arrive quickly.</li>
            <li>They quickly vibrated off my easyclean sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never even seen this with the cheapest 4 for $1 toothbrushes at the super market.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much easier to clean!</li>
            <li>They fit fine on my Sonicare Healthy White 710 model toothbrush.</li>
            <li>At first I thought these were genuine replacement heads and quickly learned that&#x27;s not the case.</li>
            <li>The right item, Quick and the right price!  </li>
            <li>+, Healthy White and Easy Clean Sonicare Toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I did a bunch of research to see exactly which replacement heads fit which brush handle.  </li>
            <li>The packaging and printing all look genuine, but the first one lasted one month before it refused to stay on.  </li>
            <li>Sweetness Elements should retract this product as it is very evident by the feedback on Amazon and through Phillips that they are counterfeit.  </li>
            <li>They appear to be genuine (not fake).</li>
            <li>Make sure you know which kind of sonicare toothbrush you have because they are not interchangeable with other designs they make.</li>
            <li>Called Phillips and confirmed it was the right holder and the right brush, but, they would not snap into the holder.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare tooth brush is great for keeping the stains down as well.</li>
            <li>Product came exactly as advertised in original packaging, with quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Perfect fit for my Sonicare and the only place I can find them, other than my dentists office, which I don&#x27;t get to often.</li>
            <li>The new head, after about a week of use, had many bristles bent out of their groups.</li>
            <li>I have been happy with the frustration free in the past.</li>
            <li>this price was unbelievable, after shopping around I decided that this was as good as it get, glad I purchased</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit as well as the original which originally concerned me, but it fits well enough and works fine.  </li>
            <li>Really like the Sonicare toothbrush!!</li>
            <li>These Phillips Sonicare HX6013 brushheads are exactly like the original ones that came with my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not feel like the first ones we ordered on here !</li>
            <li>exactly like the ones that came with the sonicare originally.</li>
            <li>I will actually be ordering more of these for my friend, who also has a sonicare!  </li>
            <li>at a total price of $50 or more!  </li>
            <li>Wish I had read the reviews first!  </li>
            <li>Excellent sonic toothbrush with great, long lasting, firm brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Still, they work just fine and provide a very vigorous brushing experience as promised.</li>
            <li>Very high quality, comfortable brush heads.</li>
            <li>They fit my toothbrush, and my teeth will probably be none the wiser, but I am not 100% convinced that these are real Philips brand.  </li>
            <li>These are a cheap knock off of the real thing.</li>
            <li>Probably still worth it</li>
            <li>Just needed some more replacement heads for my sonicare, what more can I say, not much to report on it.</li>
            <li>Nothing can beat the feeling of fresh cleaning heads.</li>
            <li>These fit my Healthy White HX6710 Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Any toothbrush is only as effective as the users allows it to be.  </li>
            <li>they were too soft and they didn&#x27;t hold their shape for more than a week</li>
            <li>These premium brush heads are worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Since my teeth are not the best, every dentist I have had has told me my issues would be worse.</li>
            <li>but worth it.</li>
            <li>as expected , good product , recommended.</li>
            <li>Phillips Sonicare makes good products, you just have to be careful you match the accessory with th emodel you are using.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my philips sonicare toothbrush and now I feel complete with these toothbrush replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>Its worth it to invest in your teeth.</li>
            <li>Turns out I have a different kind of toothbrush.</li>
            <li>so you can share one Sonicare brush and have multiple users each with his/her own brush head.</li>
            <li>Within a week I was noticing the bristles spreading out, and this is with me only using the electric brush&#x27;s own weight to brush, as I know</li>
            <li>Funny because we bought the exact replacement head they said was to fit my brush</li>
            <li>I also liked getting extra brushes</li>
            <li>So far, I love the press on head.  </li>
            <li>, but the Sonicare is worth it.</li>
            <li>Not a whole lot to say other than they fit well and are a perfect replacement for our Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>you think that later you will not be able to send to the original address, DO NOT OFFER AT ALL.</li>
            <li>A year ago I went to have my teeth clean and the dentist was surprised on how super clean my teeth already where.  </li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and love how clean and white my teeth are.  </li>
            <li>This is my second one, your teeth feel really clean after you brush, I get better check ups&lt;</li>
            <li>The replacement brush felt much softer than the original brush.  </li>
            <li>my other brush replacements were good quality and of medium firmness</li>
            <li>All three of the bristles are much softer than the original heads that I just replaced.&lt;br /&gt;C)</li>
            <li>Good deal compared to other stores</li>
            <li>Something didn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li>They fall right off the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Or can you help me to replace to the right style?</li>
            <li>they vibrate right off the barrel...  </li>
            <li>I recommend you go to sonicare&#x27;s website and chat with a representative so that they can point you to the right direction.</li>
            <li>the price was right.</li>
            <li>Get the right ones and they&#x27;ll plug right in with no hassles.</li>
            <li>Just the right product.</li>
            <li>I am so dissappointed as they have shortened the length of the bristles therefore making it vibrate against my teeth if not held just right.  </li>
            <li>The product was received timely and is exactly right.  </li>
            <li>They vibrate right off?</li>
            <li>but I noticed that they are the right size to cover your teeth when using it with the Sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I bought my Sonicare toothbrush from my dentist and couldn&#x27;t find replacement brush heads that said they fit that particular model even on the Philips website.</li>
            <li>tooth brushes give you a dentist office type clean each time you brush, my whole family loves ours.</li>
            <li>Really gets teeth clean.</li>
            <li>They seem to last longer than my old ones, but that is a mystery best left unsolved.</li>
            <li>It was great, better than the last few I ordered.</li>
            <li>Price is average but quality is good.</li>
            <li>These little guys are great, last a long time, and this is a great price.</li>
            <li>Work just as expected since they replace the original brush head that accompanied the Sonicare Easy Clean.</li>
            <li>SInce I was comparing prices, I made the mistake of thinking it was included since I did not see any offered withOUT the UV light, however, live and learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pure junk!</li>
            <li>previous brush heads lasted a good three or four months before I replaced them.  </li>
            <li>I quickly ordered these, assuming they were the real deal.  </li>
            <li>For the couple bucks more that these cost, I believe it is worth it and stay away from the generic replacement heads.  </li>
            <li>These are excellent, a stiffer bristle is better, these do last for 3-4 months before the blue is half way.</li>
            <li>Not a huge deal, but it would be nice if the colors were brighter and easier to distinguish, like primary colors.</li>
            <li>This was a great purchase, bc you must switch the toothbrush heads out when the blue strip turns white...</li>
            <li>Finally frustration free packaging provides scissor free access to the brush</li>
            <li>It is much softer and &#x27;frayed&#x27; quickly.  </li>
            <li>These bristles would collapse and let the plastic hit my teeth far too easily.</li>
            <li>They are, however, very easy to fit compared to the previous heads I had.</li>
            <li>The second head seems to be doing better but we&#x27;ll see; still doesn&#x27;t seem quite right.</li>
            <li>Sonicare has been used in my family for years and it works very, very well</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I ordered these new brush heads with the understanding that they are original Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li>These look just like the original brushes that came with the Sonicare when it was new.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are too soft to brush adequately, and they wear out quickly.</li>
            <li>Best way to clean teeth and getting into hard to reach places without too much effort compared to a regular brush.  </li>
            <li>So happy to buy it now i can use old brush to clean my shoes :/</li>
            <li>The brush heads are available in small and large sizes, both of which are useful in their own way.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are much softer and do no appear strong enough to hold up to any significant scrubbing.</li>
            <li>The new heads make my teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>A real piece of garbage!</li>
            <li>Only issue is that they cost more than I believe they should.</li>
            <li>Really does a great job cleaning my teeth and making them feel slick and look shiny.</li>
            <li>Rusted first week used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the actual brushes are fakes.</li>
            <li>However, the brush heads I received in my latest purchase were definitely different.  </li>
            <li>For the ones I received in my most recent Amazon order, however, I&#x27;d like to give zero stars.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>Love my sonicare toothbrush and you will obviously need these to go with them.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>First had to get used to it, as well as my husband.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;(Sonicare does not provide a warranty on their brush heads - they only provide a warranty on the handles)&lt;br /&gt;Amazon offered a refund, which I gladly accepted.</li>
            <li>I have a Healthy White Sonicare Toothbrush and these heads are the replacements.  </li>
            <li>Delivered on time and exactly as described ...</li>
            <li>My dental reports are better than when I used a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Will most definitely order this product from this seller again once it&#x27;s time to replace.</li>
            <li>I bought these heads to go with my Phillips Soicare Healthy White toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>They start to fade almost after the first use.</li>
            <li>More time in the dental chair, head fade strips don&#x27;t even last 4 weeks per head, and noticeable change in quality before 1 month is up for brushing.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was because of the pressure I was putting when brushing my teeth</li>
            <li>I ordered two packs for the same shipping cost for even greater savings.  </li>
            <li>These frayed after the first use.</li>
            <li>Exactly as specified and I will buy them again.</li>
            <li>This is not the first time I buy this through AMAZON.</li>
            <li>(we figure it&#x27;s a way to sell more), and we usually can and do get more life out of our heads than three months.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t point to anything specific, just more of a &amp;#34;feeling.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I received this product and it is exactly what I needed for my sonic are toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Previous purchases were fine, but this time many bristles fell out soon after I started using one.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I purchased the brush heads online.  </li>
            <li>I hope AMAZON becomes aware that is happening.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve been burned by a purchase on Amazon -- why did it have to be over replacement toothbrush heads?</li>
            <li>This sure beats the hassle I had with a different toothbrush.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t know exactly which brush head fits your sonicare</li>
            <li>I should have returned them when I first realized there was a problem.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever returned anything from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Brush head came a part the first time it was put onto my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY UNUSABLE!</li>
            <li>I have tried the compact heads, but find the Standard Head works better for me.</li>
            <li>I will pay the slightly higher cost from any U.S. based company.</li>
            <li>It felt as if I had been using this brush head for six months rather than for the first time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad to finally get replacements.</li>
            <li>I kept the first one for like a year.</li>
            <li>Within the first week of use, the bristles were just mangled and unuasable.  </li>
            <li>but I feel that they are pretty pricey for that they are.  </li>
            <li>Exact brush heads for my toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The 3 pack is a much better deal than the local pharmacy..</li>
            <li>Exact replacement head.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush leave my teeth smooth just like when I get them professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li>These are NOT the real thing!</li>
            <li>They are exactly what was on the toothbrush handle.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>These are the exact heads that are sold in stores but at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>The first time we used the heads one of them fell apart into pieces.  </li>
            <li>I love it and have now got my kids, spouce and my mother on the same one!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Very satisified !</li>
            <li>As many other have noted, they begin to show significant signs of wear within a week or so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll know better next time.  </li>
            <li>the color all wore off the first head after about 2 weeks rather than the 3 months</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I received a faulty product.</li>
            <li>Better than regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>the latest order is different.</li>
            <li>There are too many different brushes.</li>
            <li>and that is exactly what I received.</li>
            <li>At first it got lost in the mail, but once I contacted them they immediately replaced it.</li>
            <li>This could be a result of the fact that my toothbrush is getting older, but these heads seem to be wearing out really quickly.</li>
            <li>the first 2-3 brushings the brissels would fall out but that eventually stopped.  </li>
            <li>Heads are exactly like the ones it came with.  </li>
            <li>Better than the generic stuff at stores.  </li>
            <li>The first brush head lasted maybe a month.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s noteworthy that the price for these heads was the lowest I could find at the time; even at Sams Club or CostCo, the per-head cost was higher.</li>
            <li>If these aren&#x27;t fakes, then Philips quality control has really gone downhill!</li>
            <li>I think the only deal I found that was better was when Costco had a coupon on these replacement</li>
            <li>exactly as I get at the store but not going to the store.</li>
            <li>so they actually cost much more.</li>
            <li>my child and my wife screwed up their brushes on the first try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Based on my dentist&#x27;s recommendation I purchased my first Philips electric toothbrush about 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Most likely counterfeit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using pro-results brushes since the first sonicare was released.  </li>
            <li>So - these are exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>These are exactly the product that I have always used with my Philips Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I purchased the non generic item on purpose, knowing that I would spend more, but get a higher quality purchase.  </li>
            <li>These brush heads are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still I would recommend it, especially with free shipping, which got to me in 2 days anyway!</li>
            <li>On further inspection I see that the print on the brush head stem is raised and doesn&#x27;t look or feel like an authentic brush head.</li>
            <li>Totally a waste, but good thing</li>
            <li>but I was able to smooth it down.</li>
            <li>I am now a loyal customer of Sonicare for life and highly recommend buying this item.  </li>
            <li>It is much easier to keep clean than the older model.  </li>
            <li>BY BUYING SOFT HEADS INSTEAD OF STD!!!!</li>
            <li>Sure, these are more expensive than the basic brush heads, but they are far more effective.</li>
            <li>few dollars more ever few months is much cheaper and more comfortable than having a cavity filled!</li>
            <li>They work very well and they snap right on to the brush handle.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I really like him--he even made a crown right in the office with a light-based computer-design device that molded the crown on site.</li>
            <li>I have been buying this product from Amazon for the past four years, and until my most recent purchase, I have loved it.  </li>
            <li>Was having a hard time finding these in stock at my local stores so this works out great!</li>
            <li>So just a watch out, ask for a replacement if these do not feel or last like the original that came with your brush!</li>
            <li>I noticed that my teeth were not feeling as clean after using one of these heads and that my brush bristles looked prematurely old and splayed out.</li>
            <li>But this is the only good brush for proper plaque removal.</li>
            <li>I simply can’t tell you how much I love real Sonicare brush heads.  </li>
            <li>But the last crown I had cost in the neighborhood of $2K, and so I have a very different view of cost versus value now that I&#x27;m over 50 and, in essence, have a choice between maintaining  good periodontal and dental health and keeping my \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; in a cup at the bedside.</li>
            <li>These are good quality and last 3 to 6 months of brushing twice daily.</li>
            <li>Sonicare brush heads and related products help to reduce the amount of tartar that can accumulate on my teeth, and my gums are also healthy because the brushes gently stimulate the gums, cleanse beneath the gum line, resulting in no bleeding nor gum inflammations/infections.  </li>
            <li>I really like my Sonicare tooth brush a lot and change the brushes very frequently to keep it as effective as possible.</li>
            <li>Thanks  very much</li>
            <li>The bristles always make my teeth feel extra clean!</li>
            <li>I mean, they seem to work okay, but the quality could be better, IMO.</li>
            <li>I blew through the first head really quickly because they are so soft.</li>
            <li>and they wear out pretty fast</li>
            <li>It is smaller than the last model I used and is much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Also the bristles on these were bent up after a few uses, as compared to the original brush head that still remains more straighten after months of use.</li>
            <li>You all know how good it feels to put in a new head and immediately notice the results from a slightly stiffer brush.  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s interesting to see the inner workings of the toothbrush head, they now don&#x27;t fit back on very well</li>
            <li>Currently pregnant and having some issues with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>I must say that comparing to my brushes I had before, they are super soft.</li>
            <li>I have braces and these still stay strong and don&#x27;t fray apart like standard brushes.</li>
            <li>I tried the generic ones and I came back to the original because it works just that much better and leaves my teeth feeling much cleaner.  </li>
            <li>These appear to almost certainly be counterfeit.</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t be certain, I believe that the replacement heads I received may be a knockoff.</li>
            <li>figured they might have to be put on facing a certain direction.</li>
            <li>and this is the first time they have been so soft and not able to clean teeth effectively.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The very first time I used them to brush my teeth, the bristles completely disintegrated...</li>
            <li>I just purchased a new Sonicare toothbrush and wanted to be sure I had extra brushes.</li>
            <li>They do a great job, we all agree our mouths have never felt cleaner and we are looking forward to less dire predictions when i return for my next cleaning.</li>
            <li>The new head snaps right on.</li>
            <li>It makes it quick and easy to get my teeth very clean without irritating my gums.</li>
            <li>this is a bargain by and the fact that they fit a long line of sonicaire models makes it even better, will reorder in the future fast shipping</li>
            <li>The brushes are fine and are the same as the ones that came with my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>They are virtually the same exact brush heads that came with the original toothbrush</li>
            <li>I am using generic ones now, and they work just fine at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Buy one of these fine Sonicare brushes and extra heads.  </li>
            <li>Massage, sensitive and clean (or normal) do</li>
            <li>Brushes seem to be pretty high quality.</li>
            <li>They are a little pricy for electric toothbrush heads, but I think healthy teeth and gums are worth it.</li>
            <li>Arrived exactly as explained - starting using them right away!</li>
            <li>great price, especially when it needs to be replaced every few weeks as recommended by the dentist and ADA</li>
            <li>Buy the smaller heads on Amazon as they are definitely a genuine Philips product.</li>
            <li>plus I wanted a toothbrush to be basically white in color to fit in with my bathroom decor.  </li>
            <li>Indeed, we were ready to replace the device until these brushes came.</li>
            <li>I am convinced that these are the real thing.</li>
            <li>these aren&#x27;t the real deal.</li>
            <li>I purchased real ones from Target and you can see a difference in the bottom.</li>
            <li>I really like the way that these brush heads are made, but I feel that they are a bit over-priced..</li>
            <li>these were a real disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li>/&gt;Stick to the real thing.</li>
            <li>Counterfeit - not the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I have no problem with trying out generics, but this comes in Philips packaging and presents itself as the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>You be the judge, but I will say that they were very prompt in responding to my request for a refund and credited it that day.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very happy.will continue to use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>These are the brand name ones and they work very well.  </li>
            <li>However, they are much tighter on the brush than the originals.</li>
            <li>went in for a cleaning and was astonished how much time I had to spend in the chair having plaque removed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go look for the real thing, because this doesn&#x27;t seem like it.</li>
            <li>HAS THREE SETTING, BUT CAN&#x27;T TEL MUCH DIFFERENCE IN THE 3..</li>
            <li>These brush heads seem to be identical to the ones in the stores but at a much lower price.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li>but these are from the manufacturer of the toothbrush and work very well.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than retail stores.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to attach brush head.</li>
            <li>We really like the Sonicare Toothbrush system.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend really likes these brush heads.  </li>
            <li>They are reasonably fraying, just like the originals did after this amount of time.  </li>
            <li>There is THAT much of a difference in the way it will change your dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>For about $8.50 per brush, you really can&#x27;t beat it.  </li>
            <li>This cannot be the real thing by Sonicare.</li>
            <li>The print looks cheap and the plastic feels different.</li>
            <li>The tooth brushes work very well.</li>
            <li>but figured if I got the ones that were fulfilled by Amazon and Prime eligible they would be the real deal.</li>
            <li>The sonicare wording is blurry, you can tell they are not the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Given we paid for the real branded heads, and understanding the razor and the blade model, we accepted that the manufacturer would make a killer margin on three replacement heads for $25.</li>
            <li>Of the three heads, one worked perfectly, one was totally unusable (would not fit into brush) and the last one, which I am using now, pops out of my toothbrush every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>Kudos to Amazon for a simple, hassle free process</li>
            <li>These bristles are shaped to my teeth, and really feel like they are doing the job.  </li>
            <li>Cannot tell you how much it has helped to improve my gum health.  </li>
            <li>These are the real heads you would purchase from retail locations, they came in retail packaging.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the real deal.</li>
            <li>Appreciated gift to my son.</li>
            <li>The bristles wear out too fast.</li>
            <li>All 3 heads have the durability of the cheapest product ever - bristles fall out in your mouth or wear out incredibly fast.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>works very well.  </li>
            <li>so I expected authentic</li>
            <li>fast delivery</li>
            <li>I end up pulling the whole brush head off the handle.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>i really do like using sonicare and would like to continue buying this product on amazon.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say these were not actually real Philips Sonicare brushes, but they sure seemed like knockoffs.</li>
            <li>, rust forms on the bottom metal ring, and the three brushes were cut very inconsistently.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Been using for over 10 years and my teeth feel much cleaner than when I brush by hand.  </li>
            <li>You really need to change every 3 months.</li>
            <li>I wonder if these were real sonicare heads?</li>
            <li>These are the real things.</li>
            <li>Yes, it fits the Sonicare but doesn&#x27;t compare to the real Sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>The cheap generics simply not work.</li>
            <li>you never visit for your whole life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but after this fortunate, accidental discovery, I will only buy from one vendor.&lt;br /&gt;Braun</li>
            <li>After buying a &amp;#34;generic brand&amp;#34; from Walmart that didn&#x27;t fit and kept coming off when I brushed, I bought these</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The Bristles are so much softer than the ones that came with our toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering these againg very soon.</li>
            <li>Love it, received sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>Have worked very well</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes with the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I have stronger finger grip compared to most (can bend a beer bottle cap closed by pinching it between my index finger and thumb)</li>
            <li>Following a recommendation from my dentist, over five years ago, I have used Sonicare as the primary means of cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The replacement heads from Amazon are reasonably priced and arrive in 5 to 7 days.</li>
            <li>this is what I would expect from the cheap generic ones but not from the official brand.</li>
            <li>I found it is much easier to shop on line for this product.</li>
            <li>Really recommendable, I have been suing them for about two years without any issue.</li>
            <li>They claimed to send longer ones but they really don make a difference.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also slightly differently shaped than the OEM heads as my OEM brush cover wouldn&#x27;t fit these heads</li>
            <li>Then I opened them, and it didnt fit properly.</li>
            <li>For some reason, the toothbrush heads I bought on Amazon seemed to wear out much, much quicker than the ones I bought at the store.</li>
            <li>I bought for much cheaper price</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>The quality of this product is very substandard.  </li>
            <li>These brush heads are the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>REAL Philips Sonicare head brushes.</li>
            <li>Very convenient and fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Price reasonable.</li>
            <li>It was offered in frustration free packaging, but I choose the standard packaging</li>
            <li>I had a travel toothbrush for a couple of months this year and it really made me miss my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>These are the real &#x27;McCoy&#x27; product, so if you like the originals</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t know how much I&#x27;m compromising in cleaning compared to the orig.</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the sonicare tootbrush.  </li>
            <li>Better quality than generic brands by far.  </li>
            <li>Nice set of brush heads that are not too firm.  </li>
            <li>The bristles were the softest kind there is which ended up only lasting me about two weeks each head.</li>
            <li>but since I need to write at least 20 words to keep Amazon from asking me to review again, let me just say that they are a good replacement for a SonicCare Pro.  </li>
            <li>It was Perfect fit for base.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend these brush heads, they are just the right size for normal size teeth.</li>
            <li>My wife independently came to the same conclusion that I did: these brush heads must now be manufactured by someone who has created a cheap knock-off that functions nothing like the original product did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend to pay more and get real brush heads from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond or some other store.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly what it should be - new, still in the original packaging, and it was actually the correct item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overpriced little brushes, which are very easy to put on the toothbrush</li>
            <li>The replacement brushes work the same as the original brush.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but they look and feel the same as the one that came with my original brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will buy original only from now.</li>
            <li>My old Philips Sonicare Brush Head is much better than this, but it is not easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Factoring in the time to wear out two other brush heads, that&#x27;s better than 3 months/</li>
            <li>This brush is better than some other Skincare choices.</li>
            <li>The branding on the brush is blurry compared to other brushes I ordered and (3) the inside metal of these immediately stared to rust after 48 hours a sure sign that these are fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can say about toothbrush heads, other than make sure you change them every 3 months as directed.</li>
            <li>We bought the original machine at another store but then they never had these heads back in stock.</li>
            <li>These so not appear to be the same bush/bristle that came with my original EasyClean brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft enough to be gentle to gums but strong enough to clean teeth of food particles and prevent plaque.</li>
            <li>Yes the price sucks but its better than having the dentist dig around in you mouth because your teeth are full of build-up.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of picking the regular instead of the soft (which is what the toothbrush comes with) for my sensitive teeth, but in using these I find it&#x27;s still more comfortable over the manual brush, and they last 3 months.</li>
            <li>I use both my regular toothbrush (just cause I like it) but for keeping your teeth really clean, you need electric.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the compact, standard and Diamond Clean.</li>
            <li>I will be searching for something closer to the diamond clean heads next time.</li>
            <li>Next time I will try the diamond clean</li>
            <li>My teeth did not feel as clean that entire week.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to show the firmness of this product since these are definitely on the soft, soft, soft side of the scale.</li>
            <li>I thought I was going to have to purchase a whole new brush system, but thanks to AMAZON I found my replacement brushes cheaper than in the stores.  </li>
            <li>but i just put the last one on and it falls right off!</li>
            <li>better scrubbing between teeth, a problem the previous brushes had that they could not go between teeth very well.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll certainly do an update in a month if these don&#x27;t live up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Each of these heads run for at least 3 months so its still worth the money spent if you are expecting some great cleaning through your sonic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Upon opening these brushes I noticed an immediate difference than the original, normal brush; they seemed softer than the one I had been using on my sonicare for several months.  </li>
            <li>They said that these products are ordered directly from \\&quot;the manufacturer\\&quot; and that I was the first person to claim they were a \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>While I get awesome check ups since I started using the sonic brush, I am bothered that I have been sucked in to a product that is very expensive.  </li>
            <li>Not worth the money for sure.</li>
            <li>The blue nyon does not wear in color as the true product does and the nyon comes apart in your mouth as you brush your teeth causing you to swallow or choke.</li>
            <li>I had a 2 month old brush purchased from CVS as a generic and it was more favorable in use than the one week old</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a smaller Brush head than the original which had more bristles, white with the same the two greens</li>
            <li>Pretty soft but does the trick.</li>
            <li>The first two are so soft that after about 5 brushings the bristles are all bent out of shape.</li>
            <li>I was worried at first that these wouldnt last long (some sort of scheme to get you to buy more often)</li>
            <li>Overall not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>None of my original heads nor my first round of replacements wore anywhere near as quickly.</li>
            <li>Would recommend spending a little more to get the real thing from Phillips.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done much better, cheaper, and takes up less counter space.</li>
            <li>So when he pointed out this toothbrush was better than my previous model, I took his advice.</li>
            <li>These brushes are better than my previous set.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>My latest shipment of brush heads seem to have started wearing out faster than previously.</li>
            <li>I went back to a regular toothbrush until I find a better system.</li>
            <li>In the five years since I first bought mine, I have visited the dentist exactly two times a year, for periodic cleaning only.  </li>
            <li>I had another sonic toothbrush with different heads which wore out quite quickly.  </li>
            <li>I guess they must be factory seconds or clever knock-offs.</li>
            <li>The older heads lasted for years.</li>
            <li>A &amp;#34;must have &amp;#34; if you have the Sonicare toothbrush,change brush heads on a regular basis &amp; they last longer &amp; do a better job.</li>
            <li>They fit on the brush head the same as the old ones did.  </li>
            <li>Only think I don&#x27;t like is the indicator changes color too quickly,  I just ignore it.</li>
            <li>Through daily experimentation I was able to find a &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34;, e.g. not-to-loose and not-too-tight fit, but it required careful manipulation while brushing that became too much of a nuisance even for a challenge-seeking, geeky engineer such as myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Upon inspecting the printing used by the authentic product and this one, the type is noticeably different and faded compared to a used actual unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Brushes are very soft and with 2 week of use were ready for replacement.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>High priced for three pieces of Plastic</li>
            <li>The price is still awfully high for a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Philps Sonicare since high school, so I know when &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; brush heads don&#x27;t feel the way they should.</li>
            <li>they have taken a page from the high end razor marketing book.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these and this brushing system to anyone and everyone.  </li>
            <li>Removing the brush, I notice a high amount of rust in the residual water in the brush (from rinsing it off).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>They work fine as expected.</li>
            <li>The brand new brushes are constantly losing their bristles, (from the very first use).  </li>
            <li>I did notice that the brush heads might have started fraying slightly before the original brush heads did but not by any reasonable difference in time to deter me from buying these again!  </li>
            <li>The surface shape makes it easy to clean all surfaces of your teeth, especially the inside surfaces, which I have trouble with.  </li>
            <li>The action is ultrasonic and really cleans.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning and can&#x27;t believe how much whiter my teeth look after just a one time use as compared to all the years I had been using a different brand.</li>
            <li>The brushes are exactly what you find on the pharmacy shelves.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re still over-priced, but I&#x27;m at least satisfied that they go my order right.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>The bristles refuse to remain useful after only two brushings.</li>
            <li>Some may want a more firm version, but beware of any gum damage by the firmer version.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>These appear to be the standard Sonicare brush heads, but they have already begun to splinter and spread after 2 weeks worth of use.  </li>
            <li>I say this because the Sonicare brush head should be replaced every three months based on normal use.</li>
            <li>I have the brush and love it since it is not too harsh</li>
            <li>I love the quality of the Philips heads but these seem to not fit as well on my version of the Sonicare even though they are claimed to be 100% compatible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m having to see the dentist for a cleaning sooner than I normally do.</li>
            <li>These new brush heads seem to have a little more sonic power than the originals.  </li>
            <li>Perfect, a little slow on delivery, but I knew that when I ordered!</li>
            <li>The new heads are much cheaper than the old Essence style screw on brush heads.</li>
            <li>is much more firm when it&#x27;s new as well as in used condition.</li>
            <li>The brush looked many months old after less than a week.  </li>
            <li>time we will purchase these from a local retailer and strongly advise others to do the same.</li>
            <li>These are the right heads for my toothbrush, but they simply do not stay on the brush.  </li>
            <li>I gave up trying to buy these at the local pharmacy; they&#x27;re locked into a case (theft-prone) and they don&#x27;t always have the right brush for my model.</li>
            <li>The third one wouldn&#x27;t stay on right out of the package.  </li>
            <li>the EXACT SAME item that comes with a brand new brush in a box !</li>
            <li>I would say that I wished the bush head itself was a bit larger, but overall, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for a long time and I loved that I got them a little bit cheaper!</li>
            <li>The two other brushes fit</li>
            <li>To add to the other reviews I&#x27;ve received cheap counterfeit versions.</li>
            <li>I normally get this exact product at CVS/Wegmans, and they last about 6 weeks of normal use.  </li>
            <li>I do not care for Sonicare&#x27;s new brush heads</li>
            <li>New Brush heads are  </li>
            <li>I bought these replacement heads to go with the new electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>When I look over at my new sonicare, it has \\&quot;Sonicare\\&quot; on the brush head.</li>
            <li>I got a notice on Amazon that hey, new version.</li>
            <li>I already had one just needed new heads.</li>
            <li>The brush that came with my new toothbrush shed it&#x27;s bristles.  </li>
            <li>The new brush heads</li>
            <li>We have thrown out those pkgs and have purchaced one new pkg.</li>
            <li>I had a sonicare brush in storage for about a year because I didnt have a charger or new heads..</li>
            <li>I can order these on auto-delivery and always have a new brush at hand.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had to use them yet as they are &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34; for my new toothbrush, but they look just like the ones that came with the brush.</li>
            <li>Needed to get new brush heads, this 3 pack lasts me 9 months.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would still appreciate a refund or a discount on the new toothbbrush</li>
            <li>I purchased a new Sonicare toothbrush and needed replacement brush heads.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps Phillips has lowered the ProResults quality with the introduction of their new brush heads?  </li>
            <li>I just change to a new head every 3 months and have had no problems.</li>
            <li>I wanted a new electric toothbrush and this had what I wanted.</li>
            <li>New condition.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>These used to fit on the handle very smoothly and easily; now the press-fit is really tight and can be difficult to place and remove.  </li>
            <li>They do not snap on/click in like the genuine brush heads, the writing is slightly different, and there is extra model # writing on each head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have bought generic brushes which work, but I do not like the generic brand as well as I like the genuine replacement brushes.</li>
            <li>They fray much too quickly and only last a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the Proresults heads to the smaller heads available because of the larger area.  </li>
            <li>If you love your Sonicare, get the real replacements and DO change them at least every four months.</li>
            <li>These are not real Soniccare heads; they don&#x27;t fit well and the bristles are way too soft.</li>
            <li>MY TEETH ARE ALL CROWNS AND ARE VERY SENSITIVE AND THE VIBRATION SOMETIMES MESSES WIT ME..</li>
            <li>VERY soft.  </li>
            <li>brushes were very old.</li>
            <li>so I are handlepoorly and the bristles are very soft</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and began to show wear after a week, unlike the ones that I purchased at Bed Bath and Beyond (which held up for three months).</li>
            <li>I do feel like the blue bristles that indicate when the brush is worn out change color very fast.</li>
            <li>These heads last a long time and clean your teeth very well.</li>
            <li>The new brush head that I switch out began loosing the blue color on the bristles after the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li>If you have been using Sonicare for a while you would be able to notice the poor quality of these brush heads right away.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and looks like the 3 heads will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Not sure if these are authentic.</li>
            <li>Also, the blue bristles lose it colors within the first week.</li>
            <li>The first brush I attached lasted only two days.  </li>
            <li>Quality refills cheaper &amp; they&#x27;re the same exact thing</li>
            <li>These wear out within 2 weeks and are complete garbage!</li>
            <li>the head unexpectedly pops off!  </li>
            <li>The first one I used was shedding it&#x27;s bristles in my mouth every time I brushed.  </li>
            <li>I even purchased my 5 year old the children&#x27;s version!  </li>
            <li>I, however, received the exact same package that you can buy from the store.</li>
            <li>Not at all the same quality as when you first purchase the brush.</li>
            <li>Upon first use you knew these were not actual Sonicare brush heads.</li>
            <li>Looks like I&#x27;m heading to CVS tomorrow to pay regular price, which is what I didn&#x27;t want to do in the first place.</li>
            <li>but I was under the impression that i was getting these for a &amp;#34;better-than-store&amp;#34; price, but i found them at Target for the exact same price.</li>
            <li>The brushes that came with the original unit, and the ones I have purchased before these, were firm and really transmitted the vibrations from the handle to the teeth.</li>
            <li>I replaced it within a week with another one and the exact same thing happened.</li>
            <li>The price seems a bit higher than the generic brushes.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let your toothbrush get too old !</li>
            <li>BUT the price was higher for the same product.  </li>
            <li>The first time I ordered I got the smaller brush head</li>
            <li>Exactly what you can buy at big box stores.</li>
            <li>These heads started shedding plastic strands the first time I used them and constantly thereafter.</li>
            <li>After only two weeks of use, the blue stripe had faded significantly.  </li>
            <li>Pretty standard here.</li>
            <li>My choppers actually felt cleaner and polished after the first use.</li>
            <li>Mine were shipped quickly, arrived early and were real Philips Sonicare Product, not an imitation.</li>
            <li>The first thing was the packaging was obviously not from philips.  </li>
            <li>Definitely not the same quality as the ones which came with the original unit.</li>
            <li>The brushes I received are fakes, it is February 1st and two are already showing signs of wear, not usual for Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li>My first brush head (came with the unit) lasted about 5 months...expect the same from these.  </li>
            <li>seem to fit loose on my base...could be a general problem.  </li>
            <li>The bristles have a sturdy feel while still being somewhat soft and not hard on the gums.  </li>
            <li>I remember the older units lasting much longer.</li>
            <li>sonicare is the only brush we&#x27;ve used for several years and now, having had several dentist trips and them saying what a great job of brushing we do, we are firm believers in the product and will be using it for years to come</li>
            <li>Like others who have complained about these, we assumed they were genuine Sonicare brush heads and of the same quality as the original.</li>
            <li>Out with the old and in with the new.</li>
            <li>Had to buy new toothbrush after I could no longer find replacement heads for old electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have had it a long time just doesn&#x27;t go in right</li>
            <li>The same was true of the third brush head in the set.  </li>
            <li>However, I have found that any mechanical device with high speed rotation, you need to put the toothbrush in a good angle; or you may push your gum line way down by repetitive brushing.  </li>
            <li>Buy directly from their site steer clear of this product!</li>
            <li>I tend to use my brush heads for longer than recommended but, even before owning an electric, I&#x27;ve never had a brush head get flat so fast!</li>
            <li>but it seems very strange that my experience shows there is such HUGE variance in product durability.</li>
            <li>I am able to purchase these brush heads for slightly less than at any local store.  </li>
            <li>I have braces so it doesn&#x27;t last more than 2 mons with me (sometimes less)</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t fit the brush as tight as I would like</li>
            <li>The brush heads are tight to fit and can&#x27;t be removed without the brush head pulling apart.  </li>
            <li>They are a PITA to put on and take off the handle because they fit TOO tight.</li>
            <li>The heads don&#x27;t last as long as the original head has.</li>
            <li>The heads were fine for a few uses</li>
            <li>Not only were they much softer, after my brush was complete I spit out brush bristles!  </li>
            <li>Love our Sonicare... hard to find the brushes...</li>
            <li>I do brush hard so a firmer brush head may do more damage but prevents me from push on the toothbrush to shred it in two weeks.</li>
            <li>would warn all Sonicare consumers to stay clear of the HX6013 &amp;#34;pro</li>
            <li>I have read the reviews and in addition I will say that it is not made clear when purchasing this product that this company is based in Europe, and shipped from England.</li>
            <li>Bought from RNTOD and they are clearly counterfeit.  </li>
            <li>Brushes splayed out in less than 2 weeks, and don&#x27;t clean the teeth well.  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought that this was just a minor manufacturer adjustment and proceeded to use the brushes.  </li>
            <li>Bristles completely frayed after one 2 minute use.</li>
            <li>They have the cheapest replacement heads by far.</li>
            <li>Overall, they feel different, don&#x27;t fit as well, not the same quality.</li>
            <li>I was using a regular toothbrush for a while when I was waiting for the replacement heads to come, and these help get my teeth so much cleaner,</li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised that they worked so well</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money</li>
            <li>Brush heads were delivered early..</li>
            <li>So far everything is as advertised.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>But that is not so, and one can tell when one&#x27;s brush is getting on the soft side (not soft-good but soft-lacking resilience).  </li>
            <li>replacing my old Philips Sonicare that I have had for about 10 years.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are way too soft.</li>
            <li>Having trouble finding a UV light sanitizer that holds this size/style of brush head though.</li>
            <li>This is nowhere near the quality of the brushes that came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I purchased a 3 pack of these and the bristles are so soft they literally lose their shape after 2 brushes.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually not convinced this is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>They are completely legit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you want a soft bristle, these are for you, but I should probably have returned thwm.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what makes this pack different that the others I have used, but it really makes me think &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and I like the soft bristles.</li>
            <li>What I received from Amazon is completely identical to this set in all aspects.  </li>
            <li>They suggested I contact Amazon because it could have been an old product.</li>
            <li>contacted Philips directly</li>
            <li>Then after opening the package and putting the brush heads to use on our existing Philips Sonicare ProResults handle, my husband had no issues with his brush head, but mine would not fit securely and stay in place through the brushing cycle.  </li>
            <li>Get them from a real store where you know you&#x27;re getting the actual product.</li>
            <li>1st brush went soft after 2 days of use.</li>
            <li>I read the description and nowhere here says that the are soft.</li>
            <li>I recently examined my toothbrush because it appeared to lose power and was making unusual noises.</li>
            <li>Very misleading, I got only 2 brush heads instead of 3 in the picture!</li>
            <li>Too soft for my needs</li>
            <li>and so far the bristles don&#x27;t look like they need to be replaced.</li>
            <li>The bristles are far too soft and appear to be wearing out already.</li>
            <li>would appreciate suggestions to find the &#x27;real&#x27; replacement brush heads since I would not like to repeat my earlier research</li>
            <li>Too soft.</li>
            <li>My husband uses this brush head while I use the ultra soft sensitive brush heads</li>
            <li>After 3 days the head looks 2 months old.  </li>
            <li>) 2 of the 3 heads vibrate off immediately, while the third stays on if you&#x27;re gentle while</li>
            <li>I just requested a refund and repurchased through Amazon directly instead of another vendor.  </li>
            <li>I needed a different head - pay very close attention to the model number in the description because I did not and had to toss these</li>
            <li>The heads are not too soft and not too</li>
            <li>I bought these because they seemed to be direct replacements.  </li>
            <li>I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for several years and never had a brush that wore this fast.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>The bristles are extremely soft and flatten on your teeth.</li>
            <li>After a 2-3 brushings, the color of the bristles is faded considerably and the bristles flare out.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed the bristles were much softer than our prior Sonicare head (from a brick &amp; mortar retailer).</li>
            <li>The old brush, after being used for three months, had one bristle sticking out of its group.</li>
            <li>Last for reasonable amount of time without deteriorating.</li>
            <li>Check into how much you are saving on a potential knock off that is somewhat inferior.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended that I use this brush since it has a setting for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I checked a few websites and they&#x27;re definitely supposed to say ProResults on the front, so buy at your own risk since quality will likely be off.</li>
            <li>Good brushes but expensive.</li>
            <li>They are expensive but they seem to do a good job.  </li>
            <li>Clearly made in china as knockoffs, not such a big deal when the price is right</li>
            <li>Then, I noticed the pro results printing seemed a little off from the original brushes.</li>
            <li>It is not original product but looks like original.</li>
            <li>The charger is very small and compact and therefore takes up very little room and along with the toothbrush looks beautiful in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Really stiff, hurts my gums and doesnt fit as snug as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>when I used other brushes) and worse, I&#x27;ve had this head fly off the toothbrush</li>
            <li>The bristles flatten and break down amazingly quickly.</li>
            <li>Turns out they wore down so quickly they were unusable.</li>
            <li>Great brush expensive heads!</li>
            <li>this is the first time I can remember ending up with loose bristles in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Love this serious, so does the brush head</li>
            <li>The bristles on the Diamond Clean heads started to splay and fray after just a few uses.</li>
            <li>The larger brush head covers more area, and the slightly stiffer brushes last longer too.</li>
            <li>You have 2 options, use the generic and have a good brush head for 3 weeks and then let your teeth suffer for the next 5 weeks until you realize that its totally ineffective or get the Phillips and have a brush head that will actually last a few months.</li>
            <li>These are a bit pricey but they do last a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li>They looked off as soon as I first opened the box and the blue bristles never wore off, unlike the ones I&#x27;d used earlier.</li>
            <li>These brush heads are a big improvement over the older heads.  </li>
            <li>Well I just replaced the first with the 2nd and this one is seemingly following suit.</li>
            <li>It fits tightly enough to the body so as to transfer decent vibration to the tip.  </li>
            <li>knock off are good on saw blades (Sometimes) not apparently so on tooth brushes, the knock off have harder less flexable and likely slower flexing brissels.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended by my personal dentist.  </li>
            <li>This one has more bristles (a little longer brush head), and I prefer it to the smaller one - not too big for a woman&#x27;s mouth/teeth.</li>
            <li>these ARE NOT authentic Philips Sonicare products; these are cheap knock offs/counterfeits.  </li>
            <li>but I cannot for the life of me get them to look like they do in the photo and fit (they&#x27;re a tad small and don&#x27;t stretch bit a wee bit).</li>
            <li>The bristles were very brittle, and instead of having &amp;#34;give&amp;#34;, they bent at strange angles.  </li>
            <li>work well and as expected and very convenient to order online via Amazon!</li>
            <li>All 3 have done the same thing and not common for Sonicare heads.</li>
            <li>I was exactly what I expected when I ordered them.</li>
            <li>Normally, they last for 2-3 months.  </li>
            <li>packaging was exactly what I would have expected.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a long time proponent of third-party, or generic, products - especially when it comes to consumable products that we go through quickly.</li>
            <li>these brush heads are much, much cheaper than the replacements in retail stores in my area (though they are exactly the same product) and the packaging is less fussy.</li>
            <li>We sold 1000&#x27;s of these brush heads over the holidays with very few complaints and those that we did receive, turned out to be unscrupulous individuals looking for a free item, as they never returned the \\&quot;defective\\&quot; item even with a paid return postage label after they were refunded.  </li>
            <li>Seems hard to believe that a big company like Phillips Sonicare would not be able to maintain a uniform quality, so</li>
            <li>I recently purchased a new one.  </li>
            <li>I bought brushes in my local grocery store and they look brand new after 30 days of use.</li>
            <li>Actually, I have not yet used the brush heads since I&#x27;m using the one that came with my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>So back to Sonicare and the new design.  </li>
            <li>, the next morning, I was surprised to find my toothbrush looking old and worn, as if I had been using it for months and months</li>
            <li>Each brush that I have installed on my Sonicare will last about a month before it starts to generate a very loud noise from the brush when it is on.</li>
            <li>I used to have a major plaque problem on my teeth, dentist recommended this product&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>No regrets!</li>
            <li>I placed the brush head on my sonicare handle, I immediately felt that something was &amp;#34;different.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of the brush head attaching snugly onto the handle, it felt loose, and it pulled out very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked the Phillips site because it has seemed to me that my teeth were not getting as clean as usual (</li>
            <li>I usually like the smaller compact heads for my teeth, but these work fine.  </li>
            <li>Really does not fit my particular toothbrush  - works, but not well.</li>
            <li>Using the new brush head with the firm bristles definitely cleans on a different level and your gums might be a little sore after the first few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has some very competitive prices, even better at a per unit price than when you buy the 6-pack at the bulk warehouse stores.</li>
            <li>As with the ones provided with the initial brush, these heads don&#x27;t fit perfectly onto the base, leaving a very small slot that allows for toothpaste and gunk to build up.</li>
            <li>The blue streak that designates when to use a new head doesnt seem to last very long but the toothbrushes themselves work very well.</li>
            <li>We really like the Sonicare toothbrush and normally would give a high rating, but these heads do not seem like the same quality we have had in years past.</li>
            <li>The fit is much too tight and requires a strong, awkward  grip where the brush head meets the toothbrush to remove.</li>
            <li>In general, Sonicare brushes are over-priced everywhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying you should buy your heads here if you can find them cheaper elsewhere, but at least buy genuine Sonicare heads.</li>
            <li>You will either spend less in the long run or not get your teeth as clean.</li>
            <li>It clearly says &#x27;three-pack&#x27; in the description and on the package, but there were only two brush heads in the package.</li>
            <li>Like the font on the brush head and wording is slightly different than my old ones.  </li>
            <li>These are complete utter rubish!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s apparent that some people are getting knock-offs by reading their reviews.</li>
            <li>No such problem with the Proresults heads so far after six weeks.</li>
            <li>The brush heads last far longer than any Proresults brush head I&#x27;ve purchased from anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Philips please go back to your old suppliers or change back to your old bristle design.</li>
            <li>And after brushing my teeth, I feel like I need to pull out a regular old non-electric toothbrush and brush again.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used them twice a day for a week now for the standard two minute cycle, but they look like they are 4 months old.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are way too soft, the individual fibers start separating and falling out.</li>
            <li>&quot; so I expected the \\&quot;real thing\\&quot; and I feel that&#x27;s what I</li>
            <li>I like the product (standard brush head) but received the ultra soft which I don&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li>Apparently can&#x27;t return mistakenly opened package.</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive, though.</li>
            <li>Too expensive to have this kind of flaw.  </li>
            <li>Nice small soft brushes that reach into small places in the mouth.  </li>
            <li>I realize that they were economically priced, but there&#x27;s no advantage if I they have to be replaced every few weeks.</li>
            <li>I hope they are able to fix this problem (or maybe it was just my shipment that was poor quality)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not happy that I&#x27;ll have to buy more replacements so soon.</li>
            <li>Quality is high, I find that the heads last for a pretty long time, certainly longer than some traditional toothbrushes I have had in the past.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if these were &amp;#34;seconds&amp;#34;, or just old, but something was not quite right with them.  </li>
            <li>I mean it works but there is now a 1/4&amp;#34;gap where it used to fit snugly.</li>
            <li>According to Philips this is the right brash head model.</li>
            <li>These were slightly less expensive than the Sonic web site and were appropriately packaged and quickly delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would still today recommend these brush heads and will be purchasing more very shortly to replace my last set of fraying brush heads that again, have lasted 1 year 8+months and still have at least some life left in them.</li>
            <li>The bristles on the replacement brush head were much softer (too soft) with little body to begin with and have become frayed and misshapen in two weeks.  </li>
            <li>The bristles got all flat and looked like it was four months old.</li>
            <li>Please be advised that sonicare brush heads generally never &amp;#34;Fray&amp;#34; but do when they are extremely old.  </li>
            <li>Package said Phillips Sonicare Pro Results, however doubt these were the real thing since the bristles were too short and flimsy and the plastic part kept hitting my teeth due to these short soft bristles.</li>
            <li>The bristles are the same as on an one-dollar brush - nothing in common with the sharpened ones on a genuine Philips brush.</li>
            <li>Amazon should really make it clear that this is not a genuine product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Phillips just needs to do a better job with these and making them last longer to create less waste and expense.</li>
            <li>These seem to be similar to a soft traditional toothbrush, which was not indicated in the description.</li>
            <li>They are extremely soft and as such, virtually ineffectual in properly cleaning your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put on the first brush head and it only lasted less than two weeks.  </li>
            <li>This product got a four star rating only due to the fact they don&#x27;t fit as snug as my previous brushes.  </li>
            <li>It is still as hard to remove as it was the first time it was mated - this is obviously a subjective observation since I do not own a stress/strain gauge that could be fitted to make actual measurements : )</li>
            <li>I once waited too long, believing that the indicator was supposed to be completely gone before changing the brush out.  </li>
            <li>Then, the bristles started to deteriorate after the first few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are worth no more than fifty cents a piece.  </li>
            <li>good item but very expensive</li>
            <li>I have noticed that the strip that is supposed  to turn white when the brush head is ready to be changed seems to turn white after about a month, but I really don&#x27;t consider this a negative quality</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t fit the Proresults brush - they are way too loose and as a result are not able to vibrate properly.</li>
            <li>A real improvement over previous Philips Sonicaire electric toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>These brushes are more like toothbrushes compared to the small round versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The heads do not fit the Sonicare device, bristles are shorter than other heads and significantly softer.  </li>
            <li>I like these small ones so much better than those lunky big ones from a few years ago.</li>
            <li>Get the Sonimart ones instead; just as good, but way less expensive.</li>
            <li>May sound gross, but at least you know how well they keep up!</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I&#x27;m not sure these are genuine.</li>
            <li>There was a small mix up in the order and it was very, very satisfactorily corrected immediately.</li>
            <li>I actually went with the previous model (not the Diamond Clean) because there&#x27;s so little difference it doesn&#x27;t pay to upgrade.</li>

            <li> The bristles immediately deformed and were no longer cleaning teeth effectively after 2 days, and after a week, not at all, leaving food on molars.</li>

            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t use any of the heads for a month or more.</li>
            <li> Who knows how many months ago that was.</li>
            <li> What more can I say?</li>

            <li> but they don&#x27;t seem any better.</li>
            <li> Of course, they were cheaper than the ones that fit!</li>
            <li> I love the Philips Sonicare toothbrushes...</li>
            <li> It has happened to me more than once</li>
            <li> these brushes are perfect and save toothpaste since the brush is smaller and the vibrating gets between the teeth and gum</li>
            <li> We have been using these for many years</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t buy them, or buy from a more legit source (the Philips website)</li>
            <li> Love Philips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much to keep this consumer happy.  </li>
            <li> Under $20 for each purchase. :)</li>
            <li> Love the Sonicare system.</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> Buy genuine philips!</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for many years.  </li>
            <li> We both love it and it had made a huge difference!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and such a bargain at these prices.</li>
            <li> Glad i searched at Amazon to find these brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I can get these on line.</li>
            <li> Subscribe and Save lowers the price even more and makes sure that you are changing brush heads when they need to be.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why Amazon continues to sell these when so many of the reviews let it be know that they are counterfeit.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> These brushes and the entire Sonicare system of brushing my teeth were recommended by my dentist, and they are excellent.  </li>
            <li> I have been pleased with the toothbrush and often wonder how I got along without it for all those years.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll buy them from a more trusted source from now on.</li>
            <li> I found out these heads should be changed more often than what I was doing.  </li>
            <li> I have my Sonicare for more than two years now</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I find myself more inclined to do a much better job brushing my tooth.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly for our Sonicare Healthy White electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have had a Sonicare for many years.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure this type head was what I needed when I ordered.  </li>
            <li> Please contact the manufacturer as they are better equipped at diagnosing any type of problem and making sure you purchased the correct heads for your toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Sincerely, Sue Bargain OTC\\&quot;</li>
            <li> purchased along with the charger on the assumption that the charger would allow me to invest in more brushes.  </li>
            <li> The remaining bristles do their job, and I love the toothbrush itself, but Philips needs to step up their quality control on the brush heads.</li>
            <li> These cannot be authentic toothbrush replacements.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found the deal at Costco to be better.</li>
            <li> The 3-pack lasts me most of a year (changing once every 3-4 months).</li>
            <li> looked ok but</li>
            <li> What more can you ask.</li>
            <li> So if you love your teeth and your Sonicare, this is the place to buy your replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Not all that pleased.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I love my sonicare tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> It has made my gums so much more healthy.  </li>
            <li> I have used sonicare system for as many years as i can remember, from the 80s or before...never a problem like this.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the quality, no problems.</li>
            <li> Love my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The brush head that came with the toothbrush is in better condition after three months use than these &amp;#34;replacements&amp;#34; are after a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> They work okay for a bit</li>
            <li> When I bought authentic heads from sonicare, they were quite different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AVOID</li>
            <li> I love sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Great replacement and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I like the compact size better for my size mouth.  </li>
            <li> although I&#x27;m sure my dentist would recommend changing them every 3 months.  </li>
            <li> Probably could do better shopping with a coupon in the stores.</li>
            <li> I travel to underdeveloped countries for work (as I am now) and would be a hassle to return this, much more hassle than its worth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks to Philips for a great product, and amazon for bring it to there customers.</li>
            <li> The packaging seemed authentic and the markings on the heads seemed authentic as well.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with my replacement brushes that I want to order some more.  </li>
            <li> Better than the generation  </li>
            <li> I think ProResults feels much better than DiamoncClean.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> AND I CAN HONESTLY SAY MY TEETH HAVE NEVER FELT MORE CLEAN OR POLISHED.</li>
            <li> We all have our own brush heads now and clean teeth,</li>
            <li> The brushes came at a great price and high quality.</li>
            <li> I have not used the HX6013 heads, but they were delivered on time and in good condition at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised, good price, delivered on time</li>
            <li> So happy to have these new tootbrushes.</li>
            <li> have tried to use the brush head with it not fully attached so that it would be easy to remove; however, most attempts resulted in the brush head sliding off the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The brushes i get from Walmart stays for 3 months or more easily.</li>
            <li> I love brushing my teeth with this for over a year and it really cleans them and feels good in the process..</li>
            <li> I bought 3 more at Walmart and they work fine</li>
            <li> These work just fine, but make sure it is compatible with your Sonicare system.</li>
            <li> However, for that, we anticipated consistent exceptional quality.</li>
            <li> Shipment came on time, I like the bristle design which seems to be able to reach and clean teeth better.  </li>
            <li> but they are very good replacement brushed fort</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!!</li>
            <li> This is much more cheaply made than my known Philips brush heads.</li>
            <li> This is great buy and fast shipping, the price is great and beats out the Big box store.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;ProResults&amp;#34; print on the shaft of the tooth brush head appear faded and cheaply printed compared to my authentic toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> I received these toothbrush heads and thought since they were coming in philips sonicare packaging instead of the frustration free that they would be more legitimate...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually I&#x27;ve had more luck with the 6014 4-pack model they sell here on Amazon in frustration free packaging.</li>
            <li> Cleans teeth much better that the cheap battery types.</li>
            <li> Since that time and after more than 50 tight-fitting mate and de-mate cycles there has not been any noticeable loosening of the brush head to toothbrush fit.</li>
            <li> It may have been a faulty batch, or perhaps they&#x27;re just more cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure you know that it will fit your toothbrush before buying.</li>
            <li> Thanks 4 good product.</li>
            <li> They are a real help in keeping my teeth in good condition.</li>
            <li> The price of the product is compareable and the quality of this product is also good, But I would like to know, How much is the comlit set price ?</li>
            <li> Absolutely keeps my teeth at the optimum health.</li>
            <li> good price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This pack fits my Sonicare toothbrush very well and comes at a good price.</li>
            <li> I popped these in and was looking forward to a nice clean brushing experience, but I found them to be uncharacteristically and significantly softer-feeling than I was used to.</li>
            <li> Easy and quick to use, and really works great.</li>
            <li> The Brush Head HX6013 is a high quality product fitting a top sonic toothbrush, which is effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The original head looks and is in better shape than the replacement head</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t buy healthy original teeth on here or anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Excellent product but over priced...can find them cheaper other places</li>
            <li> I charged the toothbrush overnight as per the user&#x27;s manual which is also well written and easily understandable.  </li>
            <li> Love those clean teeth</li>
            <li> The Diamond Clean version is much better.</li>
            <li> Great low price for a name brand product; not an off-brand product as most others for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> The brush head can be replaced easily.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are easy to change and have a dye incorporated that indicates when it&#x27;s time to replace the brush.</li>
            <li> lightweight and easy to use..</li>
            <li> If you want to have the clean teeth and gums that are healthy than this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li> It is great to be able to find the brush heads for Sonicare and not to have to replace the entire assembly.  </li>
            <li> These brush heads wear out very quickly.</li>
            <li> It was easy to find and purchase.  </li>
            <li> The wear strip makes it easy to keep track of when to change the brush.</li>
            <li> I saved money The easy way..</li>
            <li> /&gt;After ordering (and receiving) these I saw that the Diamond clean were supposed to be better</li>
            <li> Sonicare is a great brush, and we like these larger ones--they cover more of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;It shipped very quick.</li>
            <li> It was easy to select this product and have it shipped to my home.  </li>
            <li> I strongly suggest not buying these knock-offs.</li>
            <li> These brushes are excellent........very sturdy and strong.  </li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend them to my friends.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, it is worth buying</li>
            <li> Received these brush heads quickly, makes brushing your teeth more invigorating, love the clean feel I get after brushing, and the compliments from my dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li> exactly the kind i needed bought my sonicare at the dental office</li>
            <li> as the original toothbrush, so I was sure would fit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are genuine and cost more but they are worth it!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;deal\\&quot; was certainly too good to be true...</li>
            <li> The price is a bit high, would be nice to see a better deal on them.</li>
            <li> The brushes work fine.  </li>
            <li> They now work fine.</li>
            <li> Fine replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> and they work fine.</li>
            <li> It cleans teeth  just fine.</li>
            <li> Otherwise they are fine.</li>
            <li> They still work just fine though.</li>
            <li> I replaced the head on my toothbrush and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> The bristles look fine</li>
            <li> and they have worked just fine.</li>
            <li> and they were fine.</li>
            <li> But they were fine</li>
            <li> but they are fine to me.</li>
            <li> They are fine.</li>
            <li> These are a fine product.</li>
            <li> so for two of the six are working fine.</li>
            <li> Everything is fine with them.  </li>
            <li> I used one for 3 months and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> These work just fine.  </li>
            <li> The brush is fine but it spins off the &amp;#34;easy care&amp;#34; brush we have when being used.</li>
            <li> The Phillips Sonicare Proresult  brush heads are easy to fit onto the power supply.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fine.  </li>
            <li> Works fine, I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> this is a functional item that works just fine.  </li>
            <li> It makes it quick and easy to get my teeth very clean .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the way these toothbrushes keep my teeth and gums healthy!  </li>
            <li> Amazon needs to clean up the counterfeit goods, it&#x27;s becoming a problem.</li>
            <li> very good, as expected.</li>
            <li> the original manufacturer&#x27;s brush heads, I easily give out a five-star rating.  </li>
            <li> and I think these replacements are just as strong as the ones that originally came with it</li>
            <li> I have seen some comments about the fit of these heads, but my original heads had a less than perfect fit, too.</li>
            <li> The fact they come with a rubber seal attached to the bottom is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I have been using my Sonicare for years and it makes a huge difference to replace the head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping Philips reads these reviews because for such a great electric toothbrush they went totally cheap on the heads.</li>
            <li> There is a huge difference in quality.</li>
            <li> I ordered this Easy Clean Rechargeable toothbrush on 5/23/2013</li>
            <li> I never used Sonicare before and purchased this Easy Clean version based on the customer reviews I had read here</li>
            <li> They fit and work well.</li>
            <li> They fit Sonicare HX6710 which I also bought from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> These are NOT Philips products, they are cheap counterfeit brushes that are rubbish.</li>
            <li> They fit my sonicare.</li>
            <li> Received cheap copies from seller RNTOD.</li>
            <li> and they confirmed that the legitimate Philips brush heads should not suffer from these issues.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for a few months now and they deliver what they are made for, the quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> They are now cheaply manufactured.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As advertised, god fit on end of toothbrush head, comfortable to use, would buy again.</li>
            <li> the brush heads are easy to change and clean often.</li>
            <li> They said its fit on all.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what was going to fit my son&#x27;s tooth brush</li>
            <li> A package of three gets me through the year comfortably.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference in quality or fit.  </li>
            <li> Purchase additional heads to have an available supply</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product and regularly change my brush heads every 3 months like clockwork.  </li>
            <li> The heads fit snugly on the attachment post</li>
            <li> The seller was very prompt and courteous with my request.</li>
            <li> It does not even fit well and cannot be used at all.</li>
            <li> These Brush Heads are cheap fakes.</li>
            <li> These are fakes... Sonic Care confirmed them as counterfeit...</li>
            <li> Tooth brush heads fit.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t know which brush head would fit my toothbrush</li>
            <li> Also, I wanted the easy clean model.  </li>
            <li> It really is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are cheap and after one use the toothbrush head looks like it has been used for a year.</li>
            <li> I have used the Sonicare toothbrush system for about 4 months now and really enjoy the way it cleans my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Do not buy, cheap product.  </li>
            <li> Brush heads fit well with our flex-care brush.</li>
            <li> I appreciate having a source that makes using my cordless toothbrush more economical.</li>
            <li> They are cheap knock-offs.</li>
            <li> Great product, however, they stated they were not going to be in one of those plastic packages so it would easier to open, and it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and they are replacing the heads free of charge so my faith in the company is restored probably just got a defective package</li>
            <li> I wish the seven-packs were still available.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads wouldn&#x27;t fit my sonic unit, so I had to return them.</li>
            <li> It fits on to the head, but does not feel or function like a correct fit.</li>
            <li> even though the image is not a product photo, rest assured these brush heads will fit.</li>
            <li> they are genuine  FAKES.  </li>
            <li> it said it will fit, Philips Soniccare HealthyWhite.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> Product fit and worked per instructions.</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads fit my machine like a glove.  </li>
            <li> They fit the toothbrush but bristles wear out after a week or so.  </li>
            <li> They are a great value and they each last about 4 months.</li>
            <li> The brushes &amp;#34;collapsed&amp;#34; after about 4-5 days of light use.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the heads which do fit correctly are showing signs of rust, which I never noticed with the heads I received with my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> it is easy to clean and replace .</li>
            <li> I tried the off-brand version that didn&#x27;t fit at all.  </li>
            <li> Cheap knock offs.</li>
            <li> Important.  </li>
            <li> This does not fit perfectly with the Diamond system.</li>
            <li> I accidentally bought this thinking it would fit my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t fit the Sonicare toothbrush that I have.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Then as well I noticed the brushs of the 1 head I removed, the brush bristles were already worn out just after 2 months of light use....  </li>
            <li> What can I say, the brushes fit and work well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.....</li>
            <li> I question if these are genuine Philips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Thank goodness amazon does free returns</li>
            <li> The genuine item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One thing to note, I use frustration free packaging, but this time I accidentally ordered blister pack.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> So happy that i have back ups</li>
            <li> These are cheap knock off brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I am happy that we made the switch from the traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> WITHOUT the ultra violate light.</li>
            <li> I used this for the out of country travels - it is convenient to have everything in one secure location</li>
            <li> The genuine brush head changes color</li>
            <li> So far so good with that one.</li>
            <li> The set I got is definitely the real thing and perfect.</li>
            <li> they look good tho,  but don&#x27;t last more than a week</li>
            <li> My teeth feel super clean!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used these yet; still on the first brush head that came with my new Healthywhite, but the pricing was great.  </li>
            <li> love this toothbrush and these are required items for right functioning</li>
            <li> These heads fit my Flex care and will fit Diamond Clean, Flex Care</li>
            <li> the Diamond Clean brush heads that came with my Sonicare and do just about as good of a cleaning job as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> I paid quite a bit for the sonic toothbrush device itself and am happy with it but surely at the price they charge they could make the bristles of these brush heads out of a higher quality, longer lasting material.</li>
            <li> Made my teeth feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Kept my teeth so clean my dentist quit as soon as she saw how plaque and cavity free</li>
            <li> I honestly thought I was buying a decent product.  </li>
            <li> The price is competitive, ordering is easy, and delivery is quick.</li>
            <li> For long term use, this product makes the most sense for me money wise.</li>
            <li> Never buy things with not sale by Amazon directly!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered these to go with my new Hx6731/34 toothbrush that I purchased at the same time, they&#x27;re as advertised and the best price I found.</li>
            <li> My original brush lasted 6 months with no problem.  </li>
            <li> These brush heads differ materially in quality and build from the original brush head that came with the brush and the replacement brush heads I purchased at BB&amp;B (lasted ~1.5 weeks).</li>
            <li> These are the original brushes that come from Philips when you purchase your toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The original brush was wearing out.</li>
            <li> I think they are counterfeit brushes, because it looks nothing like the original.</li>
            <li> --Original--</li>
            <li> Came as promised in original packaging.</li>
            <li> Brush Heads lasted 3 - 4 weeks rather than 2 - 3 months, compared to the brush heads purchased with original  toothbrush</li>
            <li> and one from Philips, you can see a lot of details indicating it was copied from the original product</li>
            <li> Having gone through many replacement toothbrush heads, this is a first.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I am not buying original brushes anymore.</li>
            <li> These do not seem to be original.  </li>
            <li> Stick with the original.</li>
            <li> The original head on the brush lasted over 3 months.  </li>
            <li> So, i have been using a manual toothbruse and also hunting for one powered one that may just come close to my original sonicare.</li>
            <li> The Philips are identitical to the original and perform well.  </li>
            <li> Just like the original, get the job well done.</li>
            <li> They match original.</li>
            <li> Not at all like the ones that came with the sonicare originally.  </li>
            <li> Each one wares out in 2 months (the original lasted over 6).  </li>
            <li> and I am pretty sure they will work well.</li>
            <li> After a week of brushing the bristles are splayed out and are not holding their form, as the original did.</li>
            <li> Sonicare original product.  </li>
            <li> work just like the original brush heads</li>
            <li> They clean my teeth well.</li>
            <li> These heads work just find and clean the teeth and gums well.</li>
            <li> before three months was even up, and our teeth did not feel clean by the end of the day (</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with removing the heads to clean the brush.</li>
            <li> It was nice to be able to purchase a three brush set&lt;br /&gt;rather than one at a time or five in the big box stores.</li>
            <li> I got the shipping free (Amazon Prime member), and they came quickly and well protected.  </li>
            <li> My teeth always feel so clean after each use.</li>
            <li> Dental hygene techs comment on my clean teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth are clean and I didn&#x27;t pay a boatload for them.</li>
            <li> my teeth do not feel clean if I</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt as clean since we started using these.  </li>
            <li> It makes my mouth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> These do not compare to the diamond clean heads at all.</li>
            <li> Ahh, clean teeth.</li>
            <li> Perfect cleaning, but soft enough not to damage the mouth tissues.</li>
            <li> With the Sonicare and flossing, I get complements on my clean teeth when I visit the dentist.</li>
            <li> It is a bummer as my teeth dont get as clean as they used to.</li>
            <li> With regualr size my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean as they do with compact brush.</li>
            <li> Teeth didn&#x27;t feel nearly as clean.</li>
            <li> He asked me what I used to clean my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Some of the bristles are falling out and the brush heads are pretty new, so I don&#x27;t think they are as good a quality as the ones originally with the tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I love being able to just order stuff like this on Amazon and not have to worry about going down to the store just to buy this, it&#x27;s so handy get it now</li>
            <li> Original head will last a good 3/4 - to 1 year before noticing signs of wear and time to exchange.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s more hassle to return just one brush out of three we have discarded it; but it certainly shades our opinion of this Philips product.  </li>
            <li> I will certainly order more when I need too.</li>
            <li> ; ordered the right brushes!</li>
            <li> These rotate right off the toothbrush as soon as the toothbrush is turned on!</li>
            <li> I love it that I can easily order and receive new brush heads for my sonicare ....</li>
            <li> Not too hard on my teeth, yet does a wonderful job</li>
            <li> I have bought these several times and they hold up fairly well and work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This tooth brush is so cool.</li>
            <li> Not a dentist, so have no way of judging how good a job it is actually doing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: after requesting a refund through Amazon, the China-based seller promptly responded and offered a full refund.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are much whiter and the automatic toothbrush does a much better job than manually.</li>
            <li> and I now brush a full 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After spending two years using generics, and being somewhat pleased with them, I decided to order the real deal.</li>
            <li> but these are full retail prices.</li>
            <li> As much as I love the toothbrush, I really appreciate the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is good price with coupon,but there is only 2 pack ,not 3.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Are these really Philips&#x27; authentic products?  </li>
            <li> In fact, I switched the whole family over to these electric brushes and they all love them.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy the knock-offs, buy the real thing as the cleaning function is much better.</li>
            <li> I do know is that when I&#x27;m ready to buy more brush heads, I&#x27;m going to seek out Braun Wholesale.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;ProResults&amp;#34; labeled on the brush heads are more raised and appear as a &amp;#34;bold&amp;#34; font in comparison to the real Phillips heads.  </li>
            <li> Same as described, good product..</li>
            <li> Apart for some initial miscommunications, Product arrived in timely and good</li>
            <li> Only time will tell if the quality is as good as the origional?  </li>
            <li> Replacement the heads regularly and rinse it good in hottest faucet water after each use.  </li>
            <li> Tried and true perfiormance.</li>
            <li> ordered these, name brand, and my teeth are super clean again!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but before I bought from there the replacements as well as the full set</li>
            <li> Thanks guys :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to buy from Costco b/c they only sell the newer styled brushes and this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> These brushes for and by Sonicare are good quality and last for months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several Sonicare&#x27;s and loved every one.</li>
            <li> Oh it&#x27;s cool</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t fit exactly right</li>
            <li> Again, I give credit to the China-based company for responding quickly to my concerns and allowing me a full refund no questions asked.</li>
            <li> I am glad I made the switch because these actual gave me a better clean in my opinion than the compact.</li>
            <li> But no that I am used to it, I feel that my teeth are getting more clean using this rather than just a normal tooth brush.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll continue buying them because they are great and cheaper than other stores sells them.</li>
            <li> Good quality sonicare brushes, my old brush was worn and the new one made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel fresh and clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> Having them delivered to my home was convenient and quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal fan of Sonicare products for years, ever since my dentist recommended that I purchase and use one.</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean and are holding up very well.</li>
            <li> I ordered from Amazon, and received the replacement brushes quickly.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if a larger economy pack were available to save everyone costs.</li>
            <li> butr do a tremendous job.</li>
            <li> They both love it as they share the main electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> they fit my toothbrush and are so much better than my old ones.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky to get 6-8 weeks from a brush head.</li>
            <li> These brush heads fall apart so quickly, I would imagine my teeth to be made of steel.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Product arrive quickly.</li>
            <li> They quickly vibrated off my easyclean sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never even seen this with the cheapest 4 for $1 toothbrushes at the super market.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much easier to clean!</li>
            <li> They fit fine on my Sonicare Healthy White 710 model toothbrush.</li>
            <li> At first I thought these were genuine replacement heads and quickly learned that&#x27;s not the case.</li>
            <li> The right item, Quick and the right price!  </li>
            <li> +, Healthy White and Easy Clean Sonicare Toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I did a bunch of research to see exactly which replacement heads fit which brush handle.  </li>
            <li> The packaging and printing all look genuine, but the first one lasted one month before it refused to stay on.  </li>
            <li> Sweetness Elements should retract this product as it is very evident by the feedback on Amazon and through Phillips that they are counterfeit.  </li>
            <li> They appear to be genuine (not fake).</li>
            <li> Make sure you know which kind of sonicare toothbrush you have because they are not interchangeable with other designs they make.</li>
            <li> Called Phillips and confirmed it was the right holder and the right brush, but, they would not snap into the holder.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare tooth brush is great for keeping the stains down as well.</li>
            <li> Product came exactly as advertised in original packaging, with quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my Sonicare and the only place I can find them, other than my dentists office, which I don&#x27;t get to often.</li>
            <li> The new head, after about a week of use, had many bristles bent out of their groups.</li>
            <li> I have been happy with the frustration free in the past.</li>
            <li> this price was unbelievable, after shopping around I decided that this was as good as it get, glad I purchased</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit as well as the original which originally concerned me, but it fits well enough and works fine.  </li>
            <li> Really like the Sonicare toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> These Phillips Sonicare HX6013 brushheads are exactly like the original ones that came with my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not feel like the first ones we ordered on here !</li>
            <li> exactly like the ones that came with the sonicare originally.</li>
            <li> I will actually be ordering more of these for my friend, who also has a sonicare!  </li>
            <li> at a total price of $50 or more!  </li>
            <li> Wish I had read the reviews first!  </li>
            <li> Excellent sonic toothbrush with great, long lasting, firm brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Still, they work just fine and provide a very vigorous brushing experience as promised.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, comfortable brush heads.</li>
            <li> They fit my toothbrush, and my teeth will probably be none the wiser, but I am not 100% convinced that these are real Philips brand.  </li>
            <li> These are a cheap knock off of the real thing.</li>
            <li> Probably still worth it</li>
            <li> Just needed some more replacement heads for my sonicare, what more can I say, not much to report on it.</li>
            <li> Nothing can beat the feeling of fresh cleaning heads.</li>
            <li> These fit my Healthy White HX6710 Toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Any toothbrush is only as effective as the users allows it to be.  </li>
            <li> they were too soft and they didn&#x27;t hold their shape for more than a week</li>
            <li> These premium brush heads are worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Since my teeth are not the best, every dentist I have had has told me my issues would be worse.</li>
            <li> but worth it.</li>
            <li> as expected , good product , recommended.</li>
            <li> Phillips Sonicare makes good products, you just have to be careful you match the accessory with th emodel you are using.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my philips sonicare toothbrush and now I feel complete with these toothbrush replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> Its worth it to invest in your teeth.</li>
            <li> Turns out I have a different kind of toothbrush.</li>
            <li> so you can share one Sonicare brush and have multiple users each with his/her own brush head.</li>
            <li> Within a week I was noticing the bristles spreading out, and this is with me only using the electric brush&#x27;s own weight to brush, as I know</li>
            <li> Funny because we bought the exact replacement head they said was to fit my brush</li>
            <li> I also liked getting extra brushes</li>
            <li> So far, I love the press on head.  </li>
            <li> , but the Sonicare is worth it.</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot to say other than they fit well and are a perfect replacement for our Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> you think that later you will not be able to send to the original address, DO NOT OFFER AT ALL.</li>
            <li> A year ago I went to have my teeth clean and the dentist was surprised on how super clean my teeth already where.  </li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and love how clean and white my teeth are.  </li>
            <li> This is my second one, your teeth feel really clean after you brush, I get better check ups&lt;</li>
            <li> The replacement brush felt much softer than the original brush.  </li>
            <li> my other brush replacements were good quality and of medium firmness</li>
            <li> All three of the bristles are much softer than the original heads that I just replaced.&lt;br /&gt;C)</li>
            <li> Good deal compared to other stores</li>
            <li> Something didn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li> They fall right off the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Or can you help me to replace to the right style?</li>
            <li> they vibrate right off the barrel...  </li>
            <li> I recommend you go to sonicare&#x27;s website and chat with a representative so that they can point you to the right direction.</li>
            <li> the price was right.</li>
            <li> Get the right ones and they&#x27;ll plug right in with no hassles.</li>
            <li> Just the right product.</li>
            <li> I am so dissappointed as they have shortened the length of the bristles therefore making it vibrate against my teeth if not held just right.  </li>
            <li> The product was received timely and is exactly right.  </li>
            <li> They vibrate right off?</li>
            <li> but I noticed that they are the right size to cover your teeth when using it with the Sonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I bought my Sonicare toothbrush from my dentist and couldn&#x27;t find replacement brush heads that said they fit that particular model even on the Philips website.</li>
            <li> tooth brushes give you a dentist office type clean each time you brush, my whole family loves ours.</li>
            <li> Really gets teeth clean.</li>
            <li> They seem to last longer than my old ones, but that is a mystery best left unsolved.</li>
            <li> It was great, better than the last few I ordered.</li>
            <li> Price is average but quality is good.</li>
            <li> These little guys are great, last a long time, and this is a great price.</li>
            <li> Work just as expected since they replace the original brush head that accompanied the Sonicare Easy Clean.</li>
            <li> SInce I was comparing prices, I made the mistake of thinking it was included since I did not see any offered withOUT the UV light, however, live and learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> pure junk!</li>
            <li> previous brush heads lasted a good three or four months before I replaced them.  </li>
            <li> I quickly ordered these, assuming they were the real deal.  </li>
            <li> For the couple bucks more that these cost, I believe it is worth it and stay away from the generic replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> These are excellent, a stiffer bristle is better, these do last for 3-4 months before the blue is half way.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, but it would be nice if the colors were brighter and easier to distinguish, like primary colors.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase, bc you must switch the toothbrush heads out when the blue strip turns white...</li>
            <li> Finally frustration free packaging provides scissor free access to the brush</li>
            <li> It is much softer and &#x27;frayed&#x27; quickly.  </li>
            <li> These bristles would collapse and let the plastic hit my teeth far too easily.</li>
            <li> They are, however, very easy to fit compared to the previous heads I had.</li>
            <li> The second head seems to be doing better but we&#x27;ll see; still doesn&#x27;t seem quite right.</li>
            <li> Sonicare has been used in my family for years and it works very, very well</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I ordered these new brush heads with the understanding that they are original Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> These look just like the original brushes that came with the Sonicare when it was new.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are too soft to brush adequately, and they wear out quickly.</li>
            <li> Best way to clean teeth and getting into hard to reach places without too much effort compared to a regular brush.  </li>
            <li> So happy to buy it now i can use old brush to clean my shoes :/</li>
            <li> The brush heads are available in small and large sizes, both of which are useful in their own way.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are much softer and do no appear strong enough to hold up to any significant scrubbing.</li>
            <li> The new heads make my teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> A real piece of garbage!</li>
            <li> Only issue is that they cost more than I believe they should.</li>
            <li> Really does a great job cleaning my teeth and making them feel slick and look shiny.</li>
            <li> Rusted first week used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the actual brushes are fakes.</li>
            <li> However, the brush heads I received in my latest purchase were definitely different.  </li>
            <li> For the ones I received in my most recent Amazon order, however, I&#x27;d like to give zero stars.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Love my sonicare toothbrush and you will obviously need these to go with them.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> First had to get used to it, as well as my husband.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(Sonicare does not provide a warranty on their brush heads - they only provide a warranty on the handles)&lt;br /&gt;Amazon offered a refund, which I gladly accepted.</li>
            <li> I have a Healthy White Sonicare Toothbrush and these heads are the replacements.  </li>
            <li> Delivered on time and exactly as described ...</li>
            <li> My dental reports are better than when I used a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Will most definitely order this product from this seller again once it&#x27;s time to replace.</li>
            <li> I bought these heads to go with my Phillips Soicare Healthy White toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> They start to fade almost after the first use.</li>
            <li> More time in the dental chair, head fade strips don&#x27;t even last 4 weeks per head, and noticeable change in quality before 1 month is up for brushing.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was because of the pressure I was putting when brushing my teeth</li>
            <li> I ordered two packs for the same shipping cost for even greater savings.  </li>
            <li> These frayed after the first use.</li>
            <li> Exactly as specified and I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> This is not the first time I buy this through AMAZON.</li>
            <li> (we figure it&#x27;s a way to sell more), and we usually can and do get more life out of our heads than three months.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t point to anything specific, just more of a &amp;#34;feeling.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I received this product and it is exactly what I needed for my sonic are toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Previous purchases were fine, but this time many bristles fell out soon after I started using one.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I purchased the brush heads online.  </li>
            <li> I hope AMAZON becomes aware that is happening.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve been burned by a purchase on Amazon -- why did it have to be over replacement toothbrush heads?</li>
            <li> This sure beats the hassle I had with a different toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know exactly which brush head fits your sonicare</li>
            <li> I should have returned them when I first realized there was a problem.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever returned anything from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Brush head came a part the first time it was put onto my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY UNUSABLE!</li>
            <li> I have tried the compact heads, but find the Standard Head works better for me.</li>
            <li> I will pay the slightly higher cost from any U.S. based company.</li>
            <li> It felt as if I had been using this brush head for six months rather than for the first time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad to finally get replacements.</li>
            <li> I kept the first one for like a year.</li>
            <li> Within the first week of use, the bristles were just mangled and unuasable.  </li>
            <li> but I feel that they are pretty pricey for that they are.  </li>
            <li> Exact brush heads for my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The 3 pack is a much better deal than the local pharmacy..</li>
            <li> Exact replacement head.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush leave my teeth smooth just like when I get them professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li> These are NOT the real thing!</li>
            <li> They are exactly what was on the toothbrush handle.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> These are the exact heads that are sold in stores but at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> The first time we used the heads one of them fell apart into pieces.  </li>
            <li> I love it and have now got my kids, spouce and my mother on the same one!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Very satisified !</li>
            <li> As many other have noted, they begin to show significant signs of wear within a week or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll know better next time.  </li>
            <li> the color all wore off the first head after about 2 weeks rather than the 3 months</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I received a faulty product.</li>
            <li> Better than regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> the latest order is different.</li>
            <li> There are too many different brushes.</li>
            <li> and that is exactly what I received.</li>
            <li> At first it got lost in the mail, but once I contacted them they immediately replaced it.</li>
            <li> This could be a result of the fact that my toothbrush is getting older, but these heads seem to be wearing out really quickly.</li>
            <li> the first 2-3 brushings the brissels would fall out but that eventually stopped.  </li>
            <li> Heads are exactly like the ones it came with.  </li>
            <li> Better than the generic stuff at stores.  </li>
            <li> The first brush head lasted maybe a month.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s noteworthy that the price for these heads was the lowest I could find at the time; even at Sams Club or CostCo, the per-head cost was higher.</li>
            <li> If these aren&#x27;t fakes, then Philips quality control has really gone downhill!</li>
            <li> I think the only deal I found that was better was when Costco had a coupon on these replacement</li>
            <li> exactly as I get at the store but not going to the store.</li>
            <li> so they actually cost much more.</li>
            <li> my child and my wife screwed up their brushes on the first try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Based on my dentist&#x27;s recommendation I purchased my first Philips electric toothbrush about 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Most likely counterfeit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using pro-results brushes since the first sonicare was released.  </li>
            <li> So - these are exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> These are exactly the product that I have always used with my Philips Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I purchased the non generic item on purpose, knowing that I would spend more, but get a higher quality purchase.  </li>
            <li> These brush heads are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still I would recommend it, especially with free shipping, which got to me in 2 days anyway!</li>
            <li> On further inspection I see that the print on the brush head stem is raised and doesn&#x27;t look or feel like an authentic brush head.</li>
            <li> Totally a waste, but good thing</li>
            <li> but I was able to smooth it down.</li>
            <li> I am now a loyal customer of Sonicare for life and highly recommend buying this item.  </li>
            <li> It is much easier to keep clean than the older model.  </li>
            <li> BY BUYING SOFT HEADS INSTEAD OF STD!!!!</li>
            <li> Sure, these are more expensive than the basic brush heads, but they are far more effective.</li>
            <li> few dollars more ever few months is much cheaper and more comfortable than having a cavity filled!</li>
            <li> They work very well and they snap right on to the brush handle.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I really like him--he even made a crown right in the office with a light-based computer-design device that molded the crown on site.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product from Amazon for the past four years, and until my most recent purchase, I have loved it.  </li>
            <li> Was having a hard time finding these in stock at my local stores so this works out great!</li>
            <li> So just a watch out, ask for a replacement if these do not feel or last like the original that came with your brush!</li>
            <li> I noticed that my teeth were not feeling as clean after using one of these heads and that my brush bristles looked prematurely old and splayed out.</li>
            <li> But this is the only good brush for proper plaque removal.</li>
            <li> I simply can’t tell you how much I love real Sonicare brush heads.  </li>
            <li> But the last crown I had cost in the neighborhood of $2K, and so I have a very different view of cost versus value now that I&#x27;m over 50 and, in essence, have a choice between maintaining  good periodontal and dental health and keeping my \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; in a cup at the bedside.</li>
            <li> These are good quality and last 3 to 6 months of brushing twice daily.</li>
            <li> Sonicare brush heads and related products help to reduce the amount of tartar that can accumulate on my teeth, and my gums are also healthy because the brushes gently stimulate the gums, cleanse beneath the gum line, resulting in no bleeding nor gum inflammations/infections.  </li>
            <li> I really like my Sonicare tooth brush a lot and change the brushes very frequently to keep it as effective as possible.</li>
            <li> Thanks  very much</li>
            <li> The bristles always make my teeth feel extra clean!</li>
            <li> I mean, they seem to work okay, but the quality could be better, IMO.</li>
            <li> I blew through the first head really quickly because they are so soft.</li>
            <li> and they wear out pretty fast</li>
            <li> It is smaller than the last model I used and is much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Also the bristles on these were bent up after a few uses, as compared to the original brush head that still remains more straighten after months of use.</li>
            <li> You all know how good it feels to put in a new head and immediately notice the results from a slightly stiffer brush.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s interesting to see the inner workings of the toothbrush head, they now don&#x27;t fit back on very well</li>
            <li> Currently pregnant and having some issues with sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> I must say that comparing to my brushes I had before, they are super soft.</li>
            <li> I have braces and these still stay strong and don&#x27;t fray apart like standard brushes.</li>
            <li> I tried the generic ones and I came back to the original because it works just that much better and leaves my teeth feeling much cleaner.  </li>
            <li> These appear to almost certainly be counterfeit.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t be certain, I believe that the replacement heads I received may be a knockoff.</li>
            <li> figured they might have to be put on facing a certain direction.</li>
            <li> and this is the first time they have been so soft and not able to clean teeth effectively.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The very first time I used them to brush my teeth, the bristles completely disintegrated...</li>
            <li> I just purchased a new Sonicare toothbrush and wanted to be sure I had extra brushes.</li>
            <li> They do a great job, we all agree our mouths have never felt cleaner and we are looking forward to less dire predictions when i return for my next cleaning.</li>
            <li> The new head snaps right on.</li>
            <li> It makes it quick and easy to get my teeth very clean without irritating my gums.</li>
            <li> this is a bargain by and the fact that they fit a long line of sonicaire models makes it even better, will reorder in the future fast shipping</li>
            <li> The brushes are fine and are the same as the ones that came with my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> They are virtually the same exact brush heads that came with the original toothbrush</li>
            <li> I am using generic ones now, and they work just fine at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Buy one of these fine Sonicare brushes and extra heads.  </li>
            <li> Massage, sensitive and clean (or normal) do</li>
            <li> Brushes seem to be pretty high quality.</li>
            <li> They are a little pricy for electric toothbrush heads, but I think healthy teeth and gums are worth it.</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly as explained - starting using them right away!</li>
            <li> great price, especially when it needs to be replaced every few weeks as recommended by the dentist and ADA</li>
            <li> Buy the smaller heads on Amazon as they are definitely a genuine Philips product.</li>
            <li> plus I wanted a toothbrush to be basically white in color to fit in with my bathroom decor.  </li>
            <li> Indeed, we were ready to replace the device until these brushes came.</li>
            <li> I am convinced that these are the real thing.</li>
            <li> these aren&#x27;t the real deal.</li>
            <li> I purchased real ones from Target and you can see a difference in the bottom.</li>
            <li> I really like the way that these brush heads are made, but I feel that they are a bit over-priced..</li>
            <li> these were a real disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stick to the real thing.</li>
            <li> Counterfeit - not the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I have no problem with trying out generics, but this comes in Philips packaging and presents itself as the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> You be the judge, but I will say that they were very prompt in responding to my request for a refund and credited it that day.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very happy.will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These are the brand name ones and they work very well.  </li>
            <li> However, they are much tighter on the brush than the originals.</li>
            <li> went in for a cleaning and was astonished how much time I had to spend in the chair having plaque removed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go look for the real thing, because this doesn&#x27;t seem like it.</li>
            <li> HAS THREE SETTING, BUT CAN&#x27;T TEL MUCH DIFFERENCE IN THE 3..</li>
            <li> These brush heads seem to be identical to the ones in the stores but at a much lower price.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li> but these are from the manufacturer of the toothbrush and work very well.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than retail stores.  </li>
            <li> Much easier to attach brush head.</li>
            <li> We really like the Sonicare Toothbrush system.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend really likes these brush heads.  </li>
            <li> They are reasonably fraying, just like the originals did after this amount of time.  </li>
            <li> There is THAT much of a difference in the way it will change your dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> For about $8.50 per brush, you really can&#x27;t beat it.  </li>
            <li> This cannot be the real thing by Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The print looks cheap and the plastic feels different.</li>
            <li> The tooth brushes work very well.</li>
            <li> but figured if I got the ones that were fulfilled by Amazon and Prime eligible they would be the real deal.</li>
            <li> The sonicare wording is blurry, you can tell they are not the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Given we paid for the real branded heads, and understanding the razor and the blade model, we accepted that the manufacturer would make a killer margin on three replacement heads for $25.</li>
            <li> Of the three heads, one worked perfectly, one was totally unusable (would not fit into brush) and the last one, which I am using now, pops out of my toothbrush every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> Kudos to Amazon for a simple, hassle free process</li>
            <li> These bristles are shaped to my teeth, and really feel like they are doing the job.  </li>
            <li> Cannot tell you how much it has helped to improve my gum health.  </li>
            <li> These are the real heads you would purchase from retail locations, they came in retail packaging.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the real deal.</li>
            <li> Appreciated gift to my son.</li>
            <li> The bristles wear out too fast.</li>
            <li> All 3 heads have the durability of the cheapest product ever - bristles fall out in your mouth or wear out incredibly fast.  </li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> works very well.  </li>
            <li> so I expected authentic</li>
            <li> fast delivery</li>
            <li> I end up pulling the whole brush head off the handle.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> i really do like using sonicare and would like to continue buying this product on amazon.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say these were not actually real Philips Sonicare brushes, but they sure seemed like knockoffs.</li>
            <li> , rust forms on the bottom metal ring, and the three brushes were cut very inconsistently.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Been using for over 10 years and my teeth feel much cleaner than when I brush by hand.  </li>
            <li> You really need to change every 3 months.</li>
            <li> I wonder if these were real sonicare heads?</li>
            <li> These are the real things.</li>
            <li> Yes, it fits the Sonicare but doesn&#x27;t compare to the real Sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> The cheap generics simply not work.</li>
            <li> you never visit for your whole life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but after this fortunate, accidental discovery, I will only buy from one vendor.&lt;br /&gt;Braun</li>
            <li> After buying a &amp;#34;generic brand&amp;#34; from Walmart that didn&#x27;t fit and kept coming off when I brushed, I bought these</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> The Bristles are so much softer than the ones that came with our toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering these againg very soon.</li>
            <li> Love it, received sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Have worked very well</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes with the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I have stronger finger grip compared to most (can bend a beer bottle cap closed by pinching it between my index finger and thumb)</li>
            <li> Following a recommendation from my dentist, over five years ago, I have used Sonicare as the primary means of cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The replacement heads from Amazon are reasonably priced and arrive in 5 to 7 days.</li>
            <li> this is what I would expect from the cheap generic ones but not from the official brand.</li>
            <li> I found it is much easier to shop on line for this product.</li>
            <li> Really recommendable, I have been suing them for about two years without any issue.</li>
            <li> They claimed to send longer ones but they really don make a difference.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also slightly differently shaped than the OEM heads as my OEM brush cover wouldn&#x27;t fit these heads</li>
            <li> Then I opened them, and it didnt fit properly.</li>
            <li> For some reason, the toothbrush heads I bought on Amazon seemed to wear out much, much quicker than the ones I bought at the store.</li>
            <li> I bought for much cheaper price</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is very substandard.  </li>
            <li> These brush heads are the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> REAL Philips Sonicare head brushes.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> Price reasonable.</li>
            <li> It was offered in frustration free packaging, but I choose the standard packaging</li>
            <li> I had a travel toothbrush for a couple of months this year and it really made me miss my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> These are the real &#x27;McCoy&#x27; product, so if you like the originals</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t know how much I&#x27;m compromising in cleaning compared to the orig.</li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the sonicare tootbrush.  </li>
            <li> Better quality than generic brands by far.  </li>
            <li> Nice set of brush heads that are not too firm.  </li>
            <li> The bristles were the softest kind there is which ended up only lasting me about two weeks each head.</li>
            <li> but since I need to write at least 20 words to keep Amazon from asking me to review again, let me just say that they are a good replacement for a SonicCare Pro.  </li>
            <li> It was Perfect fit for base.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend these brush heads, they are just the right size for normal size teeth.</li>
            <li> My wife independently came to the same conclusion that I did: these brush heads must now be manufactured by someone who has created a cheap knock-off that functions nothing like the original product did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend to pay more and get real brush heads from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond or some other store.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what it should be - new, still in the original packaging, and it was actually the correct item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overpriced little brushes, which are very easy to put on the toothbrush</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes work the same as the original brush.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but they look and feel the same as the one that came with my original brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will buy original only from now.</li>
            <li> My old Philips Sonicare Brush Head is much better than this, but it is not easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Factoring in the time to wear out two other brush heads, that&#x27;s better than 3 months/</li>
            <li> This brush is better than some other Skincare choices.</li>
            <li> The branding on the brush is blurry compared to other brushes I ordered and (3) the inside metal of these immediately stared to rust after 48 hours a sure sign that these are fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can say about toothbrush heads, other than make sure you change them every 3 months as directed.</li>
            <li> We bought the original machine at another store but then they never had these heads back in stock.</li>
            <li> These so not appear to be the same bush/bristle that came with my original EasyClean brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft enough to be gentle to gums but strong enough to clean teeth of food particles and prevent plaque.</li>
            <li> Yes the price sucks but its better than having the dentist dig around in you mouth because your teeth are full of build-up.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of picking the regular instead of the soft (which is what the toothbrush comes with) for my sensitive teeth, but in using these I find it&#x27;s still more comfortable over the manual brush, and they last 3 months.</li>
            <li> I use both my regular toothbrush (just cause I like it) but for keeping your teeth really clean, you need electric.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the compact, standard and Diamond Clean.</li>
            <li> I will be searching for something closer to the diamond clean heads next time.</li>
            <li> Next time I will try the diamond clean</li>
            <li> My teeth did not feel as clean that entire week.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to show the firmness of this product since these are definitely on the soft, soft, soft side of the scale.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to have to purchase a whole new brush system, but thanks to AMAZON I found my replacement brushes cheaper than in the stores.  </li>
            <li> but i just put the last one on and it falls right off!</li>
            <li> better scrubbing between teeth, a problem the previous brushes had that they could not go between teeth very well.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll certainly do an update in a month if these don&#x27;t live up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Each of these heads run for at least 3 months so its still worth the money spent if you are expecting some great cleaning through your sonic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Upon opening these brushes I noticed an immediate difference than the original, normal brush; they seemed softer than the one I had been using on my sonicare for several months.  </li>
            <li> They said that these products are ordered directly from \\&quot;the manufacturer\\&quot; and that I was the first person to claim they were a \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> While I get awesome check ups since I started using the sonic brush, I am bothered that I have been sucked in to a product that is very expensive.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money for sure.</li>
            <li> The blue nyon does not wear in color as the true product does and the nyon comes apart in your mouth as you brush your teeth causing you to swallow or choke.</li>
            <li> I had a 2 month old brush purchased from CVS as a generic and it was more favorable in use than the one week old</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a smaller Brush head than the original which had more bristles, white with the same the two greens</li>
            <li> Pretty soft but does the trick.</li>
            <li> The first two are so soft that after about 5 brushings the bristles are all bent out of shape.</li>
            <li> I was worried at first that these wouldnt last long (some sort of scheme to get you to buy more often)</li>
            <li> Overall not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> None of my original heads nor my first round of replacements wore anywhere near as quickly.</li>
            <li> Would recommend spending a little more to get the real thing from Phillips.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done much better, cheaper, and takes up less counter space.</li>
            <li> So when he pointed out this toothbrush was better than my previous model, I took his advice.</li>
            <li> These brushes are better than my previous set.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> My latest shipment of brush heads seem to have started wearing out faster than previously.</li>
            <li> I went back to a regular toothbrush until I find a better system.</li>
            <li> In the five years since I first bought mine, I have visited the dentist exactly two times a year, for periodic cleaning only.  </li>
            <li> I had another sonic toothbrush with different heads which wore out quite quickly.  </li>
            <li> I guess they must be factory seconds or clever knock-offs.</li>
            <li> The older heads lasted for years.</li>
            <li> A &amp;#34;must have &amp;#34; if you have the Sonicare toothbrush,change brush heads on a regular basis &amp; they last longer &amp; do a better job.</li>
            <li> They fit on the brush head the same as the old ones did.  </li>
            <li> Only think I don&#x27;t like is the indicator changes color too quickly,  I just ignore it.</li>
            <li> Through daily experimentation I was able to find a &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34;, e.g. not-to-loose and not-too-tight fit, but it required careful manipulation while brushing that became too much of a nuisance even for a challenge-seeking, geeky engineer such as myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Upon inspecting the printing used by the authentic product and this one, the type is noticeably different and faded compared to a used actual unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Brushes are very soft and with 2 week of use were ready for replacement.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> High priced for three pieces of Plastic</li>
            <li> The price is still awfully high for a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Philps Sonicare since high school, so I know when &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; brush heads don&#x27;t feel the way they should.</li>
            <li> they have taken a page from the high end razor marketing book.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these and this brushing system to anyone and everyone.  </li>
            <li> Removing the brush, I notice a high amount of rust in the residual water in the brush (from rinsing it off).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> They work fine as expected.</li>
            <li> The brand new brushes are constantly losing their bristles, (from the very first use).  </li>
            <li> I did notice that the brush heads might have started fraying slightly before the original brush heads did but not by any reasonable difference in time to deter me from buying these again!  </li>
            <li> The surface shape makes it easy to clean all surfaces of your teeth, especially the inside surfaces, which I have trouble with.  </li>
            <li> The action is ultrasonic and really cleans.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this morning and can&#x27;t believe how much whiter my teeth look after just a one time use as compared to all the years I had been using a different brand.</li>
            <li> The brushes are exactly what you find on the pharmacy shelves.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re still over-priced, but I&#x27;m at least satisfied that they go my order right.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> The bristles refuse to remain useful after only two brushings.</li>
            <li> Some may want a more firm version, but beware of any gum damage by the firmer version.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> These appear to be the standard Sonicare brush heads, but they have already begun to splinter and spread after 2 weeks worth of use.  </li>
            <li> I say this because the Sonicare brush head should be replaced every three months based on normal use.</li>
            <li> I have the brush and love it since it is not too harsh</li>
            <li> I love the quality of the Philips heads but these seem to not fit as well on my version of the Sonicare even though they are claimed to be 100% compatible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having to see the dentist for a cleaning sooner than I normally do.</li>
            <li> These new brush heads seem to have a little more sonic power than the originals.  </li>
            <li> Perfect, a little slow on delivery, but I knew that when I ordered!</li>
            <li> The new heads are much cheaper than the old Essence style screw on brush heads.</li>
            <li> is much more firm when it&#x27;s new as well as in used condition.</li>
            <li> The brush looked many months old after less than a week.  </li>
            <li> time we will purchase these from a local retailer and strongly advise others to do the same.</li>
            <li> These are the right heads for my toothbrush, but they simply do not stay on the brush.  </li>
            <li> I gave up trying to buy these at the local pharmacy; they&#x27;re locked into a case (theft-prone) and they don&#x27;t always have the right brush for my model.</li>
            <li> The third one wouldn&#x27;t stay on right out of the package.  </li>
            <li> the EXACT SAME item that comes with a brand new brush in a box !</li>
            <li> I would say that I wished the bush head itself was a bit larger, but overall, it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a long time and I loved that I got them a little bit cheaper!</li>
            <li> The two other brushes fit</li>
            <li> To add to the other reviews I&#x27;ve received cheap counterfeit versions.</li>
            <li> I normally get this exact product at CVS/Wegmans, and they last about 6 weeks of normal use.  </li>
            <li> I do not care for Sonicare&#x27;s new brush heads</li>
            <li> New Brush heads are  </li>
            <li> I bought these replacement heads to go with the new electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> When I look over at my new sonicare, it has \\&quot;Sonicare\\&quot; on the brush head.</li>
            <li> I got a notice on Amazon that hey, new version.</li>
            <li> I already had one just needed new heads.</li>
            <li> The brush that came with my new toothbrush shed it&#x27;s bristles.  </li>
            <li> The new brush heads</li>
            <li> We have thrown out those pkgs and have purchaced one new pkg.</li>
            <li> I had a sonicare brush in storage for about a year because I didnt have a charger or new heads..</li>
            <li> I can order these on auto-delivery and always have a new brush at hand.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to use them yet as they are &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34; for my new toothbrush, but they look just like the ones that came with the brush.</li>
            <li> Needed to get new brush heads, this 3 pack lasts me 9 months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would still appreciate a refund or a discount on the new toothbbrush</li>
            <li> I purchased a new Sonicare toothbrush and needed replacement brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps Phillips has lowered the ProResults quality with the introduction of their new brush heads?  </li>
            <li> I just change to a new head every 3 months and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> I wanted a new electric toothbrush and this had what I wanted.</li>
            <li> New condition.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> These used to fit on the handle very smoothly and easily; now the press-fit is really tight and can be difficult to place and remove.  </li>
            <li> They do not snap on/click in like the genuine brush heads, the writing is slightly different, and there is extra model # writing on each head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have bought generic brushes which work, but I do not like the generic brand as well as I like the genuine replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> They fray much too quickly and only last a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the Proresults heads to the smaller heads available because of the larger area.  </li>
            <li> If you love your Sonicare, get the real replacements and DO change them at least every four months.</li>
            <li> These are not real Soniccare heads; they don&#x27;t fit well and the bristles are way too soft.</li>
            <li> MY TEETH ARE ALL CROWNS AND ARE VERY SENSITIVE AND THE VIBRATION SOMETIMES MESSES WIT ME..</li>
            <li> VERY soft.  </li>
            <li> brushes were very old.</li>
            <li> so I are handlepoorly and the bristles are very soft</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and began to show wear after a week, unlike the ones that I purchased at Bed Bath and Beyond (which held up for three months).</li>
            <li> I do feel like the blue bristles that indicate when the brush is worn out change color very fast.</li>
            <li> These heads last a long time and clean your teeth very well.</li>
            <li> The new brush head that I switch out began loosing the blue color on the bristles after the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li> If you have been using Sonicare for a while you would be able to notice the poor quality of these brush heads right away.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and looks like the 3 heads will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Not sure if these are authentic.</li>
            <li> Also, the blue bristles lose it colors within the first week.</li>
            <li> The first brush I attached lasted only two days.  </li>
            <li> Quality refills cheaper &amp; they&#x27;re the same exact thing</li>
            <li> These wear out within 2 weeks and are complete garbage!</li>
            <li> the head unexpectedly pops off!  </li>
            <li> The first one I used was shedding it&#x27;s bristles in my mouth every time I brushed.  </li>
            <li> I even purchased my 5 year old the children&#x27;s version!  </li>
            <li> I, however, received the exact same package that you can buy from the store.</li>
            <li> Not at all the same quality as when you first purchase the brush.</li>
            <li> Upon first use you knew these were not actual Sonicare brush heads.</li>
            <li> Looks like I&#x27;m heading to CVS tomorrow to pay regular price, which is what I didn&#x27;t want to do in the first place.</li>
            <li> but I was under the impression that i was getting these for a &amp;#34;better-than-store&amp;#34; price, but i found them at Target for the exact same price.</li>
            <li> The brushes that came with the original unit, and the ones I have purchased before these, were firm and really transmitted the vibrations from the handle to the teeth.</li>
            <li> I replaced it within a week with another one and the exact same thing happened.</li>
            <li> The price seems a bit higher than the generic brushes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let your toothbrush get too old !</li>
            <li> BUT the price was higher for the same product.  </li>
            <li> The first time I ordered I got the smaller brush head</li>
            <li> Exactly what you can buy at big box stores.</li>
            <li> These heads started shedding plastic strands the first time I used them and constantly thereafter.</li>
            <li> After only two weeks of use, the blue stripe had faded significantly.  </li>
            <li> Pretty standard here.</li>
            <li> My choppers actually felt cleaner and polished after the first use.</li>
            <li> Mine were shipped quickly, arrived early and were real Philips Sonicare Product, not an imitation.</li>
            <li> The first thing was the packaging was obviously not from philips.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not the same quality as the ones which came with the original unit.</li>
            <li> The brushes I received are fakes, it is February 1st and two are already showing signs of wear, not usual for Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> My first brush head (came with the unit) lasted about 5 months...expect the same from these.  </li>
            <li> seem to fit loose on my base...could be a general problem.  </li>
            <li> The bristles have a sturdy feel while still being somewhat soft and not hard on the gums.  </li>
            <li> I remember the older units lasting much longer.</li>
            <li> sonicare is the only brush we&#x27;ve used for several years and now, having had several dentist trips and them saying what a great job of brushing we do, we are firm believers in the product and will be using it for years to come</li>
            <li> Like others who have complained about these, we assumed they were genuine Sonicare brush heads and of the same quality as the original.</li>
            <li> Out with the old and in with the new.</li>
            <li> Had to buy new toothbrush after I could no longer find replacement heads for old electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have had it a long time just doesn&#x27;t go in right</li>
            <li> The same was true of the third brush head in the set.  </li>
            <li> However, I have found that any mechanical device with high speed rotation, you need to put the toothbrush in a good angle; or you may push your gum line way down by repetitive brushing.  </li>
            <li> Buy directly from their site steer clear of this product!</li>
            <li> I tend to use my brush heads for longer than recommended but, even before owning an electric, I&#x27;ve never had a brush head get flat so fast!</li>
            <li> but it seems very strange that my experience shows there is such HUGE variance in product durability.</li>
            <li> I am able to purchase these brush heads for slightly less than at any local store.  </li>
            <li> I have braces so it doesn&#x27;t last more than 2 mons with me (sometimes less)</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t fit the brush as tight as I would like</li>
            <li> The brush heads are tight to fit and can&#x27;t be removed without the brush head pulling apart.  </li>
            <li> They are a PITA to put on and take off the handle because they fit TOO tight.</li>
            <li> The heads don&#x27;t last as long as the original head has.</li>
            <li> The heads were fine for a few uses</li>
            <li> Not only were they much softer, after my brush was complete I spit out brush bristles!  </li>
            <li> Love our Sonicare... hard to find the brushes...</li>
            <li> I do brush hard so a firmer brush head may do more damage but prevents me from push on the toothbrush to shred it in two weeks.</li>
            <li> would warn all Sonicare consumers to stay clear of the HX6013 &amp;#34;pro</li>
            <li> I have read the reviews and in addition I will say that it is not made clear when purchasing this product that this company is based in Europe, and shipped from England.</li>
            <li> Bought from RNTOD and they are clearly counterfeit.  </li>
            <li> Brushes splayed out in less than 2 weeks, and don&#x27;t clean the teeth well.  </li>
            <li> At first, I thought that this was just a minor manufacturer adjustment and proceeded to use the brushes.  </li>
            <li> Bristles completely frayed after one 2 minute use.</li>
            <li> They have the cheapest replacement heads by far.</li>
            <li> Overall, they feel different, don&#x27;t fit as well, not the same quality.</li>
            <li> I was using a regular toothbrush for a while when I was waiting for the replacement heads to come, and these help get my teeth so much cleaner,</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised that they worked so well</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> Brush heads were delivered early..</li>
            <li> So far everything is as advertised.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> But that is not so, and one can tell when one&#x27;s brush is getting on the soft side (not soft-good but soft-lacking resilience).  </li>
            <li> replacing my old Philips Sonicare that I have had for about 10 years.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are way too soft.</li>
            <li> Having trouble finding a UV light sanitizer that holds this size/style of brush head though.</li>
            <li> This is nowhere near the quality of the brushes that came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I purchased a 3 pack of these and the bristles are so soft they literally lose their shape after 2 brushes.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually not convinced this is the real thing.  </li>
            <li> They are completely legit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you want a soft bristle, these are for you, but I should probably have returned thwm.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what makes this pack different that the others I have used, but it really makes me think &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and I like the soft bristles.</li>
            <li> What I received from Amazon is completely identical to this set in all aspects.  </li>
            <li> They suggested I contact Amazon because it could have been an old product.</li>
            <li> contacted Philips directly</li>
            <li> Then after opening the package and putting the brush heads to use on our existing Philips Sonicare ProResults handle, my husband had no issues with his brush head, but mine would not fit securely and stay in place through the brushing cycle.  </li>
            <li> Get them from a real store where you know you&#x27;re getting the actual product.</li>
            <li> 1st brush went soft after 2 days of use.</li>
            <li> I read the description and nowhere here says that the are soft.</li>
            <li> I recently examined my toothbrush because it appeared to lose power and was making unusual noises.</li>
            <li> Very misleading, I got only 2 brush heads instead of 3 in the picture!</li>
            <li> Too soft for my needs</li>
            <li> and so far the bristles don&#x27;t look like they need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> The bristles are far too soft and appear to be wearing out already.</li>
            <li> would appreciate suggestions to find the &#x27;real&#x27; replacement brush heads since I would not like to repeat my earlier research</li>
            <li> Too soft.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this brush head while I use the ultra soft sensitive brush heads</li>
            <li> After 3 days the head looks 2 months old.  </li>
            <li> ) 2 of the 3 heads vibrate off immediately, while the third stays on if you&#x27;re gentle while</li>
            <li> I just requested a refund and repurchased through Amazon directly instead of another vendor.  </li>
            <li> I needed a different head - pay very close attention to the model number in the description because I did not and had to toss these</li>
            <li> The heads are not too soft and not too</li>
            <li> I bought these because they seemed to be direct replacements.  </li>
            <li> I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for several years and never had a brush that wore this fast.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> The bristles are extremely soft and flatten on your teeth.</li>
            <li> After a 2-3 brushings, the color of the bristles is faded considerably and the bristles flare out.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed the bristles were much softer than our prior Sonicare head (from a brick &amp; mortar retailer).</li>
            <li> The old brush, after being used for three months, had one bristle sticking out of its group.</li>
            <li> Last for reasonable amount of time without deteriorating.</li>
            <li> Check into how much you are saving on a potential knock off that is somewhat inferior.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I use this brush since it has a setting for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I checked a few websites and they&#x27;re definitely supposed to say ProResults on the front, so buy at your own risk since quality will likely be off.</li>
            <li> Good brushes but expensive.</li>
            <li> They are expensive but they seem to do a good job.  </li>
            <li> Clearly made in china as knockoffs, not such a big deal when the price is right</li>
            <li> Then, I noticed the pro results printing seemed a little off from the original brushes.</li>
            <li> It is not original product but looks like original.</li>
            <li> The charger is very small and compact and therefore takes up very little room and along with the toothbrush looks beautiful in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Really stiff, hurts my gums and doesnt fit as snug as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> when I used other brushes) and worse, I&#x27;ve had this head fly off the toothbrush</li>
            <li> The bristles flatten and break down amazingly quickly.</li>
            <li> Turns out they wore down so quickly they were unusable.</li>
            <li> Great brush expensive heads!</li>
            <li> this is the first time I can remember ending up with loose bristles in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Love this serious, so does the brush head</li>
            <li> The bristles on the Diamond Clean heads started to splay and fray after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> The larger brush head covers more area, and the slightly stiffer brushes last longer too.</li>
            <li> You have 2 options, use the generic and have a good brush head for 3 weeks and then let your teeth suffer for the next 5 weeks until you realize that its totally ineffective or get the Phillips and have a brush head that will actually last a few months.</li>
            <li> These are a bit pricey but they do last a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li> They looked off as soon as I first opened the box and the blue bristles never wore off, unlike the ones I&#x27;d used earlier.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are a big improvement over the older heads.  </li>
            <li> Well I just replaced the first with the 2nd and this one is seemingly following suit.</li>
            <li> It fits tightly enough to the body so as to transfer decent vibration to the tip.  </li>
            <li> knock off are good on saw blades (Sometimes) not apparently so on tooth brushes, the knock off have harder less flexable and likely slower flexing brissels.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended by my personal dentist.  </li>
            <li> This one has more bristles (a little longer brush head), and I prefer it to the smaller one - not too big for a woman&#x27;s mouth/teeth.</li>
            <li> these ARE NOT authentic Philips Sonicare products; these are cheap knock offs/counterfeits.  </li>
            <li> but I cannot for the life of me get them to look like they do in the photo and fit (they&#x27;re a tad small and don&#x27;t stretch bit a wee bit).</li>
            <li> The bristles were very brittle, and instead of having &amp;#34;give&amp;#34;, they bent at strange angles.  </li>
            <li> work well and as expected and very convenient to order online via Amazon!</li>
            <li> All 3 have done the same thing and not common for Sonicare heads.</li>
            <li> I was exactly what I expected when I ordered them.</li>
            <li> Normally, they last for 2-3 months.  </li>
            <li> packaging was exactly what I would have expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time proponent of third-party, or generic, products - especially when it comes to consumable products that we go through quickly.</li>
            <li> these brush heads are much, much cheaper than the replacements in retail stores in my area (though they are exactly the same product) and the packaging is less fussy.</li>
            <li> We sold 1000&#x27;s of these brush heads over the holidays with very few complaints and those that we did receive, turned out to be unscrupulous individuals looking for a free item, as they never returned the \\&quot;defective\\&quot; item even with a paid return postage label after they were refunded.  </li>
            <li> Seems hard to believe that a big company like Phillips Sonicare would not be able to maintain a uniform quality, so</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a new one.  </li>
            <li> I bought brushes in my local grocery store and they look brand new after 30 days of use.</li>
            <li> Actually, I have not yet used the brush heads since I&#x27;m using the one that came with my new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> So back to Sonicare and the new design.  </li>
            <li> , the next morning, I was surprised to find my toothbrush looking old and worn, as if I had been using it for months and months</li>
            <li> Each brush that I have installed on my Sonicare will last about a month before it starts to generate a very loud noise from the brush when it is on.</li>
            <li> I used to have a major plaque problem on my teeth, dentist recommended this product&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> No regrets!</li>
            <li> I placed the brush head on my sonicare handle, I immediately felt that something was &amp;#34;different.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of the brush head attaching snugly onto the handle, it felt loose, and it pulled out very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked the Phillips site because it has seemed to me that my teeth were not getting as clean as usual (</li>
            <li> I usually like the smaller compact heads for my teeth, but these work fine.  </li>
            <li> Really does not fit my particular toothbrush  - works, but not well.</li>
            <li> Using the new brush head with the firm bristles definitely cleans on a different level and your gums might be a little sore after the first few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has some very competitive prices, even better at a per unit price than when you buy the 6-pack at the bulk warehouse stores.</li>
            <li> As with the ones provided with the initial brush, these heads don&#x27;t fit perfectly onto the base, leaving a very small slot that allows for toothpaste and gunk to build up.</li>
            <li> The blue streak that designates when to use a new head doesnt seem to last very long but the toothbrushes themselves work very well.</li>
            <li> We really like the Sonicare toothbrush and normally would give a high rating, but these heads do not seem like the same quality we have had in years past.</li>
            <li> The fit is much too tight and requires a strong, awkward  grip where the brush head meets the toothbrush to remove.</li>
            <li> In general, Sonicare brushes are over-priced everywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying you should buy your heads here if you can find them cheaper elsewhere, but at least buy genuine Sonicare heads.</li>
            <li> You will either spend less in the long run or not get your teeth as clean.</li>
            <li> It clearly says &#x27;three-pack&#x27; in the description and on the package, but there were only two brush heads in the package.</li>
            <li> Like the font on the brush head and wording is slightly different than my old ones.  </li>
            <li> These are complete utter rubish!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s apparent that some people are getting knock-offs by reading their reviews.</li>
            <li> No such problem with the Proresults heads so far after six weeks.</li>
            <li> The brush heads last far longer than any Proresults brush head I&#x27;ve purchased from anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Philips please go back to your old suppliers or change back to your old bristle design.</li>
            <li> And after brushing my teeth, I feel like I need to pull out a regular old non-electric toothbrush and brush again.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used them twice a day for a week now for the standard two minute cycle, but they look like they are 4 months old.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are way too soft, the individual fibers start separating and falling out.</li>
            <li> &quot; so I expected the \\&quot;real thing\\&quot; and I feel that&#x27;s what I</li>
            <li> I like the product (standard brush head) but received the ultra soft which I don&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li> Apparently can&#x27;t return mistakenly opened package.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive, though.</li>
            <li> Too expensive to have this kind of flaw.  </li>
            <li> Nice small soft brushes that reach into small places in the mouth.  </li>
            <li> I realize that they were economically priced, but there&#x27;s no advantage if I they have to be replaced every few weeks.</li>
            <li> I hope they are able to fix this problem (or maybe it was just my shipment that was poor quality)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not happy that I&#x27;ll have to buy more replacements so soon.</li>
            <li> Quality is high, I find that the heads last for a pretty long time, certainly longer than some traditional toothbrushes I have had in the past.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these were &amp;#34;seconds&amp;#34;, or just old, but something was not quite right with them.  </li>
            <li> I mean it works but there is now a 1/4&amp;#34;gap where it used to fit snugly.</li>
            <li> According to Philips this is the right brash head model.</li>
            <li> These were slightly less expensive than the Sonic web site and were appropriately packaged and quickly delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would still today recommend these brush heads and will be purchasing more very shortly to replace my last set of fraying brush heads that again, have lasted 1 year 8+months and still have at least some life left in them.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the replacement brush head were much softer (too soft) with little body to begin with and have become frayed and misshapen in two weeks.  </li>
            <li> The bristles got all flat and looked like it was four months old.</li>
            <li> Please be advised that sonicare brush heads generally never &amp;#34;Fray&amp;#34; but do when they are extremely old.  </li>
            <li> Package said Phillips Sonicare Pro Results, however doubt these were the real thing since the bristles were too short and flimsy and the plastic part kept hitting my teeth due to these short soft bristles.</li>
            <li> The bristles are the same as on an one-dollar brush - nothing in common with the sharpened ones on a genuine Philips brush.</li>
            <li> Amazon should really make it clear that this is not a genuine product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Phillips just needs to do a better job with these and making them last longer to create less waste and expense.</li>
            <li> These seem to be similar to a soft traditional toothbrush, which was not indicated in the description.</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft and as such, virtually ineffectual in properly cleaning your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put on the first brush head and it only lasted less than two weeks.  </li>
            <li> This product got a four star rating only due to the fact they don&#x27;t fit as snug as my previous brushes.  </li>
            <li> It is still as hard to remove as it was the first time it was mated - this is obviously a subjective observation since I do not own a stress/strain gauge that could be fitted to make actual measurements : )</li>
            <li> I once waited too long, believing that the indicator was supposed to be completely gone before changing the brush out.  </li>
            <li> Then, the bristles started to deteriorate after the first few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are worth no more than fifty cents a piece.  </li>
            <li> good item but very expensive</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the strip that is supposed  to turn white when the brush head is ready to be changed seems to turn white after about a month, but I really don&#x27;t consider this a negative quality</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t fit the Proresults brush - they are way too loose and as a result are not able to vibrate properly.</li>
            <li> A real improvement over previous Philips Sonicaire electric toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> These brushes are more like toothbrushes compared to the small round versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The heads do not fit the Sonicare device, bristles are shorter than other heads and significantly softer.  </li>
            <li> I like these small ones so much better than those lunky big ones from a few years ago.</li>
            <li> Get the Sonimart ones instead; just as good, but way less expensive.</li>
            <li> May sound gross, but at least you know how well they keep up!</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I&#x27;m not sure these are genuine.</li>
            <li> There was a small mix up in the order and it was very, very satisfactorily corrected immediately.</li>
            <li> I actually went with the previous model (not the Diamond Clean) because there&#x27;s so little difference it doesn&#x27;t pay to upgrade.</li>
            <li> I recognized the flimsy cardboard packaging right away, this is commonly how the counterfeit product packages look from China, where I have lived.</li>
            <li> Too narrow and hard, not like the original ones!</li>
            <li> The cut was poorly done on the bristles and the material of the brush was not the same as the original.</li>
            <li> , I noticed that the brush felt extremely &amp;#34;soft,&amp;#34; and I thought maybe I purchased a sensitive brush head by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I used my other brush far longer then 3 months</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft that it becomes matted down after only several weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> First of all, the clam shell packaging from the manufacturer is extremely hard to open.  </li>
            <li> The previous brush heads I&#x27;ve purchased through retailers were long lasting, high quality brush heads that have lasted months.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to try using less pressure (using a new brush head) and allowing the bristles to find its way around my teeth.</li>
            <li> Talk about an irritating way to get your teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> After 1 use (I brush pretty gentle) two bristles are already sticking out and making brushing uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> These things don&#x27;t last long enough for what they charge should be cheaper</li>
            <li> The bristles during the first week immediately looked worse than the old one that I just removed.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on this set of replacement brushes were very soft and flattened out after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this set of replacement brushes were very soft and flattened out after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li> You could actually buy a bigger package, but since I am single, I don&#x27;t need it.  </li>
            <li> , it would be helpful if others with both positive and negative experiences would mention who they bought it from since the seller seems to be changing constantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure why they need to cost so much</li>
            <li> These brush heads last a long time.</li>
            <li> They are long lasting, durable, do not bend, and they do not hurt your gums.</li>
            <li> The bristles on these replacement heads were completely flat after a week.  </li>
            <li> I have used sonicare toothbrush heads for a long time, but the brush heads I bought on amazon were not the same quality.</li>
            <li> The brush heads didn&#x27;t last long at all</li>
            <li> They last a surprisingly long time before needing to be replaced.</li>
            <li> But in order to have extra brush head for my husband it took a long time to be delivered from China.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They do work well but don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The heads last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> last a long time&lt;</li>
            <li> Describe is not clear enough.</li>
            <li> (the other two shook off within the first few seconds) and that one was unbearably noisy.</li>
            <li> They completely broke down within one week.  </li>
            <li> They vibrate right off of the base when using as they don&#x27;t fit snugly enough.</li>
            <li> They do not fit on tightly to my handheld powered unit, slip right off while brushing.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these to replace as custom and after using a few times have felt these to be well worn and too frayed to be considered new brushes.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> It does not seem like it will last very long</li>
            <li> The replacements do not last very long.</li>
            <li> be a bad batch as I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush for many years with no trouble.</li>
            <li> Also, the price for Amazon Prime is nearly 10 bucks less than Walmart in-store.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads easily slide off while brushing, making them almost useless.</li>
            <li> my most recent order of brush heads was a disappointment however.</li>
            <li> Since I would otherwise be using toothbrushes I&#x27;d get for free from my dentist (or relatively inexpensive extras purchased on Amazon.com), the price of these replacements is an unfortunate drawback.  </li>
            <li> After a few very aggravating tries to brush my teeth</li>
            <li> It is an expensive product for what you get, but that seems to be true of Philips in general.  </li>
            <li> Not only did these online brush heads arrive smaller and thinner than expected but, one week after using one of them, it has already started to &amp;</li>
            <li> I received three heads in the same plastic packaging you&#x27;d find in the store, however one of them does not fit correctly and makes extremely loud sounds when the toothbrush is on.</li>
            <li> These lasted only a few days before they were completely worn away.  </li>
            <li> They start off firm and normal, but they get soft and mushy within a few uses.</li>
            <li> It is too soon for us to tell, but it seems likely that this design will have far less problems accumulating internal grit and likely will not go dead because of crud accumulating around the internal magnets.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t seem to fit quite right onto the base.</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads are a very poor replica of the genuine article: The specs are not the same.</li>
            <li> But all the other brushes presently being made by them and on their site as current, are listed as getting off 7X the plaque of handbrushing.  </li>
            <li> Obviously the original parts/extras, however i think these are horrendously expensive for what they are.</li>
            <li> As others have stated, the head slides off the base very easily, and the bristles are way too soft.</li>
            <li> I do not brush hard, and I never had this happen with the REAL Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> then you&#x27;ve probably worn your current brush heads out well beyond when the little blue indicator turned white and the bristles frayed out.</li>
            <li> Perhaps these brushes were counterfeit, perhaps they were just a bad batch from the seller that sold it to me (Amazing Deals Online).</li>
            <li> just what  they family needed to stay healthy after a cold hit everyone.</li>
            <li> At least you know you&#x27;ll be getting the real deal.</li>
            <li> Fake brush heads that don&#x27;t properly fit sonicare.  </li>
            <li> under price the expensive part, and over price the cheap, must replace part.  </li>
            <li> You can find genuine ones on Amazon, but these are fake.</li>
            <li> I also like how the dark blue bristles per brush head change to white when the brush needs to be thrown away.</li>
            <li> A closer inspection of the product description did mention that packaging was damaged but product is unaffected .</li>
            <li> Brush heads wear out long before 3 months.  </li>
            <li> It still worked but didn&#x27;t hold a charge as long.  </li>
            <li> My gums and teeth are not sensitive anymore.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned, a long time user and I have never had that happen.</li>
            <li> now I am stuck with them and I have had them too long to return, I think.</li>
            <li> No surprise, I have been using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of sonicare.</li>
            <li> They are cut strangely.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected but</li>
            <li> Comes with 3 standard proresults snap-on brush heads,  just as expected.  </li>
            <li> After using for several days, I noticed the sleeve had crushed the bristles, making them look like I had used replacement head for 3 months.  </li>
            <li> Never again will I waste my time with the old by-hand version of dental care.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t Hold up as long as those I&#x27;ve purchased elsewhere</li>
            <li> took a long time.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be cancelling for a long time.</li>
            <li> and it was silly to buy a whole new sonic care tooth brush instead of just buying heads for the kids one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The heavy, thick synthetic bristles are coming loose in my mouth causing gagging and trying to spit out a mouth full of bristles.</li>
            <li> Did not last at all like other Sonicare brand heads.  </li>
            <li> I have a Philips Sonicare which I bought from Amazon several years ago--it was recommended by my dentist over other brands.</li>
            <li> God only knows what other shortcuts they took in manufacturing these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Same thing happened with the other two.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Good value, but wish this version came with the different color interchangeable rings at the bottom for other users!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving them 4 stars and not 5 is because the little colored bands you slip on to differentiate between the heads are all various shades of gray.</li>
            <li> They are obviously of substandard materials, probably imitations as other customers have found.</li>
            <li> My experience has been similar to other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> I recommend only going with Amazon purchase and boycotting the other vendors.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know yet if the other  brushes are the same.  </li>
            <li> No problems yet,but have not had it very long.</li>
            <li> Also, it seems to me that they don&#x27;t hold up very long either.</li>
            <li> The third one did not fit properly either.</li>
            <li> I actually used one for a few days and thought that I had not actually replaced my brush head</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that the blue strip fades in a few weeks instead of 3 months.  </li>
            <li> My one complaint with the older &amp;#</li>
            <li> disappointed with the wrong delivery, love the toothbrush though, nothing leaves your teeth quiet as smooth as the sonicare.</li>
            <li> Threw them out and bought new ones at the store since not worth saving a few bucks and end up damaging your teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to think of much to say since this is a replacement for something that should be worn out due to repeated use.</li>
            <li> These brushes do a great job of cleaning my teeth, especially behind my back teeth, where it&#x27;s hard to work a manual brush.</li>
            <li> Generally speaking, the heads are fairly expensive but just based on the results and positive feedbacl from my dentist</li>
            <li> They only reimbursed 50% of cost - Not worth the hassle to chase for the remaining money.</li>
            <li> However, they are pretty expensive for what you get and how long they last.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the other two fit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only a couple here and there, so it&#x27;s manageable, but it&#x27;s not fun when they come out in my mouth while I&#x27;m brushing.</li>
            <li> The heads fall off my toothbrush which is pretty frustrating</li>
            <li> If the loose attachment and poor-quality bristles don&#x27;t bother you, go ahead with the purchase.</li>
            <li> The product says that it snap fits to my toothbrush type (A Phillips Sonicare) but it comes loose.</li>
            <li> , it was loose which contributed to the abrasion.</li>
            <li> I have to inspect them before each use and pull out any loose ones with tweezers to try to avoid this.</li>
            <li> The battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and the brush head was so loose it would fall off during brushing.  </li>
            <li> I came back to write a bad review and noticed how many other people are having issues with these sub par replacements.  </li>
            <li> have since replaced these inferior heads with ones purchased from an on-line competitor of Amazon, and those newer heads are the same ones that I&#x27;ve purchased previously from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The knock offs don&#x27;t last the typical 3 months</li>
            <li> I had to replace my previous Sonicare brush after eight years and upgraded after a couple of months using a standard tooth brush</li>
            <li> I have used these brush heads for only 2 weeks &amp; they have already splayed &amp; lost there blue \\&quot;time to replace\\&quot; color have not had a problem in the past</li>
            <li> I discovered that the metal had corroded and abraded the rubber gaiter around the oscillating spindle; the rubber was black from this abrasion and also split open allowing moisture to enter the sealed unit.</li>
            <li> They are the same ones you would buy at the store, but less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Same heads as you can get in the store but for less money.  </li>
            <li> looks the same with slight difference in lettering.</li>
            <li> My next visit to the dentist showed that I had a lot less plaque to be removed.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t think I was getting a lousy deal because they aren&#x27;t super inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> They come in Sonicare packaging, but you can quickly tell that they are fake by the quality.</li>
            <li> And there are generic knock-offs available here and elsewhere, but they get some pretty bad reviews for poor quality.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is a problem with my Phillips electric toothbrush base or these replacement heads, but I could not get the first head in the pack to stay on the base after one week of use and it would not work as it should, failing to vibrate normally and making a funny sound.  </li>
            <li> I wish they would last a little longer.  </li>
            <li> So mine still works, but if I&#x27;d be a little sleepy or distracted just once, I&#x27;d have the same problem.</li>
            <li> Quality is the same, and they come with the little color rings as that came with the toothbrush etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are highly overpriced and not good quality.</li>
            <li> They are hard to find in the stores and if you do, they&#x27;re quite a bit more expensive.  </li>
            <li> and I used it three times as long!!!</li>
            <li> What a huge, disappointing mistake.  </li>
            <li> Like these because they don&#x27;t have the huge base the old ones had.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that you have to keep pressing the same button 3 times to turn it off.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.</li>
            <li> Not real Phillips Sonicare products.</li>
            <li> but my husband said the last one got a bit mushy after using for a few months?</li>
            <li> Not much else to say, these are the brand name replacement heads</li>
            <li> so you obviously care about your teeth so don&#x27;t waste the benefit of the tooth brush by using crappy heads.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t correct head for my toothbrush, so I returned it minus a restocking charge.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no comparison.</li>
            <li> Delivery was a few days later than promised otherwise the product itself meets my expectations</li>
            <li> From now on, I will pay a few extra dollars and buy my brush heads through a trusted retailer.</li>
            <li> The packaging appeared ligitimate but when you opened the package you could immediately see these were not real sonicare brush heads.</li>
            <li> Just what I had expected.</li>
            <li> After a week the bristles were askew.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I expected a firmer bristle.</li>
            <li> Not real sonicare.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> After a few short days, the bristles are all mashed and scattered.  </li>
            <li> Each head has a few blue bristles that provide you an indication of when it&#x27;s time to replace the head.  </li>
            <li> They are toothbrushes, so not much to say.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not necessarily a fan of their prices, but when ordered using Auto-Shipping/Auto-ordering, one can shave a few pennies off.</li>
            <li> These must be counterfeit because after only a few days the bristles fell out and flattened.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected for 24 dollars.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks the cheaper brush heads would fall off in the middle of brushing.</li>
            <li> The bristles were all askew and there was no firmness to the brush head att all.  </li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really like to see all the unnecessary plastic packaging go</li>
            <li> These are the brushes i wanted and expected.  </li>
            <li> Ironically, I have been ordering these brushes a few times over the last few years, clicking on the same link every-time.</li>
            <li> 2 out of 3 of the brush heads do not fit properly on the Philips Sonicare HX6511/50 toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are not cheap but they are the only ones I will ever use!</li>
            <li> These are NOT real Philips brush heads.</li>
            <li> These are not real philips...</li>
            <li> Not much to say here,</li>
            <li> In all seriousness, its what I expected, saved me from going to the drug store to get, and the delivery was on-time and as promised.</li>
            <li> I had.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes for the sonicare did not last longer than a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Not much else</li>
            <li> The bristles are all starting to curve outward and look ratty after just a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> After a few days of this I came back here and saw the reviews questioning the authenticity.</li>
            <li> I get these on subscribe and save, they always arrive on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> lack of one star is because of the UV not being included when I expected it.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Pro Results&amp;#34; text is off center.</li>
            <li> Performing as expected.</li>
            <li> As the originals I trust, I shall go on buying them until they are discontinued, or, third party supplies are exhausted, or, until the motor dies of old age.  </li>
            <li> I called Sonicare thinking it was a fault with the base, and they kindly sent me a replacement, and I realized it was these inferior replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> I cannopt get to with regular brushes  and used less toothpaste!</li>
            <li> I will never go back to a plain toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> These are too expensive to wear down as quickly as they do.</li>
            <li> crazy expensive, but worth it for clean</li>
            <li> So I scrutinized the two sides of the connection and identified the matching side in the plastic brush for a narrow flat surface on the post of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Since I bought my brush my dentist visits are shorter and there is very limited if any tarter or scraping needed - this product and brush heads is a must have!</li>
            <li> poor quality compared to the real thing,  not worth it</li>
            <li> I am disappointed as the toothbrush heads don&#x27;t seem to fit properly</li>
            <li> This one is better and takes up less space on counter because of smaller base</li>
            <li> The dark blue indicator bristles usually turn white far before the toothbrush begins to look in poor condition.</li>
            <li> The other complaint seems to be the brushes don&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> the only drawback is the price of the new heads are expensive.</li>
            <li> My dentists visits for twice a year cleaning are much less rigorous after having used a sonicare brush for the last few years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used them for less than a week, and the heads are already bad whereas my original one lasted me three months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> I chose 5 stars on this because usually at the grocery store, they sell individually.</li>
            <li> I NEVER purchase any other brush head other from Philips Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Not sure whether or not these are counterfeit, but they&#x27;re definitely of lesser quality.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the other two</li>
            <li> Mine was over due for a changing, but has lasted a year.</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a shot anyway, despite the warnings from other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I got these to replace my other brush heads on my Philips Sonicare DiamondClean toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I should have read the other reviews...</li>
            <li> if I use any other type of toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers may be on to something.</li>
            <li> Quite an item Philips and other makers produce.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the quality is different than others I have had or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought from other vendors</li>
            <li> Not sure if they are actual product</li>
            <li> They advertise they are to last 3 months, but I usually have to change mine before that.  </li>
            <li> These are extremely week brushes.</li>
            <li> Holding my breath to see if the other two will fall apart as well.</li>
            <li> However I will not be buying these again as I&#x27;ve noticed that these brush heads are not quite the same quality as the ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be throwing the other two away.</li>
            <li> The other 2 won&#x27;t stay on the handle.  </li>
            <li> But, other than that, they are brush heads...</li>
            <li> I wish I had read all the other reviews before purchasing.</li>
            <li> and I have bought replacement heads at other stores.  </li>
            <li> ordered these through Amazon, not one of the other retailers Amazon lists.</li>
            <li> Not sure why, but the ProResults heads that I received will not stay on to my Sonicare/Healthy White Handle.</li>
            <li> see my other reviews and PLEASE DON&#x27;T MAKE THE MISTAKE</li>
            <li> They do not fit tight enough though, which is the reason I did not give them 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a drag to have to put down what amounts to $9 or so per replacement toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li> Also, I guess you can use the rings to somewhat stylize your toothbrush instead of using the plain grey rings.</li>
            <li> They turned bad very quickly.</li>
            <li> The packaging is such that you must destroy the packaging to inspect the brush, now I am stuck with three brushes that will not fit.  </li>
            <li> These brush heads do not securely attach to the toothbrush along with the bristles &amp;#34;flattening out&amp;#34; after only a few days use.</li>
            <li> Can not stress enough on the fact that it is a complete FAKE.  </li>
            <li> Amazon should not allow these imitation products to be sold.  </li>
            <li> I cannot believe this seller is well and active at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t fit the Sonicare base properly, so of the three I got in the pack</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t be certain that these aren&#x27;t the &#x27;real deal,&#x27; in a way it doesn&#x27;t matter: if they&#x27;re genuine Philips products then I&#x27;m disappointed with the quality control, if they&#x27;re knockoffs then I&#x27;m disappointed with being mislead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Something is not right.</li>
            <li> Right now I am not happy with either the seller or Amazon, I am a frequent Amazon user and a Prime member, this is the only bad review I have posted.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not right that Amazon is still allowing these brushes to be sold.</li>
            <li> Why such a dramatic difference, when those others also had the same Proresults HX6013 product number?</li>
            <li> It did not feel like the previous brushes I have bought from other sources.  </li>
            <li> The heads seem a bit hard and the blue usage dye doesn&#x27;t appear to work.</li>
            <li> This is our second set of the toothbrushes and at least 6 sets of refills.</li>
            <li> the Sonicare Power Brush, The Dentist can really get expensive it</li>
            <li> /&gt;These Brush Heads usually last at least 2+ months.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m putting a negative review is that I&#x27;ve only been using mine for a week and the brush heads are already worn out.</li>
            <li> With everyday use they last about 90-100 days, and you can get a small discount from Amazon if you sign up for automatic renewal.  </li>
            <li> not worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After you put them on the wrong way only once (barely any resistance to that), they are shot and won&#x27;t hold</li>
            <li> They last at least 6 months though</li>
            <li> These were a waste of money, and last hardly a few weeks!  </li>
            <li> Seems to be a lot of debate if these are fake or the real thing.  </li>
            <li> The brushes I bought in my dentist&#x27;s office always last at least 6 months, with twice a day use, two minutes per use.  </li>
            <li> I really like how well the Sonicare cleans my teeth, but I think it is rediculous how expensive these replacement brush heads are.  </li>
            <li> Love the tooth brush, hate paying being gouged  for the brush heads</li>
            <li> I have used it for about two weeks now and the bristles look worse than the old ones after 12 weeks.</li>
            <li> and it is completely matted and broken down.</li>
            <li> After 2-3 uses, the brushes were breaking down and bending -- It seemed like I had been using the brush for 3 months.  </li>
            <li> After using these brush heads for 2 days I noticed that my mouth was bleeding and that all of the bristles had worn down and started to fall out.</li>
            <li> but it does not snap all the way down.</li>
            <li> The bristles wore down within 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are flimsy and are worn down after one week of use.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE NOT REAL PHILIPS TOOTHBRUSH HEADS!!</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRUST THE OTHER REVIEWS!</li>
            <li> One slid off while brushing, the other took Vise-Grips to remove!</li>
            <li> They fit very tight and I take them off every day because my wife and I use the same base.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I received a bad batch because these seemed to wear our and go flat in the first week.  </li>
            <li> The package is little bit hard to open</li>
            <li> Well I bought them again in the middle of 2014 and the quality has seriously gone down.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended a Sonicare toothbrush to keep my teeth clean, I was having bad problems, and it works.</li>
            <li> they only last for about a month and they are expensive to replace.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reasonable buy - less costly than retail outlets I have checked.</li>
            <li> After getting these saw a six pack at Costco that might work for a lot less. .</li>
            <li> I always hope for less shipping charges but that seems &amp;#34;out of control&amp;#34; for us mortals.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several of the generic ones and they are always lousy .  </li>
            <li> Much less plaque.</li>
            <li> The bristles also seemed shorter and quite a bit softer than my previous (legit) brushes.</li>
            <li> I only wish the larger packs were less expensive per head as I would buy 6-9 heads at once, if that were the case!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have not found Sonicare brush heads for less.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred a slightly softer brush head.</li>
            <li> Had previous model.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not easytto remember when half asleep in teh morning, however.)</li>
            <li> Also, the plastic box is slightly different (the fake box is slightly deeper and narrower, but the length is the same).</li>
            <li> previous set was for upto 1 tooth, this is for upto 2 tooth at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> After less than one week they are no longer staying fastened to the brush.</li>
            <li> Also the Philips logo on the head looks of slightly less quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes are odd.</li>
            <li> This happened to half of what was in the package</li>
            <li> There is something odd about the one brush I am using.  </li>
            <li> A typical Phillips product.</li>
            <li> LESS TIME</li>
            <li> Most likely the worst purchase I have made on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The brush is coming apart after less than a week - bristles falling out and sticking up.</li>
            <li> needed for the sonicare I purchased and a lot less than in store</li>
            <li> Sad to say they are not on the list of vendors from which Amazon is offering this particular product today.</li>
            <li> After having used the product for a couple weeks the bristles have all turned into a mess on two of the heads we use.</li>
            <li> ordered the 4 pack from Amazon and compared them to these, and these are clearly not the same, again either a fake or a defect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the middle of January and the toothbrush is falling off and broken down.</li>
            <li> Other retailers were not able to provide this brush head.</li>
            <li> I rather help the little guy and heck with the Millionaire people.  </li>
            <li> They seemed to be a little cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> When they arrived, I thought the packaging and the font on the brush heads looked a little fishy, but I tried the brush heads thinking maybe Philips had updated their packaging or something.</li>
            <li> The correct version has a little tab just inside the slot where the handle inserts, this holds the brush head on the handle.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll ever buy these on Amazon again after this and reading other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased these in November last year, when I opened the package this year, I found that the bristles were extremely weak.</li>
            <li> One of them had a little divot on the handle and caught on my lip</li>
            <li> a little stiffer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe I am being a little petty, but these did not come packaged like the photo.</li>
            <li> And the little color coded rings...</li>
            <li> Little pricey but cheaper than stores.</li>
            <li> Buying here is a little cheaper than store.</li>
            <li> but the heads are a little pricey if you ask me.  </li>
            <li> I wish they were just a little cheaper.  </li>
            <li> After a little investigation, this brush heads doesn&#x27;t  feel like the orig.</li>
            <li> Literally, it took no more than 3-4 days and the bristles were worn down so drastically that it looked as if I took a scissor and cut the bristles in half.</li>
            <li> They have a different (worse) feel than other Proresults Brush Heads I&#x27;ve purchased from grocery stores in the past.</li>
            <li> This version doesn&#x27;t have that little tab and after a few seconds of use falls off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually take advertising too seriously, but this is a big difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loose bristles, and the usual fading ones don&#x27;t fade!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and went back to BB&amp;B to purchase my next set pf replacements (even if they are a bit more expensive.)</li>
            <li> did not open the box, but I can see through the plastic that bristles in the fake box are uneven and some are not straight.</li>
            <li> Almost immediately the metal ring at the bottom where it mounts onto the handle started rusting, and from the start the heads never fit snugly onto the handle as they should.</li>
            <li> The bristles started to fall out after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I have been using them for a few weeks now without issue.</li>
            <li> The brush heads were not genuine...</li>
            <li> I dislike this product because it&#x27;s not fit on me brush.</li>
            <li> A few uses, noticeable fading.</li>
            <li> so it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Purchased 2 packs a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> and I wish I had because it would have saved me the trouble of ordering this item.</li>
            <li> Been using  for a few years and plan to continue.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and when I threw it away it was still firm and intacked.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> What a waste of $$$$-</li>
            <li> They are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this product and it did not fit the model of the toothbrush</li>
            <li> not a genuine sonicare product.</li>
            <li> fits and works for a few weeks before the brush heads are toast.</li>
            <li> and I have been using it for a few years now.</li>
            <li> The set I got had a lot of unevenly cut bristles and seemed to wear out noticeably quicker than the ones I&#x27;ve bought at a retail store like Target.  </li>
            <li> They were not cheap (comparable to a discount price at Costco).</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re obviously not genuine.</li>
            <li> I am so annoyed, as I did not open these and make this discovery until after my return policy window had expired.</li>
            <li> They din&#x27;t stay on the brush and were a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> Did not fit my toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> they do not fit my brush</li>
            <li> The heads do not fit well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few uses there were all mushed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These bristles have a few bristles which are colored which is designed to wear off as a reminder to replace the brush head but</li>
            <li> Might as well order them here and save yourself the trouble.  </li>
            <li> They do not fit my Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush model HX6930,</li>
            <li> but they just fell off, a waste of my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have given it 3 stars, since the two I got are just what I ordered, but I took away one star for the missing brush head.  </li>
            <li> The problem is that there is a piece missing in these heads that holds them on the handle.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> doesnt fade until a few months of usage.  </li>
            <li> They wore out in a few days.  </li>
            <li> If this is counterfeit, someone went through a lot of expense and trouble to make the packaging look legitimate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine is a Flexcare purchased on Amazon and these brush heads did not fit my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It was annoying, especially when you consider how much each brush head</li>
            <li> First of all the brush head base does not slide on to the toothbrush tightly and is loose.</li>
            <li> Not sure why someone would want toothbrushes that were subject to insects, vermin dust and whatever they would encounter in the warehouse or in transit</li>
            <li> Each brush lasted less than a week!</li>
            <li> It has been less than a month and the brush has excessively frayed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These were not significantly less expensive</li>
            <li> The bristles are really stiff this time.</li>
            <li> I like the small toothbrush heads which allow me reach tight areas and brush the gums well.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, they lose their shape and are not very effective.  </li>
            <li> After only ONE use, the bristles are mashed down, and therefore useless for brushing.  </li>
            <li> NOT true Philips!</li>
            <li> And they each have little rings ( not sure what to do with those though).</li>
            <li> Thinking it might just be a bad brush, I tried a second one, only to find out it is the same poor quality.  </li>
            <li> Something is wrong with these, they only lasted a few days and now the bristles are completely flattened and useless.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the part number HX6013 a few times over the past two years for my Phillips Sonicare HX6930.  </li>
            <li> that it doesn&#x27;t leave your gums raw and tender.</li>
            <li> After a bad experience with generic brush heads for a different electric toothbrush, I decided to stick with the brand name.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get all gunked up with black icky stuff.</li>
            <li> These are not authentic Philips brush heads.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not sure about the quality of the brushes itself.  </li>
            <li> Why would you purchase an expensive toothbrush (relatively speaking) and use a cheaper replacement?  </li>
            <li> only conclusion is that these must be fake counterfeit black-market copies.  </li>
            <li> While these come in the correct packaging, the brushes themselves are not authentic.</li>
            <li> I usually look for another product then reluctantly buy Philips.</li>
            <li> Also, on a small bonus note - it came with color rings so that we can tell who&#x27;s is who&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> small crevices.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t look at the recent reviews for the item</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m not sure about he quality.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding these brush heads lately.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if they&#x27;ll still replace it.</li>
            <li> These arrived as usual in the retail package.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with the quality at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I was sent the small travel size brush heads.  </li>
            <li> It was a small, micro brush head.  </li>
            <li> If you can compare two boxes, one from GeekTrans (it&#x27;d be possible that they even do not know it is fake)</li>
            <li> Included are three heads for the Philips Sonicare Proresults toothbrush, each including a small plastic head protector.</li>
            <li> I did not know how these Sonicare brushes would fit, but I was fearful for no reason at all.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> It works perfectly as usually.</li>
            <li> I am to lazy to return</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like buying ink cartridges for a printer - expensive but necessary.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush head, it works like a brush head, not much more can be said about that.</li>
            <li> I am trying to get replacements and the store says, they are not able to send to my address,</li>
            <li> was not pleased at all with either product.</li>
            <li> I have never had problems in the past when buying these elsewhere.</li>
            <li> These brushes were worn out within 2 weeks (versus the usual 2 months I get with Philips Sonicare brushes before replacement).</li>
            <li> These are not authentic sonicare brush heads.  </li>
            <li> These are expensive and really on a last about three weeks.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are completely FAKE and potentially UNSAFE.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t recall if they were &#x27;fulfilled by Amazon&#x27; or not, and I&#x27;m past the return window by one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never bite or chew them and don&#x27;t apply excessive pressure, this hasn&#x27;t been a problem before.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> The worn out bristles don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re scrubbing my teeth as hard as they are not as stiff.</li>
            <li> They have a small 7 digit number at the base of the stem where it connects that I never had with previous heads (which may or may not mean anything).  </li>
            <li> they come with different color rings to change on the bases so you can share the base unit among different people.</li>
            <li> Not very good.</li>
            <li> They came in a really difficult, hard to cut open hard plastic sealed up cover.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that we have ordered this product from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;First there is RUST coming from the metal parts within the base of the Brush Head.</li>
            <li> Feels cheap, the printing on the heads look fake and overall it is a terrible</li>
            <li> Usually that&#x27;s when the indicator loses all its color.</li>
            <li> The metal ferrule at the base of the brush head should have been stainless steel; it was not!</li>
            <li> I have purchased a lot of brushes over the past few years these brushes are of terrible construction, in my opinion they cannot be true Sonicare brushes</li>
            <li> Not easy for small, weak hands.  </li>
            <li> I wish the replacement heads were a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> Not sure how these could be fake or counterfeit as other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not too hard and they don&#x27;t hurt my gums.</li>
            <li> Not too hard on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Major major ripoff with some of the worst quality in a product I have ever seen.  </li>
            <li> Does Amazon make it so hard to change a product description that vendors can&#x27;t reflect those changes in a timely manner?  </li>
            <li> and they were hard to push on and sometimes just fell off.</li>
            <li> These heads are surprisingly hard and inflexible and are not comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> my hygienist gave me the ultimatum, &amp;#34;switch from manual toothbrushes, even soft heads or get painful gum surgery&amp;#34; so I did.  </li>
            <li> This will make me wary of ever buying from unknown sources.</li>
            <li> It is not too late to return the defective brush.</li>
            <li> You can tell from the shoddy logo paint-job, and the fact that the head wore out after a week.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the Sonicare but after using 6 months, went to the dentist and had absolutely no tartar on my teeth.</li>
            <li> As in, the brush loses it&#x27;s stiffnesss</li>
            <li> If I do not keep pressure on the head it will vibrate straight off, which makes it annoying to use on the softer brush settings.</li>
            <li> You save a few bucks, yes, but do you really want to brush your teeth with some poor quality crap made somewhere</li>
            <li> The head is slowly falling apart each time I brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The whole transaction to buy a Phillips unit and the replacement brush heads was very distasteful!</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews, I was wary of purchasing these</li>
            <li> I mean, they make you break out in a sweat.</li>
            <li> Be true to your teeth or they will be false to you!!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not good to brush hard.</li>
            <li> And, with the ubiquitous BB&amp;B 20% off coupon and Sonicare&#x27;s mail-in-rebate, they ended up being less expensive than the ones I bought on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> they are clearly fake, imitation knock offs!</li>
            <li> BUT LESS EXPENSIVE.</li>
            <li> After a half dozen uses, the brush bristles start falling out and brushes become useless.  </li>
            <li> I ordered some knock-off replacements because they were much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thoroughly disgusted with Amazon and their lax policies which allow scumbag sellers like \\&quot;RNTOD\\&quot; get away with selling knockoffs that are blatantly advertised as authentic.</li>
            <li> Over $10.00 is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me I purchased at the same time as I I purchased my brushing unit and tucked away until needed, now the return window has closed. :-(</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is the price of these brush heads.</li>
            <li> They will last about three brushings before they begin to fall apart, and will leave a bad taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Not a good quality product or value.</li>
            <li> So it not a good indication of when the brush needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Super annoying and a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Came in the Phillips annoying packaging that is hard to open just like you see in stores.</li>
            <li> I go through these faster than i&#x27;m supposed to (I know, I know, don&#x27;t press so hard!</li>
            <li> Either I got a bad one, they&#x27;ve lowered the quality considerably, or this product is fake.</li>
            <li> If one tries to remove the brush head by pulling on the neck it separates into two pieces leaving the brush had base remaining firmly attached to the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> They took the metal tip of my toothbrush base right out of the base they were soo tight.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite disappointed as only one weeks use looks like the use of a brush head used (and frayed) for six months!</li>
            <li> Not sure what is wrong with them...</li>
            <li> Next: Dealing with the 8 that are coming from Groupon :(</li>
            <li> They are expensive, probably excessively so.  </li>
            <li> The worst part is they fit very loosely on the base.</li>
            <li> These brushes were weak and fell apart after a week of using them.</li>
            <li> Duh!</li>
            <li> I bought an extra set for my mom, and found out these heads aren&#x27;t compatible with her Sonicare base unit.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> , quality is poor and the bottom line:  </li>
            <li> I am not happy.  </li>
            <li> And it was too late to get a refund or return by the time I used them..which I find to be unfair.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how poor the quality of these become.  </li>
            <li> Annoyed by the hassle.</li>
            <li> Alas, I cannot leave zero stars.</li>
            <li> You may find some generic ones that are 3/$10, but don&#x27;t bother with that crap.</li>
            <li> It fits so poorly that everytime</li>
            <li> Poor Quality.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m really annoyed</li>
            <li> The thin, flimsy bristles did not stand up to one brushing before looking like they&#x27;ve been used for months.</li>
            <li> The brush head fitted poorly and did not snap on</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brushes basically fall apart after only a couple of uses, so they are completely worthless.</li>
            <li> brushes are too thin and too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This item is good,but the package is poor.</li>
            <li> Out of my last two 3-packs, 4 out of 6 brush heads shed alarming quantities of bristles in my mouth while in use, which is both uncomfortable and disgusting.</li>
            <li> I only had one that would even stay on the base when it was turned on</li>
            <li> Or is this an intentional rip-off?</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> everything else is superfilous  and unnecessary verbage end of discussion.</li>
            <li> The quality is so poor, I have thrown them away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was just a bad batch or what, but for the price, that&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> After less than three week&#x27;s use, the brush head, was in really bad shape.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very disappointed so far.</li>
            <li> I am annoyed by expensive mistake; my $120 dollar toothbrush is ruined as a result.</li>
            <li> They are a bit pricey, but I was fearful to try a generic brush.  </li>
            <li> The other really annoying problem is that the heads will not stay snapped into the brush like they should, so while you are brushing your teeth (toothbrush is on and vibrating)</li>
            <li> These come with the colored bands and plastic protective caps so that you can protect your brush and keep them sorted if you share a brush base with other people.</li>
            <li> I hate going to bed bath and beyond for replacement heads because I end up buying other stuff I didn&#x27;t intend to buy.</li>
            <li> Ordered with little apprehension and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money :(</li>
            <li> What I hate is the fact that I have to search and search to find the brushes for a price that is slightly lower than the manufacturers&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive though.....</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> So, turned out, they are quite expensive for couple of months brushing teeth.</li>
            <li> The replacement brush heads are quite expensive, that is unless you buy them through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Expensive and not practical.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced this before with any replacement brushes!</li>
            <li> Satisfactory but expensive.</li>
            <li> Sad that Sonicare&#x27;s page redirects to this reseller.  </li>
            <li> These seem to me to be fake.</li>
            <li> So I was skeptical and used up my supply before trying these.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> , the serial number on the head looms completely fake.</li>
            <li> These must be fake knock offs.</li>
            <li> This is fake brush.</li>
            <li> Sorry, after I opened the package and try to put your head on my  machine, I found the style is wrong.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> As it turns out these are fake brush heads, wore out after just 2 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> After one week of use, the brush was worn out and unable to use anymore.</li>
            <li> Are they fake or issue with quality control?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but that&#x27;s what you get when you want to buy a electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because they were the cheapest that still seemed unlikely to be fakes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is wrong with these, but they frayed and were useless after a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless, if you&#x27;re concerned about getting a fake, don&#x27;t worry with these.</li>
            <li> Might be nothing, but makes me wonder if they&#x27;re fake.</li>
            <li> The bristles got matted and useless within a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> They completely failed within 2-3 days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon</li>
            <li> Absolutely fake.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, sometimes you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> These are knock offs and have proved to be completely useless.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> These heads are FAKE.  </li>
            <li> After one use, the brush was useless.  </li>
            <li> I believe these are fake Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wrong item-returned it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was one of the \\&quot;Miss\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this problem with these heads before, so maybe these are discount because they failed QC or something.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they&#x27;re fake.  </li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll swear to you that there is something wrong with these brushes.</li>
            <li> but they are useless.</li>
            <li> Something is wrong here.</li>
            <li> the wrong way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If these toothbrush heads are made by Philips, it appears their quality is questionable.</li>
            <li> These have got to be knock- off, fake, replicas of Philips Sonicare brush heads.</li>
            <li> Sorry we didn&#x27;t make the switch sooner.</li>
            <li> They are so expensive that I am not using them.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this brand if I had known the brushes would put me in the poor house!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.  </li>
            <li> Very poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> The head would come off the bottom base before actually coming off the Flexcare base.  </li>
            <li> I had to hold the base with one hand and hold the brush onto the base with the other.  </li>
            <li> The previous pack was horrible.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Now I am afraid to reorder even it says Philips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong heads :(</li>
            <li> The brushes can be very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are very expensive anywhere where one goes.</li>
            <li> These heads are borderline impossible to get off.  </li>
            <li> They are bad fakes too.</li>
            <li> Bad product.</li>
            <li> My bad...</li>
            <li> What can I say bad about them?  </li>
            <li> Was hesitant to buy these because of some bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS SO BAD.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch, but I&#x27;m having a problem with these where the bristles keep coming out.</li>
            <li> Or like I said, maybe I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> maybe I just got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if this was a bad batch or</li>
            <li> This must be a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Really bad, knockoff  item</li>
            <li> These were worse than terrible.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this purchase.  </li>
            <li> EXTREMELY disappointed.</li>
            <li> They are obviously fake Philips tooth brush head, VERY VERY BAD quality!</li>
            <li> Ridiculously disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed-</li>
            <li> The reasons: (1)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased off-brand toothbrush heads before to save money and was sorely disappointed in the outcome.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Either Phillips just started making crap or these are knockoff brushes :(</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this batch of toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> We are very unhappy with the two packages of three heads we were sent.  </li>
            <li> What has the world come to when you are making fake toothbrushes!!</li>
            <li> It is a piece of crap.  </li>
            <li> Even if you place the head on and hold it in your hand and turn on the tooth brush you can see the head vibrating up and off the base unit.  </li>
            <li> base unit comes with a 2 year warranty so save your receipt.  </li>
            <li> I just used the warranty when my base unit stopped working after about 13 months.  </li>
            <li> yet I have to use a towel to grip the brush head base in order to remove this after each use -</li>
            <li> Base will not stay on with one.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re definitely crap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that this fraudulent commerce goes on under the roof of Amazon!</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed!</li>
            <li> My husband and I ordered these as replacement heads for our toothbrush, and we were very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed that amazon would have this product on there site.</li>
            <li> so am very disappointed</li>
            <li> Very disappointed...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I think these are knock offs.  Did not last at all like other Sonicare brand heads.  Don&#x27;t buy these.  Buy the smaller heads on Amazon as they are definitely a genuine Philips product.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> Great price and of course the product is outstanding.</li>
            <li> used one twice and I already need to replace it. A real piece of garbage!</li>
            <li> I ordered this Easy Clean Rechargeable toothbrush on 5/23/2013 and it arrived well packed on 5/28/2013.  This was also during a holiday weekend.  I never used Sonicare before and purchased this Easy Clean version based on the customer reviews I had read here plus I wanted a toothbrush to be basically white in color to fit in with my bathroom decor.  I charged the toothbrush overnight as per the user&#x27;s manual which is also well written and easily understandable.  I used it for the first time this morning and can&#x27;t believe how much whiter my teeth look after just a one time use as compared to all the years I had been using a different brand. (Conair Interplak).  The charger is very small and compact and therefore takes up very little room and along with the toothbrush looks beautiful in my bathroom.  I am now a loyal customer of Sonicare for life and highly recommend buying this item.  I also combined my order by purchasing 3 additional brush heads.</li>
            <li> There is one thing we haven&#x27;t liked about the Sonicare. The brushes can be very difficult to remove. Indeed, we were ready to replace the device until these brushes came. They fit perfectly. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Great price for these.  I will shop here again.  Thank you for selling the authentic product.  Love those clean teeth</li>
            <li> They fit and work well. Durable is good. Only issue is that they cost more than I believe they should. Probably still worth it considering how many toothbrushes you&#x27;d go through instead and that the Sonicare is exceptional as a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Good buy for the money.  A+</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare a lot, so I keep buying the heads. They last for a couple of months, yo.</li>
            <li> ...in fact I stood in the toothbrush aisle while I ordered these from Amazon! Make sure you match up your model correctly though. I bought an extra set for my mom, and found out these heads aren&#x27;t compatible with her Sonicare base unit. Oh well, we&#x27;ve now got extras.</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive though.....they only last for about a month and they are expensive to replace. But this is the only good brush for proper plaque removal.</li>
            <li> I have bought these several times and they hold up fairly well and work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable buy - less costly than retail outlets I have checked.</li>
            <li> I have a Philips Sonicare which I bought from Amazon several years ago--it was recommended by my dentist over other brands. These are just refills--and I use it daily. Really does a great job cleaning my teeth and making them feel slick and look shiny.</li>
            <li> I bought my Sonicare toothbrush from my dentist and couldn&#x27;t find replacement brush heads that said they fit that particular model even on the Philips website. These brush heads fit the HX6530 perfectly.</li>
            <li> I recognized the flimsy cardboard packaging right away, this is commonly how the counterfeit product packages look from China, where I have lived. Words on brushhead blurry as another commenter mentioned. Internal metal seems cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THESE. Not work few bucks you save from real thing at local store!!</li>
            <li> This is the third time I have ordered these brushes.  I have examined the packaging thoroughly and I am convinced that these are the real thing. The brushes work fine.  I change them every three months as recommended on the packaging.  There is nothing wrong with this product. They fit Sonicare HX6710 which I also bought from Amazon.  I don&#x27;t know what is with the unfavorable reviews.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE NOT REAL PHILIPS TOOTHBRUSH HEADS!! i bought these because  they seemed like a good deal but don&#x27;t be fooled....these aren&#x27;t the real deal. poor quality compared to the real thing,  not worth it</li>
            <li> Rusted first week used. Will not recommend. I purchased real ones from Target and you can see a difference in the bottom.</li>
            <li> Sonicare toothbrush and replacement heads are terrific!  I used to have a major plaque problem on my teeth, dentist recommended this product&lt;br /&gt;and my teeth are so much better!  Removes over 80% plaque, stains in between dentist office cleanings.</li>
            <li> Good brush heads, but start to slip off of my toothbrush after 5 days of using. I have to replace them in a couple of weeks instead of 3 months, they just could not stay on the brush. So, turned out, they are quite expensive for couple of months brushing teeth.</li>
            <li> I really like the way that these brush heads are made, but I feel that they are a bit over-priced..</li>
            <li> I love the Philips Sonicare tooth brush ultrasonic system.  The replacement brush heads are quite expensive, that is unless you buy them through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied with the job those brushes do and would recommend it to a friend.  Thanks  very much</li>
            <li> This tooth brush is so cool. I&#x27;ve had other tooth brushes. This makes your mouth shine. Try it out and you will be getting one for your self.</li>
            <li> The brushes are exactly what you find on the pharmacy shelves.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re still over-priced, but I&#x27;m at least satisfied that they go my order right.&lt;br /&gt;Last time I ordered they charged me for three brushes but only sent two.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Amazon one more time on this item -- this time I got all three.</li>
            <li> These are NOT Philips products, they are cheap counterfeit brushes that are rubbish. Amazon should be ashamed of selling such a product.</li>
            <li> Great product, quick shipment.</li>
            <li> Package said Phillips Sonicare Pro Results, however doubt these were the real thing since the bristles were too short and flimsy and the plastic part kept hitting my teeth due to these short soft bristles. Threw them out and bought new ones at the store since not worth saving a few bucks and end up damaging your teeth. I&#x27;ve been using this model toothbrush for over 7 years so have an idea on what to expect with replacement heads and these were a real disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The ones I bought at the store say Phillips Sonicare on the brush heads. These just say \\&quot;Proresults\\&quot; like in the picture. Although the outer package says Phillips I&#x27;m sure the actual brushes are fakes.</li>
            <li> Love my Phillips Skincare tooth brush.  The new heads make my teeth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, it is worth buying</li>
            <li> Look nice but didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li> This is counterfeit product. It ended up ruining my sonic. Do NOT Buy!!!!!</li>
            <li> Came as a two pack instead of a three pack. Wasn&#x27;t informed prior to sending it to me. Not happy.</li>
            <li> As a dental hygienist, I am picky about brush heads.  I do not care for Sonicare&#x27;s new brush heads because they do no adapt to the tooth as well as these do.  5 stars for these!  I definitely notice the cleaner feeling when I brush with these vs their newer heads.</li>
            <li> Brush heads. They fit my sonicare. They brush my teeth. Excellent work.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t fit the brush as tight as I would like and you have to change the head every month.  Expensive and not practical.  I went back to a regular toothbrush until I find a better system.</li>
            <li> Love the Sonicare and love its brushes!</li>
            <li> Not sure if these are authentic. They have a different (worse) feel than other Proresults Brush Heads I&#x27;ve purchased from grocery stores in the past.</li>
            <li> These toothbrush replacements were terrible. I&#x27;ve never experienced this before with any replacement brushes! The brissles kept falling out and I could only use it for a week because it didn&#x27;t feel like it was actually working.</li>
            <li> Excellent pricing and quality!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product from Amazon for the past four years, and until my most recent purchase, I have loved it.  However, the brush heads I received in my latest purchase were definitely different.  The bristles were softer, and the imprinting on the shaft of the brush was different from before.  At first, I thought that this was just a minor manufacturer adjustment and proceeded to use the brushes.  Then, the bristles started to deteriorate after the first few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous brush heads lasted a good three or four months before I replaced them.  After one week, though, these brush heads looked like I had been using them for three or four months.  My wife independently came to the same conclusion that I did: these brush heads must now be manufactured by someone who has created a cheap knock-off that functions nothing like the original product did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since replaced these inferior heads with ones purchased from an on-line competitor of Amazon, and those newer heads are the same ones that I&#x27;ve purchased previously from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the original manufacturer&#x27;s brush heads, I easily give out a five-star rating.  For the ones I received in my most recent Amazon order, however, I&#x27;d like to give zero stars.  Caveat emptor.</li>
            <li> They sure are toothbrushes</li>
            <li> Excellent brush heads.</li>
            <li> Received cheap copies from seller RNTOD. Bristles completely frayed after one 2 minute use. They only reimbursed 50% of cost - Not worth the hassle to chase for the remaining money.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Does what is says it does.</li>
            <li> The ones that are sold by zaggydoo are FAKE!!! These are not authentic Philips brush heads. I&#x27;ve only used them for less than a week, and the heads are already bad whereas my original one lasted me three months.</li>
            <li> These &#x27;ProResults&#x27; toothbrushes are likely fakes. Almost immediately the metal ring at the bottom where it mounts onto the handle started rusting, and from the start the heads never fit snugly onto the handle as they should. I called Philips Customer Service and they confirmed that the legitimate Philips brush heads should not suffer from these issues. God only knows what other shortcuts they took in manufacturing these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick to the real thing.</li>
            <li> Counterfeit - not the real deal.  You can tell immediately that these are substandard.  Don&#x27;t order.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Genuine quality at a great price!</li>
            <li> The Phillips Sonicare toothbrush is a proven, outstanding way to avoid dental bills.  In the five years since I first bought mine, I have visited the dentist exactly two times a year, for periodic cleaning only.  The brush heads are available in small and large sizes, both of which are useful in their own way.  I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I purchased through Amazon and the brushes came in packaging like you can purchase at your local Walmart, etc.  It fits perfectly on my sonicare.  However, I&#x27;m not sure about the quality of the brushes itself.  The head brush does not keep it&#x27;s form.  And after 2 weeks, the bristles are all over the place and I need to replace it.  Also, the blue bristles lose it colors within the first week.</li>
            <li> Just needed some more replacement heads for my sonicare, what more can I say, not much to report on it.</li>
            <li> They clean my teeth well.</li>
            <li> Great service great price</li>
            <li> Good brushes but expensive. After getting these saw a six pack at Costco that might work for a lot less. .</li>
            <li> I love it, my dentist loves it!</li>
            <li> Not much to say. They&#x27;re replacement heads for the Sonicare electronic toothbrush. I actually went with the previous model (not the Diamond Clean) because there&#x27;s so little difference it doesn&#x27;t pay to upgrade. These heads work just find and clean the teeth and gums well. No complaints.</li>
            <li> They work as advertised and we continue to order refills.This is our second set of the toothbrushes and at least 6 sets of refills.</li>
            <li> I was happy with my Sonicare brush replacement heads. Having them delivered to my home was convenient and quick. The quality of the product met my expectations and I will definitely order them again.</li>
            <li> Love my sonicare toothbrush and you will obviously need these to go with them. They have the cheapest replacement heads by far.</li>
            <li> The bristles flatten and break down amazingly quickly. Not a good quality product or value.</li>
            <li> The bristles always make my teeth feel extra clean!</li>
            <li> I believe that these are counterfeit.  I have no problem with trying out generics, but this comes in Philips packaging and presents itself as the real thing.  This is much more cheaply made than my known Philips brush heads.</li>
            <li> The product was just as described. Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> very good i use it all the time now</li>
            <li> The heads don&#x27;t last as long as the original head has. I have used the replacement head and it lasted three weeks and should last three months! The original head looks and is in better shape than the replacement head and I used it three times as long!!!</li>
            <li> High priced for three pieces of Plastic but they are very good replacement brushed fort the Sonicare Power Brush, The Dentist can really get expensive it you don&#x27;t use them that&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;  They fit well and are very good quality. would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> My original brush lasted 6 months with no problem.  The ones I bought here didn&#x27;t make it one month.  Refund requested.</li>
            <li> As good as the brushes that came with the toothbrushes. Don&#x27;t get caught up wasting all your time reading reviews on these (like I did), just buy them. They&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> Glad I bought the Philips Sonicare.  First had to get used to it, as well as my husband.  But now he also loves it too.</li>
            <li> I always hope for less shipping charges but that seems &amp;#34;out of control&amp;#34; for us mortals.  I was extremely pleased with finding the product and will be happy if this continues to be available.  Other retailers were not able to provide this brush head.</li>
            <li> NOT true Philips! I bought these July 2014.I just opened the pack this week. The head keeps coming off, the bristles come out. Horrible quality. Not the Philips heads that I bought at Kohls when I bought the Sonicare Flexcare. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised, good price, delivered on time</li>
            <li> I chose 5 stars on this because usually at the grocery store, they sell individually. this is a bargain by and the fact that they fit a long line of sonicaire models makes it even better, will reorder in the future fast shipping</li>
            <li> Not a dentist, so have no way of judging how good a job it is actually doing.  Got three for the price on one in pharmacy.</li>
            <li> As advertised and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I had another sonic toothbrush with different heads which wore out quite quickly.  These don&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the toothbrush and heads.  They are hard to find in the stores and if you do, they&#x27;re quite a bit more expensive.  I&#x27;m so glad Amazon carries them.</li>
            <li> New Brush heads are  just what  they family needed to stay healthy after a cold hit everyone. Out with the old and in with the new.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Did everything they were supposed to do. Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a long time and I loved that I got them a little bit cheaper! Thanks</li>
            <li> Satisfactory but expensive.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt these are counterfit.  The bristles started to fall out after a few uses.  Sad that Sonicare&#x27;s page redirects to this reseller.  I&#x27;m going to purchase ones from Bed Bath Beyond for comparison.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for a few months now and they deliver what they are made for, the quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> Somehow the quality of these Sonicare replacement brushes took a noticeable downward slide. The bristles refuse to remain useful after only two brushings. Quite perturbing. The bristles become flimsy and ragged almost immediately. They are now cheaply manufactured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would behove Sonicare to take these replacement brushes off the market. To continue marketing these brushes is to erode Sonicare&#x27;s reputation of manufacturing a quality and durable oral hygiene product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would warn all Sonicare consumers to stay clear of the HX6013 &amp;#34;pro results brush head replacements.</li>
            <li> Compare them to the toothbrush head that came with your toothbrush. They&#x27;re not quite the same. The \\&quot;Pro Results\\&quot; print doesn&#x27;t look authentic, for example. Overall, they feel different, don&#x27;t fit as well, not the same quality. I&#x27;ll be returning them if I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: after requesting a refund through Amazon, the China-based seller promptly responded and offered a full refund.  They said that these products are ordered directly from \\&quot;the manufacturer\\&quot; and that I was the first person to claim they were a \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot;.  You be the judge, but I will say that they were very prompt in responding to my request for a refund and credited it that day.  So, responsive customer service adds a star to my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I purchased the same set from Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond and compared the two side-by-side.  The bristles are different (BB&amp;B purchase had a softer feel and was cut differently).  The BB&amp;B product (which I am assuming to be the legit Sonicare product) feels much better on my teeth and gums.  And, with the ubiquitous BB&amp;B 20% off coupon and Sonicare&#x27;s mail-in-rebate, they ended up being less expensive than the ones I bought on Amazon.  Again, I give credit to the China-based company for responding quickly to my concerns and allowing me a full refund no questions asked.</li>
            <li> As advertised, god fit on end of toothbrush head, comfortable to use, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I had difficulties with an earlier order of this product. Then I found out it was my defective toothbrush, not these replacement brush heads. They now work fine. Delivered on time by Amazon. Kind of expensive, though.</li>
            <li> I wish I could post a photo of what this brush looks like after ONE use.&lt;br /&gt;When I placed the brush head on my sonicare handle, I immediately felt that something was &amp;#34;different.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of the brush head attaching snugly onto the handle, it felt loose, and it pulled out very easily.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I had to brush my teeth, so I ignored this matter and brushed away as usual.&lt;br /&gt;Then, I noticed that the brush felt extremely &amp;#34;soft,&amp;#34; and I thought maybe I purchased a sensitive brush head by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Well, the next morning, I was surprised to find my toothbrush looking old and worn, as if I had been using it for months and months (I&#x27;ve never seen a toothbrush look this old)!&lt;br /&gt;The bristles were all over the place, and they looked terrible!&lt;br /&gt;I called sonicare to report this issue, and the customer service representative told me that she had been getting calls from customers who purchased the proresults brush set from Amazon, and that various problems have been reported.&lt;br /&gt;(Sonicare does not provide a warranty on their brush heads - they only provide a warranty on the handles)&lt;br /&gt;Amazon offered a refund, which I gladly accepted. If you are a regular sonicare user, you&#x27;ll immediately &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; that something is different about these brushes. If the loose attachment and poor-quality bristles don&#x27;t bother you, go ahead with the purchase. If not, I would stick with going into a store and purchasing it, or ordering from someplace else.</li>
            <li> great product, prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> So happy to buy it now i can use old brush to clean my shoes :/</li>
            <li> I have a Healthy White Sonicare Toothbrush and these heads are the replacements.  I NEVER purchase any other brush head other from Philips Sonicare.  Why would you purchase an expensive toothbrush (relatively speaking) and use a cheaper replacement?  I purchase this to have &amp;#34;a healthy smile&amp;#34; and I do not comprise to save a couple of dollars.  I can truly say this product works and it does as advertised.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and find this to be the best electric toothbrush plus refill brush head</li>
            <li> Nice but not as good as original heads. They seem a bit softer</li>
            <li> These brush heads differ materially in quality and build from the original brush head that came with the brush and the replacement brush heads I purchased at BB&amp;B (lasted ~1.5 weeks). Not sure whether or not these are counterfeit, but they&#x27;re definitely of lesser quality. I&#x27;m requesting a refund.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare does everything it is advertised that it will do.  It is much easier to keep clean than the older model.  My dentist confirms that it is working for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t last very long.  The Diamond Clean version is much better.</li>
            <li> These are very good quality.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and exactly as described ... great price, especially when it needs to be replaced every few weeks as recommended by the dentist and ADA</li>
            <li> Make sure you buy the correct model of brush as they are not interchangeable.  The packaging is such that you must destroy the packaging to inspect the brush, now I am stuck with three brushes that will not fit.  Since the packaging is destroyed, I can&#x27;t return. Philips has done a marketing number on the public.  While I get awesome check ups since I started using the sonic brush, I am bothered that I have been sucked in to a product that is very expensive.  I only thought I was saving money by buying on the internet instead of my neighborhood drug store.</li>
            <li> The first brush I attached lasted only two days.  After that, when you turned the brush on the head would shoot off from the vibration.  I had to hold the base with one hand and hold the brush onto the base with the other.  After a few very aggravating tries to brush my teeth I gave up and threw the brush head away.  I haven&#x27;t tried the other two yet but I&#x27;m very disappointed so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re all made in China, but this was a great deal and works just as advertised...and was a good deal</li>
            <li> My family has been using Phillips Sonicare for over 12 years with ZERO issues when purchasing this product from a local retailer.  This is the first time that we have ordered this product from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;First there is RUST coming from the metal parts within the base of the Brush Head. (This has never happen before with this product purchased from a local retailer)&lt;br /&gt;Second we have been using these Proresults Brush Heads for only 2 weeks now and already the bristles are worn and lying over. (Again, this has never happen before with this product purchased from a local retailer.)&lt;br /&gt;These Brush Heads usually last at least 2+ months.&lt;br /&gt;My only conclusion is that these must be fake counterfeit black-market copies.  Not real Phillips Sonicare products.</li>
            <li> I just love having my automatic toothbrush and the refills come just when I need them. My teeth are much whiter and the automatic toothbrush does a much better job than manually.</li>
            <li> I like the small toothbrush heads which allow me reach tight areas and brush the gums well. Very satisfied with them.</li>
            <li> These are great! The bristles are soft enough to be gentle to gums but strong enough to clean teeth of food particles and prevent plaque.</li>
            <li> I bought these for refills for hubby&#x27;s toothbrush. They work well but my husband said the last one got a bit mushy after using for a few months?</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot to say other than they fit well and are a perfect replacement for our Sonicare toothbrush. I was using a regular toothbrush for a while when I was waiting for the replacement heads to come, and these help get my teeth so much cleaner, no matter how well I thought I was brushing!</li>
            <li> Have been using 4 about 4 yrs. Very happy.will continue to use. Thanks 4 good product. Keep up quality of work.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace the compact ones I had been using before. I was a bit surprised that they worked so well considering I have smaller teeth and I had been so accustomed to using the compact brush heads. I am glad I made the switch because these actual gave me a better clean in my opinion than the compact. The price was wonderful as well!!!</li>
            <li> I use this thooth brush for ever, I get great reports from my dentist. Witch is good.</li>
            <li> I bought these replacement heads for my sonicare HX6921 and they fit perfectly. I have been using them for a few weeks now without issue.</li>
            <li> The brush heads were not genuine... They are bad fakes too. They frayed after one use. Loose bristles, and the usual fading ones don&#x27;t fade!</li>
            <li> Perfect, a little slow on delivery, but I knew that when I ordered! Finally &amp;#34;I&amp;#34; ordered the right brushes!</li>
            <li> I like that these brushes come with three different colored rings so each person knows which brush head is theirs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal fan of Sonicare products for years, ever since my dentist recommended that I purchase and use one. I&#x27;ve used similar products but I feel that none do the job as well as the Sonicare brushes and toothbrush do!  The surface shape makes it easy to clean all surfaces of your teeth, especially the inside surfaces, which I have trouble with.  I have noticed that the strip that is supposed  to turn white when the brush head is ready to be changed seems to turn white after about a month, but I really don&#x27;t consider this a negative quality - I just put a sticky note on the package when the  brush head needs to be changed again!</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare toothbrush.system..it feels wonderful and I now brush a full 2 minutes.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever done that!</li>
            <li> Better quality than generic brands by far.  The price is still awfully high for a toothbrush.  I suspect a very big mark-up  by all parties from Philips to the retailer.  Makes me think of replacement blades for electric shavers.</li>
            <li> Nice set of brush heads that are not too firm.  Some may want a more firm version, but beware of any gum damage by the firmer version.</li>
            <li> I have use knock off heads from Target with my Sonicare for a while, but couldn&#x27;t find them in the store recently. I got these and the build quality is much better.</li>
            <li> good cleaning brushes</li>
            <li> Teeth feel fresh and clean after brushing.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have a sonicare you are living in the stone ages. Since switching to sonicare I finally didn&#x27;t have any cavities. (I am prone to them.) The knock offs don&#x27;t last the typical 3 months so instead I recommend purchasing the 3 pack online. It&#x27;s about the same price as the generics.</li>
            <li> I am on the auto-ship, which ships the brushes every 6 months.  This changes out the heads every 2 months, which wards off an accumulation of germs and sickness.  I also like how the dark blue bristles per brush head change to white when the brush needs to be thrown away.</li>
            <li> Love my tooth brush. These brush heads last a long time. Mine was over due for a changing, but has lasted a year. May sound gross, but at least you know how well they keep up!</li>
            <li> Regularly use these brushes.</li>
            <li> We are very pleased and they are wearing exceedingly well.  They are easy to clean and are holding up very well.</li>
            <li> Ive been using these for my Sonicare tooth brush for years. Each brush lasts a month or more. My dental reports are better than when I used a regular tooth brush.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare HX6013 Proresults encourages daily dental care and the brush heads are easy to change and clean often.</li>
            <li> Great product! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Bristles come out when using. I guess they must be factory seconds or clever knock-offs. I will not buy again from this source.</li>
            <li> Love these heads. The fact they come with a rubber seal attached to the bottom is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Great! Not much else to say, these are the brand name replacement heads and I wouldn&#x27;t dream of using anything else on my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> After a dental check-up with my dentist, he suggested I buy an electric toothbrush to help with the cleaning of my teeth.  I purchased a Philips Sonicare brush online because I had a coupon to use.  When my brush came and I started to use it, it was great.  After about three months however, I knew I needed to replace the head of it.  I ordered from Amazon, and received the replacement brushes quickly.  I would recommend ordering online to anyone.  It saves a lot of time searching for what you want in department stores.</li>
            <li> These are quality brush heads. They are a real help in keeping my teeth in good condition. They work great.</li>
            <li> These are the brand name ones and they work very well.  However, they are pretty expensive for what you get and how long they last.  I&#x27;m going to try the generic ones next.</li>
            <li> .....but you just get so much more life out of the name brand ones. I have tried several of the generic ones and they are always lousy .  You have 2 options, use the generic and have a good brush head for 3 weeks and then let your teeth suffer for the next 5 weeks until you realize that its totally ineffective or get the Phillips and have a brush head that will actually last a few months. You will either spend less in the long run or not get your teeth as clean. Yes the price sucks but its better than having the dentist dig around in you mouth because your teeth are full of build-up. You spend $100 on the tooth brush so you obviously care about your teeth so don&#x27;t waste the benefit of the tooth brush by using crappy heads.</li>
            <li> Fine replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> Excellent sonic toothbrush with great, long lasting, firm brush heads.  Really does an excellent job cleaning the teeth.  Also, the price for Amazon Prime is nearly 10 bucks less than Walmart in-store.  Therefore, this is an excellent value.</li>
            <li> Bad product. I would recommend to pay more and get real brush heads from Bed Bath &amp; Beyond or some other store. These seem to me to be fake. Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> Better than buying one at a time this 3 pack  is the ideal and convenient solution for Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush users.  I picked up this pack for my partner and ordered a Braun pack for me. Quality is great, price is fair and service wonderful; consequently, we&#x27;ll certainly order more within 9 months.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for older Sonicare Pro.  These are a good fit.  However, they are much tighter on the brush than the originals.</li>
            <li> work well and as expected and very convenient to order online via Amazon!</li>
            <li> I buy those and gave with the toothbrush to my farther as a present which bring back to China with him already. He told me the head is fake!!!!! What should I do!!!!???? Never buy things with not sale by Amazon directly!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I dislike this product because it&#x27;s not fit on me brush. They said its fit on all. Describe is not clear enough.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit for my Sonicare and the only place I can find them, other than my dentists office, which I don&#x27;t get to often.</li>
            <li> Great low price for a name brand product; not an off-brand product as most others for a cheaper price. It fits our Sonicare electric bruch perfectly...as it should. Will most definitely order this product from this seller again once it&#x27;s time to replace.</li>
            <li> I bought these heads to go with my Phillips Soicare Healthy White toothbrush.  The brushes are fine and are the same as the ones that came with my toothbrush.  I am taking off a star because of the price.  25.00 for three toothbrush heads is a lot of money but whatever.  I just purchased 8 generic heads off of Groupon for 11.99 so we will see if those are just as good and if so I wont be paying 25.00 plus tax for these heads.</li>
            <li> I bought these replacement heads to go with the new electric toothbrush (HX6511/50) I purchased for my mom for Christmas.  I have a Sonicare myself and am happy with the results (so is my dentist).  Generally speaking, the heads are fairly expensive but just based on the results and positive feedbacl from my dentist I would recommend these heads.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using sonicare for about three years and have changed brushes before-I ordered these to replace as custom and after using a few times have felt these to be well worn and too frayed to be considered new brushes.  I will not be ordering these again.</li>
            <li> The label says \\&quot;Pro Results\\&quot; on each brush head. When I look over at my new sonicare, it has \\&quot;Sonicare\\&quot; on the brush head. Brushes are supposed to last 3 months. Coloreds bristles fade when need to be replaced. So here I am looking up my order history on Amazon to see that I ordered a 3-pak about 5 weeks ago. I&#x27;m on my 3rd brush head. They start to fade almost after the first use. A few uses, noticeable fading. I have no rusted metal ring on the bottom. However, I didn&#x27;t use any of the heads for a month or more. 5 weeks, 2 brush heads used up already according to the faded bristles. That&#x27;s not right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went in for a cleaning and was astonished how much time I had to spend in the chair having plaque removed. Something didn&#x27;t seem right. Because I&#x27;ve used this sonicare for years and not had that kind of problem. The older heads lasted for years. I got a notice on Amazon that hey, new version. Who knows how many months ago that was. So I was skeptical and used up my supply before trying these. I&#x27;ll go look for the real thing, because this doesn&#x27;t seem like it. More time in the dental chair, head fade strips don&#x27;t even last 4 weeks per head, and noticeable change in quality before 1 month is up for brushing. Go 3 months with one of these heads? Don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> Product came exactly as advertised in original packaging, with quick shipping. I made the mistake of picking the regular instead of the soft (which is what the toothbrush comes with) for my sensitive teeth, but in using these I find it&#x27;s still more comfortable over the manual brush, and they last 3 months. Thanks!</li>
            <li> good. Just what I needed!</li>
            <li> Best u can find for your Phillips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> These appear to almost certainly be counterfeit. They fall right off the toothbrush.  I strongly suggest not buying these knock-offs.</li>
            <li> Quality refills cheaper &amp; they&#x27;re the same exact thing</li>
            <li> Just started using, seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> OF COURSE I HAVE THE TOOTHBRUSH TO GO WITH THIS, BUT IT DOES A GREAT JOB, BUT MY TEETH ARE ALL CROWNS AND ARE VERY SENSITIVE AND THE VIBRATION SOMETIMES MESSES WIT ME..HAS THREE SETTING, BUT CAN&#x27;T TEL MUCH DIFFERENCE IN THE 3..</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a shot anyway, despite the warnings from other reviewers. I didn&#x27;t know what was going to fit my son&#x27;s tooth brush and it was silly to buy a whole new sonic care tooth brush instead of just buying heads for the kids one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried these out and they work fine. The reason I&#x27;m putting a negative review is that I&#x27;ve only been using mine for a week and the brush heads are already worn out. At first I thought it was because of the pressure I was putting when brushing my teeth so I decided to try using less pressure (using a new brush head) and allowing the bristles to find its way around my teeth. Same result, worn out bristles after a week.</li>
            <li> These are not similar to the brush heads that come with the Sonicare Toothbrush. They fray in a week or two. I wish I could return them.</li>
            <li> It arrived  on time. It works just time witrh our power handle. It cleans teeth  just fine. What more can I say?</li>
            <li> These are the original brushes that come from Philips when you purchase your toothbrush. They work great. You can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> Perhaps these brushes were counterfeit, perhaps they were just a bad batch from the seller that sold it to me (Amazing Deals Online). I popped these in and was looking forward to a nice clean brushing experience, but I found them to be uncharacteristically and significantly softer-feeling than I was used to. Turns out they wore down so quickly they were unusable. Literally, it took no more than 3-4 days and the bristles were worn down so drastically that it looked as if I took a scissor and cut the bristles in half. Totally a waste, but good thing Amazon has good customer service and issued a refund.</li>
            <li> Sure, these are more expensive than the basic brush heads, but they are far more effective. The head is contoured to reach deeper between teeth. The heads are also bigger... the basic brush heads are just so tiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few dollars more ever few months is much cheaper and more comfortable than having a cavity filled!</li>
            <li> Recently purchased these for our Philips Sonicare toothbrushes. At first I thought these were genuine replacement heads and quickly learned that&#x27;s not the case. Of the three brushes we received one wouldn&#x27;t actually stay in place on the brush. Unfortunately the other two fit but the brush heads are worn out after two weeks, it looks like the brushes have been use for two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the serial number on the head looms completely fake. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I change brush heads almost every three months as one is supposed to do. A package of three gets me through the year comfortably.</li>
            <li> While these come in the correct packaging, the brushes themselves are not authentic. These wear out within 2 weeks and are complete garbage! They do not snap on/click in like the genuine brush heads, the writing is slightly different, and there is extra model # writing on each head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This \\&quot;deal\\&quot; was certainly too good to be true...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update - Amazon&#x27;s customer service is excellent and offered a full refund.</li>
            <li> Happy to find replacement heads for my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If you own a Philips Sonicare toothbrush then you&#x27;re locked into eventually purchasing replacement brush heads. If you&#x27;re like me then you&#x27;ve probably worn your current brush heads out well beyond when the little blue indicator turned white and the bristles frayed out. Using the new brush head with the firm bristles definitely cleans on a different level and your gums might be a little sore after the first few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has some very competitive prices, even better at a per unit price than when you buy the 6-pack at the bulk warehouse stores.</li>
            <li> Nothing can beat the feeling of fresh cleaning heads. It leaves your tooth surfaces feeling polished. Just amazing for a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These brush heads seem to be identical to the ones in the stores but at a much lower price.  I have not noticed any difference in quality or fit.  I ordered two packs for the same shipping cost for even greater savings.  Delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li> The cheapest replacement I&#x27;ve found.  It fits, and I can&#x27;t find replacements nearby.  What else can you say about a toothbrush?</li>
            <li> These frayed after the first use. These must be fake knock offs. Do not get duped into buying these brush heads.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  I have purchased several of these from my Sonicare and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my previous Sonicare brush after eight years and upgraded after a couple of months using a standard tooth brush I had a dental appointment, my hygienist noticed more stains from coffee.  The Sonicare tooth brush is great for keeping the stains down as well. Purchase additional heads to have an available supply</li>
            <li> Exactly as specified and I will buy them again. Since I started using electric tooth brush 4 years ago I have had zero cavities and getting praise from my dentist</li>
            <li> It is an expensive product for what you get, but that seems to be true of Philips in general.  I usually look for another product then reluctantly buy Philips.</li>
            <li> This is not the first time I buy this through AMAZON. This time I found  provider that had a better prize.&lt;br /&gt; The tooth brush is as effective as always</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite disappointed as only one weeks use looks like the use of a brush head used (and frayed) for six months!</li>
            <li> This is fake brush. Not from Sonicare</li>
            <li> way overpriced. C&#x27;est la vie</li>
            <li> I understand there are after market brush heads on the market but these are from the manufacturer of the toothbrush and work very well.</li>
            <li> This is great buy and fast shipping, the price is great and beats out the Big box store.  I rather help the little guy and heck with the Millionaire people.  This is a great buy and I love my tooth brush.  Henry, The Weedeaterman,LLC.</li>
            <li> Really stiff, hurts my gums and doesnt fit as snug as I thought it would. Overall not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are excellent........very sturdy and strong.  I&#x27;m sure they will last a long time.  We are very happy with our purchase.</li>
            <li> The original brush was wearing out. Good to have replacement brushes. Better price than what I found in many stores.</li>
            <li> These appear to be the standard Sonicare brush heads, but they have already begun to splinter and spread after 2 weeks worth of use.  Not sure what is wrong with them...</li>
            <li> Great job. Only complaint is that you have to keep pressing the same button 3 times to turn it off.</li>
            <li> Great replacements toothbrush heads, no complaints happy to be able to get them fast online. Be ordering them again soon!</li>
            <li> Shipment came on time, I like the bristle design which seems to be able to reach and clean teeth better.  The brush head can be replaced easily. However, I have found that any mechanical device with high speed rotation, you need to put the toothbrush in a good angle; or you may push your gum line way down by repetitive brushing.  I alternate the mechanical and manual daily, so I won&#x27;t damage my gum again.</li>
            <li> Works good I guess but severely overpriced. Will try the cheaper non branded ones next time. I cannot know how you can tell the difference between the two.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than retail stores.  I am happy with the product and regularly change my brush heads every 3 months like clockwork.  Although, they would probably last longer than that.</li>
            <li> I ordered once and the brush heads were legit. Then I subscribed and the next order that came they are clearly fake, imitation knock offs! :) I requested a return and am getting my money back. Don&#x27;t buy these. Amazon needs to clean up the counterfeit goods, it&#x27;s becoming a problem.</li>
            <li> My husband and I ordered these as replacement heads for our toothbrush, and we were very disappointed.  We have had the ProResults heads before (about two years ago), and these ones were not the same.  We don&#x27;t follow the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions to replace heads every three months (we figure it&#x27;s a way to sell more), and we usually can and do get more life out of our heads than three months.  Well, these heads were junk after about two months.  The bristles started to wear out (the edges flared out) before three months was even up, and our teeth did not feel clean by the end of the day (like we had forgotten to brush our teeth in the morning).  The other really annoying problem is that the heads will not stay snapped into the brush like they should, so while you are brushing your teeth (toothbrush is on and vibrating) the head unexpectedly pops off!  Talk about an irritating way to get your teeth clean.  We really like the Sonicare toothbrush and normally would give a high rating, but these heads do not seem like the same quality we have had in years past.</li>
            <li> They fit my toothbrush, and my teeth will probably be none the wiser, but I am not 100% convinced that these are real Philips brand.  I can&#x27;t point to anything specific, just more of a &amp;#34;feeling.&amp;#34;  Like the font on the brush head and wording is slightly different than my old ones.  Oh well, I&#x27;m keeping them.</li>
            <li> These are complete utter rubish! We ordered the MANUFACTURER&#x27;S BRAND FOR OUR PHILIPS SONICARE, and these do not SNAP ON! They glide on and keep falling off as you brush your teeth. If the manufacturer&#x27;s own brand won&#x27;t work, what the heck are we supposed to use! We are beyond irritated!</li>
            <li> I love my toothbrush, the replacement heads Were on sale for a good price on here. Would recommend to anyone who owns a sonic care</li>
            <li> Sonicare has been used in my family for years and it works very, very well and I would suggest it for everyone!</li>
            <li> The replacement brushes work the same as the original brush.  I have bought generic brushes which work, but I do not like the generic brand as well as I like the genuine replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> These cost much more any where else that you buy them, and you want to have spares on hand for then</li>
            <li> The Brush Head HX6013 is a high quality product fitting a top sonic toothbrush, which is effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li> love these my teeth feel really clean after using them just what I was looking for keep up the great product</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush fade when it is time to replace. Like that! Much easier to attach brush head.</li>
            <li> Brush heads were delivered early.. That&#x27;s good... But the packaging was damaged.. A closer inspection of the product description did mention that packaging was damaged but product is unaffected . My bad... Not sure why someone would want toothbrushes that were subject to insects, vermin dust and whatever they would encounter in the warehouse or in transit</li>
            <li> BUT LESS EXPENSIVE. recently had some dental procedures and he recommend this device. I already had one just needed new heads. great delivery time too A+++++</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any idea of the cost for replacement heads and was a bit concerned. But after doing some analysis and then receiving the product - I can&#x27;t express enough praise for the quality and price. Also, on a small bonus note - it came with color rings so that we can tell who&#x27;s is who&#x27;s.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware ... these ARE NOT authentic Philips Sonicare products; these are cheap knock offs/counterfeits.  Didn&#x27;t fit exactly right, quality is poor and the bottom line:  they&#x27;re pawning off a counterfeit product as authentic!</li>
            <li> A &amp;#34;must have &amp;#34; if you have the Sonicare toothbrush,change brush heads on a regular basis &amp; they last longer &amp; do a better job. Really like the Sonicare toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this Philips system for a couple of years now, and, swear by it.  These brushes are firm, but, still gentle on the gums.  What I hate is the fact that I have to search and search to find the brushes for a price that is slightly lower than the manufacturers&#x27;.  And, I just can&#x27;t bring myself to buy the knock-offs from China.  For all I know, the knock-offs may have been made from the nape hair of the abominable snowman.  As the originals I trust, I shall go on buying them until they are discontinued, or, third party supplies are exhausted, or, until the motor dies of old age.  I like the system because I was able to pick up the sterilizer attachment here at Amazon, and, am comforted by the fact that the brush heads will be sterilized before each use.  Nice to have an enclosure for the brush heads in a bathroom environment.  Buy &#x27;em while you can.  The supply seems to be thinning out.</li>
            <li> This is the only electric toothbrush I use so these are the only tooth brush heads I buy.  They arrived quickly and packaging was great.</li>
            <li> These Phillips Sonicare HX6013 brushheads are exactly like the original ones that came with my toothbrush.  You can&#x27;t get a better price or quality.  These fit my Healthy White HX6710 Toothbrush.  Trust this seller.</li>
            <li> One day I realized I had only cleansed and not changed my Philips toothbrush for over a year!  I quickly ordered these, assuming they were the real deal.  I&#x27;d had mine a week and already noticed the bristles are fraying after such a short time. I will definitely be returning these.  Should have realized the price was too good.  Next: Dealing with the 8 that are coming from Groupon :(</li>
            <li> Same as the ones that came with the system.  Tried Oral-B once, but came back to Sonicare as soon as that wore out because these don&#x27;t seem to have a problem with drool!</li>
            <li> The brand new brushes are constantly losing their bristles, (from the very first use).  The brush that came with my new toothbrush shed it&#x27;s bristles.  I guess they all do but that doesn&#x27;t make me happy.  I like everything else about the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Sorry, after I opened the package and try to put your head on my  machine, I found the style is wrong. (My need is e-Series heads).&lt;br /&gt;Can I return that to you? Or can you help me to replace to the right style?</li>
            <li> Perfect size for the mouth.  Last longer than they say it will.</li>
            <li> Good brushes. The blue streak that designates when to use a new head doesnt seem to last very long but the toothbrushes themselves work very well.</li>
            <li> I simply can’t tell you how much I love real Sonicare brush heads.  I tried the generic ones and I came back to the original because it works just that much better and leaves my teeth feeling much cleaner.  Never shall I be without my love!  These heads fit my Flex care and will fit Diamond Clean, Flex Care +, Healthy White and Easy Clean Sonicare Toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> i opened the package only to find that my sonic care tooth brush doesnt take these heads and because I opened the package I couldn&#x27;t return them so it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Love my Philips Sonicare, and so does my dentist!  Both my wife and I were beginning to notice that our gumlines were receding from over-intense brushing, and our dentist recommended we either change our brushing habits or get an electronic brush, and changing habits just wasn&#x27;t happening.  Got the Sonicare and haven&#x27;t looked back!</li>
            <li> I received this product and it is exactly what I needed for my sonic are toothbrush.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If you have tried to buy these replacement brushes in a retail store, you know that this price was a good one.  You could actually buy a bigger package, but since I am single, I don&#x27;t need it.  It is very important to buy the trademark name replacement brushes.  I have tried the substitutions and THEY DON&#x27;T WORK!</li>
            <li> these replacement toothbrush heads for my Phillips toothbrush seem even better than the originals in their ability to&lt;br /&gt;reach small crevices. their shape is excellent.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t correct head for my toothbrush, so I returned it minus a restocking charge. next time show correct product/text description</li>
            <li> Excellent price for an Excellent product.  I have been using my Sonicare for years and it makes a huge difference to replace the head.</li>
            <li> I bought these replacement heads for my Sonicare toothbrush.  They do not fit tight enough though, which is the reason I did not give them 5 stars.  Otherwise they are fine.</li>
            <li> Perfect fit, great price.</li>
            <li> Purchased 2 packs a few weeks ago.  I am already on the second brush head.  The first one I used was shedding it&#x27;s bristles in my mouth every time I brushed.  It was annoying, especially when you consider how much each brush head costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to use another replacement head.  So far so good with that one.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush heads.  We really like the Sonicare Toothbrush system.  We would definitely recommend this to everyone.  I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush that these brushes go to.. I even purchased my 5 year old the children&#x27;s version!  Def recommend it!</li>
            <li> The bristles are falling out as i brush.  It is a piece of crap.  I think they are counterfeit brushes, because it looks nothing like the original.</li>
            <li> I got these to replace my other brush heads on my Philips Sonicare DiamondClean toothbrush. They work fine as expected.</li>
            <li> I use these brush heads on a regular basis. It is a pleasure to receive them conveniently delivered to my home packaged properly and on time.</li>
            <li> This was a great deal so i jumped on it. These are real nice brushes and work well. I am glad to be able to replace my worn out  brush heads.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend really likes these brush heads.  They fit his model perfectly as stated in the description.  It was a great buy!</li>
            <li> This is a product I use daily. Recommended by my dentist. The brush heads are easy to change and have a dye incorporated that indicates when it&#x27;s time to replace the brush.</li>
            <li> have been using this for about 2 wks. have had no problems with it..chose this one because it was affordable.  lightweight and easy to use..would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t got the chance to use them yet however, they seem to be a good product.  So far everything is as advertised.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this purchase.  Previous purchases were fine, but this time many bristles fell out soon after I started using one.  It happened with all three.  Too expensive to have this kind of flaw.  I might accept this from a knock-off, but not from Phillips.</li>
            <li> If you use the sonic brush, you gotta have em.  These are a bit pricey but they do last a decent amount of time.  I have braces and these still stay strong and don&#x27;t fray apart like standard brushes.</li>
            <li> --Original-- (8-24-2012)&lt;br /&gt;I have had them for a week now.  They are virtually the same exact brush heads that came with the original toothbrush (Sonicare Flexcare+ toothbrush with UV sanitizer).  The bristles have a sturdy feel while still being somewhat soft and not hard on the gums.  They fit on the brush head the same as the old ones did.  Great brush heads for a discounted price from buying anywhere else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Update-- (4-21-14)&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to update my review on these toothbrush heads.  I have now had them, and been using them, for about 1 year and 8 months.  They are reasonably fraying, just like the originals did after this amount of time.  I would consider myself \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; or some might say \\&quot;Dutch\\&quot; so I try my best to use something until it actually needs to be replaced.  I did notice that the brush heads might have started fraying slightly before the original brush heads did but not by any reasonable difference in time to deter me from buying these again!  I would still today recommend these brush heads and will be purchasing more very shortly to replace my last set of fraying brush heads that again, have lasted 1 year 8+months and still have at least some life left in them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time proponent of third-party, or generic, products - especially when it comes to consumable products that we go through quickly. Toothbrush heads, I have learned, should not fall into that category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending two years using generics, and being somewhat pleased with them, I decided to order the real deal. There is absolutely no comparison. I can only try to compare it to the difference between an electric toothbrush and a manual one. There is THAT much of a difference in the way it will change your dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s apparent that some people are getting knock-offs by reading their reviews. I, however, received the exact same package that you can buy from the store. They aren&#x27;t duplicates and didn&#x27;t come in a brown box. They fit great and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with removing the heads to clean the brush. The package comes with three different colored rings as well that you can use to distinguish which brush head belongs to who if you share the toothbrush. Also, I guess you can use the rings to somewhat stylize your toothbrush instead of using the plain grey rings. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: There were sold to me by Amazon.com LLC.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great pricing.  The packaging was superior to what is sold in the stores.  It was nice to be able to purchase a three brush set&lt;br /&gt;rather than one at a time or five in the big box stores.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended a Sonicare toothbrush to keep my teeth clean, I was having bad problems, and it works. I&#x27;m getting excellent results and my dentist and hygienist are pleased.</li>
            <li> This product got a four star rating only due to the fact they don&#x27;t fit as snug as my previous brushes.  They still work just fine though.</li>
            <li> I have seen some comments about the fit of these heads, but my original heads had a less than perfect fit, too. To me, this makes sense as it needs to be able to vibrate. The heads fit snugly on the attachment post and I cannot tell a difference between these and the heads that came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The item did not work. After 2-3 brushings it would fall off the device. I asked for a refund and was told I would have to pay for it to be returned.</li>
            <li> I love brushing my teeth with this for over a year and it really cleans them and feels good in the process.. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this batch of toothbrushes.  The new brush head that I switch out began loosing the blue color on the bristles after the first couple of uses. I received the product around Jan 20th and did not change brush head immediately. The heads are suppose to last longer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended by my personal dentist.  I know they do a great cleaning job.  They take some getting used to for me.  I&#x27;m sure I will like them even more after I use it for awhile.</li>
            <li> Brushes came as advertised, and cheaper than buying from a traditional brick and mortar. If you like Phillips, then this is a great choice. You will be happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Very good for suit for my sonic toothbrush very much.</li>
            <li> For about $8.50 per brush, you really can&#x27;t beat it.  I got the shipping free (Amazon Prime member), and they came quickly and well protected.  These are the Proresults brushes (there are several different brushes that Phillips makes, depending on the unit that you bought), and they appear to be identical to the one that came with my electric Sonicare toothbrush.  For the money, this is the best deal I could find  on the internet for replacement toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> I am always replacing my toothbrush heads and looking for good value for money replacements.  Thanks for the fair pricing!</li>
            <li> Have one to use and 2 for replacements.  LIke that the brush looses color to tell you when the change the brush.</li>
            <li> After a half dozen uses, the brush bristles start falling out and brushes become useless.  HORRIBLE.  Not all like the last set I purchased?</li>
            <li> These are great brushes, and the Sonicare makes trips to the dentist for a cleaning quick and easy. They are a little pricy for electric toothbrush heads, but I think healthy teeth and gums are worth it. You can&#x27;t buy healthy original teeth on here or anywhere else. Only the replacements, which are way more expensive than these brush heads.</li>
            <li> Brush heads wear out long before 3 months.  I think they may be conterfeit.  Not worth the money for sure.</li>
            <li> After only ONE use, the bristles are mashed down, and therefore useless for brushing.  This cannot be the real thing by Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Delivery was a few days later than promised otherwise the product itself meets my expectations</li>
            <li> These are the right heads for my toothbrush, but they simply do not stay on the brush.  Super annoying and a disappointment.</li>
            <li> bristles become brittle and fray after several uses.  All 3 have done the same thing and not common for Sonicare heads.</li>
            <li> Of the 3-pack we received one of the brushes is defective.  It refuses to snap into place regardless of which o-ring is tried.  Since it&#x27;s more hassle to return just one brush out of three we have discarded it; but it certainly shades our opinion of this Philips product.  The two other brushes fit fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Tubesing</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare products for over two years.  This is the first time I purchased the brush heads online.  What a huge, disappointing mistake.  The previous brush heads I&#x27;ve purchased through retailers were long lasting, high quality brush heads that have lasted months.  Not only did these online brush heads arrive smaller and thinner than expected but, one week after using one of them, it has already started to &amp;#34;fray&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think I was getting a lousy deal because they aren&#x27;t super inexpensive.  I honestly thought I was buying a decent product.  I was wrong.  From now on, I will pay a few extra dollars and buy my brush heads through a trusted retailer.</li>
            <li> Best way to clean teeth and getting into hard to reach places without too much effort compared to a regular brush.  Nice plastic cover for each brush.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and the replacement head, works great on my replacement handle. No &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; issues, works just as well as originals.</li>
            <li> I received a replacement from the seller and these seem like legitimate sonicare replacment heads. So just a watch out, ask for a replacement if these do not feel or last like the original that came with your brush! The seller was very prompt and courteous with my request. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated from... I should have read the other reviews... beware, these appear to be knock-offs, I have been using one for just about a month... and it is completely matted and broken down. Not at all the same quality as when you first purchase the brush.</li>
            <li> Had to buy new toothbrush after I could no longer find replacement heads for old electronic toothbrush. Like these because they don&#x27;t have the huge base the old ones had.</li>
            <li> These were knock-offs! What has the world come to when you are making fake toothbrushes!! The packaging appeared ligitimate but when you opened the package you could immediately see these were not real sonicare brush heads. The cut was poorly done on the bristles and the material of the brush was not the same as the original. Within 1 week I threw them away (they should last 3 months). Upon first use you knew these were not actual Sonicare brush heads. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product. I bought this thinking that it is a replacement brush head manufactured by Philips but it&#x27;s not. It does not even fit well and cannot be used at all. What a disappointment. This product should not be allowed to be sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking I was getting a deal.  As it turns out these are fake brush heads, wore out after just 2 weeks of use.  DO NOT PURCHASE!!</li>
            <li> These Brush Heads are cheap fakes. The print looks cheap and the plastic feels different. I will be returning these.</li>
            <li> To get three brushes at this price is a great savings. The tooth brushes work very well. I will be buying again in the future.</li>
            <li> Brush heads are definitely counterfeit. These brush heads do not securely attach to the toothbrush along with the bristles &amp;#34;flattening out&amp;#34; after only a few days use. Writing on the brush head itself is also raised compared to the standard printing on the OEM brush heads. Clearly made in china as knockoffs, not such a big deal when the price is right but these are full retail prices. Buyer beware...</li>
            <li> Warning! Buyers beware!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had the Sonicare toothbrush for 2 years now and bought these thinking they were official Sonicare heads. They are NOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried all three and they &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; off of the toothbrush and do not work at all. Feels cheap, the printing on the heads look fake and overall it is a terrible product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRUST THE OTHER REVIEWS!</li>
            <li> Each brush lasted less than a week! In addition, they do not properly attach to the motor head.  It is not possible that these are Sonicare (Phillips-made) replacements, it would irresponsible for Phillips to release such a product.  I hope AMAZON becomes aware that is happening.</li>
            <li> These sell for $36.00 at Walmart. I love my Philips sonic toothbrush and these replacement heads. My dentist loves them too! Much less plaque.</li>
            <li> These are definitely off brand, they say &amp;#34;Philips Sonicare&amp;#34; on the brush head instead of &amp;#34;ProResults&amp;#34;. I checked a few websites and they&#x27;re definitely supposed to say ProResults on the front, so buy at your own risk since quality will likely be off.</li>
            <li> These are fakes... Sonic Care confirmed them as counterfeit... they vibrate right off the barrel...  purchase with caution... they do not work...</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve been burned by a purchase on Amazon -- why did it have to be over replacement toothbrush heads? I&#x27;ve used Philps Sonicare since high school, so I know when &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; brush heads don&#x27;t feel the way they should. I even checked the box to make sure I hadn&#x27;t bought &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; instead. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t look at the recent reviews for the item and I wish I had because it would have saved me the trouble of ordering this item. Looks like I&#x27;m heading to CVS tomorrow to pay regular price, which is what I didn&#x27;t want to do in the first place.</li>
            <li> As much as I love the toothbrush, I really appreciate the replacement heads. The new head snaps right on. This sure beats the hassle I had with a different toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If you want to have the clean teeth and gums that are healthy than this is the brush for you. Teeth that feel like you just left the dentist.</li>
            <li> The brush heads fit and work great. Just what I had expected. No problems. My dental hygienist will be proud of me.</li>
            <li> I replaced the head on my toothbrush and it worked fine.  When my husband said his replacement would not stay on, he assumed it was his toothbrush. It wasn&#x27;t. The third one did not fit properly either. Would not flush with the body of the toothbrush and while brushing the head would come off.  Amazon needs to discontinue offering this product.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what it should be - new, still in the original packaging, and it was actually the correct item. And it got here on time. I would have given 4 stars but I was under the impression that i was getting these for a &amp;#34;better-than-store&amp;#34; price, but i found them at Target for the exact same price.</li>
            <li> Been using  for a few years and plan to continue.</li>
            <li> ...so add it to your cart and buy it!</li>
            <li> love the brushes and appointments have improved</li>
            <li> Arrived in time and as was described. Will order more after all these finished.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this heads for almost all Phillips users.</li>
            <li> I buy these as they are replacement brushes for my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It works great and the price was super</li>
            <li> I brush my teefs wiff it!</li>
            <li> Nice small soft brushes that reach into small places in the mouth.  Ones  I cannopt get to with regular brushes  and used less toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Quality brush head. I LOVE LOVE LOVE my EASYCLEAN ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH. Can never be without one. Although, the brush heads are pricey.</li>
            <li> I like it very much. I am absolutely amazed at this stuff!This product is high quality and good values!!! good</li>
            <li> The price and packaging is wonderful. It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m not sure about he quality. I say this because the Sonicare brush head should be replaced every three months based on normal use. Usually that&#x27;s when the indicator loses all its color. With these brushes, it seems like the indicator disappears in two month. The bristles look fine but it makes me wonder why it&#x27;s different. Still, my last dental check up had no problems.</li>
            <li> Received these brush heads quickly, makes brushing your teeth more invigorating, love the clean feel I get after brushing, and the compliments from my dental hygienist.  Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain. No problems with the delivery. Tooth brush heads fit. I intend on purchasing these again next time my tooth brush heads wear out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy the &amp;#34;department store&amp;#34; brand of these toothbrush heads again. The quality is sorely lacking in comparison to the Sonicare brand.</li>
            <li> The product meets our expectations. It would be nice if a larger economy pack were available to save everyone costs.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I received a bad batch because these seemed to wear our and go flat in the first week.  This is the second time I have ordered and the 1st time they did not do that.</li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews, I was wary of purchasing these but figured if I got the ones that were fulfilled by Amazon and Prime eligible they would be the real deal. Wrong. As soon as I got them, I noticed the print on the brush head looked off and had some sort of serial number on it as well. The bristles also seemed shorter and quite a bit softer than my previous (legit) brushes. I went ahead and brushed my teeth with it anyway and after just one use, some of the bristles had fallen out and the ones that were left were smashed in and pointing in every direction. It looked like I had been using the brush for a decade! Same thing happened with the other two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my advice is to spend the extra $5 or $6 and order these from the official Sonicare website. At least you know you&#x27;ll be getting the real deal.</li>
            <li> The replacement brush felt much softer than the original brush.  I am not happy.  It does not seem like it will last very long and I keep hitting my teeth with the plastic on the brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this set of replacement brushes were very soft and flattened out after only a few uses. A completely different quality than my last set.  And it was too late to get a refund or return by the time I used them..which I find to be unfair.  I bought these twice!!!  On accident!!!!</li>
            <li> Have used the Philips Sonicare system for several years with goods results. It has improved and help maintain my dental health.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are very expensive anywhere where one goes. They seemed to be a little cheaper on Amazon. The heads themselves wear out sooner than I thought &#x3D; the blue brush bristles become white but I wait on putting in a replacement as the brush lasts longer than they say.</li>
            <li> For the couple bucks more that these cost, I believe it is worth it and stay away from the generic replacement heads.  I have never used the generic, but I expect that they would be similar to using a toothbrush you buy from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I have to for this one. After one week of use, the brush was worn out and unable to use anymore. I will request a refund. I have ordered the same product before and it worked well. The logo looks different and the brushes were softer and shorter to begin with. Are they fake or issue with quality control?  Now I am afraid to reorder even it says Philips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this set of replacement brushes were very soft and flattened out after only a few uses.  A completely different quality than my last set.</li>
            <li> exactly the kind i needed bought my sonicare at the dental office and I didn&#x27;t know which brush head would fit my toothbrush this did the trick. If you don&#x27;t know exactly which brush head fits your sonicare I recommend you go to sonicare&#x27;s website and chat with a representative so that they can point you to the right direction.</li>
            <li> I like the Sonicare toothbrush.  Any toothbrush is only as effective as the users allows it to be.  One of the things that one needs to do is change the brush as soon as the blue indicator color begins to fade.  I once waited too long, believing that the indicator was supposed to be completely gone before changing the brush out.  But that is not so, and one can tell when one&#x27;s brush is getting on the soft side (not soft-good but soft-lacking resilience).  They are expensive, probably excessively so.  But the last crown I had cost in the neighborhood of $2K, and so I have a very different view of cost versus value now that I&#x27;m over 50 and, in essence, have a choice between maintaining  good periodontal and dental health and keeping my \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; in a cup at the bedside.</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding these brush heads lately.  These are the heads that you can switch the bands on.  Very happy I found these at this price. I will be ordering more from them.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I paid more than $20 for these.  These are worth no more than fifty cents a piece.  The bristles during the first week immediately looked worse than the old one that I just removed.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how poor the quality of these become.  I&#x27;m hoping Philips reads these reviews because for such a great electric toothbrush they went totally cheap on the heads.</li>
            <li> These heads are definitely fate. they were too soft and they didn&#x27;t hold their shape for more than a week</li>
            <li> Either I got a bad one, they&#x27;ve lowered the quality considerably, or this product is fake. The brush gets frizzled and all out of shape just after 2 brushes. Never had this problem before. Not sure if they&#x27;ll still replace it.</li>
            <li> replacing my old Philips Sonicare that I have had for about 10 years.  It still worked but didn&#x27;t hold a charge as long.  Also, I wanted the easy clean model.  It really is easy to clean.  Doesn&#x27;t get all gunked up with black icky stuff.</li>
            <li> Love our Sonicare... hard to find the brushes... glad there are sources.  Finding different length and softness in brushes is a challenge.</li>
            <li> I bought a 3 pack that was in a Sonicare package. The brushes are way too soft. After a week the bristles were askew. Something is not right. I will be calling Sonicare</li>
            <li> this price was unbelievable, after shopping around I decided that this was as good as it get, glad I purchased</li>
            <li> These have to be counterfeit items.  The bristles are cheap and after one use the toothbrush head looks like it has been used for a year. The sonicare wording is blurry, you can tell they are not the real deal.  Do not buy these.</li>
            <li> Concerned we got counterfeit heads as the quality is awful. The bristles immediately deformed and were no longer cleaning teeth effectively after 2 days, and after a week, not at all, leaving food on molars. Using a Phillips Sonicare HealthyWhite that was doing amazing with the Philips heads that came with it. Given we paid for the real branded heads, and understanding the razor and the blade model, we accepted that the manufacturer would make a killer margin on three replacement heads for $25. However, for that, we anticipated consistent exceptional quality. This is why we did not buy the generic heads that were 3 for $4. I trust Philips, so chalk it up to a counterfeit or flaw. They&#x27;ll figure it out when they receive them back with the RMA.</li>
            <li> We received the order on time but item was not standard size-received the compact heads instead.  We kept them for our kids but had to order another set.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly on my Sonicare. Perfect replacement heads and a value by ordering a 3 pack. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I absolutely love this toothbrush. My gums and teeth are not sensitive anymore. My teeth are really white. I feel like I just came back from a cleaning at my dentist.</li>
            <li> I bought these back in September 2014. Of the three heads, one worked perfectly, one was totally unusable (would not fit into brush) and the last one, which I am using now, pops out of my toothbrush every time I use it.  I should have returned them when I first realized there was a problem.  I think Amazon has a responsibility to ensure that the products it sells do what they claim to do and I don&#x27;t think this meets that standard and is tantamount to fraud.  I will try my luck at Bed Bath and Beyond for my next replacement heads.</li>
            <li> These are the best toothbrushes ever! My teeth always feel so clean after each use. I wish the replacement heads were a little less expensive. I even tried an off brand and there was a huge difference! Will be sticking with Sonicare brand from now on.</li>
            <li> Returned after 1 use.  The product was either counterfeit or defective.  I have use Sonicare heads for many years with no problems.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever returned anything from Amazon.  Kudos to Amazon for a simple, hassle free process</li>
            <li> The bristles are really stiff this time. Does sonicare make different styles or this is it?&lt;br /&gt;It does not feel like the first ones we ordered on here !</li>
            <li> This three pack is an excellent way to restock your supply of brushes for the Philips Sonicare toothbrush system. These come with the colored bands and plastic protective caps so that you can protect your brush and keep them sorted if you share a brush base with other people. As with the ones provided with the initial brush, these heads don&#x27;t fit perfectly onto the base, leaving a very small slot that allows for toothpaste and gunk to build up.</li>
            <li> This product was a counterfeit. Packaging seemed like it was correct but the product itself was not. Can not stress enough on the fact that it is a complete FAKE.  Brush head came a part the first time it was put onto my toothbrush. Very disappointed that amazon would have this product on there site.</li>
            <li> These heads appear to illegitimate. The &amp;#34;ProResults&amp;#34; print on the shaft of the tooth brush head appear faded and cheaply printed compared to my authentic toothbrush heads. The worst part is they fit very loosely on the base. They come off in you mouth after 15 seconds of brushing. Even if you place the head on and hold it in your hand and turn on the tooth brush you can see the head vibrating up and off the base unit.  ABSOLUTE GARBAGE! ABSOLUTELY UNUSABLE!</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush, and getting the refills here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good value, but wish this version came with the different color interchangeable rings at the bottom for other users!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hillbilly Gregs familys gots more than 1 teeth per persons, even the yung&#x27;uns!</li>
            <li> These are not Sonicare manufactured toothbrush heads. They come in Sonicare packaging, but you can quickly tell that they are fake by the quality. They are imposters and started to fall apart after the third use.</li>
            <li> Have had the Sonicare for years.  I recently purchased replacement brush heads. The brush heads are tight to fit and can&#x27;t be removed without the brush head pulling apart.  I contacted Philips and they do not stand by their product, at all. I will never purchase a Philips product again.</li>
            <li> These bristles are shaped to my teeth, and really feel like they are doing the job.  Much better than the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; ones.</li>
            <li> Love this serious, so does the brush head</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Cannot tell you how much it has helped to improve my gum health.  I have tried the compact heads, but find the Standard Head works better for me.</li>
            <li> The bristles are not as good as the packs purchased from stores like BJ&#x27;s.  They fray much too quickly and only last a couple of weeks.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> It makes it quick and easy to get my teeth very clean .&lt;br /&gt;It is good price with coupon,but there is only 2 pack ,not 3.&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#x27;ve got the refund.</li>
            <li> I blew through the first head really quickly because they are so soft. I do brush hard so a firmer brush head may do more damage but prevents me from push on the toothbrush to shred it in two weeks.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used these yet; still on the first brush head that came with my new Healthywhite, but the pricing was great.  Having trouble finding a UV light sanitizer that holds this size/style of brush head though.</li>
            <li> Just bought these replacement brushes. Currently pregnant and having some issues with sensitive gums. I replaced my old brush heads with these, and they work wonderfully on minimizing agitation when on &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; setting.</li>
            <li> Subscribed and it is the best price around.  We all have Sonicare toothbrushes so this is perfect and it&#x27;s scheduled deliveries.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t fit the Proresults brush - they are way too loose and as a result are not able to vibrate properly. In addition, I only received 2 heads instead of the advertised 3. EXTREMELY disappointed.</li>
            <li> They are obviously fake Philips tooth brush head, VERY VERY BAD quality! The brush head seems like hundreds times used after only 3 times used!</li>
            <li> I have read the reviews and in addition I will say that it is not made clear when purchasing this product that this company is based in Europe, and shipped from England. I have no problem understanding global capitalism, but I will not purchase items that contribute to the loss of American jobs.  This is why I have returned it and no longer want it. I will pay the slightly higher cost from any U.S. based company.</li>
            <li> These are excellent brush heads. They are long lasting, durable, do not bend, and they do not hurt your gums.</li>
            <li> These arrived as usual in the retail package. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever trust something that has been re-packaged via the internet.</li>
            <li> I bought some others that were cheaper but they kept popping off, I found these and they work like they are supposed to and the price was right.</li>
            <li> The bristles on these replacement heads were completely flat after a week.  This is nowhere near the quality of the brushes that came with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I purchased a 3 pack of these and the bristles are so soft they literally lose their shape after 2 brushes.  You all know how good it feels to put in a new head and immediately notice the results from a slightly stiffer brush.  Not so this time.  The package says Philips Sonicare, but these feel like a knock-off.  They have a small 7 digit number at the base of the stem where it connects that I never had with previous heads (which may or may not mean anything).  Ridiculously disappointed.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are the same as the official Phillips Sonicare that I have bought at brick and mortar stores.</li>
            <li> WE have used this toothbrush for several years now, the heads are a bit pricey butr do a tremendous job.</li>
            <li> I have used the Sonicare toothbrush system for about 4 months now and really enjoy the way it cleans my teeth.  Also have a dental hygenist friend who says she loves hers as well.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Package says switch out every 3 months. It&#x27;s expensive, but that&#x27;s what you get when you want to buy a electric toothbrush. Everything came as ordered.</li>
            <li> It felt as if I had been using this brush head for six months rather than for the first time. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I am a Registered Dental Hygienist and this is the only toothbrush I will use.</li>
            <li> Do not buy, cheap product.  Amazon should not allow these imitation products to be sold.  After a few uses, they lose their shape and are not very effective.  Purchased actual Philips replacements at a store and they work great!  Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I have a Diamond Sonicare toothbrush.  These replacements work great for this model.  I usually like the smaller compact heads for my teeth, but these work fine.  My son and husband have Sonicare also so we need these.  Best toothbrush out there.  I am a dental hygienist and Sonicare is the best power brush on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually not convinced this is the real thing.  The bristles are so soft that it becomes matted down after only several weeks of use.  They are completely different than what comes with the initial Sonicare purchase and refills you buy at Costco.</li>
            <li> These premium brush heads are worth the money.  Dental hygene techs comment on my clean teeth.</li>
            <li> These were well-priced and work great.</li>
            <li> Wore out in just a couple weeks. Not OEM product.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because they were the cheapest that still seemed unlikely to be fakes. They are completely legit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I expected a firmer bristle. These seem to be similar to a soft traditional toothbrush, which was not indicated in the description. The brushes that came with the original unit, and the ones I have purchased before these, were firm and really transmitted the vibrations from the handle to the teeth. The others seemed to be much more effective in cleaning my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a soft bristle, these are for you, but I should probably have returned thwm.</li>
            <li> the EXACT SAME item that comes with a brand new brush in a box !</li>
            <li> I have purchased many packs of brush heads for my Sonicare - this is the first time I can remember ending up with loose bristles in my mouth. I am not pleased with the quality at all. I don&#x27;t know what makes this pack different that the others I have used, but it really makes me think &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is not a philips sonicare product. This is a replica. The blue nyon does not wear in color as the true product does and the nyon comes apart in your mouth as you brush your teeth causing you to swallow or choke. -- Customer service is excellent for the fast product refund, thank you.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong heads :( I&#x27;m sure these work great for the toothbrush they are made for so they get four stars.</li>
            <li> These were terrible. I actually used one for a few days and thought that I had not actually replaced my brush head it had become so frayed. I replaced it within a week with another one and the exact same thing happened. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I don&#x27;t know what is wrong with these, but they frayed and were useless after a week. I went to Target and got a pack and they have worked just fine.</li>
            <li> I use both my regular toothbrush (just cause I like it) but for keeping your teeth really clean, you need electric.  This is a good product and I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the results of the Philips Sonicare HX6013 Proresults Brush Head, and so is my dentist.</li>
            <li> No cavities in 30 years.</li>
            <li> Came as promised in original packaging.</li>
            <li> Fits my toothbrush just perfect and I like the soft bristles.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  I don&#x27;t know if these were knock-offs, but after two uses they looked like it had a year of use.  Went to Target and bought replacements for these off the shelf and they were fine.</li>
            <li> These are replacement heads, so you probably already own a Phillips brush and you probably have already used these brush heads, but if not they are great. Get the right ones and they&#x27;ll plug right in with no hassles.</li>
            <li> This is about the cheapest I have found the refill heads for my Sonicare and it is real nice getting it automatically.</li>
            <li> These are replacement heads so they work just like the originals. This brand gives you better checkups at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I should have trusted my better judgement when I saw the price on these. Then, I noticed the pro results printing seemed a little off from the original brushes. THEN, a week after using them, the bristles are pointed all over the place. I do not brush hard, and I never had this happen with the REAL Sonicare brushes. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> These are the real heads you would purchase from retail locations, they came in retail packaging. I only wish the larger packs were less expensive per head as I would buy 6-9 heads at once, if that were the case!&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, if you&#x27;re concerned about getting a fake, don&#x27;t worry with these. They&#x27;re the real deal.</li>
            <li> Not real sonicare. I bought these toothbrushes in December. It&#x27;s the middle of January and the toothbrush is falling off and broken down.I used my other brush far longer then 3 months and when I threw it away it was still firm and intacked. This one was literally falling off my brush handle and the bristles falling out. I know sonicare makes a excellent product and there for I believe these are fakes. The packaging looked like it was a sonicare product but it is NOT</li>
            <li> Appreciated gift to my son.</li>
            <li> These brushes are not the same as the ones that come with the brush.  VERY soft.  I got maybe 10 days&#x27; use out of each of them.  I do not recommend buying them here.  I have had no problems with the ones I have purchased at brick &amp; mortar stores.</li>
            <li> knock off are good on saw blades (Sometimes) not apparently so on tooth brushes, the knock off have harder less flexable and likely slower flexing brissels.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Are these really Philips&#x27; authentic products?  Very poor quality.  They don&#x27;t last a month.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are the type that I need for my Sonicare toothbrush.  The price is competitive, ordering is easy, and delivery is quick.</li>
            <li> The bristles wear out too fast.</li>
            <li> I was sent the small travel size brush heads.  Can I have the correct ones sent to me?  So disappointed- they&#x27;re horrible!</li>
            <li> My electric toothbrush broke so I didn&#x27;t get to use these. But they were fine</li>
            <li> This is definately a counterfeit product.  I know this because I happen to have been using the same counterfeit bought from a chinese vendor at a different website until this purchase.  What I received from Amazon is completely identical to this set in all aspects.  Packaging, the unevenness and the unstable movement of the bristles, and even the force it needs in order to be plugged in to the battery.  I wish there was an option to upload photos.  If you have been using Sonicare for a while you would be able to notice the poor quality of these brush heads right away.  Use one for couple weeks and it&#x27;ll will look like it&#x27;s been used for 3 months.  I cannot believe this seller is well and active at Amazon.  I contacted Amazon and am returning for refund.  Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are nice. Someone said the quality might not hold up to the originals but they are fine to me. No issues at all. I&#x27;m still not sure why they need to cost so much but I have not found Sonicare brush heads for less. I&#x27;m just glad to finally get replacements. I kept the first one for like a year. (Boo)</li>
            <li> I am able to purchase these brush heads for slightly less than at any local store.  In general, Sonicare brushes are over-priced everywhere.</li>
            <li> What can I say bad about them?  They&#x27;re the stock replacement for SoniCare toothbrushes.  My teeth are clean and I didn&#x27;t pay a boatload for them.</li>
            <li> Brush Heads lasted 3 - 4 weeks rather than 2 - 3 months, compared to the brush heads purchased with original  toothbrush</li>
            <li> Within the first week of use, the bristles were just mangled and unuasable.  The bristles splayed all over the place and did not provide the &amp;#34;feeling&amp;#34; they were providing any cleaning ability.  I had a 2 month old brush purchased from CVS as a generic and it was more favorable in use than the one week old purchased from Amazon from an alternative source....&lt;br /&gt;PS:  the brush did have a code on it and I am pursuing Sonicaire for replacement!</li>
            <li> Called Phillips and confirmed it was the right holder and the right brush, but, they would not snap into the holder. They suggested I contact Amazon because it could have been an old product. Contacted Amazon and my correspondence with Amazon was dropped reasons giving, it was a product review and not related to the seller. Right now I am not happy with either the seller or Amazon, I am a frequent Amazon user and a Prime member, this is the only bad review I have posted.</li>
            <li> I like these small ones so much better than those lunky big ones from a few years ago. Glad they changed the style...it&#x27;s much easier to clean!</li>
            <li> We returned this with the Sonicare toothbrush that loosed my dental work (shook the fillings out of my mouth and loosened a crown).  We bought an Oral B and are very happy with it.</li>
            <li> When they arrived, I thought the packaging and the font on the brush heads looked a little fishy, but I tried the brush heads thinking maybe Philips had updated their packaging or something. After 2-3 uses, the brushes were breaking down and bending -- It seemed like I had been using the brush for 3 months.  These are not at all like the Philips product you would buy from an authorized vendor. Returned for refund. Annoyed by the hassle.</li>
            <li> Philips Sonicare is a great product.  It works well for everyone in the family including those who have braces.  I would have preferred a slightly softer brush head.</li>
            <li> Great for the gums, just as it is advertised.</li>
            <li> brushes were very old. What a waste of $$$$-</li>
            <li> Paid a premium price thinking I was getting an authentic Philips brush.  I suspect they are knock-offs or seconds.  After a few short days, the bristles are all mashed and scattered.  Not at all like the originals.</li>
            <li> Good as they can be. I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but they look and feel the same as the one that came with my original brush.</li>
            <li> I bought extra&#x27;s brush heads for my son and daughter-in-law. They both love it as they share the main electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these multiple times as replacement brushes for my Sonicare device.  I am really pleased with the Sonicare brushing device and I think these replacements are just as strong as the ones that originally came with it but I feel that they are pretty pricey for that they are.  I will be looking for alternatives that are more cost effective.  If they were to lower the price on these devices I would be completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Something is wrong with these, they only lasted a few days and now the bristles are completely flattened and useless.  I have ordered these from Amazon before and they were legit, but not this time.</li>
            <li> I was exactly what I expected when I ordered them. Perfect!!!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush refills.</li>
            <li> This is a counterfeit item. The bristles are the same as on an one-dollar brush - nothing in common with the sharpened ones on a genuine Philips brush. Alas, I cannot leave zero stars. I want my money back!</li>
            <li> Horrible product.  Amazon refused to refund me because I didn&#x27;t open and use these until about 3 months after I ordered them.  2 of the 3 heads did not stay on the toothbrush (they literally fall off so you end up having to hold them on while brushing).  All 3 heads have the durability of the cheapest product ever - bristles fall out in your mouth or wear out incredibly fast.  Would 100% not buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product and A LOT cheaper than buying them at the store!</li>
            <li> These are excellent, a stiffer bristle is better, these do last for 3-4 months before the blue is half way. Size is perfect !</li>
            <li> Frustration Free packaging makes this a good product. I have the brush and love it since it is not too harsh</li>
            <li> Brush heads fit well with our flex-care brush. Works really well. The price seems a bit higher than the generic brushes.</li>
            <li> I love being able to just order stuff like this on Amazon and not have to worry about going down to the store just to buy this, it&#x27;s so handy get it now</li>
            <li> I received these toothbrush heads and thought since they were coming in philips sonicare packaging instead of the frustration free that they would be more legitimate...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first time I used them to brush my teeth, the bristles completely disintegrated... That has never happened to me before. Amazon totally refunded my order and I will try a different pair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually I&#x27;ve had more luck with the 6014 4-pack model they sell here on Amazon in frustration free packaging. I will be trying that one again.</li>
            <li> After less than three week&#x27;s use, the brush head, was in really bad shape.  Normally, they last for 2-3 months.  I realize that they were economically priced, but there&#x27;s no advantage if I they have to be replaced every few weeks.</li>
            <li> Good price. Just the right product. The new heads are much cheaper than the old Essence style screw on brush heads.</li>
            <li> the Diamond Clean brush heads that came with my Sonicare and do just about as good of a cleaning job as far as I can tell. The bristles on the Diamond Clean heads started to splay and fray after just a few uses. No such problem with the Proresults heads so far after six weeks.</li>
            <li> These are much more expensive in stores.  I appreciate having a source that makes using my cordless toothbrush more economical.</li>
            <li> Exact brush heads for my toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have use a sonic are toothbrush for about 25 years and love them... my teeth do not feel clean if I if I use any other type of toothbrush.  Since my teeth are not the best, every dentist I have had has told me my issues would be worse.</li>
            <li> works very well.  Very pleased with the performance.</li>
            <li> Great Phillips Sonicare Brush Heads. I would strongly recommend them to my friends. The 3 pack is a much better deal than the local pharmacy.. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these brushheads for a while now. They last the avg. time of 3 months and hold together well.</li>
            <li> I notice this item&#x27;s model number HX6013/66 is not listed on Philips&#x27; website. Their number is HX6013/64. Might be nothing, but makes me wonder if they&#x27;re fake. Other reviewers may be on to something.</li>
            <li> Perfect toothbrush heads... exactly like the ones that came with the sonicare originally. Don&#x27;t let your toothbrush get too old !</li>
            <li> It was a small, micro brush head.  It was not the same as advertised in the picture.</li>
            <li> I really like the way these toothbrushes keep my teeth and gums healthy!  I like the price/sale and the quantity.</li>
            <li> they fit my toothbrush and are so much better than my old ones.  I think I can brush my teeth and keep my hygienist happpy.</li>
            <li> The bristles have been coming out of the brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered these new brush heads with the understanding that they are original Sonicare brushes. They are not. They are cheap knock-offs. My wife and I have been using the Sonicare system for over ten years. We both replaced our brushes with these and they broke almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;The brush \\&quot;sleeve\\&quot; slid off the brush \\&quot;shaft\\&quot; and was rusty underneath. As I mentioned, a long time user and I have never had that happen. These were not significantly less expensive so I expected authentic brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Each of these heads run for at least 3 months so its still worth the money spent if you are expecting some great cleaning through your sonic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Use as intended. Had previous model. This one is better and takes up less space on counter because of smaller base</li>
            <li> I always buy extra heads to keep my Great Electric Toothbrush available and always handy to maintain my  brushing program to keep my teeth healthy and bright</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare for years but this HX6511/50  is smaller and easier to return to the holder as well as handier when traveling.</li>
            <li> I used to have an Oral B electric toothbrush.  This one&#x27;s even better.  I love that it lets you know when you are done with each quadrant of your mouth.  My teeth feel super clean!</li>
            <li> Combined with the base unit, the Philips Sonicare system is great.  I prefer the Proresults heads to the smaller heads available because of the larger area.  Each head has a few blue bristles that provide you an indication of when it&#x27;s time to replace the head.  With everyday use they last about 90-100 days, and you can get a small discount from Amazon if you sign up for automatic renewal.  Been using Sonicare for years and have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base unit comes with a 2 year warranty so save your receipt.  I just used the warranty when my base unit stopped working after about 13 months.  I called Philips, they took some info, and sent me a replacement unit the next day - it was very easy.  Great product.</li>
            <li> These are probably my favorite Sonicare brush heads. I have a HealthyWhite and I&#x27;ve tried the Diamondclean heads but they don&#x27;t seem any better. You may find some generic ones that are 3/$10, but don&#x27;t bother with that crap. I&#x27;m not saying you should buy your heads here if you can find them cheaper elsewhere, but at least buy genuine Sonicare heads.</li>
            <li> Works great and spare heads are always needed.</li>
            <li> Garbage.  Fakes. One slid off while brushing, the other took Vise-Grips to remove!</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li> Great product, however, they stated they were not going to be in one of those plastic packages so it would easier to open, and it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> seem to fit loose on my base...could be a general problem.  fast delivery</li>
            <li> Have to see review of the toothbrush.  Great brush expensive heads!</li>
            <li> I paid quite a bit for the sonic toothbrush device itself and am happy with it but surely at the price they charge they could make the bristles of these brush heads out of a higher quality, longer lasting material. Quite an item Philips and other makers produce.....a never ending money pit of a device.</li>
            <li> These work well, no issues. They fit fine on my Sonicare Healthy White 710 model toothbrush. The only reason I&#x27;m giving them 4 stars and not 5 is because the little colored bands you slip on to differentiate between the heads are all various shades of gray. Not a huge deal, but it would be nice if the colors were brighter and easier to distinguish, like primary colors. It&#x27;s like they&#x27;re asking for me to accidentally use my husband&#x27;s toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Pricey! ..but worth it.</li>
            <li> The price of the product is compareable and the quality of this product is also good, But I would like to know, How much is the comlit set price ?</li>
            <li> Great price and a quality product</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare tooth brush!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The only regret that I have is not purchasing one sooner.</li>
            <li> This product fits my so I are handlepoorly and the bristles are very soft so I don&#x27;t feel like it is doing anything. It fits so poorly that everytime I attempt to take the cover off the brush I end up pulling the whole brush head off the handle.</li>
            <li> I have used these brush heads for only 2 weeks &amp; they have already splayed &amp; lost there blue \\&quot;time to replace\\&quot; color have not had a problem in the past so am very disappointed&lt;br /&gt;Just contacted Philips directly and they are replacing the heads free of charge so my faith in the company is restored probably just got a defective package</li>
            <li> They are nice. They are toothbrushes, so not much to say. They each come with their over protective cover, which is nice. And they each have little rings ( not sure what to do with those though). But they work well.</li>
            <li> This is the best on-line price for a 3-pack of Proresults brush heads.  They are much more expensive in the stores.</li>
            <li> These do not even attach to my toothbrush. These heads are totally defective. Just got off the phone with sonicare who told me that this is a rampant problem for them. Buy directly from their site steer clear of this product!</li>
            <li> as expected , good product , recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I ordered replacement heads for my sonic care brush on Amazon. I made the mistake of trying to get a bargain this time and I got what I paid for. I have already used all 3 heads and have only had them for l3 months. They start off firm and normal, but they get soft and mushy within a few uses. Would recommend spending a little more to get the real thing from Phillips. Which I just did to replace these.</li>
            <li> First of all, the clam shell packaging from the manufacturer is extremely hard to open.  I would have ordered &#x27;frustration-free packaging&amp;#34; from Amazon BUT the price was higher for the same product.  Then after opening the package and putting the brush heads to use on our existing Philips Sonicare ProResults handle, my husband had no issues with his brush head, but mine would not fit securely and stay in place through the brushing cycle.  The same was true of the third brush head in the set.  Only one of three workable brush heads for the price is NOT a bargain in my books.</li>
            <li> These brushes are made for the Sonicare that I have. They work very well and they snap right on to the brush handle.</li>
            <li> The bristles are terrible quality and are unusable. After using it twice they were already worn out. Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.  Exact replacement head.  I wish the seven-packs were still available.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Fast shipping. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are wonderful and they work as the ones included in the original purchase. I&#x27;m not necessarily a fan of their prices, but when ordered using Auto-Shipping/Auto-ordering, one can shave a few pennies off.</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a replacement for our Philips Sonicare toothbrushes. The bristles are very soft and began to show wear after a week, unlike the ones that I purchased at Bed Bath and Beyond (which held up for three months). I was very disappointed and went back to BB&amp;B to purchase my next set pf replacements (even if they are a bit more expensive.)</li>
            <li> These brushes last about 2 weeks and then get so mushy that you can&#x27;t use them anymore. They are highly overpriced and not good quality. i have gone back to a manual tooth brush. It gets the job done much better, cheaper, and takes up less counter space.</li>
            <li> The larger brush head covers more area, and the slightly stiffer brushes last longer too. I&#x27;ve tried the compact, standard and Diamond Clean. For long term use, this product makes the most sense for me money wise.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened here, but these tips all wore out within 2 weeks. I&#x27;m not sure if it was just a bad batch or what, but for the price, that&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Great choice love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely keeps my teeth at the optimum health. I cannot go a day without my Sonicare! My scores for my oral exams have only improved since I purchased mine over 11 years ago. I have purchased for my kids and grandkids because it keeps them out of the dentist chair (if they use it).</li>
            <li> I have used sonicare toothbrush heads for a long time, but the brush heads I bought on amazon were not the same quality. After 1 use (I brush pretty gentle) two bristles are already sticking out and making brushing uncomfortable. I have never had this issue before even after 3 months of brushing. I hope they are able to fix this problem (or maybe it was just my shipment that was poor quality) bc i really do like using sonicare and would like to continue buying this product on amazon.</li>
            <li> These brushes were terrible. The bristles got matted and useless within a couple weeks. I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for years, and none of the brush heads I have purchased in person at a store have had this happen. They always last three months minimum. I can&#x27;t say these were not actually real Philips Sonicare brushes, but they sure seemed like knockoffs. Never again will I purchase these online. Get them from a real store where you know you&#x27;re getting the actual product.</li>
            <li> I go through these faster than i&#x27;m supposed to (I know, I know, don&#x27;t press so hard! it&#x27;s not easytto remember when half asleep in teh morning, however.) A three pack is just what I need.</li>
            <li> Item was delivered as promised and was as described</li>
            <li> thee heads last about 2 weeks and cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> I purchased the part number HX6013 a few times over the past two years for my Phillips Sonicare HX6930.  Always a good fit.  However, this version of the same part number doesn&#x27;t work.  The correct version has a little tab just inside the slot where the handle inserts, this holds the brush head on the handle.  This version doesn&#x27;t have that little tab and after a few seconds of use falls off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m contacting the seller for a refund.</li>
            <li> Got the replacement heads after noon using the sonic care for a couple of months, They work great and have my teeth nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Bought from RNTOD and they are clearly counterfeit.  Bristles fray almost immediately, rust forms on the bottom metal ring, and the three brushes were cut very inconsistently.  The brush looked many months old after less than a week.  Not sure if I&#x27;ll ever buy these on Amazon again after this and reading other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it would be helpful if others with both positive and negative experiences would mention who they bought it from since the seller seems to be changing constantly.</li>
            <li> We bought these replacements for our Sonicare toothbrush. They are well made and I can not say enough about the Sonicare toothbrush. My family has horrible gum disease so I take very good care of my teeth and gums. This toothbrush leave my teeth smooth just like when I get them professionally cleaned. If I could give this 10 stars I would.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads wouldn&#x27;t fit my sonic unit, so I had to return them. Of course, they were cheaper than the ones that fit! The whole transaction to buy a Phillips unit and the replacement brush heads was very distasteful!</li>
            <li> So happy to have these new tootbrushes. Will use this seller again.</li>
            <li> I replace the head every 3 months My dentist knows I will only use the Sonicare and that I replace the head every 3 months. When I use my last one, I reorder. I had to have the &amp;#34;gum&amp;#34; surgery once, and do not ever intend to do that again. I have had excellent checkups for years since I started using these.</li>
            <li> Some of the bristles are falling out and the brush heads are pretty new, so I don&#x27;t think they are as good a quality as the ones originally with the tooth brush.</li>
            <li> The product says that it snap fits to my toothbrush type (A Phillips Sonicare) but it comes loose. If I do not keep pressure on the head it will vibrate straight off, which makes it annoying to use on the softer brush settings. It fits on to the head, but does not feel or function like a correct fit.</li>
            <li> Great interaction/ product.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I love the Philips Sonicare toothbrushes...it&#x27;s that simple!  They work great!</li>
            <li> Poor Quality.These are not made by Philips the bristles wear out almost immediately. Do not buy. They are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The bristles were the softest kind there is which ended up only lasting me about two weeks each head. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> my hygienist gave me the ultimatum, &amp;#34;switch from manual toothbrushes, even soft heads or get painful gum surgery&amp;#34; so I did.  In fact, I switched the whole family over to these electric brushes and they all love them.  They do a great job, we all agree our mouths have never felt cleaner and we are looking forward to less dire predictions when i return for my next cleaning.</li>
            <li> I purchased these in November last year, when I opened the package this year, I found that the bristles were extremely weak. They completely failed within 2-3 days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has been AWESOME and completely addressed this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat Emptor ..</li>
            <li> These heads were a perfect fit, and an original product, for the Sonicare HX6013.  You can see the product number you need on the bottom of the brush holder.</li>
            <li> These are NOT the real thing! These must be counterfeit because after only a few days the bristles fell out and flattened. Do not buy! I compared them to replacement heads I purchased from Drugstore.com and those say &amp;#34;Philips Sonicare&amp;#34;. These say &amp;#34;Pro Results&amp;#34;  Save your money because these are fakes.  It has happened to me more than once and I will not buy again…</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a set of toothbrush heads....What else can be said?  I got what I wanted to support the toothbrush I had purchased.</li>
            <li> Phillips Sonicare makes good products, you just have to be careful you match the accessory with th emodel you are using. The first time I ordered I got the smaller brush head and they wear out pretty fast, I did not research the web enough to see the correct part number. Parts assemble to motor well and work great</li>
            <li> Absolutely fake. It is not original product but looks like original. If you can compare two boxes, one from GeekTrans (it&#x27;d be possible that they even do not know it is fake) and one from Philips, you can see a lot of details indicating it was copied from the original product: reproduction of colors is different, different color transitions, some texts are edited with use of different fonts, images are without details, e.g., tips of the bristles on the picture. Also, the plastic box is slightly different (the fake box is slightly deeper and narrower, but the length is the same). Sealing of the box is different. Folding of the carton inside plastic is different. Probably 20-30 differences only in the boxes.&lt;br /&gt;I did not open the box, but I can see through the plastic that bristles in the fake box are uneven and some are not straight. In the sun, the bristles have different transparency.&lt;br /&gt;I take photo evidence of it (I have even a digital microscope) and send it back for refund.</li>
            <li> even though the image is not a product photo, rest assured these brush heads will fit. Included are three heads for the Philips Sonicare Proresults toothbrush, each including a small plastic head protector.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt as clean since we started using these.  Best toothbrush ( and brushes) we have ever used.  Our dentist recommended these and we love them!</li>
            <li> Excellent brush heads.  After a bad experience with generic brush heads for a different electric toothbrush, I decided to stick with the brand name.  They are fine.</li>
            <li> Been using for over 10 years and my teeth feel much cleaner than when I brush by hand.  You really need to change every 3 months.</li>
            <li> Brushes seem to be pretty high quality. One of them had a little divot on the handle and caught on my lip but I was able to smooth it down.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. It is smaller than the last model I used and is much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Great price for three replacements. I had no problems attaching the brush heads to the Sonicare. Would recommend anyone to purchase , if your looking for replacement brushes for your Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Not sure how these could be fake or counterfeit as other reviewers have said. They are exactly what was on the toothbrush handle. Exactly what you can buy at big box stores. The set I got is definitely the real thing and perfect.</li>
            <li> Rats....now I am stuck with them and I have had them too long to return, I think. They might be good but I will never know.</li>
            <li> Made in &amp;#34;guess where?&amp;#34; plastic replacement brushes should come in a 50 pack for $2.  Since they dont, I shopped here.</li>
            <li> It is great to be able to find the brush heads for Sonicare and not to have to replace the entire assembly.  Sonicare is the preferable brushing technique for good dental care.</li>
            <li> Zero stars if possible -- These rotate right off the toothbrush as soon as the toothbrush is turned on! They are obviously of substandard materials, probably imitations as other customers have found. We found workable heads at Bed, Bath, and Beyond.</li>
            <li> never again will i buy from these sellers.  they are genuine  FAKES.  they look good tho,  but don&#x27;t last more than a week</li>
            <li> The brush heads didn&#x27;t last long at all and I question the seller.  Please be advised that sonicare brush heads generally never &amp;#34;Fray&amp;#34; but do when they are extremely old.  I wonder if these were real sonicare heads?</li>
            <li> this was the same no. as the original toothbrush, so I was sure would fit. What can you say about a tooth brush it cleaned your teeth jusy like the original one did, they work great.</li>
            <li> They work great. Cleans teeth much better that the cheap battery types.</li>
            <li> these brushes are perfect and save toothpaste since the brush is smaller and the vibrating gets between the teeth and gum</li>
            <li> I tried to use this product and it did not fit the model of the toothbrush it said it will fit, Philips Soniccare HealthyWhite. Though the product details says it works for this model.</li>
            <li> The new brush heads Philips Sonicare HX6013 appear to be defective.  They completely broke down within one week.  We have been using these for many years and this is the first time they have been so soft and not able to clean teeth effectively.  We are very unhappy with the two packages of three heads we were sent.  We have thrown out those pkgs and have purchaced one new pkg. of three to try.  It appears that these two pkgs. we received were defective.</li>
            <li> I love the quality of the Philips heads but these seem to not fit as well on my version of the Sonicare even though they are claimed to be 100% compatible. So there is some instability when using them. Still, they work just fine and provide a very vigorous brushing experience as promised.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and my teef love them!</li>
            <li> These heads started shedding plastic strands the first time I used them and constantly thereafter. Very low quality. Not what I expected for 24 dollars.</li>
            <li> My experience has been similar to other reviewers.  After only two weeks of use, the blue stripe had faded significantly.  I&#x27;m just keeping track of of when it is time to change it out.  I&#x27;m not sure if the quality is different than others I have had or not.</li>
            <li> One recommendation. Don&#x27;t buy the knock-offs, buy the real thing as the cleaning function is much better. These are the real things.</li>
            <li> Just like the one that came with the brush.  Excellent wear characteristics.</li>
            <li> I ordered some knock-off replacements because they were much less expensive. Unfortunately, sometimes you get what you pay for. After a few weeks the cheaper brush heads would fall off in the middle of brushing. The Real-Deal works great!</li>
            <li> Great price for replacement heads</li>
            <li> These have worked wonders. I had a sonicare brush in storage for about a year because I didnt have a charger or new heads.. These heads are just standard brush heads but that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re paying for. Good product</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!! It&#x27;s a counterfeit, when compared to the brush head that came with my Sonicare toothbrush this 3 pack brush heads were obviously different after a couple of uses. First of all the brush head base does not slide on to the toothbrush tightly and is loose. Also the bristles on these were bent up after a few uses, as compared to the original brush head that still remains more straighten after months of use. In addition, the quality of  printed words on the toothbruth &amp;#34;ProResults&amp;#34; were noticeably different. Just don&#x27;t buy them, or buy from a more legit source (the Philips website), I thought I was getting a deal but I ended up getting fakes..not worth it.</li>
            <li> they are what I needed</li>
            <li> I am disappointed as the toothbrush heads don&#x27;t seem to fit properly</li>
            <li> Love Philips Sonicare.  Will never brush with a manual toothbrush again.  The only bad thing is the price of these brush heads.</li>
            <li> Fake brush heads that don&#x27;t properly fit sonicare.  The brush heads easily slide off while brushing, making them almost useless.</li>
            <li> The right item, Quick and the right price!  Doesn&#x27;t take much to keep this consumer happy.  I will actually be ordering more of these for my friend, who also has a sonicare!  thanks!</li>
            <li> I really like my Sonicare tooth brush a lot and change the brushes very frequently to keep it as effective as possible.</li>
            <li> These replacements heads fit and worked great like the original. Price was the best I found and would purchase them again.</li>
            <li> My dentist had a good deal on the Philips Sonicare and recommended it for better gum health. My dentist LOVES technology and his office always has leading-edge equipment. That&#x27;s why I really like him--he even made a crown right in the office with a light-based computer-design device that molded the crown on site. Fantastic. So when he pointed out this toothbrush was better than my previous model, I took his advice. And it&#x27;s as good as he said. The longer brush, with the contours, gets into the recesses of the gums and teeth. The action is ultrasonic and really cleans. These brushes are more like toothbrushes compared to the small round versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three pack is convenient; one thing you have to do is change up the brush when it wears. I gave up trying to buy these at the local pharmacy; they&#x27;re locked into a case (theft-prone) and they don&#x27;t always have the right brush for my model. I can order these on auto-delivery and always have a new brush at hand.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd purchase of these Philips Sonicare Proresults brush heads from Amazon. They are great!! Each brush head came with it&#x27;s own cover. Can&#x27;t beat these prices. Under $20 for each purchase. :)</li>
            <li> These heads are borderline impossible to get off.  They took the metal tip of my toothbrush base right out of the base they were soo tight.  Broke my tooth brush.  I should sue for this product being sooooo horrible!!!</li>
            <li> Since a brush head was included with my Sonicare  I have not used the HX6013 heads, but they were delivered on time and in good condition at a very reasonable price. I would not hesitate to place an order from this company in the future</li>
            <li> These are the exact heads that are sold in stores but at a cheaper price. The three pack is in the same packaging.</li>
            <li> I wanted replacement heads for my Sonicare (which is awesome and I highly recommend).  Well, these are replacement heads.  Quality is high, I find that the heads last for a pretty long time, certainly longer than some traditional toothbrushes I have had in the past.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 packages of 3 brush heads. 1st brush went soft after 2 days of use. Same with 2nd. Returned all 6.&lt;br /&gt;Must be a bad batch as I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush for many years with no trouble.</li>
            <li> Product fit and worked per instructions. Noticed after a couple of weeks a metal lock ring inside brush stem began to rust and contaminate the stand. Hadn&#x27;t seen that before with OEM brush.</li>
            <li> After using these brush heads for 2 days I noticed that my mouth was bleeding and that all of the bristles had worn down and started to fall out. Save your time and money and order from reputable source!! SELLER NAME &#x3D; \\&quot;House And Home\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This was the worst product I ever bought from Amazon.  If i had read the reviews, I never would have bought them but I figured Amazon did not sell garbage.  Boy was I wrong.  I used one head for three days and it looked like I had used it for a year.  The bristles were all askew and there was no firmness to the brush head att all.  Rather than return them, I threw them away as a reminder to never rely on a product provider&#x27;s integrity but rather read tbe reviews.</li>
            <li> Despite seeming that they&#x27;re official Sonicare brushes, these are NOT. They vibrate right off of the base when using as they don&#x27;t fit snugly enough. These are knock offs and have proved to be completely useless. I called Sonicare thinking it was a fault with the base, and they kindly sent me a replacement, and I realized it was these inferior replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> Good price.  Delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> not a genuine sonicare product. fits and works for a few weeks before the brush heads are toast. if you replace every three months you&#x27;ll eventually be brushing your teeth with plastic towards the end. avoid.</li>
            <li> This is the worst toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever put in my mouth. Yes, it fits the Sonicare but doesn&#x27;t compare to the real Sonicare toothbrushes.  The ad is deceiving! I thought they were Sonicare not ProResults!!  This picture is after 2 weeks of use!!</li>
            <li> Great 3-pack. Love the Sonicare system. Shipped promptly and packed well.</li>
            <li> Sonicare Toothbrush Heads...pure junk! The toothbrush heads lost shape, fell apart, and had to be thrown away after only 3 weeks!&lt;br /&gt;We have had our Sonicare Toothbrushs for over 5 years and never had a problem like this before. Having gone through many replacement toothbrush heads, this is a first. Since I will never buy from this site again, I will never have this problem again...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4vegasgirl.</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads fit my machine like a glove.  I did not know how these Sonicare brushes would fit, but I was fearful for no reason at all.  I did a bunch of research to see exactly which replacement heads fit which brush handle.  I now conclude that they are universal.  These are a fine product.</li>
            <li> Great price, wonderful delivery and the correct toothbrush head. Could you want anything else?</li>
            <li> they have taken a page from the high end razor marketing book.  under price the expensive part, and over price the cheap, must replace part.  Love the tooth brush, hate paying being gouged  for the brush heads</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare toothbrush and I have been using it for a few years now. I ordered this brush heads and started using them last Saturday. I must say that comparing to my brushes I had before, they are super soft. I read the description and nowhere here says that the are soft. Very disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Buy genuine philips! you will not regret. The cheap generics simply not work. You save a few bucks, yes, but do you really want to brush your teeth with some poor quality crap made somewhere you never visit for your whole life?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy original only from now.</li>
            <li> I used this one for just a month, and it curved at the end. My old Philips Sonicare Brush Head is much better than this, but it is not easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The absolute best batch of Phillips Sonicare Proresults Brush heads I have ever purchased came from Amazon vendor Braun Wholesale, and I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why was this batch the best by far? The brush heads last far longer than any Proresults brush head I&#x27;ve purchased from anywhere else. With these I actually get about 3 months from a brush head. Want data? February 11, 2014 I bought 3 three-packs, a total of nine brush heads for my wife and I. Today, November 9, 2014 we still have four left to use. Factoring in the time to wear out two other brush heads, that&#x27;s better than 3 months/per head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;ve bought from other vendors I was lucky to get 6-8 weeks from a brush head. Why such a dramatic difference, when those others also had the same Proresults HX6013 product number? I don&#x27;t know, but after this fortunate, accidental discovery, I will only buy from one vendor.&lt;br /&gt;Braun Wholesale - Details&lt;br /&gt;Storefront:www.amazon.com/shops/A3TBFTOSW3II4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some discussion in these reviews about counterfeit/knock-off brush heads. I don&#x27;t know about that but it seems very strange that my experience shows there is such HUGE variance in product durability. Seems hard to believe that a big company like Phillips Sonicare would not be able to maintain a uniform quality, so maybe something else is going on. I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do know is that when I&#x27;m ready to buy more brush heads, I&#x27;m going to seek out Braun Wholesale. Sad to say they are not on the list of vendors from which Amazon is offering this particular product today. I&#x27;m spoiled now and I want the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, Sonicare is the best and even with lesser brush heads is worth the price in terms of excellent oral health.</li>
            <li> I had to put them on backwards to get them to stay on my Sonicare. Not a big deal but you might not think of trying them oriented differently.</li>
            <li> These brushes are better than my previous set.&lt;br /&gt;The previous set was for upto 1 tooth, this is for upto 2 tooth at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Much better scrubbing between teeth, a problem the previous brushes had that they could not go between teeth very well.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re a little stiffer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love em!</li>
            <li> Best thing for your teeth.</li>
            <li> my first 2 toothbrush heads worked great but i just put the last one on and it falls right off! must be defective but i&#x27;m really annoyed</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement brushes for my sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> No surprise, I have been using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> The 3-pack I received were terrible quality knockoffs of the Sonicare product. The thin, flimsy bristles did not stand up to one brushing before looking like they&#x27;ve been used for months. They are ineffective &amp; defective and I&#x27;ll be returning these immediately.</li>
            <li> Was hesitant to buy these because of some bad reviews.  Very happy with this purchase.  Fits out Sonicare perfectly and the price was great.</li>
            <li> After buying a &amp;#34;generic brand&amp;#34; from Walmart that didn&#x27;t fit and kept coming off when I brushed, I bought these and they were perfect.  Generic brands don&#x27;t always save you money!  These came quickly and work great!</li>
            <li> one of the heads would not stay on the brush handle and had to be discarded. so for two of the six are working fine. So out of two 3 pack one brush had to be tossed without use</li>
            <li> Ordered the brush heads and got what I paid for. Could&#x27;ve probably bought a cheaper substitute but why should I? I save by not brushing my teeth that often. Don&#x27;t tell anyone.</li>
            <li> The heads were fine for a few uses then they vibrated off the toothbrush entirely. I would not buy them again or recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> These are NOT manufacturer-quality brush heads and they DO NOT WORK! After less than one week they are no longer staying fastened to the brush. Do not buy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a smaller Brush head than the original which had more bristles, white with the same the two greens</li>
            <li> Not sure if they are actual product</li>
            <li> The description says Philips Sonicare on it, but I have my doubts that these are OEM originals.  The set I got had a lot of unevenly cut bristles and seemed to wear out noticeably quicker than the ones I&#x27;ve bought at a retail store like Target.  I mean, they seem to work okay, but the quality could be better, IMO.</li>
            <li> works great and fits as described</li>
            <li> I purchased these and found that they damaged my Flexcare toothbrush. The metal ferrule at the base of the brush head should have been stainless steel; it was not! I recently examined my toothbrush because it appeared to lose power and was making unusual noises.I discovered that the metal had corroded and abraded the rubber gaiter around the oscillating spindle; the rubber was black from this abrasion and also split open allowing moisture to enter the sealed unit. The brush head fitted poorly and did not snap on, it was loose which contributed to the abrasion. These replacement brush heads are a very poor replica of the genuine article: The specs are not the same. They were not cheap (comparable to a discount price at Costco). When I bought them, I did not consider that they could have been counterfeit! I am annoyed by expensive mistake; my $120 dollar toothbrush is ruined as a result. This will make me wary of ever buying from unknown sources. I&#x27;m disappointed that this fraudulent commerce goes on under the roof of Amazon! Extremely disappointed!</li>
            <li> It clearly says &#x27;three-pack&#x27; in the description and on the package, but there were only two brush heads in the package.</li>
            <li> These brush heads work great with my sonicare. They&#x27;re not too hard and they don&#x27;t hurt my gums. They last a surprisingly long time before needing to be replaced. And amazon sells these at a great price.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand for many years.  They advertise they are to last 3 months, but I usually have to change mine before that.  I like the difference in the health of my teeth.  Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband(and I could use it too) and it was one of the best things I have ever bought him!! We both love it and it had made a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I am not buying original brushes anymore. They turned bad very quickly. The generic ones actually last longer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my philips sonicare toothbrush and now I feel complete with these toothbrush replacement heads.  This was a great purchase, bc you must switch the toothbrush heads out when the blue strip turns white...I like this 3 pack b/c that gives you about 9 mo until the next order...</li>
            <li> great product. I love my sonicare tooth brush and these heads are amazing. I would definately recommend to everyone. thanks</li>
            <li> These are worthless! Don&#x27;t waste your money! The Bristles are so much softer than the ones that came with our toothbrush. They don&#x27;t work at all. After using them for a couple weeks my husband started seeing stains on his teeth!</li>
            <li> These brush heads wear out very quickly. They last about a week. They&#x27;re obviously not genuine. You can find genuine ones on Amazon, but these are fake.</li>
            <li> These do not seem to be original.  They fit the toothbrush but bristles wear out after a week or so.  I will not buy these again!</li>
            <li> These are extremely week brushes. It&#x27;s like brushing with feathers instead of a toothbrush. It would be nice to show the firmness of this product since these are definitely on the soft, soft, soft side of the scale.</li>
            <li> As advertised and nothing to complain about - came in retail package.</li>
            <li> OEM is always better!</li>
            <li> The first time we used the heads one of them fell apart into pieces.  Holding my breath to see if the other two will fall apart as well.</li>
            <li> The pack of brush heads I received are obvious counterfeits. I noticed that my teeth were not feeling as clean after using one of these heads and that my brush bristles looked prematurely old and splayed out. I compared mine to my husband’s brush head (he was still using a brush head from a pack that we purchased in person from a big box store), and these do not pass a side by side comparison. I am so annoyed, as I did not open these and make this discovery until after my return policy window had expired.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is for sure the best tooth brush I have ever purchased and I would never buy generic heads again. These brush heads and great and I would buy them again!  They are a great value and they each last about 4 months. My dentist says my teeth look great and I haven&#x27;t have any issues with my teeth since I switch to this brush. I love it and have now got my kids, spouce and my mother on the same one!</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are great!</li>
            <li> Great Price. Fast delivery! Very satisified !</li>
            <li> Buyer, beware!  Like others who have complained about these, we assumed they were genuine Sonicare brush heads and of the same quality as the original. Wrong. They are extremely soft and as such, virtually ineffectual in properly cleaning your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time we will purchase these from a local retailer and strongly advise others to do the same.</li>
            <li> Very happy with item, good price, works well !</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and such a bargain at these prices.</li>
            <li> great product.  good seller</li>
            <li> As others have pointed out, these are likely fakes.  The packaging and printing all look genuine, but the first one lasted one month before it refused to stay on.  The second one lasted six months and is still usable.  The third one wouldn&#x27;t stay on right out of the package.  One out of three at this price is robbery.  They should be ashamed to offer these to their customers.  I am using generic ones now, and they work just fine at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> love this toothbrush and these are required items for right functioning</li>
            <li> I liked the product but one is defective and wont stay on my unit.  Check al lthree before you use them.  It is not too late to return the defective brush.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery.  Product as advertised.  I haven&#x27;t had to use them yet as they are &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34; for my new toothbrush, but they look just like the ones that came with the brush.</li>
            <li> Good quality and price</li>
            <li> These have to be counterfeit. As many other have noted, they begin to show significant signs of wear within a week or so.</li>
            <li> It fit perfectly and was at a much better prices than I was able to find in stores. Including target and walmart.</li>
            <li> These are replacements and as good as the original. As expected. I&#x27;d really like to see all the unnecessary plastic packaging go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sticker on the package stated &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; to which I am thankful that they were not used or refurbished.</li>
            <li> Great price!  I bought some off-brand replacements from Groupon and my advice - DON&#x27;t!  They din&#x27;t stay on the brush and were a waste of time and money.  Stick with the original.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads keep my Sonicare working at peak performance. I like the color change that indicates when to change the head.</li>
            <li> These are the brushes i wanted and expected.  Everything is fine with them.  It was easy to find and purchase.  Glad i searched at Amazon to find these brushes.</li>
            <li> A real improvement over previous Philips Sonicaire electric toothbrush heads. It is too soon for us to tell, but it seems likely that this design will have far less problems accumulating internal grit and likely will not go dead because of crud accumulating around the internal magnets.</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this product. The feeling after brushing is great, feels really clean. So good I bought one to have in our winter home so I wouldn&#x27;t have to carry back and forth.</li>
            <li> Nice repalcement brushes for this product. This is the best price I have found on the internet. Will be ordering these againg very soon.</li>
            <li> My dental check ups have improved since I switched from a hand held toothbrush to this sonic toothbrush. Easy and quick to use, and really works great. Buy it.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush refills heads were not in a sealed pack which concerned me.  I did not return them but did sanitize the heads.  Would not reorder this product from this provider.</li>
            <li> My husband uses these heads and is very satisfied.  The wear strip makes it easy to keep track of when to change the brush.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase the Sonicare HX6013/64 Brush Head 3 Pack at the same time as Sonicare HX6972/10 for convenience. I replace the brush heads every 3 months.</li>
            <li> Ordered these to go with my new Hx6731/34 toothbrush that I purchased at the same time, they&#x27;re as advertised and the best price I found.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd time purchasing these heads. They are the same ones you would buy at the store, but less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again</li>
            <li> Great product; quick service, will order again!</li>
            <li> These will handle my needs for a year or so</li>
            <li> These are replacement heads that do as they&#x27;re intended. I hate going to bed bath and beyond for replacement heads because I end up buying other stuff I didn&#x27;t intend to buy. I&#x27;m glad I can get these on line.</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt and product as promised.  This brush is better than some other Skincare choices.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly as usually.</li>
            <li> What is displayed is not what I got. Did not fit my toothbrush.  I am to lazy to return so I threw them away.</li>
            <li> I ordered these at the beginning of the year and am about to run out after 9 months. However I will not be buying these again as I&#x27;ve noticed that these brush heads are not quite the same quality as the ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. They looked off as soon as I first opened the box and the blue bristles never wore off, unlike the ones I&#x27;d used earlier. I don&#x27;t think my brushing habits have changed so it must have been the brush heads. Also the Philips logo on the head looks of slightly less quality. So take your chances with these at  your own risk.</li>
            <li> Very misleading, I got only 2 brush heads instead of 3 in the picture!</li>
            <li> These are good quality and last 3 to 6 months of brushing twice daily. Price is average but quality is good. I would buy it again</li>
            <li> Love it, received sooner than expected. Cleans your teeth excellently, I would highly recommend the brush and the selling company.</li>
            <li> they do not fit my brush</li>
            <li> very good improvement over the original</li>
            <li> The genuine HX6013 Philips Proresults Brush Heads are a good choice.  The only issue I have is that the blue strip fades in a few weeks instead of 3 months.  So it not a good indication of when the brush needs to be replaced.</li>
            <li> They work well with the sonic care tooth brush.  Only think I don&#x27;t like is the indicator changes color too quickly,  I just ignore it.</li>
            <li> The only way to buy SonicCare replacement brush heads is through Amazon.  Subscribe and Save lowers the price even more and makes sure that you are changing brush heads when they need to be.  Finally frustration free packaging provides scissor free access to the brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SonicCare tooth brushes give you a dentist office type clean each time you brush, my whole family loves ours.</li>
            <li> I love my toothbrush! Since I bought my brush my dentist visits are shorter and there is very limited if any tarter or scraping needed - this product and brush heads is a must have!</li>
            <li> These heads are FAKE.  After one use, the brush was useless.  I don&#x27;t understand why Amazon continues to sell these when so many of the reviews let it be know that they are counterfeit.  I thought they were Phillips Sonicare brushes so I didn&#x27;t bother reading the reviews.  I&#x27;ll know better next time.  Shame on you Amazon.</li>
            <li> These brushes are counterfeit.  I spoke with Phillips Customer Service and they have been receiving these complaints.  The &amp;#34;ProResults&amp;#34; labeled on the brush heads are more raised and appear as a &amp;#34;bold&amp;#34; font in comparison to the real Phillips heads.  Additionally, there is a numerical code on the counterfeit brush heads.  Sweetness Elements should retract this product as it is very evident by the feedback on Amazon and through Phillips that they are counterfeit.  The bristles on the brushes basically fall apart after only a couple of uses, so they are completely worthless.</li>
            <li> I remove the head from my toothbrush after every use and two of the three heads have pulled apart after only a couple of weeks of use. While it&#x27;s interesting to see the inner workings of the toothbrush head, they now don&#x27;t fit back on very well and I&#x27;m not happy that I&#x27;ll have to buy more replacements so soon.</li>
            <li> A lot of the ones sold on amazon are fakes. The brushes &amp;#34;collapsed&amp;#34; after about 4-5 days of light use. Compared with ones I bought from the store that lasted a 1-2 months. YMMV depending on the seller.</li>
            <li> If you use a Sonicare this is the one to get.</li>
            <li> Too soft for my needs</li>
            <li> Have worked very well</li>
            <li> Same as described, good product..I love it</li>
            <li> This item lasts a lot longer than the recommended 3 months. It&#x27;s not too gentle, nor too firm. Fits on my Philips Sonicare from 2012.</li>
            <li> Ordered with little apprehension and have not been disappointed. Hope the integrity of the brushes remains in great shape. Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Sonicare devotee, but shopping for replacement brush heads is a nuisance. I&#x27;m happy to order these - these brush heads are much, much cheaper than the replacements in retail stores in my area (though they are exactly the same product) and the packaging is less fussy.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t be certain, I believe that the replacement heads I received may be a knockoff. I received three heads in the same plastic packaging you&#x27;d find in the store, however one of them does not fit correctly and makes extremely loud sounds when the toothbrush is on. Additionally, the heads which do fit correctly are showing signs of rust, which I never noticed with the heads I received with my Sonicare. While I can&#x27;t be certain that these aren&#x27;t the &#x27;real deal,&#x27; in a way it doesn&#x27;t matter: if they&#x27;re genuine Philips products then I&#x27;m disappointed with the quality control, if they&#x27;re knockoffs then I&#x27;m disappointed with being mislead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not planning to buy these replacement heads again.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because the price and I have been ordering replacement brush heads for approx 3 years now.  These do not appear to be legit OEM manufacturer, or they are a defective batch/bad factory/etc.  The reasons: (1) The heads do not fit well.  They fit very tight and I take them off every day because my wife and I use the same base.  The head would come off the bottom base before actually coming off the Flexcare base.  This happened to all three of the heads.  (2) The branding on the brush is blurry compared to other brushes I ordered and (3) the inside metal of these immediately stared to rust after 48 hours a sure sign that these are fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the 4 pack from Amazon and compared them to these, and these are clearly not the same, again either a fake or a defect.</li>
            <li> I love it that I can easily order and receive new brush heads for my sonicare ....this company promptly sends replacements as advertised ...</li>
            <li> I believe these are fake Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are too thin and too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few uses there were all mushed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy!</li>
            <li> Too narrow and hard, not like the original ones! Changed from Sonicare to Oral B, its a lighter toothbrush... No regrets!</li>
            <li> After some research, Amazon&#x27;s price was the best and I always trust their services.  I will buy again when time for next replacement cycle.</li>
            <li> I change out every months so you need to have the extra heads.  Keeping my teeth in my mouth is a priority.</li>
            <li> What on earth is going on. I am a long time user of sonicare. These brushes are odd. They are cut strangely. They keep brushing up against my gums. I asked for a refund which was provided. I&#x27;ll be throwing the other two away.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes with the Sonicare. It makes my mouth feel really clean. No problems yet,but have not had it very long.</li>
            <li> Great brushes.  fit perfectly on the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Apart for some initial miscommunications, Product arrived in timely and good fashion.&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with service and the product itself</li>
            <li> Love these brushheads; excellent price and shipping time; will buy again...</li>
            <li> Excellent product and works as advertised!</li>
            <li> I have used Sonicare tooth brushes for years and this this brush cleans good it is easy to clean and replace .</li>
            <li> These bristles have a few bristles which are colored which is designed to wear off as a reminder to replace the brush head but the color all wore off the first head after about 2 weeks rather than the 3 months it says it should last and so far the bristles don&#x27;t look like they need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> wrong item-returned it</li>
            <li> Makes the 2 minute rule very easy to comply with.  Recommended by my dentist and the best check-ups I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
            <li> These brushes and the entire Sonicare system of brushing my teeth were recommended by my dentist, and they are excellent.  Sonicare brush heads and related products help to reduce the amount of tartar that can accumulate on my teeth, and my gums are also healthy because the brushes gently stimulate the gums, cleanse beneath the gum line, resulting in no bleeding nor gum inflammations/infections.  I recommend the entire Sonicare teeth cleaning equipment without reservations.</li>
            <li> Good price good product</li>
            <li> sonicare is the only brush we&#x27;ve used for several years and now, having had several dentist trips and them saying what a great job of brushing we do, we are firm believers in the product and will be using it for years to come</li>
            <li> These do not compare to the diamond clean heads at all. The bristles are far too soft and appear to be wearing out already. I will be searching for something closer to the diamond clean heads next time.</li>
            <li> Seems that it is a hit and miss about this product. Unfortunately I was one of the \\&quot;Miss\\&quot;. I used all three within a month (max). These brush heads fall apart so quickly, I would imagine my teeth to be made of steel. Ironically, I have been ordering these brushes a few times over the last few years, clicking on the same link every-time. This is the first time that I received a faulty product.</li>
            <li> THIS IS SO BAD. IT ONLY CAN LAST FOR NOT EVEN A WEEK</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare brush for several years now. These brushes do a great job of cleaning my teeth, especially behind my back teeth, where it&#x27;s hard to work a manual brush.</li>
            <li> good item but very expensive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like buying ink cartridges for a printer - expensive but necessary.  Four stars still for the overall Sonicare products.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are defective.  I used one for 3 months and it worked fine.  The other 2 won&#x27;t stay on the handle.  They come off in my mouth and when rinsing them they fly off into the sink.  I bought 3 more at Walmart and they work fine so it is the brush heads that are defective and not the handle.  I have not returned these as I bought them over 3 months ago and do not have the package they came in but I would suggest that anyone who purchases these should test them immediately upon receipt and return them if defective.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell if the quality is as good as the origional?  I am assuming these are knockoff brush heads because they are about 1/3 the price of what Phillips charges.  They look good.  Can&#x27;t say I see the need to require a signature for delivery however.  After all they are only brush heads.</li>
            <li> These work just fine.  Maybe I am being a little petty, but these did not come packaged like the photo. They came in a really difficult, hard to cut open hard plastic sealed up cover. You know the type I mean, they make you break out in a sweat. And the little color coded rings... maybe I can&#x27;t figure it out for some reason but I cannot for the life of me get them to look like they do in the photo and fit (they&#x27;re a tad small and don&#x27;t stretch bit a wee bit). So my dughters and I just let them dangle. We all have our own brush heads now and clean teeth,</li>
            <li> Very fine product!  it cleans and massages well. Nothing else needs to be said. Had this electric toothbrush for several years.</li>
            <li> Pretty standard here. The Philips system is amazing and has changed my life forever. These head replacements are the cheapest, cost-wise, that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Depending on pressure applied during brushing, each toothbrush head lasts about 3 months. Have been using this replacement brand for about two years, no complaints.</li>
            <li> 2 out of 3 of the brush heads do not fit properly on the Philips Sonicare HX6511/50 toothbrush. The fit is much too tight and requires a strong, awkward  grip where the brush head meets the toothbrush to remove. If one tries to remove the brush head by pulling on the neck it separates into two pieces leaving the brush had base remaining firmly attached to the toothbrush. I have stronger finger grip compared to most (can bend a beer bottle cap closed by pinching it between my index finger and thumb) yet I have to use a towel to grip the brush head base in order to remove this after each use - I share the toothbrush with my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried to use the brush head with it not fully attached so that it would be easy to remove; however, most attempts resulted in the brush head sliding off the toothbrush. Through daily experimentation I was able to find a &amp;#34;sweet spot&amp;#34;, e.g. not-to-loose and not-too-tight fit, but it required careful manipulation while brushing that became too much of a nuisance even for a challenge-seeking, geeky engineer such as myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using one of the two tight-fitting brush heads about 5 weeks ago. Since that time and after more than 50 tight-fitting mate and de-mate cycles there has not been any noticeable loosening of the brush head to toothbrush fit. It is still as hard to remove as it was the first time it was mated - this is obviously a subjective observation since I do not own a stress/strain gauge that could be fitted to make actual measurements : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If these are truly made by Philips, then the company needs to re-torque its quality control process for this item! I have been pleased with the toothbrush and often wonder how I got along without it for all those years. It provides a &amp;#34;dentist-clean&amp;#34; feel in my mouth every time it&#x27;s used - until the brush head wears out after 9 or 10 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would appreciate suggestions to find the &#x27;real&#x27; replacement brush heads since I would not like to repeat my earlier research efforts.t like to repeat my earlier research efforts.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch, but I&#x27;m having a problem with these where the bristles keep coming out. It&#x27;s only a couple here and there, so it&#x27;s manageable, but it&#x27;s not fun when they come out in my mouth while I&#x27;m brushing. I have to inspect them before each use and pull out any loose ones with tweezers to try to avoid this. I&#x27;ve never had this problem with these heads before, so maybe these are discount because they failed QC or something. Or like I said, maybe I got a bad batch. I think I&#x27;ll buy them from a more trusted source from now on.</li>
            <li> So happy to have found the toothbrush and also these replacement heads.  Great price and great service!! Bought my husband one too!!</li>
            <li> Following a recommendation from my dentist, over five years ago, I have used Sonicare as the primary means of cleaning my teeth.  The replacement heads from Amazon are reasonably priced and arrive in 5 to 7 days.</li>
            <li> Not very good. Too soft. Trying to work out if they are F A K E. my other brush replacements were good quality and of medium firmness</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> works well.  My choppers actually felt cleaner and polished after the first use.</li>
            <li> Timely delivery and good brush heads.</li>
            <li> will order fromthem agin. It came as said it would.</li>
            <li> These were worse than terrible. After 1-3 uses the insert that goes over the post on the toothbrush pulled out when taling the brush off of the toothbrush. This happened to half of what was in the package and I threw the rest out.</li>
            <li> They work great, Perfect fit.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit as well as the original which originally concerned me, but it fits well enough and works fine.  I tried the off-brand version that didn&#x27;t fit at all.  I&#x27;d like to see the brush heads on sale in my lifetime.  Really gets teeth clean. Better than regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Might as well order them here and save yourself the trouble.  I found out these heads should be changed more often than what I was doing.  Its worth it to invest in your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have my Sonicare for more than two years now and I love it. my most recent order of brush heads was a disappointment however. i have always used the standard ones and they lasted about 10 to 12 weeks. the latest order is different. you can feel the bristles are different. I have used it for about two weeks now and the bristles look worse than the old ones after 12 weeks. this is what I would expect from the cheap generic ones but not from the official brand. Philips please go back to your old suppliers or change back to your old bristle design. this is not working. maybe I just got a bad batch. I will try some from the local pharmacy and compare.</li>
            <li> Works as good as the ones that came with the unit. Great replacements!!</li>
            <li> The brush is fine but it spins off the &amp;#34;easy care&amp;#34; brush we have when being used. This is also a repeat order but the earlier group brushes did not do this. My husband uses this brush head while I use the ultra soft sensitive brush heads</li>
            <li> I ordered three and received a package of two heads.  Not as advertised.</li>
            <li> These do the job and do it well. My dentist insists these be replaced every 3 months, I opt for 4.</li>
            <li> Quality is good . Would like to see price a bit lower.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these and this brushing system to anyone and everyone.  I find myself more inclined to do a much better job brushing my tooth.</li>
            <li> I purchased these brush heads to give as a Christmas gift, as I had given the toothbrush last Christmas.  The recepient was very pleased.</li>
            <li> They are a PITA to put on and take off the handle because they fit TOO tight. But, other than that, they are brush heads...they brush my teeth. What else can I say??</li>
            <li> Excellent price for refills. Not too hard on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Mine were shipped quickly, arrived early and were real Philips Sonicare Product, not an imitation.</li>
            <li> I always been using this toothbrushes and I&#x27;ll continue buying them because they are great and cheaper than other stores sells them.</li>
            <li> Ahh, clean teeth. Awesome.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T FORGET TO REPLACE YOUR BRUSH HEADS EVERY 3 MONTHS.</li>
            <li> Cheap knock offs. Bristles keep falling out of the tooth brush. Base will not stay on with one.</li>
            <li> Quality is great Sonicare is great. Little pricey but cheaper than stores.</li>
            <li> Pretty soft but does the trick. I wish they would specify the bristle type.</li>
            <li> I would say that I wished the bush head itself was a bit larger, but overall, it&#x27;s fine.  It&#x27;s a brush head, it works like a brush head, not much more can be said about that.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect replacement brush heads for my sonic toothbrush.  I found it is much easier to shop on line for this product.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are great. The newer. I have braces so it doesn&#x27;t last more than 2 mons with me (sometimes less) but I love it. Not too hard on my teeth, yet does a wonderful job</li>
            <li> crazy expensive, but worth it for clean they make your teeth</li>
            <li> These are necessary if you use a Sonicare toothbrush.  Important.  Replacement the heads regularly and rinse it good in hottest faucet water after each use.  Same should be done with regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Needed to get new brush heads, this 3 pack lasts me 9 months.</li>
            <li> Brushes are very soft and with 2 week of use were ready for replacement.</li>
            <li> Really does not fit my particular toothbrush  - works, but not well.</li>
            <li> Tried and true perfiormance.</li>
            <li> These work just fine, but make sure it is compatible with your Sonicare system. This does not fit perfectly with the Diamond system.</li>
            <li> The original head on the brush lasted over 3 months.  I put on a head from this set 2 weeks ago and it is already worn out.  The bristles are pushed to the side.  Switching to another head after 2 weeks is not what I bargained for.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I ordered the nice travel case for these as well!</li>
            <li> The replacements do not last very long. A lot to pay for an item with a short lifespan.</li>
            <li> I accidentally bought this thinking it would fit my electric toothbrush. Turns out I have a different kind of toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Very good.  Cheaper thru Amazon</li>
            <li> My dentists visits for twice a year cleaning are much less rigorous after having used a sonicare brush for the last few years.  These replaceable brush heads come in 2 sizes, one has a smaller set of bristles.  This one has more bristles (a little longer brush head), and I prefer it to the smaller one - not too big for a woman&#x27;s mouth/teeth.</li>
            <li> Work just as expected since they replace the original brush head that accompanied the Sonicare Easy Clean.</li>
            <li> Perfect cleaning, but soft enough not to damage the mouth tissues. Really recommendable, I have been suing them for about two years without any issue.</li>
            <li> I tried the CVS brand and my teeth just didnt feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these, name brand, and my teeth are super clean again!&lt;br /&gt;These are not cheap but they are the only ones I will ever use!</li>
            <li> These little guys are great, last a long time, and this is a great price. I recommend them. Go for it!</li>
            <li> I wish I never bought these.  I put on the first brush head and it only lasted less than two weeks.  The bristles got all flat and looked like it was four months old.</li>
            <li> There are too many different brushes. These don&#x27;t fit the Sonicare toothbrush that I have.&lt;br /&gt;I opened them so I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do with them.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly for our Sonicare Healthy White electric toothbrush.  Plus, they&#x27;re the best price we can find out there.  We&#x27;ll be ordering more when we need them!!</li>
            <li> arrived quickly. the brushes are genuine OEM and work great. Smaller than expected but does get the job done. Recommended.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare is a great tooth brush.  These brush heads are a big improvement over the older heads.  With the Sonicare and flossing, I get complements on my clean teeth when I visit the dentist.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, within a week...the bristles on this brush have already become frayed to the point where they already need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> An excellent and useful brushing  product.  The Phillips Sonicare Proresult  brush heads are easy to fit onto the power supply.</li>
            <li> These are NOT real Philips brush heads. After 3 days the head looks 2 months old.  None of my original heads nor my first round of replacements wore anywhere near as quickly.</li>
            <li> Want to put your dentist out of work?  Me too!  Buy one of these fine Sonicare brushes and extra heads.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I have had a Sonicare for many years.  I recently purchased a new one.  I am so dissappointed as they have shortened the length of the bristles therefore making it vibrate against my teeth if not held just right.  It is a bummer as my teeth dont get as clean as they used to. I contacted the company to no avail. They claimed to send longer ones but they really don make a difference. Even my Dental Hygenist agrees. Hopefully there will be enough claims in the future to make them realize there is a problem. So, i have been using a manual toothbruse and also hunting for one powered one that may just come close to my original sonicare.</li>
            <li> since you have to change brushes supposedly every 3 months this is a deal&lt;br /&gt;I will see if i need to do that</li>
            <li> I purchased these heads from Rockbottom Price at the beginning of March and I believe they&#x27;re counterfeit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A) 2 of the 3 heads vibrate off immediately, while the third stays on if you&#x27;re gentle while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;B) All three of the bristles are much softer than the original heads that I just replaced.&lt;br /&gt;C) They&#x27;re also slightly differently shaped than the OEM heads as my OEM brush cover wouldn&#x27;t fit these heads correctly.&lt;br /&gt;D) These heads don&#x27;t have serial/batch numbers etched into them like the OEM heads do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they&#x27;re fake.  They&#x27;re definitely crap.  I just requested a refund and repurchased through Amazon directly instead of another vendor.  I recommend only going with Amazon purchase and boycotting the other vendors.</li>
            <li> I ordered these expecting to get three replace heads for my Philips Sonicare Flexcare Plus and that is exactly what I received. Great ;purchase.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t 100% sure this type head was what I needed when I ordered.  The product was received timely and is exactly right.  I&#x27;m very pleased from all standpoints</li>
            <li> Good quality sonicare brushes, my old brush was worn and the new one made a huge difference. Made my teeth feel smooth and clean. I started brushing with baking soda to get rid of the fluoride.</li>
            <li> The brush heads failed to snap on, and I received the following reply from Bargain OTC:  \\&quot;All of our items are authentic and factory sealed.  We sold 1000&#x27;s of these brush heads over the holidays with very few complaints and those that we did receive, turned out to be unscrupulous individuals looking for a free item, as they never returned the \\&quot;defective\\&quot; item even with a paid return postage label after they were refunded.  I personally took home this same item back in December and have been using without issue since.  Our return policy is 30 days and you purchased this item over 2 months ago.  Please contact the manufacturer as they are better equipped at diagnosing any type of problem and making sure you purchased the correct heads for your toothbrush. Sincerely, Sue Bargain OTC\\&quot;</li>
            <li> These lasted only a few days before they were completely worn away.  I ordered the same product from another seller and had no issues.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!  Will not recommend this item.  INFERIOR product.  Save your money for originals from Philips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Pro-Results are inferior quality replacements for the Sonicare.  They do not fit on tightly to my handheld powered unit, slip right off while brushing.  Tried another of the 3 with the same results, no the same clipping mechanism or different specs.  Then as well I noticed the brushs of the 1 head I removed, the brush bristles were already worn out just after 2 months of light use....  Original head will last a good 3/4 - to 1 year before noticing signs of wear and time to exchange.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush heads does not last. I have purchased from the store prior to Amazon and the toothbrush heads I got form the store lasted one month before needing to change, whereas these really only last one week and that was pushing it.</li>
            <li> At first it got lost in the mail, but once I contacted them they immediately replaced it. Great product quality and customer service! ^^</li>
            <li> This could be a result of the fact that my toothbrush is getting older, but these heads seem to be wearing out really quickly.</li>
            <li> They do not fit my Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush model HX6930, According to Philips this is the right brash head model.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fine.  There is something odd about the one brush I am using.  It did not feel like the previous brushes I have bought from other sources.  It is much softer and &#x27;frayed&#x27; quickly.  Don&#x27;t know yet if the other  brushes are the same.  Maybe the seller can tell me why.  I have used enough of these brushes not to be imagining this.</li>
            <li> purchased along with the charger on the assumption that the charger would allow me to invest in more brushes.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 boxes of these for a total of 6 brushes. After 4 days of use a brush would be frayed matted and look as if it had been used for 6 months. I bought brushes in my local grocery store and they look brand new after 30 days of use. I have purchased a lot of brushes over the past few years these brushes are of terrible construction, in my opinion they cannot be true Sonicare brushes, I believe that they are counterfeit.</li>
            <li> Be true to your teeth or they will be false to you!!!!</li>
            <li> Standard brush head for my sonicare. I do feel like the blue bristles that indicate when the brush is worn out change color very fast.</li>
            <li> I like it when I use my brush. But in order to have extra brush head for my husband it took a long time to be delivered from China.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered at the same time when I bought the Sonicare HX6972/30 but I had to wait almost a month to have my brush head. Need to improve the delivery time!</li>
            <li> This is a good product and I&#x27;d buy it again and recommend it.  I have had this automatic brush for a couple of years and it&#x27;s still standing up, and my dentist recommends it.</li>
            <li> Brushhead kits work as good as the originals which I was unsure about. Am very happy with the Sonicare toothbrush devices in general.</li>
            <li> I just purchased a new Sonicare toothbrush and wanted to be sure I had extra brushes. They arrived quickly and I&#x27;m sure they will be great.</li>
            <li> This item is good,but the package is poor.</li>
            <li> If you love your Sonicare, get the real replacements and DO change them at least every four months. My dentist loves me since I started using sonicare. Nothing can beat it. But do floss too.</li>
            <li> Out of my last two 3-packs, 4 out of 6 brush heads shed alarming quantities of bristles in my mouth while in use, which is both uncomfortable and disgusting. The remaining bristles do their job, and I love the toothbrush itself, but Philips needs to step up their quality control on the brush heads.</li>
            <li> I will be contacting Amazon for a refund. These cannot be authentic toothbrush replacements. After 2 weeks of use, it looks like I&#x27;ve been using it for 1 year! I wish I had read all the other reviews before purchasing. Very disappointed...</li>
            <li> Excellent product but over priced...can find them cheaper other places</li>
            <li> What can I say, the brushes fit and work well.</li>
            <li> A typical Phillips product. You can&#x27;t believe the difference until you try it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  CW.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Fantastic..... And great shipping</li>
            <li> Good product, but I&#x27;ve found the deal at Costco to be better.</li>
            <li> These are great brush heads for my Philips Sonicare. The 3-pack lasts me most of a year (changing once every 3-4 months). They come with various color bands for the bottom of the brush so you can share one Sonicare brush and have multiple users each with his/her own brush head. These are firm enough that they feel like your teeth are being professionally cleaned but soft enough that it doesn&#x27;t leave your gums raw and tender.</li>
            <li> DOES GREAT WITH KEEPING YOUR TEETH CLEAN AND LESS TIME AT THE DENTIST WHICH IS A PLUS. WE ARE HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I purchased some brush heads that said they were compatible but they just fell off, a waste of my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are genuine and cost more but they are worth it!</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and love how clean and white my teeth are.  I wish I discovered it sooner!!!</li>
            <li> They were fakes. These are not real philips...these are cheaper. The first thing was the packaging was obviously not from philips.  Then I opened them, and it didnt fit properly.</li>
            <li> Same heads as you can get in the store but for less money.  They seem to last longer than my old ones, but that is a mystery best left unsolved.</li>
            <li> I can recommend. I use this brush . This order I gave to my grandson with the toothbrush.. He is happy with the set..</li>
            <li> For some reason, the toothbrush heads I bought on Amazon seemed to wear out much, much quicker than the ones I bought at the store. Weird.</li>
            <li> They rusted and ruined my toothbrush.  I just ordered another toothbrush from Amazon, I hope it is not counterfeit.  If so, I will be returning asap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still appreciate a refund or a discount on the new toothbbrush</li>
            <li> Excellent brushes--they do the job.</li>
            <li> These are not Phillps brand brush heads. They are knock offs, and not even good knock offs. They didn&#x27;t fit the Sonicare base properly, so of the three I got in the pack I only had one that would even stay on the base when it was turned on (the other two shook off within the first few seconds) and that one was unbearably noisy.</li>
            <li> Good product and good price.</li>
            <li> Comes with 3 standard proresults snap-on brush heads,  just as expected.  My teeth are so white now.</li>
            <li> These heads are surprisingly hard and inflexible and are not comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I bought these in anticipation of getting the same ones I ordered last time and I got the knock off version when I ordered these ones.  They lasted 2-4 days each and then they were shot and had to be thrown away.  Major major ripoff with some of the worst quality in a product I have ever seen.  I will not be buying from here again and you should not buy from these people.  Horrible qualiy.  Garbage.</li>
            <li> These are too expensive to wear down as quickly as they do. They do work well but don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Brush bristles flattened within a week. Definitely not the same quality as the ones which came with the original unit. Most likely the worst purchase I have made on Amazon.</li>
            <li> If I could give 6 stars, I would. There was a small mix up in the order and it was very, very satisfactorily corrected immediately.</li>
            <li> I bought two different 3 packs, a generic and the Philips.  The Philips are identitical to the original and perform well.  My generic I bought for much cheaper price looked ok but the first 2-3 brushings the brissels would fall out but that eventually stopped.  Later they would just fall off the battery unit when I held the brush under the water facet to rinse it off.  So, in my experience, this is one of the examples that its best to stay with the OEM.</li>
            <li> Just like the original, get the job well done. Product arrive quickly. The package is little bit hard to open</li>
            <li> Grandson loves these brushes. Teeth get real clean. Easy to use and looks like the 3 heads will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I am trying to get replacements and the store says, they are not able to send to my address, but before I bought from there the replacements as well as the full set and I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is not what I want from any seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think that later you will not be able to send to the original address, DO NOT OFFER AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Wish it was a 4-pack for my spouse and I to use.  Heads are exactly like the ones it came with.  Even comes with the age rings to coordinate when to replace if you actually use them not for color options.</li>
            <li> The bases of the tooth brush heads are rusting and I would like to return this item.  I have pictures.</li>
            <li> fits my sonicare perfectly</li>
            <li> Better than the generic stuff at stores.  This fits well and is as described, and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This was a great product and a very good price for all three brushes. I will certainly order more when I need too.</li>
            <li> If you have a Sonicare, then there&#x27;s no reason to brag to you, as you already know that a Sonicare toothbrush is SUPERB compared to a &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve searched everywhere for a deal on the replacement heads.  You can&#x27;t beat AMAZON&#x27;s $21 for a set of 3!</li>
            <li> Not much to say here, but since I need to write at least 20 words to keep Amazon from asking me to review again, let me just say that they are a good replacement for a SonicCare Pro.  They fit perfectly, which shouldn&#x27;t come as a surprise since they are made by Philips to fit the device.  Shocking, I realize.  In all seriousness, its what I expected, saved me from going to the drug store to get, and the delivery was on-time and as promised.</li>
            <li> I doubt this is truly a Philips product. Used the brush head 3 times and the bristles are mangled! Will be trying to obtain a refund for this defective product.</li>
            <li> One of the 3 brushes had the bristles coming out and I had to throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;Considerably more expensive when you divide the cost by 2 brushes</li>
            <li> I have had a Sonicare Toothbrush for years on end, practically since Phillips put them on the market and I&#x27;ll swear to you that there is something wrong with these brushes. Each brush that I have installed on my Sonicare will last about a month before it starts to generate a very loud noise from the brush when it is on. Removing the brush, I notice a high amount of rust in the residual water in the brush (from rinsing it off). The metal ring at the bottom of the brush is also noticeably rusting. Either they are knock-offs or Sonicare has changed the quality of their brushes because I have never seen this occur to Sonicare brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I bought these once years ago and they fit perfectly and worked well. Well I bought them again in the middle of 2014 and the quality has seriously gone down. The first brush head lasted maybe a month. I tend to use my brush heads for longer than recommended but, even before owning an electric, I&#x27;ve never had a brush head get flat so fast! Within a week I was noticing the bristles spreading out, and this is with me only using the electric brush&#x27;s own weight to brush, as I know it&#x27;s not good to brush hard. Well I just replaced the first with the 2nd and this one is seemingly following suit. Such a shame because the electric toothbrush itself I know works well</li>
            <li> These used to fit on the handle very smoothly and easily; now the press-fit is really tight and can be difficult to place and remove.  Not easy for small, weak hands.  Also, why 3 to a set?  We need 2, so to make it come out even, we end up ordering 2 sets at a time.</li>
            <li> They match original. good price and fast delivery. What more can you ask. Definitely recommend them if you have a Sonic Care toothbrush</li>
            <li> The pest rid did not work for me at all. Also the spray part of the bottles never worked, I had to take a spray from part from another bottle I had.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes for the sonicare did not last longer than a few weeks. I had to go to Bed Bath and Beyond to replace them.&lt;br /&gt;I was not pleased at all with either product.</li>
            <li> It might not be for everyone, but I really love my Sonicare!  My teeth feel great and my dentist has commented on the great job the toothbrush seems to be doing, especially at the gumline.  However, after the big up-front investment ($80? $100? I can&#x27;t recall)...it&#x27;s a drag to have to put down what amounts to $9 or so per replacement toothbrush head.  Since I would otherwise be using toothbrushes I&#x27;d get for free from my dentist (or relatively inexpensive extras purchased on Amazon.com), the price of these replacements is an unfortunate drawback.  It&#x27;s noteworthy that the price for these heads was the lowest I could find at the time; even at Sams Club or CostCo, the per-head cost was higher. (And at those stores, you had to buy 6 or 8 heads at a time...at a total price of $50 or more!  Yikes!)  And there are generic knock-offs available here and elsewhere, but they get some pretty bad reviews for poor quality.  So if you love your teeth and your Sonicare, this is the place to buy your replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I wish they had different colored rings on the bottom of the brushes because I share my sonicare with my daughter, and we switch out the heads.</li>
            <li> These brush heads were awful. They frayed and softened after only a couple weeks. They already need to be replaced. I have never had problems in the past when buying these elsewhere. I believe these are counterfeit products.</li>
            <li> Funny because we bought the exact replacement head they said was to fit my brush but it does not snap all the way down. I mean it works but there is now a 1/4&amp;#34;gap where it used to fit snugly. Not all that pleased.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are clearly not actually made by Philips. You can tell from the shoddy logo paint-job, and the fact that the head wore out after a week. I will be returning.</li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t seem like they are cut evenly. The bristles do not feel like the sturdy, flexible plastic that you&#x27;d expect, instead they almost feel like, I don&#x27;t know, horsehair? They don&#x27;t hold their straight lines even after a few uses. And after brushing my teeth, I feel like I need to pull out a regular old non-electric toothbrush and brush again. If these aren&#x27;t fakes, then Philips quality control has really gone downhill!</li>
            <li> The brushes came at a great price and high quality. Very pleased. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to take great care of their teeth.</li>
            <li> I got a 3 pack of these brush heads. The first two are so soft that after about 5 brushings the bristles are all bent out of shape. Haven&#x27;t tried the third yet. Don&#x27;t know if this was a bad batch or what but they are useless.</li>
            <li> These are great! They are factory sonic care toothbrushes and I have to say I love my sonicare tooth brush.  It has made my gums so much more healthy.  It really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have given it 3 stars, since the two I got are just what I ordered, but I took away one star for the missing brush head.  I understand that product offerings and prices have to change sometimes.  Does Amazon make it so hard to change a product description that vendors can&#x27;t reflect those changes in a timely manner?  Or is this an intentional rip-off?</li>
            <li> These brushes were weak and fell apart after a week of using them. Horrible product…and the quality is suspect. Buy the originals</li>
            <li> The brushes I received are fakes, it is February 1st and two are already showing signs of wear, not usual for Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> I needed a different head - pay very close attention to the model number in the description because I did not and had to toss these</li>
            <li> After 3 days of brushing with these, I couldn&#x27;t take it any longer and had to contact Amazon customer service.  As others have stated, the head slides off the base very easily, and the bristles are way too soft.</li>
            <li> These brushes are perfect with my Sonicare.  What else is there to say except they do the job.  i have them on auto ship, so I don&#x27;t keep the brush after its time.  Great way to keep your mouth clean as it should be and great price to boot!</li>
            <li> My first brush head (came with the unit) lasted about 5 months...expect the same from these.  Good price for 3.</li>
            <li> These fit perfectly and after a month or so of use they are holding up beautifully. I would buy them again and recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Good value for the replacement items. Arrived on time and seems to be the same as found in stores. All around good value.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are pricey but they do the job quite well. We&#x27;re very satisfied with them although since this is my first toothbrush of this type, i can&#x27;t say these heads offer the best value.</li>
            <li> These brushes are junk! I would have rated &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; if I could have. The heavy, thick synthetic bristles are coming loose in my mouth causing gagging and trying to spit out a mouth full of bristles. Their harshness is causing tooth pain. I have used sonicare system for as many years as i can remember, from the 80s or before...never a problem like this. I will try find replacements in a store so that I can see what I am getting</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the quality, no problems.</li>
            <li> I have a Sonicare toothbrush and I have bought replacement heads at other stores.  However, I find that Amazon.com has one of the lowest prices.  I think the only deal I found that was better was when Costco had a coupon on these replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;The heads last for a long time.  The heads are not too soft and not too hard.&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare toothbrushes are my favorite!</li>
            <li> Good value, shipped as promised.  Not much else I can say about toothbrush heads, other than make sure you change them every 3 months as directed.</li>
            <li> Although the Sonicare brushes and oher Sonicare equipment is pricey you have the best price for these items and that makes me very happy!</li>
            <li> phlips sonicare toothbrush system is the best system available, imo.  never have teeth felt cleaner.  you do have to make sure your brush head is in good shape, tho, so you need to replace regularly.</li>
            <li> Love my toothbrush. Buying here is a little cheaper than store. I&#x27;m on the auto send, every three months these guys show up like clock work.</li>
            <li> These brushes were worn out within 2 weeks (versus the usual 2 months I get with Philips Sonicare brushes before replacement).</li>
            <li> exactly as I get at the store but not going to the store.It.s the same product I have been using for years</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is very substandard.  The brush head that came with the toothbrush is in better condition after three months use than these &amp;#34;replacements&amp;#34; are after a couple of weeks.  The bristles on the replacement brush head were much softer (too soft) with little body to begin with and have become frayed and misshapen in two weeks.  I have been using Sonicare brushes for five years and have never had this experience before.  Something is wrong here.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with this purchase.  The head is slowly falling apart each time I brush my teeth.  I switched to the next one and found the same thing started happening after a month of use.  NOT BUYING THESE THROUGH AMAZON EVER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they seemed to be direct replacements.  The problem is that there is a piece missing in these heads that holds them on the handle. They work okay for a bit then they start to fall off while in use. Now I have to re buy them so they actually cost much more. I wont be buying these again.</li>
            <li> I question if these are genuine Philips Sonicare.  The bristles wore down within 2 weeks.  I have used a Sonicare toothbrush for several years and never had a brush that wore this fast.</li>
            <li> To add to the other reviews I&#x27;ve received cheap counterfeit versions. After having used the product for a couple weeks the bristles have all turned into a mess on two of the heads we use. The brush housing that attaches to the actual handheld unit has also fallen off. Upon inspecting the printing used by the authentic product and this one, the type is noticeably different and faded compared to a used actual unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would take some time to learn about who you are buying from and what they actually stock.</li>
            <li> Not at all like the ones that came with the sonicare originally.  We&#x27;ve used them twice a day for a week now for the standard two minute cycle, but they look like they are 4 months old.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> These are not authentic sonicare brush heads.  They quickly vibrated off my easyclean sonicare.  When I bought authentic heads from sonicare, they were quite different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AVOID</li>
            <li> I love sonicare.  The brush heads in stores are much more expensive even on sale.</li>
            <li> Wish I had read the reviews first!  After using for several days, I noticed the sleeve had crushed the bristles, making them look like I had used replacement head for 3 months.  I came back to write a bad review and noticed how many other people are having issues with these sub par replacements.  I&#x27;ve already been through them, but maybe like another reviewer, I will purchase from Bed, Bath and Beyond instead.</li>
            <li> Works fine, I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> Great replacement and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing these again.</li>
            <li> I wish they would last a little longer.  I brush my teeth often, and I notice it doesn&#x27;t go the 3 months that it&#x27;s supposed to.  I remember the older units lasting much longer.</li>
            <li> These new brush heads seem to have a little more sonic power than the originals.  My dentist recommends using the Sonicare all the time.</li>
            <li> I saved money The easy way.. Amazon.com&amp;#34; Quality products at great prices&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> talk about taking the razor blade principle to the next level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overpriced little brushes, which are very easy to put on the toothbrush the wrong way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you put them on the wrong way only once (barely any resistance to that), they are shot and won&#x27;t hold anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my child and my wife screwed up their brushes on the first try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only me being a gear head figured they might have to be put on facing a certain direction. So I scrutinized the two sides of the connection and identified the matching side in the plastic brush for a narrow flat surface on the post of the toothbrush. So mine still works, but if I&#x27;d be a little sleepy or distracted just once, I&#x27;d have the same problem.</li>
            <li> The blister-pack packaging says Phillips and gives Phillips phone number and addresses but the brushes that I ordered DO NOT behave like the one that cam with the SonicCare.  Each one wares out in 2 months (the original lasted over 6).  The blue colored indicator bristles do not fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either Phillips just started making crap or these are knockoff brushes :(</li>
            <li> love it, love it, love it!  as these wear out like regular toothbrushes do, I will always have them on hand.</li>
            <li> I like the compact size better for my size mouth.  With regualr size my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean as they do with compact brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased a new Sonicare toothbrush and needed replacement brush heads.  I ordered these before I fully researched this brush head.  These were slightly less expensive than the Sonic web site and were appropriately packaged and quickly delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After ordering (and receiving) these I saw that the Diamond clean were supposed to be better (they are somewhat more expensive).  Next time I will try the diamond clean but I don&#x27;t feel cheated by buying these!</li>
            <li> Based on my dentist&#x27;s recommendation I purchased my first Philips electric toothbrush about 10 years ago.  I&#x27;m now on my second one and replace the brush head about every 2-3 months.  They are expensive but they seem to do a good job.  I like the way my mouth feels after I&#x27;ve brushed with the Philips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> these toothbrushes are so awesome but the heads are a little pricey if you ask me.  I wish they were just a little cheaper.  They last at least 6 months though although I&#x27;m sure my dentist would recommend changing them every 3 months.  they come with different color rings to change on the bases so you can share the base unit among different people.</li>
            <li> Knock offs!!! Thank goodness amazon does free returns</li>
            <li> Works well. Quick shipping also.</li>
            <li> These are expensive and really on a last about three weeks. You can nurse another couple weeks out of them, but nowhere close to 3 months as they suggest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phillips just needs to do a better job with these and making them last longer to create less waste and expense.</li>
            <li> These are not real Soniccare heads; they don&#x27;t fit well and the bristles are way too soft. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t seem to fit quite right onto the base. Works though. I have had it a long time just doesn&#x27;t go in right</li>
            <li> I used a brush from this set and it was worn out after 3 brushes so I threw it away.  Thinking it might just be a bad brush, I tried a second one, only to find out it is the same poor quality.  Do not order from this merchant nor order this product!  Most likely counterfeit.</li>
            <li> Love my Sonicare toothbrush and all the accessories that come with it! These heads last a long time and clean your teeth very well. I&#x27;ve purchased off-brand toothbrush heads before to save money and was sorely disappointed in the outcome. These are worth the money and they work the best!</li>
            <li> Great brush head, fit my Philliips toothbrush perfectly and I have no problem with them or any Phillips product that I have.</li>
            <li> It was great, better than the last few I ordered.</li>
            <li> A perfect match. Of course they work. The genuine item. A good deal</li>
            <li> These brush heads are completely FAKE and potentially UNSAFE. They will last about three brushings before they begin to fall apart, and will leave a bad taste in your mouth. Do not waste your money. I&#x27;m thoroughly disgusted with Amazon and their lax policies which allow scumbag sellers like \\&quot;RNTOD\\&quot; get away with selling knockoffs that are blatantly advertised as authentic. I will not purchase any supposed \\&quot;Sonicare\\&quot; products on amazon.com again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using pro-results brushes since the first sonicare was released.  Upon opening these brushes I noticed an immediate difference than the original, normal brush; they seemed softer than the one I had been using on my sonicare for several months.  Still, I thought I&#x27;d try them.  Not only were they much softer, after my brush was complete I spit out brush bristles!  I&#x27;ve never even seen this with the cheapest 4 for $1 toothbrushes at the super market.  Perhaps Phillips has lowered the ProResults quality with the introduction of their new brush heads?  Counterfeit Brush heads? Mine were sold by &#x27;Aroma Beauty&#x27;, I don&#x27;t recall if they were &#x27;fulfilled by Amazon&#x27; or not, and I&#x27;m past the return window by one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update: Amazon gave me a refund! Thanks guys :)</li>
            <li> These brush heads are the real thing.  They are a bit pricey, but I was fearful to try a generic brush.  Probably could do better shopping with a coupon in the stores.</li>
            <li> If you like brushing your teeth, than you need to be using a Sonicare toothbrush. I was a non-believer for years until my wife shoved one into my mouth. It was like an explosion. &amp;#34;What in the heck have I been brushing my teeth with all of these years,&amp;#34; I asked myself. Never again will I waste my time with the old by-hand version of dental care. Run, don&#x27;t walk, to your computer and order one and a set of replacement heads (because you should replace them like a toothbrush).</li>
            <li> according to our dentist these are the best toothbrushes around.  my husband loves his sonicare.</li>
            <li> this is a functional item that works just fine.  Doing a review is superfluous to the rating.  I don&#x27;t mind rating but the need to comment annoys me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t Hold up as long as those I&#x27;ve purchased elsewhere</li>
            <li> My latest shipment of brush heads seem to have started wearing out faster than previously. The bristles are all starting to curve outward and look ratty after just a few weeks of use. I never bite or chew them and don&#x27;t apply excessive pressure, this hasn&#x27;t been a problem before. The dark blue indicator bristles usually turn white far before the toothbrush begins to look in poor condition. The worn out bristles don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re scrubbing my teeth as hard as they are not as stiff. I&#x27;m having to see the dentist for a cleaning sooner than I normally do. It may have been a faulty batch, or perhaps they&#x27;re just more cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note, I use frustration free packaging, but this time I accidentally ordered blister pack. Perhaps they come from different factories. I have been happy with the frustration free in the past.</li>
            <li> The best no excuses. Avoid the knock offs you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> So - these are exactly as advertised.  They work with my Sonicare White &amp; the color bar doesnt fade until a few months of usage.  I was worried at first that these wouldnt last long (some sort of scheme to get you to buy more often) but that doesn&#x27;t appear to be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
            <li> These were a waste of money, and last hardly a few weeks!  I will have to stick with local for this one. Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> If you go to the Phillips site and check their descriptions of the four or so different kinds of toothbrush attachments they make, you discover that Phillips says these get off 2X the plaque of handbrushing.  But all the other brushes presently being made by them and on their site as current, are listed as getting off 7X the plaque of handbrushing.  I don&#x27;t usually take advertising too seriously, but this is a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked the Phillips site because it has seemed to me that my teeth were not getting as clean as usual (when I used other brushes) and worse, I&#x27;ve had this head fly off the toothbrush (Flexcare) if it bumps into a tooth while I&#x27;m brushing.</li>
            <li> We bought the original machine at another store but then they never had these heads back in stock. Good deal compared to other stores and you get the Amazon seal of approval..lol.</li>
            <li> Ordered these June 14. Came in the Phillips annoying packaging that is hard to open just like you see in stores. Brushes seem to be identical to the originals that came with the toothbrush except they do have a part number on the outside. Quality is the same, and they come with the little color rings as that came with the toothbrush etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these through Amazon, not one of the other retailers Amazon lists.</li>
            <li> The previous pack was horrible. They wore out in a few days.  Let&#x27;s hope this pack is better!&lt;br /&gt;I have ordered before and no complaints.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Had used a lesser model for ages until it finally quit, so replaced it with this.  This model has a smaller handle &amp; does not need to be taken apart for cleaning... bonus!</li>
            <li> Have been using the Phillips Sonicare HX6013 brush heads for a couple of years now and am very pleased with them. They have a wear indicator  that changes color when they should be changed, but I don&#x27;t use it. I just change to a new head every 3 months and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> These are exactly the product that I have always used with my Philips Sonicare toothbrush. Very high quality, comfortable brush heads.</li>
            <li> Good item when you need them and we do.  Always keep spares on hand.  Remembering to change them is the challenge.</li>
            <li> REAL Philips Sonicare head brushes. I don&#x27;t want to buy from Costco b/c they only sell the newer styled brushes and this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> I am yet to start using these sets, but they fit perfectly well and I am pretty sure they will work well.</li>
            <li> Philips is a big company, it shouldn&#x27;t sell a 3 pack product and deliver a 2 pack product, needed the brush heads to brush my teeth, so they&#x27;re opened... I travel to underdeveloped countries for work (as I am now) and would be a hassle to return this, much more hassle than its worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just disappointed with the wrong delivery, love the toothbrush though, nothing leaves your teeth quiet as smooth as the sonicare.</li>
            <li> My husband actually loves this toothbrush. I like it also. It does a good job of cleaning your teeth so nicely.</li>
            <li> used it before and perfectly happy with them. that&#x27;s about it. everything else is superfilous  and unnecessary verbage end of discussion.</li>
            <li> Not sure why, but the ProResults heads that I received will not stay on to my Sonicare/Healthy White Handle. They vibrate right off? They appear to be genuine (not fake). This must be a bad batch.</li>
            <li> These so not appear to be the same bush/bristle that came with my original EasyClean brush. The bristles are much softer and do no appear strong enough to hold up to any significant scrubbing. After a week of brushing the bristles are splayed out and are not holding their form, as the original did. Unfortunately for me I purchased at the same time as I I purchased my brushing unit and tucked away until needed, now the return window has closed. :-(</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with my Sonicare toothbrush. It makes it quick and easy to get my teeth very clean without irritating my gums.</li>
            <li> Excellent price for these.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted - work great!</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING MY SONIC TOOTHBRUSH AND EXTRA BRUSHES FOR OVER A YEAR AND I CAN HONESTLY SAY MY TEETH HAVE NEVER FELT MORE CLEAN OR POLISHED.</li>
            <li> Actually, I have not yet used the brush heads since I&#x27;m using the one that came with my new toothbrush. They are, however, very easy to fit compared to the previous heads I had.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is a great brush, and we like these larger ones--they cover more of your teeth.  The price is a bit high, would be nice to see a better deal on them.</li>
            <li> I also bought the Sonicare HX6013 and these heads don&#x27;t fit. That might be my fault, but I must have missed something in the product specs.</li>
            <li> Good product, speedy delivery</li>
            <li> Sonicare original product.  Always use this brand.  Same quality as brick and mortar purchase.  Very convenient and fast delivery.  Very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> The heads fall off my toothbrush which is pretty frustrating</li>
            <li> Thanks to Philips for a great product, and amazon for bring it to there customers.</li>
            <li> This tooth brush is awesome!!</li>
            <li> Brush heads last for three months as advertised</li>
            <li> If these toothbrush heads are made by Philips, it appears their quality is questionable. The bristles are extremely soft and flatten on your teeth. After a 2-3 brushings, the color of the bristles is faded considerably and the bristles flare out. The packaging seemed authentic and the markings on the heads seemed authentic as well. Either these are inferior \\&quot;copies\\&quot; of the brush heads or Philips needs to improve their product.</li>
            <li> Great price for authentic Sonicare toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with my replacement brushes that I want to order some more.  I thought I was going to have to purchase a whole new brush system, but thanks to AMAZON I found my replacement brushes cheaper than in the stores.  Thank you thank you thank you</li>
            <li> Works great, and I didn&#x27;t have to drive 15 miles to town to buy one at the store.</li>
            <li> The brushes are way too soft, the individual fibers start separating and falling out. I&#x27;ve used Sonicare brushes from stores before and had to go back. This was a waste of money :(</li>
            <li> These have got to be knock- off, fake, replicas of Philips Sonicare brush heads. The brush is coming apart after less than a week - bristles falling out and sticking up. I never have problems with my purchases from Amazon but I&#x27;m going to request a refund/return for these.</li>
            <li> I like the tapered brush and that a change in bristle color &amp;#34;alerts&amp;#34;you when it is time to replace the brush.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I&#x27;m not sure these are genuine. I immediately noticed the bristles were much softer than our prior Sonicare head (from a brick &amp; mortar retailer). These bristles would collapse and let the plastic hit my teeth far too easily. Teeth didn&#x27;t feel nearly as clean. After a few days of this I came back here and saw the reviews questioning the authenticity. I checked one of these heads side-by-side with our prior brush head and noticed differences in the plastic injection sites and the printing. The printing seemed inconsistent and the code number is a larger size than the known-good one. Looking at the bristles side-by-side was a big difference. The old brush, after being used for three months, had one bristle sticking out of its group. The new head, after about a week of use, had many bristles bent out of their groups. I would not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: it seems the same product link may be sold by different sellers. The heads I received were from the \\&quot;House and Home\\&quot; seller.</li>
            <li> These brushes for and by Sonicare are good quality and last for months.</li>
            <li> Quality bristles. Serves its purpose. Fits description. Make sure you know that it will fit your toothbrush before buying. Price reasonable.</li>
            <li> This pack fits my Sonicare toothbrush very well and comes at a good price.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a lot of debate if these are fake or the real thing.  All I can say is the item I ordered was sold through Amazon Prime, the description said they were \\&quot;by Philips,\\&quot; so I expected the \\&quot;real thing\\&quot; and I feel that&#x27;s what I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was exactly what I would have expected.  It was offered in frustration free packaging, but I choose the standard packaging just so I could see what it looked like.  If this is counterfeit, someone went through a lot of expense and trouble to make the packaging look legitimate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They fit perfectly on my brush.  The other complaint seems to be the brushes don&#x27;t last long.  Too soon for me to tell, but I&#x27;ll certainly do an update in a month if these don&#x27;t live up to my expectations.  The brushes I bought in my dentist&#x27;s office always last at least 6 months, with twice a day use, two minutes per use.  I expect the same from these.</li>
            <li> Items are excellent, but shipping from CHINA ! took a long time.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got a pack for the family.  After a week of use, these brush heads looked like the ones that had been used for more than 3 months! Returned to Amazon and a refund was issued.</li>
            <li> This product advertizes on Amazon and on the packaging that it fits FlecCare models.  Mine is a Flexcare purchased on Amazon and these brush heads did not fit my toothbrush. Requesting a return/refund.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are just what I needed for my sonicare toothbrushes.  The heads fit perfectly and much cheaper than I can get at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I liked it.  Unfortunately, the diamond brushes for this toothbrush as just better and I should have got those instead, which I eventually did.</li>
            <li> I purchased the non generic item on purpose, knowing that I would spend more, but get a higher quality purchase.  These refill heads were absolutely awful.  I normally get this exact product at CVS/Wegmans, and they last about 6 weeks of normal use.  All three heads in this package fell apart after one use.  The bristles were very brittle, and instead of having &amp;#34;give&amp;#34;, they bent at strange angles.  I am very disappointed with this product, and will not buy from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They came in the correct packaging, and were sealed.  I&#x27;m not sure if these were &amp;#34;seconds&amp;#34;, or just old, but something was not quite right with them.  If anyone is interested in pictures, I&#x27;m more than happy to provide.</li>
            <li> These are either outright fakes or cheaper quality brushes made by Philips for non European and US markets. I have used these brushes for the last 4 years and always purchased from Walmart. This time I happened to purchase them through amazon. There is a huge difference in quality. The brushes i get from Walmart stays for 3 months or more easily. It has been less than a month and the brush has excessively frayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not right that Amazon is still allowing these brushes to be sold. Please stop this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Amazon refunded the purchase! Send them back the frayed brushes.</li>
            <li> These things don&#x27;t last long enough for what they charge should be cheaper</li>
            <li> oredene este repuesto para ser entregado en M&amp;eacute;xico estuvo bien y en tiempo todo sali&amp;oacute; perfecto espero ordenar m&amp;aacute;s en el futuro</li>
            <li> For me, it took two or three times to get used to the vibration of the brush on teeth. But no that I am used to it, I feel that my teeth are getting more clean using this rather than just a normal tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Just as shown. It was Perfect fit for base. So happy that i have back ups now.&lt;br /&gt;It shipped very quick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to think of much to say since this is a replacement for something that should be worn out due to repeated use. I had a travel toothbrush for a couple of months this year and it really made me miss my Sonicare. Five stars for the Sonicare and five stars for the replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> I get these on subscribe and save, they always arrive on time and as expected. Won&#x27;t be cancelling for a long time.</li>
            <li> Was having a hard time finding these in stock at my local stores so this works out great! Competitively priced and it was great not having to go to the store, not have them in stock, etc.</li>
            <li> so my daaughter now has enough replacement toothbrushes for the next decade.  Make sure you know which kind of sonicare toothbrush you have because they are not interchangeable with other designs they make.</li>
            <li> These brush heads are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Great purchase for the Sonic tooth brush. I replace them every 3 months and I am good to go.</li>
            <li> What I need but I find it too pricey.</li>
            <li> These work well, but are way over priced. Get the Sonimart ones instead; just as good, but way less expensive.</li>
            <li> These are cheap knock off brush heads.  Do NOT purchase.  The bristles are too soft to brush adequately, and they wear out quickly.</li>
            <li> needed for the sonicare I purchased and a lot less than in store</li>
            <li> These replacement heads works well with my sonicare brush. Last for reasonable amount of time without deteriorating.</li>
            <li> Kept my teeth so clean my dentist quit as soon as she saw how plaque and cavity free I was. She ended up switching her careers and became a Sonicare sales woman.</li>
            <li> Results have been quite good. I am happy that we made the switch from the traditional toothbrush. Sorry we didn&#x27;t make the switch sooner.</li>
            <li> These look just like the original brushes that came with the Sonicare when it was new.  They are so expensive that I am not using them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these toothbrush heads for quite a while now: that suggests I like them, and I do. Price was good and the order was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I never would have purchased an electric toothbrush, but my dentist recommended it.  I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for over 10 years now.  I am on my second Sonicare.  I will never go back to a plain toothbrush.  The health of my teeth and gums have greatly improved.  My mouth and teeth feel cleaner, too.</li>
            <li> It was easy to select this product and have it shipped to my home.  I also liked getting extra brushes so I have them when I need them.  I enjoy using this product and have good reports from my dental hygienist.</li>
            <li> VEry fine e- brush. Better than the generation  before  (E type) because the bristles seem to last longer and the handle is not only lighter but has fewer places for gunk to accumulate.  A good price is around $90 (free shipping)  WITHOUT the ultra violate light. SInce I was comparing prices, I made the mistake of thinking it was included since I did not see any offered withOUT the UV light, however, live and learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still I would recommend it, especially with free shipping, which got to me in 2 days anyway! I actually like using it. I pay no attention to the 3 settings although they actually work as advertised. Massage, sensitive and clean (or normal) do what they say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lack of one star is because of the UV not being included when I expected it. Make your own call on that.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the Sonicare but after using 6 months, went to the dentist and had absolutely no tartar on my teeth. I will always buy the Sonicare brush heads..tried the Walmart and they were hard to push on and sometimes just fell off. The more expensive the Sonicare the more expensive the brushes.</li>
            <li> I like the product (standard brush head) but received the ultra soft which I don&#x27;t use.  Apparently can&#x27;t return mistakenly opened package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several Sonicare&#x27;s and loved every one. My one complaint with the older &amp;#34;screw-on&amp;#34; design was that the brush head and body would inevitably get funky after awhile.  About a year ago, I caved in to an infomercial and bought a competing product.  That unit lasted about 6 months and then started to fall apart.  The battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and the brush head was so loose it would fall off during brushing.  So back to Sonicare and the new design.  So far, I love the press on head.  It fits tightly enough to the body so as to transfer decent vibration to the tip.  And cleaning it has been a breeze.  I rate this five stars!</li>
            <li> Not much to say. These are the real &#x27;McCoy&#x27; product, so if you like the originals you&#x27;ll like these too.</li>
            <li> OEM brush heads that work great, and at a great price.</li>
            <li> The heads seem a bit hard and the blue usage dye doesn&#x27;t appear to work.</li>
            <li> fit great and great value.</li>
            <li> Obviously the original parts/extras, however i think these are horrendously expensive for what they are.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, packaging and cost. I use it with my Sonicare EasyClean.</li>
            <li> The best way to clean your teeth every day.</li>
            <li> There was a hair visible on one of the toothbrush heads (before opening the item), so I promptly returned this item.</li>
            <li> These brushes fell apart after two uses!  The quality is so poor, I have thrown them away.</li>
            <li> just as it supposed to be</li>
            <li> Oh hey it&#x27;s toothbrush heads... Of course they work! Duh! Oh it&#x27;s cool I got thre of them, way cheaper</li>
            <li> see my other reviews and PLEASE DON&#x27;T MAKE THE MISTAKE I DID BY BUYING SOFT HEADS INSTEAD OF STD!!!! (unless you&#x27;re 60+; of course)</li>
            <li> These are not from Philips. The &amp;#34;Pro Results&amp;#34; text is off center. The wear strip on the bristles does not fade like the OEM ones. I would not purchase these again especially for what they are charging.</li>
            <li> They are what they are, replacement heads for your Sonicare toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive, but the Sonicare is worth it. I couldn&#x27;t go back to using a manual toothbrush anymore. I did for a bit while I was on vacation out of convenience of taking a manual toothbrush with me. My teeth did not feel as clean that entire week.</li>
            <li> As good as always. I have been using ProResults for years. I think ProResults feels much better than DiamoncClean.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and fast shipping. Thanks.</li>
            <li> The only replacements to buy.</li>
            <li> very good, as expected.</li>
            <li> I used this for the out of country travels - it is convenient to have everything in one secure location</li>
            <li> Product is a knock off. The genuine brush head changes color so you know when you need to change it. This one does not change color at all. Amazon should really make it clear that this is not a genuine product.</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly as explained - starting using them right away!</li>
            <li> These are a cheap knock off of the real thing. The bristles are flimsy and are worn down after one week of use. On further inspection I see that the print on the brush head stem is raised and doesn&#x27;t look or feel like an authentic brush head.</li>
            <li> Well, I got this back  in 10/13 and just finished the last of the three in a pack. After a little investigation, this brush heads doesn&#x27;t  feel like the orig. Philips brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;It looks the same with slight difference in lettering. When compared to the orig. the brush is softer. The orig. is much more firm when it&#x27;s new as well as in used condition. Also, third one in a pack doesn&#x27;t seem to want to stay on the handle. it keeps falling off.&lt;br /&gt;So, it may be a fake/knockoff.  It is definitely cheaper than the orig. It still works when it stays on the handle. But I don&#x27;t know how much I&#x27;m compromising in cleaning compared to the orig. with a softer brush.  You may want to compare prices with a orig. Check into how much you are saving on a potential knock off that is somewhat inferior.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!  Horrible counterfeit product.....Brushes splayed out in less than 2 weeks, and don&#x27;t clean the teeth well.  These are nothing like the brushes that come with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I would have given this no stars if that was an option.  The heads do not fit the Sonicare device, bristles are shorter than other heads and significantly softer.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> good price I will purchase again</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Really bad, knockoff  item</li>
            <li> These have worked well for us as replacement heads for our Sonicare system.&lt;br /&gt;They work just like the original brush heads&lt;br /&gt;They last a long time&lt;br /&gt;This is a good price for the pack</li>
            <li> These are quality brushes!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product!  Philips Sonicare brush head are excellent for cleaning my teeth.  A year ago I went to have my teeth clean and the dentist was surprised on how super clean my teeth already where.  He asked me what I used to clean my teeth.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good quality items that stands up to the test of brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item is a must purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will order again.</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush, but these replacement brushes are a bit expensive. Over $10.00 is ridiculous. I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this brand if I had known the brushes would put me in the poor house!</li>
            <li> I wanted a new electric toothbrush and this had what I wanted. the only drawback is the price of the new heads are expensive.</li>
            <li> Super, and good price too</li>
            <li> They were a perfect fit for my machine.</li>
            <li> /We have used the Sonicare system for many years and have had good dental checkups because of it, no cavities and healthy gums. I like that the brush heads are in the Subscribe/Save program so they come on schedule and I don&#x27;t have to worry about when to change them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend Sonicare, it has held up for years and given us good checkups.</li>
            <li> The brush heads work great but need to come with a stand. It takes some effort to attach them to the Soniccare and take them off.</li>
            <li> I really like how well the Sonicare cleans my teeth, but I think it is rediculous how expensive these replacement brush heads are.  What a rip.  Also, it seems to me that they don&#x27;t hold up very long either. As in, the brush loses it&#x27;s stiffnesss very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess they have a patent on the design because I have never found any knock offs.</li>
            <li> New condition.&lt;br /&gt;Good price.&lt;br /&gt;As described.&lt;br /&gt;No issues with delivery time or functionality.&lt;br /&gt;The blue stripe fades to white when it is time to change the head.</li>
            <li> I have ot say that using the sonicare toothbrush and brush head is like going to the dentist every day.</li>
            <li> I really like the sonicare tootbrush.  This is my second one, your teeth feel really clean after you brush, I get better check ups&lt;br /&gt;with my dentist when I use the sonicare.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend these brush heads, they are just the right size for normal size teeth. of course you have to have a soniccare stooth brush to use these.</li>
            <li> The brush head is smaller than your standard toothbrush but I noticed that they are the right size to cover your teeth when using it with the Sonic toothbrush.  These brush heads are pricey but they do work.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly, as described. Performing as expected. Good price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is a problem with my Phillips electric toothbrush base or these replacement heads, but I could not get the first head in the pack to stay on the base after one week of use and it would not work as it should, failing to vibrate normally and making a funny sound.  The second head seems to be doing better but we&#x27;ll see; still doesn&#x27;t seem quite right.</li>
            <li> just like the originals. Found out later i could&#x27;ve gotten them at wallgreens for the same price : ( smh</li>
            <li> These are the brush heads for my Sonicare toothbrush. My dentist recommended that I use this brush since it has a setting for sensitive teeth. My next visit to the dentist showed that I had a lot less plaque to be removed. These brush heads are the ones I need to buy for my type of brush and they work great. One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made in awhile</li>
