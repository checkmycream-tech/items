            <li>The care taker canguide the chair and the hand brakes are a good safety feature.</li>
            <li>We are very pleased.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t feel very safe in it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are very pleased with the chair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It was just what I was looking for at a great price and free shipping..</li>
            <li>We used it at Disneyland and it was comfortable and held up great.  </li>
            <li>I just did not have that kind of $$ to spend again</li>
            <li>I then use a backpack to put supplies in and hang those over the handles after I put the walker on, so I kind of have a neat package to push around on those longer excursions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good packaging, easy set up.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The chair is very easy to maneuver and the advantage to the transport chair is</li>
            <li>The chair is very easily \\&quot;steered\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The chair was very easy for my son to put together.  </li>
            <li>I was assured the bearings are just fine and that it is a really good chair except for some plastic.  </li>
            <li>Will get a good cushion and all will be fine.  </li>
            <li>Would be nice to be able to move it with your hands.</li>
            <li>It opens and closes very smooth and the leg rests are very easy to operate.</li>
            <li>Easy to push!</li>
            <li>This chair is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>The seat is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>It was very comfortable</li>
            <li>It is 39 1/2&amp;#34; tall from the bottom to the top of the handle bars.    </li>
            <li>Our patients love it.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the build and the look of the wheelchair.</li>
            <li>so I went to a wheelchair repair shop and had 2 much better wheels placed on the front for $25 each.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so glad that I didn&#x27;t pass up the opportunity to buy this</li>
            <li>works great for my mom, 350lbs very moveable, keep in mind breaks dont work well on hills, And that is in the manual..</li>
            <li>like most of them are.</li>
            <li>Was easily able to transport a 350 pound man to and from his doctor&#x27;s appointments with no problems.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;d feel better if it had a wider seat.</li>
            <li>Love the chair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfect for me, if not a tad too big</li>
            <li>/&gt;Without the wheelchair, she would not have been able to attend the play.</li>
            <li>The plastic piece on the padded armrest was cracked, but the company promptly sent a replacement piece free of charge and it was very easy to change out.</li>
            <li>so I can find her more easily and need a horn.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy, very comfortable and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>All around great chair so far.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, strong, comfortable!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it is really easy to pinch your fingers doing that.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to get in and out of and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>Easy to maneuver and makes it easy for me to take her places.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and to maneuver in and out of the car.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to load and unload in my minivan.</li>
            <li>The wheelchair was easy to maneuver, fold and handle.</li>
            <li>Can fold easily ..</li>
            <li>Delivered on time and easily assembled.</li>
            <li>Important dimensions.  </li>
            <li>Its an opportunity to have a way to enjoy just traveling to events that you have put off for years</li>
            <li>Light weight for a bariatric chair.</li>
            <li>this fit what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>She is comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Considering the quality of this product, what a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>but it would be more bother than its worth.</li>
            <li>Not to mention that I would be hesitant about putting something so important</li>
            <li>This wheelchair was great for two weeks, then the front wheel on the left side broke.</li>
            <li>Great wheelchair for a bigger person.</li>
            <li>After constant usage I have EXPERIENCED NO PROBLEMS.  </li>
            <li>Good chair for a big man, but has too many places to crush caregiver&#x27;s fingers when folding it</li>
            <li>the order)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I am THRILLED with this chair... fantastic price, high quality of product.</li>
            <li>I am now able to take her out and do many more things with her as well as not having to worry about having a bariatric chair available when I take her to medical appointments.</li>
            <li>Good value and quality for the price and light enough to lift into the car.</li>
            <li>My wife has limited mobility and this has changed things a great deal for us.</li>
            <li>It was a much nicer chair, but I needed more than 16&amp;#34; for my Grandma</li>
            <li>but I am able to push her in this chair and transfer the chair in and out of trunk without much strain.</li>
            <li>Comes all put together, except for foot rests, which were pretty easy to put on.  </li>
            <li>super price.</li>
            <li>I would have been on the sidewalk myself if not for my daughter-in-law who was walking along side and quickly held me from hitting the ground.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m still very glad to have it.</li>
            <li>Invacare make great products as I have one of their walkers with fold down seat and it supports 300 lbs.</li>
            <li>Foot pedals are tough to get on otherwise great!</li>
            <li>would have given the chair 5 stars if the seat and back were more comfortable.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;IMO, it was worth the price paid but is not as durable as the standard&lt;br /&gt;manual wheel chairs we have</li>
            <li>It was well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>We bought the wheelchair to take Kathleen to our granddaughter&#x27;s performance as Christine in Phantom of the Opera.&lt;br /&gt;She was able to sit comfortably for the long play (</li>
            <li>The chair was perfect for what I need especially for teh heavy dutyness</li>
            <li>It unfolds quickly and easily, and I&#x27;m grateful for the hand brakes, which work well and add a measure of safety when transporting a larger person.  </li>
            <li>This means even when the short side of the wheels are up front they are almost touching the foot rests.  </li>
            <li>I received the first chair March 17</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just now OK&#x27;d to return the 2nd chair.</li>
            <li>The first time I went out, we went to the zoo and out to eat, and I learned that I did need a cushion.</li>
            <li>I purchased this transport chair to replace another exactly like it that I have had for some time and it has started &#x27;showing it&#x27;s age&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;MY ADVICE IS TO SPEND MORE MONEY AND GET A LEATHER SEAT &amp; BACK.  </li>
            <li>Price was excellent but it is sometimes difficult to unfold.  </li>
            <li>I have a special needs daughter that needs a heavier weight transport chair because she literally kicked the plastic pedals off her old one!</li>
            <li>I cannot see most bariatrics in this chair because most are much bigger than me, and It is not a comfortable fit for me.</li>
            <li>I bought this chair for my profoundly non verbal Autistic and intelligently impaired  daughter who cannot walk distances and will not follow me in a store.</li>
            <li>My mother is comfortable in it, the smaller back wheels make it MUCH better for getting around the house with.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to put together, It&#x27;s  easy to push and not to heavy to lift.  </li>
            <li>Its so easy to open and fold up.</li>
            <li>buy but easily manipulated into a car&#x27;s back seat or a trunk by the caregiver.</li>
            <li>This transport chair had small wheels, so I thought it would fit better in the trunk of a car.  </li>
            <li>The arm rests come off easily and folding is simple.  </li>
            <li>Good quality sturdy chair, now we have to see how long the bearings in the wheels last.</li>
            <li>A lot cheaper than even some of the large people websites.</li>
            <li>I recommend the chair to users requiring a large chair and comfort.</li>
            <li>The folding back rest allows the chair to fit easily into smaller vehicles.</li>
            <li>The other problem is that it took myself &amp; another person more than an hour to figure out how to put on the swing away foot rests, because when you first put them on, the foot pedals are facing outward and you cannot figure out how to make them face inside.</li>
            <li>It is not like a large wheeled chair where they stick out at a 30 degree angle if not used, making it much wider (so basically you have to use them to keep the profile).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fits in the truck of the car nicely and the smaller wheels in the back vs Wheel chair with large wheels makes it easier to get in and out of the trunk.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s about 260 pounds and has a huge frame, so he needs a larger chair.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonalble.</li>
            <li>This is beautifly built, it came out of the box ready to go.</li>
            <li>I paid over $300 for a light weight transport chair from a medical supply store and it lasted about 3 years, but it got a lot of use.</li>
            <li>so thanks Amazon for the deal.</li>
            <li>Very durable, sturdy chair.  </li>
            <li>We ate at a very crowded restaurant and did not bump into one thing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The chair is plenty wide for me and my son (who pushes it most of the time) loves the hand brakes.  </li>
            <li>This transport wheelchair is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>my wife really likes this chair and so do I</li>
            <li>I felt that they really cared about solving the issue promptly.</li>
            <li>305 weight  and light enough for me to put in and out of the car.</li>
            <li>Even the foot pads were very accomodating.  </li>
            <li>Really would like to return it, but have no way to get it to the UPS port which is 50 miles from here.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This states it is heavy duty, but it bends in places very easily.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to sit in (although you might want to get a cushion if you will be seated for long periods).</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and has 2 bars underneath it for stability instead of 1 like normal wheelchairs  </li>
            <li>I sure do not want to send it back or even just send the wheel back and wait for a replacement</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to have found a rollator so that I did have did some freedom inside my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>high and 17 1/2&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this chair.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone needing a wider transport chair.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I Would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone with ambulation problems.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone needing transport from car to home.</li>
            <li>Apparently, you are just supposed to find this little lever on your own.  </li>
            <li>It is too wide to fit in a narrower door, like a closet.</li>
            <li>This makes 19 1/2&amp;#34; of normal seat space unless you put a cushion on it.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get it into the house and out of the box by myself and I am disabled.  </li>
            <li>The foot rests were backwards when we received it, but it was simple to just release the adjustable part and turn the foot rests in the right direction.</li>
            <li>It stays right in the back of our Jeep now at all times and she can always go into store with me or anywhere I go!</li>
            <li>that without the large wheels on the sides it fits through standard door ways much easier.</li>
            <li>However, while there is a hole for a notch in the back, there is no button and notch to secure it so it is only held in on one side.  </li>
            <li>I ended up attaching a dining room chair seat cushion for a back cushion, and (after several attempts) settled on a gel-filled seat cushion, which my wife says is now reasonably comfortable.</li>
            <li>He uses a walker around the house, but he can&#x27;t walk very far if I take him somewhere.  </li>
            <li>you are going to use the chair every day or very frequently, take my advice &amp; get another chair.  </li>
            <li>The price compared to other sites was great, I think I saved at least $200 buying it here.</li>
            <li>It is easier if you take the foot rests off, but they are really easy to get on and off with a little practice.</li>
            <li>I was able to fix that issue by pushing the locks in that typically would only be used for lengthening or shortening the rests, but in this case I had to twist the pipe around instead to fix the directionality.    </li>
            <li>The chair is wide enough for him to be comfortable (I bought a wheelchair pad for padding).  </li>
            <li>Thank-you for offering this chair at such a reasonable price and providing reliable service.</li>
            <li>When it comes to medical equipment, you really get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>On balance, the chair is strongly made &amp; has hand brakes, which is a nice accessory, but the cheap seat material is awful; they could have used vinyl to make it more secure &amp; comfortable.est -- you either have to have someone adjust the strap behind your foot or lean down yourself.  </li>
            <li>arrived in 3 days, easy to assemble (only needed to add foot rests), and it is in deed heavy duty.  </li>
            <li>Only problem is the foot rests that are spaced very far apart.</li>
            <li>There are little foot levers in the back to assist in tipping the chair back a bit, but my dad&#x27;s heavier weight doesn&#x27;t allow me to safely tip him back and push the chair forward over the obstacle.  </li>
            <li>but I can fold it up just fine and put it in the back of my little car that will does not have room for a standard wheelchair.</li>
            <li>Definitely not  good on gravel or grass but easy on pavement.  </li>
            <li>However, it is not much wider than a normal chair.</li>
            <li>And if you have large derriere, you will find yourself half way out the chair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Plenty of sitting room, although I would recommend sitting in it for a little bit before you leave your house for the first time in it, to see if you&#x27;ll need a cushion b&#x27;hind your back.</li>
            <li>With the 22&amp;#34; wide seat, it is basically the same overall width as a normal large-wheeled wheelchair.</li>
            <li>They are OK for a 15 minute ride, but any longer and my wife complained about it being very uncomfortable (like most wheel chairs).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a hassle to return it &amp; get another one, I&#x27;m not sure what I am going to do, since I need to use it right away</li>
            <li>Readily use inside and out, folds well, including the back folding down, for getting in a regular sedan vehicle.  </li>

            <li> We are very pleased.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t feel very safe in it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are very pleased with the chair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It was just what I was looking for at a great price and free shipping..</li>
            <li> We used it at Disneyland and it was comfortable and held up great.  </li>
            <li> I just did not have that kind of $$ to spend again</li>
            <li> I then use a backpack to put supplies in and hang those over the handles after I put the walker on, so I kind of have a neat package to push around on those longer excursions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good packaging, easy set up.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The chair is very easy to maneuver and the advantage to the transport chair is</li>
            <li> The chair is very easily \\&quot;steered\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The chair was very easy for my son to put together.  </li>
            <li> I was assured the bearings are just fine and that it is a really good chair except for some plastic.  </li>
            <li> Will get a good cushion and all will be fine.  </li>
            <li> Would be nice to be able to move it with your hands.</li>
            <li> It opens and closes very smooth and the leg rests are very easy to operate.</li>
            <li> Easy to push!</li>
            <li> This chair is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> The seat is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> It was very comfortable</li>
            <li> It is 39 1/2&amp;#34; tall from the bottom to the top of the handle bars.    </li>
            <li> Our patients love it.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the build and the look of the wheelchair.</li>
            <li> so I went to a wheelchair repair shop and had 2 much better wheels placed on the front for $25 each.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am so glad that I didn&#x27;t pass up the opportunity to buy this</li>
            <li> works great for my mom, 350lbs very moveable, keep in mind breaks dont work well on hills, And that is in the manual..</li>
            <li> like most of them are.</li>
            <li> Was easily able to transport a 350 pound man to and from his doctor&#x27;s appointments with no problems.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;d feel better if it had a wider seat.</li>
            <li> Love the chair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s perfect for me, if not a tad too big</li>
            <li> /&gt;Without the wheelchair, she would not have been able to attend the play.</li>
            <li> The plastic piece on the padded armrest was cracked, but the company promptly sent a replacement piece free of charge and it was very easy to change out.</li>
            <li> so I can find her more easily and need a horn.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy, very comfortable and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> All around great chair so far.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, strong, comfortable!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is really easy to pinch your fingers doing that.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to get in and out of and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Easy to maneuver and makes it easy for me to take her places.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and to maneuver in and out of the car.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to load and unload in my minivan.</li>
            <li> The wheelchair was easy to maneuver, fold and handle.</li>
            <li> Can fold easily ..</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and easily assembled.</li>
            <li> Important dimensions.  </li>
            <li> Its an opportunity to have a way to enjoy just traveling to events that you have put off for years</li>
            <li> Light weight for a bariatric chair.</li>
            <li> this fit what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> She is comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Considering the quality of this product, what a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> but it would be more bother than its worth.</li>
            <li> Not to mention that I would be hesitant about putting something so important</li>
            <li> This wheelchair was great for two weeks, then the front wheel on the left side broke.</li>
            <li> Great wheelchair for a bigger person.</li>
            <li> After constant usage I have EXPERIENCED NO PROBLEMS.  </li>
            <li> Good chair for a big man, but has too many places to crush caregiver&#x27;s fingers when folding it</li>
            <li> the order)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I am THRILLED with this chair... fantastic price, high quality of product.</li>
            <li> I am now able to take her out and do many more things with her as well as not having to worry about having a bariatric chair available when I take her to medical appointments.</li>
            <li> Good value and quality for the price and light enough to lift into the car.</li>
            <li> My wife has limited mobility and this has changed things a great deal for us.</li>
            <li> It was a much nicer chair, but I needed more than 16&amp;#34; for my Grandma</li>
            <li> but I am able to push her in this chair and transfer the chair in and out of trunk without much strain.</li>
            <li> Comes all put together, except for foot rests, which were pretty easy to put on.  </li>
            <li> super price.</li>
            <li> I would have been on the sidewalk myself if not for my daughter-in-law who was walking along side and quickly held me from hitting the ground.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m still very glad to have it.</li>
            <li> Invacare make great products as I have one of their walkers with fold down seat and it supports 300 lbs.</li>
            <li> Foot pedals are tough to get on otherwise great!</li>
            <li> would have given the chair 5 stars if the seat and back were more comfortable.</li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;IMO, it was worth the price paid but is not as durable as the standard&lt;br /&gt;manual wheel chairs we have</li>
            <li> It was well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> We bought the wheelchair to take Kathleen to our granddaughter&#x27;s performance as Christine in Phantom of the Opera.&lt;br /&gt;She was able to sit comfortably for the long play (</li>
            <li> The chair was perfect for what I need especially for teh heavy dutyness</li>
            <li> It unfolds quickly and easily, and I&#x27;m grateful for the hand brakes, which work well and add a measure of safety when transporting a larger person.  </li>
            <li> This means even when the short side of the wheels are up front they are almost touching the foot rests.  </li>
            <li> I received the first chair March 17</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just now OK&#x27;d to return the 2nd chair.</li>
            <li> The first time I went out, we went to the zoo and out to eat, and I learned that I did need a cushion.</li>
            <li> I purchased this transport chair to replace another exactly like it that I have had for some time and it has started &#x27;showing it&#x27;s age&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;MY ADVICE IS TO SPEND MORE MONEY AND GET A LEATHER SEAT &amp; BACK.  </li>
            <li> Price was excellent but it is sometimes difficult to unfold.  </li>
            <li> I have a special needs daughter that needs a heavier weight transport chair because she literally kicked the plastic pedals off her old one!</li>
            <li> I cannot see most bariatrics in this chair because most are much bigger than me, and It is not a comfortable fit for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this chair for my profoundly non verbal Autistic and intelligently impaired  daughter who cannot walk distances and will not follow me in a store.</li>
            <li> My mother is comfortable in it, the smaller back wheels make it MUCH better for getting around the house with.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to put together, It&#x27;s  easy to push and not to heavy to lift.  </li>
            <li> Its so easy to open and fold up.</li>
            <li> buy but easily manipulated into a car&#x27;s back seat or a trunk by the caregiver.</li>
            <li> This transport chair had small wheels, so I thought it would fit better in the trunk of a car.  </li>
            <li> The arm rests come off easily and folding is simple.  </li>
            <li> Good quality sturdy chair, now we have to see how long the bearings in the wheels last.</li>
            <li> A lot cheaper than even some of the large people websites.</li>
            <li> I recommend the chair to users requiring a large chair and comfort.</li>
            <li> The folding back rest allows the chair to fit easily into smaller vehicles.</li>
            <li> The other problem is that it took myself &amp; another person more than an hour to figure out how to put on the swing away foot rests, because when you first put them on, the foot pedals are facing outward and you cannot figure out how to make them face inside.</li>
            <li> It is not like a large wheeled chair where they stick out at a 30 degree angle if not used, making it much wider (so basically you have to use them to keep the profile).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fits in the truck of the car nicely and the smaller wheels in the back vs Wheel chair with large wheels makes it easier to get in and out of the trunk.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s about 260 pounds and has a huge frame, so he needs a larger chair.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonalble.</li>
            <li> This is beautifly built, it came out of the box ready to go.</li>
            <li> I paid over $300 for a light weight transport chair from a medical supply store and it lasted about 3 years, but it got a lot of use.</li>
            <li> so thanks Amazon for the deal.</li>
            <li> Very durable, sturdy chair.  </li>
            <li> We ate at a very crowded restaurant and did not bump into one thing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The chair is plenty wide for me and my son (who pushes it most of the time) loves the hand brakes.  </li>
            <li> This transport wheelchair is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> my wife really likes this chair and so do I</li>
            <li> I felt that they really cared about solving the issue promptly.</li>
            <li> 305 weight  and light enough for me to put in and out of the car.</li>
            <li> Even the foot pads were very accomodating.  </li>
            <li> Really would like to return it, but have no way to get it to the UPS port which is 50 miles from here.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This states it is heavy duty, but it bends in places very easily.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to sit in (although you might want to get a cushion if you will be seated for long periods).</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and has 2 bars underneath it for stability instead of 1 like normal wheelchairs  </li>
            <li> I sure do not want to send it back or even just send the wheel back and wait for a replacement</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to have found a rollator so that I did have did some freedom inside my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> high and 17 1/2&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this chair.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone needing a wider transport chair.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I Would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone with ambulation problems.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone needing transport from car to home.</li>
            <li> Apparently, you are just supposed to find this little lever on your own.  </li>
            <li> It is too wide to fit in a narrower door, like a closet.</li>
            <li> This makes 19 1/2&amp;#34; of normal seat space unless you put a cushion on it.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get it into the house and out of the box by myself and I am disabled.  </li>
            <li> The foot rests were backwards when we received it, but it was simple to just release the adjustable part and turn the foot rests in the right direction.</li>
            <li> It stays right in the back of our Jeep now at all times and she can always go into store with me or anywhere I go!</li>
            <li> that without the large wheels on the sides it fits through standard door ways much easier.</li>
            <li> However, while there is a hole for a notch in the back, there is no button and notch to secure it so it is only held in on one side.  </li>
            <li> I ended up attaching a dining room chair seat cushion for a back cushion, and (after several attempts) settled on a gel-filled seat cushion, which my wife says is now reasonably comfortable.</li>
            <li> He uses a walker around the house, but he can&#x27;t walk very far if I take him somewhere.  </li>
            <li> you are going to use the chair every day or very frequently, take my advice &amp; get another chair.  </li>
            <li> The price compared to other sites was great, I think I saved at least $200 buying it here.</li>
            <li> It is easier if you take the foot rests off, but they are really easy to get on and off with a little practice.</li>
            <li> I was able to fix that issue by pushing the locks in that typically would only be used for lengthening or shortening the rests, but in this case I had to twist the pipe around instead to fix the directionality.    </li>
            <li> The chair is wide enough for him to be comfortable (I bought a wheelchair pad for padding).  </li>
            <li> Thank-you for offering this chair at such a reasonable price and providing reliable service.</li>
            <li> When it comes to medical equipment, you really get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> On balance, the chair is strongly made &amp; has hand brakes, which is a nice accessory, but the cheap seat material is awful; they could have used vinyl to make it more secure &amp; comfortable.est -- you either have to have someone adjust the strap behind your foot or lean down yourself.  </li>
            <li> arrived in 3 days, easy to assemble (only needed to add foot rests), and it is in deed heavy duty.  </li>
            <li> Only problem is the foot rests that are spaced very far apart.</li>
            <li> There are little foot levers in the back to assist in tipping the chair back a bit, but my dad&#x27;s heavier weight doesn&#x27;t allow me to safely tip him back and push the chair forward over the obstacle.  </li>
            <li> but I can fold it up just fine and put it in the back of my little car that will does not have room for a standard wheelchair.</li>
            <li> Definitely not  good on gravel or grass but easy on pavement.  </li>
            <li> However, it is not much wider than a normal chair.</li>
            <li> And if you have large derriere, you will find yourself half way out the chair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Plenty of sitting room, although I would recommend sitting in it for a little bit before you leave your house for the first time in it, to see if you&#x27;ll need a cushion b&#x27;hind your back.</li>
            <li> With the 22&amp;#34; wide seat, it is basically the same overall width as a normal large-wheeled wheelchair.</li>
            <li> They are OK for a 15 minute ride, but any longer and my wife complained about it being very uncomfortable (like most wheel chairs).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a hassle to return it &amp; get another one, I&#x27;m not sure what I am going to do, since I need to use it right away</li>
            <li> Readily use inside and out, folds well, including the back folding down, for getting in a regular sedan vehicle.  </li>
            <li> Very well constructed, heavy duty will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I will never purchase a product like this again, unless I do it locally, and purchase a real wheelchair, not a transport chair, which I did not realize was not safe.</li>
            <li> It folds down for ease of packing in our vehicle and offers comfort for the patient.</li>
            <li> I purchased this wheelchair for my mother who has had limited mobility for several years.</li>
            <li> Some of my doorways were a little narrower than others, and I ended up removing the door completely</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obviously a little bit heavier than her old lightweight chair, but it&#x27;s well made and</li>
            <li> This includes strange upright straps on the foot rests.</li>
            <li> It has been an extremely long process trying to return, exchange and return.  </li>
            <li> A plus is the padded seat for when she sits a long time in it when we are out and about.</li>
            <li> For my adult Autistic daughter, it is her \\&quot;stroller\\&quot; and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Also, even though I&#x27;m not near the weight limit that the chair can hold I still feel squished in it.</li>
            <li> If 19-1/2\\&quot; is wide enough for you, then the seat will work for you; otherwise, you might want to look at regular bariatric wheelchairs with the wide wheels that have a wider seat area.</li>
            <li> It was a long day</li>
            <li> and I had to sit in it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this wheelchair to anyone that wanted one that they would have to sit for long hours.  </li>
            <li> Another problem is that the only way to open this chair is to push down on the seat bars.  </li>
            <li> I had ordered the Medline transport chair that stated it was 19&amp;#34; wide, but it was actually 16&amp;#34; wide.  </li>
            <li> But it gives this chair limited utility for my purposes.</li>
            <li> The tops of the push handles fold down so it fits upright into the back of my Honda CRV.</li>
            <li> It also takes a little practice to get the sequence of removing the seat and back to fold it up.</li>
            <li> Only thing is it is a little heavy for me to pick up and put in the back of the truck.</li>
            <li> wide.  </li>
            <li> so the chair fits through, you just have to be careful.</li>
            <li> My family took me to a museum in a similar rented wheelchair a few days before receiving this one.  </li>
            <li> The item was delivered one day before expected.</li>
            <li> The instructions, (which I believe goes with a different chair), do not tell or show you to look for the little black lever located on the footrest pole that makes the foot pedals turn inward.  </li>
            <li> a little too heavy for a little old lady...</li>
            <li> compared to other web sights I looked at.</li>
            <li> So we don&#x27;t lose the backseat for the million other things that I always have to have with me.</li>
            <li> I think the problem may be the small back wheels, so it might be a problem inherent in all transport chairs.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had listened to the other reviewers on this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that I had to wait so long to receive it after reading other reviews that stated they had gotten it so quickly.</li>
            <li> As my son was pushing me down the sidewalk, the wheel hit a crack and threw me forward.  </li>
            <li> AND THE SEAT RIPPED DOWN</li>
            <li> &quot; WIDE, BECAUSE ON BOTH THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDE OF THE SEAT, THERE IS A ONE INCH STRIP OF FABRIC THAT IS BOLTED TOGETHER WITH GIANT STEEL BOLTS THAT ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TO SIT ON!!!!</li>
            <li> It has allowed all members of my family to do things with her that we previously could not do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took less than 50 hours from the time I placed the order until it arrived at my front door.</li>
            <li> I HAD THIS CHAIR FOR LESS THAN 2 MONTHS</li>
            <li> We owned this for about two and a half years</li>
            <li> Even if someone always pushes it, sometimes the person sitting needs to move it a little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy for me ...</li>
            <li> - then it&#x27;s hard to get those fingers loose!  </li>
            <li> In other words I am a Invacare fan!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a heavy duty chair and</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy being heavy duty</li>
            <li> Biggest draw for me was the medal footrests, they are not cheap plastic</li>
            <li> Not too heavy for a woman to lift and fold.  </li>
            <li> For the price this is a well made heavy duty wheelchair.</li>
            <li> Would not fit my son, so will have to donate it someplace.  </li>
            <li> Not easy to maneuver when you have a patient aboard.</li>
            <li> The leg rests were put together wrong so that they only locked if you put them to the sides</li>
            <li> Looks like the chair is too small for me.</li>
            <li> My wife needs a small walker to stand and turn, which I have found I can bungee cord between the handles to transport with us.</li>
            <li> The sides rub and make it bit uncomfortable to sit long periods.  </li>
            <li> The edges of the seat are hard bars with bolts that are raised sticking out of it.  </li>
            <li> THE SIDE.THE COMPANY WAS NO HELP IN RESPONSE TO MY COMPLAINT.</li>
            <li> This came assembled except for the footrest which can be confusing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they suddenly changed the design or what, but it looks different than pictured and it has some dangerous and potentially painful design flaws.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to push this chair over the threshold at the door or over any other bump.  </li>
            <li> Also, there is an annoying foot strap that prevents your foot from just resting on the footrest -- you either have to have someone adjust the strap behind your foot or lean down yourself.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Eventually the brakes became difficult to keep adjusted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But both foot panels are assembled wrong.</li>
            <li> There are also dangerous issues.  </li>
            <li> The footrest is very difficult to put in.</li>
            <li> WHEN I TELL YOU THIS;  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS MODEL IF YOU WEIGH OVER 300 POUNDS -- THE SEAT IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Foot rests fall off when folding for storing which is annoying.</li>
            <li> suppose you could order a seat pad, but that&#x27;s an annoying</li>

            <li> This is an awesome chair......super price. Thanks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they suddenly changed the design or what, but it looks different than pictured and it has some dangerous and potentially painful design flaws.    The wheels are incredibly close to the leg rests.  This means even when the short side of the wheels are up front they are almost touching the foot rests.  If the wheels turn at all they ram against the foot rests.  The leg rests were put together wrong so that they only locked if you put them to the sides and then they would swing around upfront.  I was able to fix that issue by pushing the locks in that typically would only be used for lengthening or shortening the rests, but in this case I had to twist the pipe around instead to fix the directionality.    There are also dangerous issues.  This includes strange upright straps on the foot rests. There is a bolt going thru the foot rest that holds the strap strait up on one side and then it is attached to the bar of the foot rest.  This could potentially trap your foot and trip you, plus you can&#x27;t put your foot on the foot rest properly to begin with.  This is not shown on the website picture either.    The arm rests are removable and there is a button and notch in front to hold the front of the arm rests in.  However, while there is a hole for a notch in the back, there is no button and notch to secure it so it is only held in on one side.  This means the back part will move around when you try to lift it.   Another problem is that the only way to open this chair is to push down on the seat bars.  Unfortunately it is really easy to pinch your fingers doing that.  Important dimensions.  Seat width technically 22&amp;#34; between the front bars.  Space between arm rests is 21 1/2&amp;#34;.  The edges of the seat are hard bars with bolts that are raised sticking out of it.  This makes 19 1/2&amp;#34; of normal seat space unless you put a cushion on it.  There is also 19 1/2&amp;#34; between the bars on the back rest. The seat is 19&amp;#34; high and 17 1/2&amp;#34; deep.  The chairis a total of 27&amp;#34; wide.  It is 39 1/2&amp;#34; tall from the bottom to the top of the handle bars.    I had ordered the Medline transport chair that stated it was 19&amp;#34; wide, but it was actually 16&amp;#34; wide.  It was a much nicer chair, but I needed more than 16&amp;#34; for my Grandma so I exchanged it for this one because it was listed as wider.  I ordered thru 1800 wheelchairs.  It has been an extremely long process trying to return, exchange and return.  I received the first chair March 17 and I&#x27;m just now OK&#x27;d to return the 2nd chair.</li>
            <li> Bought this wheelchair for my mother. Very well constructed, heavy duty will last a long time. A plus is the padded seat for when she sits a long time in it when we are out and about.</li>
            <li> This is the best transport chair for persons who have a problem walking. Its an opportunity to have a way to enjoy just traveling to events that you have put off for years</li>
            <li> I purchased this wheelchair for my mother who has had limited mobility for several years. It is very easy to use. It opens and closes very smooth and the leg rests are very easy to operate. The foot rests were backwards when we received it, but it was simple to just release the adjustable part and turn the foot rests in the right direction. The chair is very easy to maneuver and the advantage to the transport chair is that without the large wheels on the sides it fits through standard door ways much easier. My mother is over 300 lbs. and I am 110 lbs. but I am able to push her in this chair and transfer the chair in and out of trunk without much strain. The folding back rest allows the chair to fit easily into smaller vehicles. The plastic piece on the padded armrest was cracked, but the company promptly sent a replacement piece free of charge and it was very easy to change out. Having this chair has opened up the world again to my Mother. I am now able to take her out and do many more things with her as well as not having to worry about having a bariatric chair available when I take her to medical appointments. The change in my Mom&#x27;s attitude has been wonderful to see. She no longer feels a prisoner in her home and looks for opportunity&#x27;s to go out. It has allowed all members of my family to do things with her that we previously could not do. We are spending more time together as a family and that is a priceless gift. Thank-you for offering this chair at such a reasonable price and providing reliable service. We are very pleased.</li>
            <li> This wheelchair truly is heavyduty. It is easy to get in and out of and easy to maneuver. I like the folding handles and brakes on both the wheels and handles is convenient.</li>
            <li> I received this chair quicker than promised, which was a plus.  The price compared to other sites was great, I think I saved at least $200 buying it here. The chair came delivered in one piece.I was able to get it into the house and out of the box by myself and I am disabled.  The only thing that is seperate is the foot pegs. Its so easy to open and fold up. Light weight for a bariatric chair. Very sturdy, very comfortable and I am very pleased with it. I would definately recommend this chair to someone else with a need for a bariatric transport chair.</li>
            <li> This chair is very comfortable.  I was looking for a heavy duty chair and this fit what I was looking for.  It was easy to put together, It&#x27;s  easy to push and not to heavy to lift.  It folds up real nice and fits in the trunk of your car.  The price was very reasonalble. compared to other web sights I looked at.</li>
            <li> very impressed with the chairs construction and comfort. Our patients love it. Great price.</li>
            <li> I bought the wheelchair for my grandmother.  She is comfortable.  It is spacious.  I found it incredibly affordable.  I was pleased with the build and the look of the wheelchair.</li>
            <li> This is an update to my last review. I did not get my wheelchair until today because  there was no room number written on the mailing address (I&lt;br /&gt;did include the room number when placing the order)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I am THRILLED with this chair... fantastic price, high quality of product. This is beautifly built, it came out of the box ready to go. All I had to do was place the leg rests on the chair. I HIGHLY recommend this chair.</li>
            <li> This has been a great product for us. My wife has limited mobility and this has changed things a great deal for us. It stays right in the back of our Jeep now at all times and she can always go into store with me or anywhere I go!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my mom. Easy to maneuver and makes it easy for me to take her places.</li>
            <li> I bought this chair for my profoundly non verbal Autistic and intelligently impaired  daughter who cannot walk distances and will not follow me in a store. I paid over $300 for a light weight transport chair from a medical supply store and it lasted about 3 years, but it got a lot of use. I just did not have that kind of $$ to spend again so thanks Amazon for the deal. HOWEVER SOME OF THE PARTS CONNECTING THE FRONT WHEELS ARE PLASTIC AND ONE BROKE ON ONE WHEEL  I sure do not want to send it back or even just send the wheel back and wait for a replacement so I went to a wheelchair repair shop and had 2 much better wheels placed on the front for $25 each. I also had a seat belt added. I was assured the bearings are just fine and that it is a really good chair except for some plastic.  So I added $75 dollars to the regular purchase. It is still a bargain and I am happy I bought it. It is a bit heavy being heavy duty but I can fold it up just fine and put it in the back of my little car that will does not have room for a standard wheelchair. For my adult Autistic daughter, it is her \\&quot;stroller\\&quot; and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I have osteoarthritis. This chair will allow me to take a vacation with my family and not be a burden. Considering the quality of this product, what a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> We should have gotten big wheels in the back. Even if someone always pushes it, sometimes the person sitting needs to move it a little. Would be nice to be able to move it with your hands.</li>
            <li> Took a week to come.  Good packaging, easy set up.  Very durable, sturdy chair.  However, it is not much wider than a normal chair. The sides rub and make it bit uncomfortable to sit long periods.  And if you have large derriere, you will find yourself half way out the chair.  So its not very deep either.  Should have paid closer attention to the dimensions. But it said Bariatric, so I assumed it was for bariatric patients. I cannot see most bariatrics in this chair because most are much bigger than me, and It is not a comfortable fit for me. Looks like the chair is too small for me. Hmph!  I guess I should return it but it would be more bother than its worth.</li>
            <li> I was beyond ecstatic when I found this chair on Amazon. And for the price, it was not something I could pass by. I have Lupus and have been confined to my home for close to 2 years b&#x27;cause we couldn&#x27;t afford a wheelchair. I was lucky enough to have found a rollator so that I did have did some freedom inside my home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took less than 50 hours from the time I placed the order until it arrived at my front door. It was already assembled, except for the foot rests. A pleasant surprise b&#x27;cause my hubby is not mechanically inclined. I&#x27;ve always been the one to put things together. Not to mention that I would be hesitant about putting something so important together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plenty of sitting room, although I would recommend sitting in it for a little bit before you leave your house for the first time in it, to see if you&#x27;ll need a cushion b&#x27;hind your back. The first time I went out, we went to the zoo and out to eat, and I learned that I did need a cushion. The chair is very easily \\&quot;steered\\&quot;. We ate at a very crowded restaurant and did not bump into one thing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B&#x27;cause of the brakes on the handles, you can&#x27;t hang a bag on the handle. So if you need to carry a lot of stuff with you, I do recommend that you either buy a bag made to hang on the back of the seat, or have one made to your liking. I have a friend who sews, and she helped hook me up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I didn&#x27;t pass up the opportunity to buy this chair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another bonus is that the chair is compact enough, that when it&#x27;s folded up it fits in the trunk of a car. So we don&#x27;t lose the backseat for the million other things that I always have to have with me.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and has 2 bars underneath it for stability instead of 1 like normal wheelchairs  I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Works perfect Pleased would consider ordering again from Amazon and recommed to friends The chair was perfect for what I need especially for teh heavy dutyness I need it for.</li>
            <li> I purchased this transport chair to replace another exactly like it that I have had for some time and it has started &#x27;showing it&#x27;s age&#x27;.  The chair was very easy for my son to put together.  All he had to do was attach one of the side pieces (by sliding the posts into the holes until they clicked) and attach the foot rests.  It took him all of 30 seconds to do this.  The chair is plenty wide for me and my son (who pushes it most of the time) loves the hand brakes.  I highly recommend this product to anyone needing a wider transport chair.</li>
            <li> works great for my mom, 350lbs very moveable, keep in mind breaks dont work well on hills, And that is in the manual..</li>
            <li> My wife has a stroke and I needed a wheelchair  to move her around the houser and out to appointments. This Invacare chair has done an excellent job. With the 22&amp;#34; wide seat, it is basically the same overall width as a normal large-wheeled wheelchair. Some of my doorways were a little narrower than others, and I ended up removing the door completely so the chair fits through, you just have to be careful. It is too wide to fit in a narrower door, like a closet. I can wheel my wife out on the back deck through the sliding doors. One of the benefits is that the foot rests curl back inside the wheel profile when they are not being used. It is not like a large wheeled chair where they stick out at a 30 degree angle if not used, making it much wider (so basically you have to use them to keep the profile).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the ease with which it folds. The tops of the push handles fold down so it fits upright into the back of my Honda CRV. I just use a bungee cord to keep it from rolling. It is easier if you take the foot rests off, but they are really easy to get on and off with a little practice.It also takes a little practice to get the sequence of removing the seat and back to fold it up. My wife needs a small walker to stand and turn, which I have found I can bungee cord between the handles to transport with us. I then use a backpack to put supplies in and hang those over the handles after I put the walker on, so I kind of have a neat package to push around on those longer excursions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given the chair 5 stars if the seat and back were more comfortable. They are OK for a 15 minute ride, but any longer and my wife complained about it being very uncomfortable (like most wheel chairs). I ended up attaching a dining room chair seat cushion for a back cushion, and (after several attempts) settled on a gel-filled seat cushion, which my wife says is now reasonably comfortable. I did have to tighten some of the connectors when it arrived (like the manual suggests), and I had to adjust one of the brakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I rate this a great value (quality v. cost).</li>
            <li> Good quality sturdy chair, now we have to see how long the bearings in the wheels last. I find that to be the most vulnerable point, but this chair looks sturdier than some that we have purchased</li>
            <li> I have a special needs daughter that needs a heavier weight transport chair because she literally kicked the plastic pedals off her old one! This chair is wonderful! It&#x27;s obviously a little bit heavier than her old lightweight chair, but it&#x27;s well made and well worth the money. Biggest draw for me was the medal footrests, they are not cheap plastic like most of them are. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> We take Mom in this chair everywhere!</li>
            <li> A perfect wheel chair for our needs. Great price. It is sturdy, but it does not roll as easyily as a big wheel, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This transport wheelchair is very sturdy. Was easily able to transport a 350 pound man to and from his doctor&#x27;s appointments with no problems. It is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> returned this product without taking it out of the box.  My family took me to a museum in a similar rented wheelchair a few days before receiving this one.  As my son was pushing me down the sidewalk, the wheel hit a crack and threw me forward.  I would have been on the sidewalk myself if not for my daughter-in-law who was walking along side and quickly held me from hitting the ground.  Even tho we returned this product without having taken it out of the box, I had to pay for shipping, and &amp;#34;restocking&amp;#34; charges, which were substantial.  I will never purchase a product like this again, unless I do it locally, and purchase a real wheelchair, not a transport chair, which I did not realize was not safe.</li>
            <li> This was a very good chair for the price.  It is easy to use and to maneuver in and out of the car.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I needed a walker or a wheelchair. I researched and chose this transport wheelchair as my solution. It is easy to load and unload in my minivan. It is very good as a walker. It is comfortable to sit in (although you might want to get a cushion if you will be seated for long periods).</li>
            <li> I HAD THIS CHAIR FOR LESS THAN 2 MONTHS AND THE SEAT RIPPED DOWN THE SIDE.THE COMPANY WAS NO HELP IN RESPONSE TO MY COMPLAINT.</li>
            <li> This wheelchair was great for two weeks, then the front wheel on the left side broke. They sent me another wheel, but I did not trust it so I purchase another wheelchair from another company. I give it three stars because the wheel broke. The wheelchair was easy to maneuver, fold and handle.</li>
            <li> Wwell constructed&lt;br /&gt;Durable&lt;br /&gt;If used for prolonged sitting, need a cusion.&lt;br /&gt;It is a transport chair, not a wheel chair</li>
            <li> Not too heavy for a woman to lift and fold.  Good chair for a big man, but has too many places to crush caregiver&#x27;s fingers when folding it - then it&#x27;s hard to get those fingers loose!  Definitely not  good on gravel or grass but easy on pavement.  Foot rests fall off when folding for storing which is annoying.</li>
            <li> This came assembled except for the footrest which can be confusing.</li>
            <li> We owned this for about two and a half years and it served quite well.&lt;br /&gt;Eventually the brakes became difficult to keep adjusted.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the seat bottom started tearing so we retired it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMO, it was worth the price paid but is not as durable as the standard&lt;br /&gt;manual wheel chairs we have owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To fold as it does it is necessarily a more complicated design than a&lt;br /&gt;regular manual wheelchair.  Considering that we still rated it a 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Folds up and fits in your trunk great! Easy to push! Great wheelchair for a bigger person. The seat is very comfortable. All around great chair so far. I wished I would of found this wheelchair sooner! Great price!!</li>
            <li> great buy on this chair. needed a wider one and on a budget  this fit the problem perfect. therpast loved the breaks on handle  works  with a squeeze</li>
            <li> sturdy chair...elicits confidence in the user.  Can fold easily ..a little too heavy for a little old lady...buy but easily manipulated into a car&#x27;s back seat or a trunk by the caregiver.</li>
            <li> We plan on using it when we go on vacation.  It was cheaper to buy this chair than it was to rent one for a week and pay all the fees attached for the rental.</li>
            <li> This states it is heavy duty, but it bends in places very easily. Not easy to maneuver when you have a patient aboard.</li>
            <li> my wife really likes this chair and so do I</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that I had to wait so long to receive it after reading other reviews that stated they had gotten it so quickly. I use it whenever I go to stores that don&#x27;t have the electric carts and it comes in very handy. However, I don&#x27;t feel very safe in it. I keep thinking the seat will split in 2 and I&#x27;ll land on the floor. Also, even though I&#x27;m not near the weight limit that the chair can hold I still feel squished in it. I think I&#x27;d feel better if it had a wider seat. Overall I&#x27;m still very glad to have it.</li>
            <li> The footrest is very difficult to put in.</li>
            <li> For the price this is a well made heavy duty wheelchair. It is well thought out from a design point of view. For some reason the designers don&#x27;t have a fastener on the front of the arm supports only the back so that if you try to move or pick it up from the arms they will try to pull up.</li>
            <li> Works well for what I need.  Will get a good cushion and all will be fine.  hunting a flag to place so I can find her more easily and need a horn.  A bike horn will work.</li>
            <li> Came assembled which was a plus for me.  Very nicely constructed.  Good value and quality for the price and light enough to lift into the car.</li>
            <li> There was a mix up in my order, but Big Apple immediately sent me a replacement chair.  It is great!  Just as described.  I felt that they really cared about solving the issue promptly.</li>
            <li> Love the chair. It was just what I was looking for at a great price and free shipping.. I Would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Foot pedals are tough to get on otherwise great!</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this product enough!!  If anyone, of any size - I weigh 300 lbs.) needs a transport chair this is the one to buy!!!  Invacare make great products as I have one of their walkers with fold down seat and it supports 300 lbs. In other words I am a Invacare fan!!</li>
            <li> I bought this wheelchair to make transporting my father easier.  He uses a walker around the house, but he can&#x27;t walk very far if I take him somewhere.  He&#x27;s about 260 pounds and has a huge frame, so he needs a larger chair.  The chair is wide enough for him to be comfortable (I bought a wheelchair pad for padding).  It unfolds quickly and easily, and I&#x27;m grateful for the hand brakes, which work well and add a measure of safety when transporting a larger person.  The chair fits in the back of my sedan without any trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the problem.  It&#x27;s very difficult to push this chair over the threshold at the door or over any other bump.  There are little foot levers in the back to assist in tipping the chair back a bit, but my dad&#x27;s heavier weight doesn&#x27;t allow me to safely tip him back and push the chair forward over the obstacle.  I think the problem may be the small back wheels, so it might be a problem inherent in all transport chairs.  But it gives this chair limited utility for my purposes.</li>
            <li> I needed a folding portable wheelchair to get from a parking lot to a hotel room &amp; back.  This transport chair had small wheels, so I thought it would fit better in the trunk of a car.  THE ACTUAL SITTING AREA IS ONLY 19-1/2\\&quot; WIDE, BECAUSE ON BOTH THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDE OF THE SEAT, THERE IS A ONE INCH STRIP OF FABRIC THAT IS BOLTED TOGETHER WITH GIANT STEEL BOLTS THAT ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TO SIT ON!!!! Poor design, as they could have covered them with fabric to make it more comfortable &amp; wheelchair pads are expensive.  The other problem is that it took myself &amp; another person more than an hour to figure out how to put on the swing away foot rests, because when you first put them on, the foot pedals are facing outward and you cannot figure out how to make them face inside. They don&#x27;t just swing inward. The instructions, (which I believe goes with a different chair), do not tell or show you to look for the little black lever located on the footrest pole that makes the foot pedals turn inward.  Apparently, you are just supposed to find this little lever on your own.  It took us 1 hour to figure this out. Also, there is an annoying foot strap that prevents your foot from just resting on the footrest -- you either have to have someone adjust the strap behind your foot or lean down yourself.  The strap is also not shown on the diagram. If 19-1/2\\&quot; is wide enough for you, then the seat will work for you; otherwise, you might want to look at regular bariatric wheelchairs with the wide wheels that have a wider seat area. On balance, the chair is strongly made &amp; has hand brakes, which is a nice accessory, but the cheap seat material is awful; they could have used vinyl to make it more secure &amp; comfortable.est -- you either have to have someone adjust the strap behind your foot or lean down yourself.  The strap is also not shown on the diagram. Totally annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRUST ME WHEN I TELL YOU THIS;  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS MODEL IF YOU WEIGH OVER 300 POUNDS -- THE SEAT IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.  I wish I had listened to the other reviewers on this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY ADVICE IS TO SPEND MORE MONEY AND GET A LEATHER SEAT &amp; BACK.  WHEN YOU RENT ONE FROM A MEDICAL PRODUCTS COMPANY, YOU WILL SEE THAT THERE ARE NO GIANT BOLTS ON THE SEAT -- IT IS ALL BOLTED UNDERNEATH THE SEAT, SO IT IS COMFORTABLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose you could order a seat pad, but that&#x27;s an annoying expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product.  It&#x27;s such a hassle to return it &amp; get another one, I&#x27;m not sure what I am going to do, since I need to use it right away &amp; I&#x27;m only gonna use it two or three times a year.  I&#x27;ve got 30 days to decide what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to use the chair every day or very frequently, take my advice &amp; get another chair.  When it comes to medical equipment, you really get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It has been wonderful for my mom.  Only thing is it is a little heavy for me to pick up and put in the back of the truck.</li>
            <li> The wheel chair is on good quality. But both foot panels are assembled wrong. I have to try to get warrenty. It is very frustrated.</li>
            <li> The airline broke the brake handle . Now it sports duct tape to hold it together. Otherwise it is big enough to support my husbands 305 weight  and light enough for me to put in and out of the car.</li>
            <li> I ordered this wheelchair because it said it supported 400 lbs.  And I needed it in a hurry.  Shipping got it here just in time for me to attend my nephew&#x27;s wedding.  It was a long day and I had to sit in it for a long time.  It was very comfortable and I had plenty of room.  Even the foot pads were very accomodating.  I would recommend this wheelchair to anyone that wanted one that they would have to sit for long hours.  It was excellent.  It was well worth the money.  A lot cheaper than even some of the large people websites.</li>
            <li> I love this chair!!  It says up to 400 lbs but I&#x27;m only 225 and it&#x27;s perfect for me, if not a tad too big but there wasn&#x27;t anything in between that I could find. Comes all put together, except for foot rests, which were pretty easy to put on.  Don&#x27;t hesitate!!  Buy it!!</li>
            <li> Good sturdy chair. Only problem is the foot rests that are spaced very far apart. Wish the footrests could be adjusted.</li>
            <li> This product met my expectations.  We used it at Disneyland and it was comfortable and held up great.  I highly recommend this for anyone with ambulation problems.</li>
            <li> Would not fit my son, so will have to donate it someplace.  Really would like to return it, but have no way to get it to the UPS port which is 50 miles from here.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> arrived in 3 days, easy to assemble (only needed to add foot rests), and it is in deed heavy duty.  The arm rests come off easily and folding is simple.  excellent product.</li>
            <li> It does the trick to perfection.  Readily use inside and out, folds well, including the back folding down, for getting in a regular sedan vehicle.  It&#x27;s a little heavy for me ... 40+ lbs, but I can still manage it.  My mother is comfortable in it, the smaller back wheels make it MUCH better for getting around the house with.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Chair is well built and sturdy.  It folds compactly and presents no storage problem.  Invacare has an excellent reputation so when I saw a favorable price I bought the chair.  After constant usage I have EXPERIENCED NO PROBLEMS.  I would highly recommend it to anyone needing transport from car to home.</li>
            <li> We bought the wheelchair to take Kathleen to our granddaughter&#x27;s performance as Christine in Phantom of the Opera.&lt;br /&gt;She was able to sit comfortably for the long play (almost 4 hours)&lt;br /&gt;We are very pleased with the chair.&lt;br /&gt;Without the wheelchair, she would not have been able to attend the play.</li>
            <li> Price was excellent but it is sometimes difficult to unfold.  The bars seem to stick under the seat.  The item was delivered one day before expected.</li>
            <li> It is every bit like the description said it was. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I chose this chair for its size and heavey duty construction. It folds down for ease of packing in our vehicle and offers comfort for the patient. I recommend the chair to users requiring a large chair and comfort. The care taker canguide the chair and the hand brakes are a good safety feature.</li>
            <li> I looked at lots of chairs to find one to use in the kitchen, rather than my travel one we leave in car. Fantastic, strong, comfortable!</li>
            <li> Product was as described. Delivered on time and easily assembled. Fits in the truck of the car nicely and the smaller wheels in the back vs Wheel chair with large wheels makes it easier to get in and out of the trunk.</li>
