            <li> The blades are very sharp so be careful!..I get 2 shaves out of 1 blade, but I&#x27;m not 1 of those guys that looks like a teen wolf. And yes ladies it works on your faces as&#x27; well, again be very careful, these blades will get the job done!!! Trust me great blades!!!..</li>
            <li> Thanks, awesome product</li>

            <li> Sharp blades. Comparable to the derby blades I had finished before ordering these. Love the packaging.</li>
            <li> Really sharp but are excellent for a really smooth shave. I&#x27;d definitely recommend buying them to anyone interested. They arrived sooner than I thought. Reliable seller too.</li>
            <li> Awesome customer service. The blades cut nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> If you shave any other way you are being chumped.</li>

            <li> Simple and cheap, they get the job done.  I&#x27;ve been using these in a straight edge style shavette. Be careful starting out.  It&#x27;s like shaving with a scalpel.</li>
            <li> Hello from Florida! Came promptly after ordering, and in even better condition than the box they used in the product display photo for Amazon! When I see people paying $24.95 for 4 tri and quad blades in the stores, it makes me wonder why everyone doesn&#x27;t make the switch to a straight razor. How can anyone beat a deal like that? $9 (after s&amp;h) and I have enough blades to last me for months...if not the entire year, and some. And they&#x27;re so sharp - I never have to worry about getting a dull blade, or tugging and pulling during shaving. Thanks, SHARK! Will buy again!</li>
