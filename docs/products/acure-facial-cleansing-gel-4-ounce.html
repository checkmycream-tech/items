            <li>Thank you Acure for another amazing product.</li>

            <li>It smells good and is able to remove my make up at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful, gentle, non-drying and effective cleanser.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and citrusy.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you follow up with a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love it for oily skin, smells good too.</li>
            <li>Whole Foods has a wonderful all natural/organic beauty section, you can get lost for hours.  </li>
            <li>Really nice product.  </li>
            <li>I am the kind of person who has tried TONS of products for my oily skin and none seem to work that well.</li>
            <li>prone to breakouts, eczema, just a joy really :P )</li>
            <li>prone to breakouts, eczema, just a joy really :P )</li>
            <li>This gel is a joy to use so a quick lather removes makeup and dirt.</li>
            <li>This gel is a joy to use so a quick lather removes makeup and dirt.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel sooo clean and amazing!</li>
            <li>I decided to try this and their mud mask solely because it&#x27;s fairly traded and I will always opt for that when it&#x27;s available, and oh man it worked.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for sensitive and prone skin</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and feels like a much more luxurious/expensive product.</li>
            <li>I was already planning on repurchasing it because it&#x27;s so good at gently removing my eye makeup, but am even more happy to do so</li>
            <li>Excellent, natural cleanser for any type of skin.  </li>
            <li>My husband has cyctic acne and after using this product coupled with the Acure sensitive skin body lotion (it&#x27;s cheaper than &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; lotion and has great ingredients, so we figured we&#x27;d try it as a face lotion!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  the best I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this cleanser!  </li>
            <li>Good smell, gentle on face, and a good brand.</li>
            <li>have not broke out and it feels like a good clean.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly &amp; arrived in good shape.  </li>
            <li>It also gets great reviews from the Environmental Working Group for pure and non-toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that this is organic.</li>
            <li>I love how my face reacts to thes all-natural products.</li>
            <li>But it smells lovely, and it is much better than Zia, the stuff I was using before.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many cleansers over the years and this time, I don&#x27;t feel a desire to change cleansers.</li>
            <li>i love this line now, and their simplicity and integrity.</li>

            <li>I love this face</li>
            <li>I also love the scent of it.</li>
            <li>Low EWG rating and works great!  </li>
            <li>I love this product line.  </li>
            <li>In any case, this is their top choice.</li>
            <li>and I love the ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I continue to love it.</li>
            <li>I love this wash and also use their shampoo and conditioner too.</li>
            <li>and I am allergic to most lotions, soaps and skin products.  </li>
            <li>but it is one of my favorite face washes.  </li>
            <li>It cleans very well and smells great.</li>
            <li>Also, love the smell.</li>
            <li>Safe ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Spending over an hour checking out different products I found this wonderful cleanser!  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, the feel, and how well they work.</li>
            <li>I love the cleanser, although I do wish it was a bit more thicker and not so runny.  </li>
            <li>I love this product for my face.</li>
            <li>this product is better than soap.</li>
            <li>decided once again to try, I love it.  </li>
            <li>But the nicest thing is knowing that it&#x27;s safe for my skin.</li>
            <li>By skin tone has become more even.</li>
            <li>I love the Acure product line.  </li>
            <li>However, I seem to not be able to kick this excess oil regardless of me breaking out or not - I am just always oily.</li>
            <li>Really love the smell and consistency of this product.</li>
            <li>I love acure organics.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never had to use more than one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I LOVE Acure products.</li>
            <li>At the three week mark with using this magic.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t provide me with the healthy glow</li>
            <li>This is the best facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>overall Great!</li>
            <li>It smells lovely, it cleans and it also removes my mascara and make-up wonderful, leaving my face soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>This is a great cleanser for normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good cleanser.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely smell a well as being a good gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good basic cleanser.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is a light citrus (although more lemony to me than grapefruit).</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love, absolute LOVE with my skin again!</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m sure this is a great product.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the clean rinse, but it dries out my face</li>
            <li>It takes all my makeup off easily.</li>
            <li>My skin seems to do decent with soaps for a month or maybe two, and then it just seems not to do any good anymore.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to everyone but make sure you buy the right stuff for your type of skin!</li>
            <li>Perfect for my combo skin and seems to be helping o fade my dark marks.</li>
            <li>This cleaner works great and leaves your skin feeling soft, clean, and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Combo skin is fine, but you may need to use a heavier cream in the winter.</li>
            <li>washes makeup off so well and has a pleasant, natural smell.</li>
            <li>but when I found out I was pregnant my hormones through by skin for a loop!</li>
            <li>Buy on Amazon bc whole foods has it for $10 more!</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price hands down, Target Sells it for over $20!</li>
            <li>Tried the day cream, and it is fantastic too.</li>
            <li>I can not say enough great things about this face wash.</li>
            <li>so it is great that you only need a tab of the gel.</li>
            <li>this is a great second option.</li>
            <li>Smells lightly fruity.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Gentle but effective.</li>
            <li>and you can feel your face is baby smooth</li>
            <li>Nice and gentle cleansing for my skin.</li>
            <li>I buy nothing but cruelty-free cosmetics and beauty products and enjoy almost everything I have tried from ACURE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good cleansing gel for my sensitive skin that is prone to dryness and eczema.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done a lot of research on what natural things are good for the skin, and what each one of them does.  </li>
            <li>In reality it is really about finding your perfect combination of products, from night oils, creams, and facial wash in combination with your make-up.</li>
            <li>* is effective, gentle, lathers into a rich foam,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a gel-like consistency and feels cool to the skin, and rinses easily.</li>
            <li>but works great for morning cleansing, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, very mild, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>(the bottle says its for normal to oily skin), however it did make my skin look better than most products did.</li>
            <li>Baking soda is mildly abrasive, and when combined with this cleanser it completely smoothes out my skin to most-desirable bright and glowy effects.</li>
            <li>Still i paid the higher WF price to try it immediately and be able to return it if I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting to love this face wash so much!</li>
            <li>It works great at removing makeup and doesn&#x27;t appear to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean without feeling pinched.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean after washing.</li>
            <li>Just clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>This cleansing gel was very pleasant to use but it definitely dried out my skin!</li>
            <li>Use it everyday, never fails me and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>why buy luxury designer brand name skincare that is full of junk?</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve copied the full ingredient list from the website.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve copied the full ingredient list from the website.</li>
            <li>i could not say enough good things about this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Only good part is oily skin at 61</li>
            <li>the &#x27;skin-renewal&#x27; claims are true over time.</li>
            <li>Love this face product for cleaning my sensitive skin!!!</li>
            <li>This facial cleansing gel is so refreshing and easy on my skin!</li>
            <li>This line, and especially this particular face cleaner is packed with so many of the things that is good for our skin.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell, nice cleansing without leaving my face tight after that.</li>
            <li>I like the smell because to me it smells fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>I do massage well with my fingers because it doesn&#x27;t just melt the makeup and oil away, but it works well and quickly.</li>
            <li>love this facial wash, i havent found anything better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy to say, I will definitely be streamlining my face care and getting rid of the several cleansers i have all over the shower/medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy to say, I will definitely be streamlining my face care and getting rid of the several cleansers i have all over the shower/medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>I have super oily, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and leaves my face feeling fresh and deep cleaned.</li>
            <li>Helps with my mild acne.</li>
            <li>There are no harsh chemical ingredients, which I love, and it&#x27;s also cruelty free.</li>
            <li>I have high praise for that product, and will probably write a review after I had more experience with it.</li>
            <li>I am 49 and honestly have not spent a lot of money or effort on skin care products.  </li>
            <li>: I follow it immediately with a balancing toner, spot treat with tea tree oil, and then apply a good moisturizer before my skin has a chance to dry out.</li>
            <li>This is a really good buy for anyone who needs a makeup remover but understands that they will still need to wash their face again after, or someone who doesn&#x27;t wear makeup but has sensitive or normal skin.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Acure products and this is a very fine facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>the past week or two I&#x27;ve been doing some experimenting and have seen really awesome results when combining this with baking soda (for washing my face AFTER having already removed my makeup); I put some on a wash cloth and and then sprinkle a roughly equal amount (maybe a teaspoon?) of baking soda on top.</li>
            <li>(it doesn&#x27;t take much at all!!).</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling clean and crisp.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that my skin is in great condition after using this for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>(usually only comes off with warm water and wiggling) and all my foundation and waterproof eyeliner.</li>
            <li>now as far as the ingredients , you can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>I want to love this, especially since it is toxin free.</li>
            <li>This leaves your face fresh, but not stripped of oil.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price in every way.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling fresh but not overly-dry.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very clean and doesn&#x27;t aggravate my acne prone sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I would use the lotion right after the cleanser and have decided to give up both.  </li>
            <li>But - according to them - it&#x27;s tricky finding the right balance between cleaning and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>appearance right after using the face wash...</li>
            <li>Acure&#x27;s whole brand (well, at least everything I&#x27;ve tried!) is wonderful.</li>
            <li>but I will take a more gentle product over complete makeup removal.</li>
            <li>Gentle and vegan!</li>
            <li>How brilliant of the cosmetic  companies to get us hooked, through false advertising, on products that crate the very problems they claim to cure!</li>
            <li>Actual review starts now : )</li>
            <li>I just wished I found this cleanser 13 years ago when I first started breaking out with cysts.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that the top layer of my skin needed exfoliating, so I bought the Acure brand&#x27;s exfoliating scrub prior to this product.</li>
            <li>This cleanser did not make my face red or break out more after use.</li>
            <li>I always used Kiels, and other nice brands</li>
            <li>But, other cleansers have been much more effective at removing at least most of my makeup.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel any residue or over-dryness after using it, just clean and soft.</li>
            <li>so far I love it, and it&#x27;s an all natural company/product too.</li>
            <li>the thing I&#x27;ve been looking for that completely healed my skin, however it has done MUCH better than everything I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>I have mild acne and VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Cleans very well and very gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This wash is so gentle on me skin and has been very affictive!</li>
            <li>Super natural product.</li>
            <li>I am new to using this line of facial products, and I have to say I love every one of them.  </li>
            <li>It is natural, it removes makeup, it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin too dry, and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>It was a good cleanser, but my face was red after use, and my cheeks looked dry.  </li>
            <li>and although it didn&#x27;t make my pores amazingly smaller and tone my skin, etc., it really did reduce the large pimples I have and kept my skin from developing too many new pimples weekly.</li>
            <li>I really like how clean it makes my face feel, and how gentle it is, not causing my combination skin to break out any more than it usually does.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin super moisturized like other moisturizers, but it leaves my skin feeling comfortable and not oily or irritated in any way.  </li>
            <li>Use sparingly as too much can cause a rather drying effect.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t breakout as much</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
            <li>It cleans my face (without having to remove makeup) very thoroughly.</li>
            <li>i have very oily/acne prone skin, and this has helped a lot.</li>
            <li>I then gently scrub my face with it in circular motions for maybe two minutes.</li>
            <li>This Product didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I always buy at whole food store.</li>
            <li>, I really didn&#x27;t want to rock the boat and change.  </li>
            <li>This line of skincare has really made an improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li>And my face doesn&#x27;t breakout much anymore.</li>
            <li>We both have dermatitis/psoriasis and this face wash seems gentle.</li>
            <li>at this point in my life - I enjoy using this facial wash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It removes make up really well.</li>
            <li>None of them have aggravated my dermatitis whatsoever and the costs are reasonable.</li>
            <li>Oh whole foods....</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much in the way of oil reduction</li>
            <li>I started with a dime sized amount on a wet face, and it had a fair amount of slip to it, so i was thinking it&#x27;d take forever to wash off (the way facial bar soaps do).</li>
            <li>and not at the price of SukiFace (another natural brand i love, but different price bracket).</li>
            <li>It foams so nicely without a harsh sulfate lather feeling.</li>
            <li>I literally only use one drop for my whole face, it spreads evenly and foams up a little bit and has an amazing smell!</li>
            <li>Though this cleanser cuts through makeup really well, it doesn&#x27;t seem to deep clean my pores</li>
            <li>I might go back to my original routine and see if that makes any difference.</li>
            <li>I like other Acure cleansers better.</li>
            <li>This facial cleaning gel is a product I like a lot, and have been using for about 4 months, but I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars because it&#x27;s not something I would use every day, because I find it a little drying, and also it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t clear up my acne - yet it also does causes any new acne, which is good!</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t give me that deep clean feeling after using it.</li>
            <li>(basically, a lot of more conventional face products make my skin ITCH.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed less breakouts and smooth fresh feel.</li>
            <li>I love my natural skincare items and I love the idea behind Acure.</li>
            <li>Essential Oil, Citric Acidat is full of junk?</li>
            <li>If you use this face wash and follow it immediately with one of their moisturizers, you will notice a whole new face in about 10 days.  </li>
            <li>Because I don&#x27;t have to use a large amount of product, I find it to be more cost-effective than many of the other makeup removers and cleansers I&#x27;ve used for this purpose in the past.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser, clean all makeup off without over drying my middle aged skin!!!</li>
            <li>and I have to say it&#x27;s a great cleanser if you don&#x27;t have bad acne or really oily skin because it leaves skin looking healthy and not dry.  </li>
            <li>leaves my skin feeling very clean but not tight or dry.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, and truly believe that you won&#x27;t regret giving it a shot..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all Acure products for their purity and safety.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>skin is also super sensitive and that makes finding facial wash that much harder.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wish it removed my makeup a little better</li>
            <li>Leaves my combo skin feeling clean and refreshed without stripping the necessary natural oils away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several brands, this leaves my face clean but doesn&#x27;t strip away my natural oils.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s such a gentle face wash and smells pretty decent.</li>
            <li>This works really well for my sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li>I like how the product doesn&#x27;t really foam, indicating there&#x27;s no harsh ingredients...</li>
            <li>Gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This leaves your skin clean without being dry.</li>
            <li>, the cleanser is so gentle I didn&#x27;t even have to order the sensitive skin line.  </li>
            <li>It feels gentle and leaves my face soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for a few months now, every night and most mornings</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>I run out of the new stuff)</li>
            <li>Seriously, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Sure their prices are higher than here, but it&#x27;s usually fresher and there&#x27;s no 3rd party seller to go through.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s made my skin more glowy looking</li>
            <li>Complete turn around!</li>
            <li>Acure Organics&#x27; facial cleansing gel wasn&#x27;t exactly the hero -</li>
            <li>The scars on my face are less noticeable, my skin feels younger and healthier, the tone is more even,  it almost glows.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, large pores, and occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li>My skin also responds really well to alkaline cleansers; if you have sensitive skin, break out or otherwise have a reaction (e.g.: redness) when washing your face with soap or soap based (read: alkaline, pH basic) cleansers, I do not recommend you try baking soda on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I follow my cleansing routine with rosewater and the sensitive moisturizer from ACURE.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>not green).</li>
            <li>not green).</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleasantly surprised that this has not been the case with this brand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an all natural junkie, but I do believe that nature provides us with the things we need if we know what to look for.  </li>
            <li>This is a gentle, non-stripping, pH neutral cleanser that I rate a solid 3 stars for my skin and needs; however, as a makeup remover, it&#x27;s 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I use the acure argan oil as a moisturizer after this and my face is looking glowy and feels so soft.</li>
            <li>I am a complete beauty product junky.</li>
            <li>have been using this for a couple of weeks now and so far I am liking</li>
            <li>his cystic acne has completely gone away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone with oily skin should definitely purchase this, it really helps.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-I also like that it boasts mainly of natural, organic ingredients, though there&#x27;s no way to know whether these claims are verifiable or</li>
            <li>Switched to organic ACURE product after being recommended by a professional to go with organic products.</li>
            <li>I need to combine this with an exfoliating wash a few times a week, but other than that I love it!  </li>
            <li>I have several items I love from the Acure line (their green clay mask, argan oil, day cream , haircare).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve slowly but surely found some brand loyalty through my musings at my local Whole Foods, where you can smell and get samples for almost anything.</li>
            <li>This is an honest review from someone who&#x27;s been battling acne and the damage it leaves behind for about 13 years.  </li>
            <li>It did quite good, but not excellent.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful, subtle aroma and it&#x27;s very thick and sudsy</li>
            <li>I usually use Origins products, but I actually like this better</li>
            <li>It says normal to oily skin on the tube and my skin is older and sun damaged, but it does not make my skin feel dry or taught.  </li>
            <li>Creamy cleansers won&#x27;t usually remove physical sunscreen, so for a gel, this is gentler than most.</li>
            <li>I am still in the earlier stages of using it, and am willing to try different things out in order to see what works.</li>
            <li>For the last 5 years I&#x27;ve lived in Colorado in the blaring high altitude zero humidity sunlight.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So to make a long story short, right now</li>
            <li>I immediately stopped using it, and went back to my normal boscia face wash.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly what I expected and received in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>You simply feel clean and fresh after you use it and a small amount goes a long way, so thats always a plus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on the look for new products, especially ones without all the yucky parabens, ect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently trying a new product, but I keep this Acure&#x27;s cleansing gel on standby just in case</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have been ordering my cleanser from the opposite coast wasting money on shipping, but since I have problem skin and have always thrown away lots of money trying to find the cure</li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s a major perk that this product works so well while being organic.</li>
            <li>All the spots on my face I had picked at in high school even though mom told me not to (gross I know...) suddenly became scars.  </li>
            <li>no super tight pores either, that would just produce more oil.</li>
            <li>My face is never as clear as it is when I am using this regularly.</li>
            <li>So overall, it didn&#x27;t completely clear my skin, but it cleared my skin quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that all you need is a pea size drop to cleanse your entire face.</li>
            <li>definitely works for my normal-combination, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So, naturally I experiment with different oil mixtures, getting variable results.</li>
            <li>It was extremely irritating to parts of my face and most of my neck.  </li>
            <li>Every other day I use the ACURE Organics Brightening Facial Scrub Sea Kelp+ Chlorella Growth Factor to switch it up.&lt;br /&gt;I have always been self conscious about my large pores on my cheeks and nose, I&#x27;ve been using this combination of products for about a week</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe I finally found a cleanser that is natural, organic, and actually works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used that actually removes eye makeup completely without getting out of the shower looking like a raccoon.</li>
            <li>i very much like the products by this company and both this cleanser and the green scrub</li>
            <li>Face cleansers I have used in the past have dried my skin out, irritated it, didn&#x27;t clean very well or have burned my skin.  </li>
            <li>so I generally follow it with a different soap-based cleanser to prevent any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>I use bare minerals waterproof mascara and the only cleanser that took it off is Avalon Organics Vit. C.  </li>
            <li>You might wan to spot test first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still in search for the product that goes all the way and reduces my pores, controls oil production, and gets rid of all pimples (small and large - my small tiny pimples/bumps are really hard to get rid off), but Acure was a good start.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin and leaves it feeling soft.</li>

            <li> This gel is a joy to use so a quick lather removes makeup and dirt.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel sooo clean and amazing!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this and their mud mask solely because it&#x27;s fairly traded and I will always opt for that when it&#x27;s available, and oh man it worked.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for sensitive and prone skin</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and feels like a much more luxurious/expensive product.</li>
            <li> I was already planning on repurchasing it because it&#x27;s so good at gently removing my eye makeup, but am even more happy to do so</li>
            <li> Excellent, natural cleanser for any type of skin.  </li>
            <li> My husband has cyctic acne and after using this product coupled with the Acure sensitive skin body lotion (it&#x27;s cheaper than &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; lotion and has great ingredients, so we figured we&#x27;d try it as a face lotion!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  the best I&#x27;ve used thus far.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this cleanser!  </li>
            <li> Good smell, gentle on face, and a good brand.</li>
            <li> have not broke out and it feels like a good clean.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly &amp; arrived in good shape.  </li>
            <li> It also gets great reviews from the Environmental Working Group for pure and non-toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that this is organic.</li>
            <li> I love how my face reacts to thes all-natural products.</li>
            <li> But it smells lovely, and it is much better than Zia, the stuff I was using before.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many cleansers over the years and this time, I don&#x27;t feel a desire to change cleansers.</li>
            <li> i love this line now, and their simplicity and integrity.</li>

            <li> Low EWG rating and works great!  </li>
            <li> I love this product line.  </li>
            <li> In any case, this is their top choice.</li>
            <li> and I love the ingredients.  </li>

            <li> I love this wash and also use their shampoo and conditioner too.</li>
            <li> and I am allergic to most lotions, soaps and skin products.  </li>
            <li> but it is one of my favorite face washes.  </li>
            <li> It cleans very well and smells great.</li>
            <li> Also, love the smell.</li>
            <li> Safe ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Spending over an hour checking out different products I found this wonderful cleanser!  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, the feel, and how well they work.</li>
            <li> I love the cleanser, although I do wish it was a bit more thicker and not so runny.  </li>
            <li> I love this product for my face.</li>
            <li> this product is better than soap.</li>
            <li> decided once again to try, I love it.  </li>
            <li> But the nicest thing is knowing that it&#x27;s safe for my skin.</li>
            <li> By skin tone has become more even.</li>
            <li> I love the Acure product line.  </li>
            <li> However, I seem to not be able to kick this excess oil regardless of me breaking out or not - I am just always oily.</li>
            <li> Really love the smell and consistency of this product.</li>
            <li> I love acure organics.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had to use more than one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I LOVE Acure products.</li>
            <li> At the three week mark with using this magic.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t provide me with the healthy glow</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> overall Great!</li>
            <li> It smells lovely, it cleans and it also removes my mascara and make-up wonderful, leaving my face soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser for normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good cleanser.</li>
            <li> It has a lovely smell a well as being a good gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good basic cleanser.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is a light citrus (although more lemony to me than grapefruit).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love, absolute LOVE with my skin again!</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m sure this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the clean rinse, but it dries out my face</li>
            <li> It takes all my makeup off easily.</li>
            <li> My skin seems to do decent with soaps for a month or maybe two, and then it just seems not to do any good anymore.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone but make sure you buy the right stuff for your type of skin!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my combo skin and seems to be helping o fade my dark marks.</li>
            <li> This cleaner works great and leaves your skin feeling soft, clean, and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Combo skin is fine, but you may need to use a heavier cream in the winter.</li>
            <li> washes makeup off so well and has a pleasant, natural smell.</li>
            <li> but when I found out I was pregnant my hormones through by skin for a loop!</li>
            <li> Buy on Amazon bc whole foods has it for $10 more!</li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price hands down, Target Sells it for over $20!</li>
            <li> Tried the day cream, and it is fantastic too.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough great things about this face wash.</li>
            <li> so it is great that you only need a tab of the gel.</li>
            <li> this is a great second option.</li>
            <li> Smells lightly fruity.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Gentle but effective.</li>
            <li> and you can feel your face is baby smooth</li>
            <li> Nice and gentle cleansing for my skin.</li>
            <li> I buy nothing but cruelty-free cosmetics and beauty products and enjoy almost everything I have tried from ACURE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good cleansing gel for my sensitive skin that is prone to dryness and eczema.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done a lot of research on what natural things are good for the skin, and what each one of them does.  </li>
            <li> In reality it is really about finding your perfect combination of products, from night oils, creams, and facial wash in combination with your make-up.</li>
            <li> * is effective, gentle, lathers into a rich foam,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a gel-like consistency and feels cool to the skin, and rinses easily.</li>
            <li> but works great for morning cleansing, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, very mild, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> (the bottle says its for normal to oily skin), however it did make my skin look better than most products did.</li>
            <li> Baking soda is mildly abrasive, and when combined with this cleanser it completely smoothes out my skin to most-desirable bright and glowy effects.</li>
            <li> Still i paid the higher WF price to try it immediately and be able to return it if I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting to love this face wash so much!</li>
            <li> It works great at removing makeup and doesn&#x27;t appear to dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean without feeling pinched.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean after washing.</li>
            <li> Just clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This cleansing gel was very pleasant to use but it definitely dried out my skin!</li>
            <li> Use it everyday, never fails me and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> why buy luxury designer brand name skincare that is full of junk?</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve copied the full ingredient list from the website.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve copied the full ingredient list from the website.</li>
            <li> i could not say enough good things about this cleanser.</li>
            <li> Only good part is oily skin at 61</li>
            <li> the &#x27;skin-renewal&#x27; claims are true over time.</li>
            <li> Love this face product for cleaning my sensitive skin!!!</li>
            <li> This facial cleansing gel is so refreshing and easy on my skin!</li>
            <li> This line, and especially this particular face cleaner is packed with so many of the things that is good for our skin.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell, nice cleansing without leaving my face tight after that.</li>
            <li> I like the smell because to me it smells fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> I do massage well with my fingers because it doesn&#x27;t just melt the makeup and oil away, but it works well and quickly.</li>
            <li> love this facial wash, i havent found anything better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy to say, I will definitely be streamlining my face care and getting rid of the several cleansers i have all over the shower/medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy to say, I will definitely be streamlining my face care and getting rid of the several cleansers i have all over the shower/medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I have super oily, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves my face feeling fresh and deep cleaned.</li>
            <li> Helps with my mild acne.</li>
            <li> There are no harsh chemical ingredients, which I love, and it&#x27;s also cruelty free.</li>
            <li> I have high praise for that product, and will probably write a review after I had more experience with it.</li>
            <li> I am 49 and honestly have not spent a lot of money or effort on skin care products.  </li>
            <li> : I follow it immediately with a balancing toner, spot treat with tea tree oil, and then apply a good moisturizer before my skin has a chance to dry out.</li>
            <li> This is a really good buy for anyone who needs a makeup remover but understands that they will still need to wash their face again after, or someone who doesn&#x27;t wear makeup but has sensitive or normal skin.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Acure products and this is a very fine facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> the past week or two I&#x27;ve been doing some experimenting and have seen really awesome results when combining this with baking soda (for washing my face AFTER having already removed my makeup); I put some on a wash cloth and and then sprinkle a roughly equal amount (maybe a teaspoon?) of baking soda on top.</li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t take much at all!!).</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling clean and crisp.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that my skin is in great condition after using this for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> (usually only comes off with warm water and wiggling) and all my foundation and waterproof eyeliner.</li>
            <li> now as far as the ingredients , you can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I want to love this, especially since it is toxin free.</li>
            <li> This leaves your face fresh, but not stripped of oil.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price in every way.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling fresh but not overly-dry.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very clean and doesn&#x27;t aggravate my acne prone sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I would use the lotion right after the cleanser and have decided to give up both.  </li>
            <li> But - according to them - it&#x27;s tricky finding the right balance between cleaning and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> appearance right after using the face wash...</li>
            <li> Acure&#x27;s whole brand (well, at least everything I&#x27;ve tried!) is wonderful.</li>
            <li> but I will take a more gentle product over complete makeup removal.</li>
            <li> Gentle and vegan!</li>
            <li> How brilliant of the cosmetic  companies to get us hooked, through false advertising, on products that crate the very problems they claim to cure!</li>
            <li> Actual review starts now : )</li>
            <li> I just wished I found this cleanser 13 years ago when I first started breaking out with cysts.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that the top layer of my skin needed exfoliating, so I bought the Acure brand&#x27;s exfoliating scrub prior to this product.</li>
            <li> This cleanser did not make my face red or break out more after use.</li>
            <li> I always used Kiels, and other nice brands</li>
            <li> But, other cleansers have been much more effective at removing at least most of my makeup.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel any residue or over-dryness after using it, just clean and soft.</li>
            <li> so far I love it, and it&#x27;s an all natural company/product too.</li>
            <li> the thing I&#x27;ve been looking for that completely healed my skin, however it has done MUCH better than everything I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne and VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well and very gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> This wash is so gentle on me skin and has been very affictive!</li>
            <li> Super natural product.</li>
            <li> I am new to using this line of facial products, and I have to say I love every one of them.  </li>
            <li> It is natural, it removes makeup, it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin too dry, and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> It was a good cleanser, but my face was red after use, and my cheeks looked dry.  </li>
            <li> and although it didn&#x27;t make my pores amazingly smaller and tone my skin, etc., it really did reduce the large pimples I have and kept my skin from developing too many new pimples weekly.</li>
            <li> I really like how clean it makes my face feel, and how gentle it is, not causing my combination skin to break out any more than it usually does.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin super moisturized like other moisturizers, but it leaves my skin feeling comfortable and not oily or irritated in any way.  </li>
            <li> Use sparingly as too much can cause a rather drying effect.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t breakout as much</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
            <li> It cleans my face (without having to remove makeup) very thoroughly.</li>
            <li> i have very oily/acne prone skin, and this has helped a lot.</li>
            <li> I then gently scrub my face with it in circular motions for maybe two minutes.</li>
            <li> This Product didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I always buy at whole food store.</li>
            <li> , I really didn&#x27;t want to rock the boat and change.  </li>
            <li> This line of skincare has really made an improvement on my skin.</li>
            <li> And my face doesn&#x27;t breakout much anymore.</li>
            <li> We both have dermatitis/psoriasis and this face wash seems gentle.</li>
            <li> at this point in my life - I enjoy using this facial wash.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It removes make up really well.</li>
            <li> None of them have aggravated my dermatitis whatsoever and the costs are reasonable.</li>
            <li> Oh whole foods....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much in the way of oil reduction</li>
            <li> I started with a dime sized amount on a wet face, and it had a fair amount of slip to it, so i was thinking it&#x27;d take forever to wash off (the way facial bar soaps do).</li>
            <li> and not at the price of SukiFace (another natural brand i love, but different price bracket).</li>
            <li> It foams so nicely without a harsh sulfate lather feeling.</li>
            <li> I literally only use one drop for my whole face, it spreads evenly and foams up a little bit and has an amazing smell!</li>
            <li> Though this cleanser cuts through makeup really well, it doesn&#x27;t seem to deep clean my pores</li>
            <li> I might go back to my original routine and see if that makes any difference.</li>
            <li> I like other Acure cleansers better.</li>
            <li> This facial cleaning gel is a product I like a lot, and have been using for about 4 months, but I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars because it&#x27;s not something I would use every day, because I find it a little drying, and also it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t clear up my acne - yet it also does causes any new acne, which is good!</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t give me that deep clean feeling after using it.</li>
            <li> (basically, a lot of more conventional face products make my skin ITCH.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed less breakouts and smooth fresh feel.</li>
            <li> I love my natural skincare items and I love the idea behind Acure.</li>
            <li> Essential Oil, Citric Acidat is full of junk?</li>
            <li> If you use this face wash and follow it immediately with one of their moisturizers, you will notice a whole new face in about 10 days.  </li>
            <li> Because I don&#x27;t have to use a large amount of product, I find it to be more cost-effective than many of the other makeup removers and cleansers I&#x27;ve used for this purpose in the past.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, clean all makeup off without over drying my middle aged skin!!!</li>
            <li> and I have to say it&#x27;s a great cleanser if you don&#x27;t have bad acne or really oily skin because it leaves skin looking healthy and not dry.  </li>
            <li> leaves my skin feeling very clean but not tight or dry.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, and truly believe that you won&#x27;t regret giving it a shot..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend all Acure products for their purity and safety.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> skin is also super sensitive and that makes finding facial wash that much harder.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wish it removed my makeup a little better</li>
            <li> Leaves my combo skin feeling clean and refreshed without stripping the necessary natural oils away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands, this leaves my face clean but doesn&#x27;t strip away my natural oils.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s such a gentle face wash and smells pretty decent.</li>
            <li> This works really well for my sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li> I like how the product doesn&#x27;t really foam, indicating there&#x27;s no harsh ingredients...</li>
            <li> Gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This leaves your skin clean without being dry.</li>
            <li> , the cleanser is so gentle I didn&#x27;t even have to order the sensitive skin line.  </li>
            <li> It feels gentle and leaves my face soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for a few months now, every night and most mornings</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> I run out of the new stuff)</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Sure their prices are higher than here, but it&#x27;s usually fresher and there&#x27;s no 3rd party seller to go through.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s made my skin more glowy looking</li>
            <li> Complete turn around!</li>
            <li> Acure Organics&#x27; facial cleansing gel wasn&#x27;t exactly the hero -</li>
            <li> The scars on my face are less noticeable, my skin feels younger and healthier, the tone is more even,  it almost glows.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, large pores, and occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> My skin also responds really well to alkaline cleansers; if you have sensitive skin, break out or otherwise have a reaction (e.g.: redness) when washing your face with soap or soap based (read: alkaline, pH basic) cleansers, I do not recommend you try baking soda on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I follow my cleansing routine with rosewater and the sensitive moisturizer from ACURE.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> not green).</li>
            <li> not green).</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleasantly surprised that this has not been the case with this brand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an all natural junkie, but I do believe that nature provides us with the things we need if we know what to look for.  </li>
            <li> This is a gentle, non-stripping, pH neutral cleanser that I rate a solid 3 stars for my skin and needs; however, as a makeup remover, it&#x27;s 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I use the acure argan oil as a moisturizer after this and my face is looking glowy and feels so soft.</li>
            <li> I am a complete beauty product junky.</li>
            <li> have been using this for a couple of weeks now and so far I am liking</li>
            <li> his cystic acne has completely gone away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyone with oily skin should definitely purchase this, it really helps.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-I also like that it boasts mainly of natural, organic ingredients, though there&#x27;s no way to know whether these claims are verifiable or</li>
            <li> Switched to organic ACURE product after being recommended by a professional to go with organic products.</li>
            <li> I need to combine this with an exfoliating wash a few times a week, but other than that I love it!  </li>
            <li> I have several items I love from the Acure line (their green clay mask, argan oil, day cream , haircare).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve slowly but surely found some brand loyalty through my musings at my local Whole Foods, where you can smell and get samples for almost anything.</li>
            <li> This is an honest review from someone who&#x27;s been battling acne and the damage it leaves behind for about 13 years.  </li>
            <li> It did quite good, but not excellent.</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful, subtle aroma and it&#x27;s very thick and sudsy</li>
            <li> I usually use Origins products, but I actually like this better</li>
            <li> It says normal to oily skin on the tube and my skin is older and sun damaged, but it does not make my skin feel dry or taught.  </li>
            <li> Creamy cleansers won&#x27;t usually remove physical sunscreen, so for a gel, this is gentler than most.</li>
            <li> I am still in the earlier stages of using it, and am willing to try different things out in order to see what works.</li>
            <li> For the last 5 years I&#x27;ve lived in Colorado in the blaring high altitude zero humidity sunlight.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So to make a long story short, right now</li>
            <li> I immediately stopped using it, and went back to my normal boscia face wash.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I expected and received in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> You simply feel clean and fresh after you use it and a small amount goes a long way, so thats always a plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the look for new products, especially ones without all the yucky parabens, ect.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently trying a new product, but I keep this Acure&#x27;s cleansing gel on standby just in case</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have been ordering my cleanser from the opposite coast wasting money on shipping, but since I have problem skin and have always thrown away lots of money trying to find the cure</li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s a major perk that this product works so well while being organic.</li>
            <li> All the spots on my face I had picked at in high school even though mom told me not to (gross I know...) suddenly became scars.  </li>
            <li> no super tight pores either, that would just produce more oil.</li>
            <li> My face is never as clear as it is when I am using this regularly.</li>
            <li> So overall, it didn&#x27;t completely clear my skin, but it cleared my skin quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that all you need is a pea size drop to cleanse your entire face.</li>
            <li> definitely works for my normal-combination, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So, naturally I experiment with different oil mixtures, getting variable results.</li>
            <li> It was extremely irritating to parts of my face and most of my neck.  </li>
            <li> Every other day I use the ACURE Organics Brightening Facial Scrub Sea Kelp+ Chlorella Growth Factor to switch it up.&lt;br /&gt;I have always been self conscious about my large pores on my cheeks and nose, I&#x27;ve been using this combination of products for about a week</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I finally found a cleanser that is natural, organic, and actually works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used that actually removes eye makeup completely without getting out of the shower looking like a raccoon.</li>
            <li> i very much like the products by this company and both this cleanser and the green scrub</li>
            <li> Face cleansers I have used in the past have dried my skin out, irritated it, didn&#x27;t clean very well or have burned my skin.  </li>
            <li> so I generally follow it with a different soap-based cleanser to prevent any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> I use bare minerals waterproof mascara and the only cleanser that took it off is Avalon Organics Vit. C.  </li>
            <li> You might wan to spot test first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in search for the product that goes all the way and reduces my pores, controls oil production, and gets rid of all pimples (small and large - my small tiny pimples/bumps are really hard to get rid off), but Acure was a good start.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin and leaves it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t appear to cause skin redness or other irritation issue so far.</li>
            <li> Using a dime sized amount 1-2 times a day , i&#x27;d say this last at least 4 months (unless you cleanse your neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;).</li>
            <li> These will be my new skin care products, hands down, and I intend to convert my friends and family onto ACURE!</li>
            <li> The tube is pretty big and you only need a little bit of it because a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Aloing this little natural journey, I found the Acure Organic Facial Cleansing Gel at&lt;br /&gt;Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li> This bottle is small but has already lasted me a long time because you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> If you have overall dry skin, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I noticed some weird fine lines with a &amp;#34;pulled&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Without proper moisturization, my skin would become very dry-</li>
            <li> I have to be extra careful with these tube containers.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I went on an all natural organic beauty hunt.  </li>
            <li> My pores appeared smaller, and some of the scars and sun spots on my face were less noticeable after only a couple of times using it.</li>
            <li> These are the only products I&#x27;ve used for the last two weeks and holy cow!</li>
            <li> A cleanser isn&#x27;t a treatment item obviously and it&#x27;s short time on your face means the ingredients have little to no effect.</li>
            <li> It also lasts SO long!</li>
            <li> I was averaging a pimple a day while using this cleanser which hasn&#x27;t happened in a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> So this gel was either going to foam excessively (Dry me out) or have residue....</li>
            <li> yet my skin started to wrinkle and dry out even with sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> My skin does not get overly dry or oily with this product.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this to dry skin types though as I can see how it would be too drying for those skin types.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t over dry or make my skin oily.</li>
            <li> It is not very moisturizing, but doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin either.  </li>
            <li> I use a toner on a cotton pad after I was my face just to make sure I remove any excess make up and the cotton pad is never super dirty</li>
            <li> i am combo skin (dry in patches and oilier in other.</li>
            <li> i am combo skin (dry in patches and oilier in other.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for for a few months and imagine I will run out in the next six weeks or so.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It lathers well so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I read other reviews that it worked for their waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling cleansed, yet it is not drying like other products.</li>
            <li> I use this face-wash with other ACURE products.</li>
            <li> I use three other ACURE products, so I might try again..</li>
            <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;-I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t immediately strip your skin and only a small amount is needed to cleanse your face</li>
            <li> I have such a hard time finding something to wash  my face without drying it out or feeling like my face is not clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It  never dawned on me that a natural product my be so irritating.  </li>
            <li> and it helps keep the oil down.  </li>
            <li> hands down</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam up like other cleansers but remember, the foaming agents are harsh, harmful chemicals that we don&#x27;t need anyway in order to cleanse our bodies.</li>
            <li> I use about 2 squirts and a half of the cleanser and leave on for about 1 minute.  </li>
            <li> I have had horrible skin most of my life and now at 25 it is finally mellowing out.</li>
            <li> It can be slightly drying in the winter.</li>
            <li> washing my face with this particular cleanser, I noticed that it looked ashen.</li>
            <li> but after 2-3 uses, I found my skin extremely dry/tight...and not a comfortable feeling tight at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s too early to say whether this product will help me in my quest for skin perfection, but I am honestly disappointed with what I have seen so far.</li>
            <li> wash and moisturizer are a little pricey</li>
            <li> However, use just a little.</li>
            <li> You just need a little bit for foam.</li>
            <li> but I am disappointed how it doesn&#x27;t clean off my waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and for a while was on the fence as to how I felt about it.</li>
            <li> To me this product isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy and I need that as I tend to have oily skin or combination skin.</li>
            <li> I felt it&#x27;s somehow harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> I am unfortunate enough to have the T-zone complexion and this did seem a little harsh on my cheeks (the drier zone).</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight after washing with this, but all the oil and debris is gone!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry me out and doesn&#x27;t leave a film behind.</li>
            <li> biggest recommendation on this is as a make-up remover: a small dollop gets off all of my face and eye makeup super-quickly without getting into or burning my eyes.</li>
            <li> not sure if it takes off the makeup or not.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I should use it again..  </li>
            <li> This usually happens when my skin is not thoroughly</li>
            <li> (I use derma e moisturizer when needed which is hardly ever as the ocm method isn&#x27;t drying).</li>
            <li> I have perioral dermatitis and it&#x27;s extemely hard to find products that don&#x27;t aggravate it.</li>
            <li> My skin still has a lot of healing to do but after a month of use I have completely stopped getting painful, inflamed pimples.</li>
            <li> I know I wanted to slowly replace all of my beauty and make-up products</li>
            <li> This regimen has seriously improved the amount of pimples I get.</li>
            <li> I still have problems with blackheads and pimples, but I&#x27;ve only been using the face wash a couple of weeks, and I am bad and don&#x27;t wash my face at night.  </li>
            <li> AND it is less expensive!  </li>
            <li> This product made my face break out even worse.</li>
            <li> or worse--</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews for products unless they are terrible, but I have to share!</li>
            <li> Somehow though I still had black heads and really annoying combination skin.</li>
            <li> Some people say they don&#x27;t like the smell, and some have referred to it as a fake lemon scent.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re so silly.....</li>
            <li> This Brand is a SERIOUS treasure!!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t use any crazy ingredients and it doesn&#x27;t compromise the qualiy of their products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I keep trying it, hoping the pain will stop ... because I&#x27;m an idiot.</li>
            <li> Those parts became inflamed and very painful.</li>
            <li> follow up with their argan oil and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> follow up with their argan oil and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This cleaner smells horrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid $80+ for crap!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this cleanser. Gentle and vegan!</li>
            <li> Love the fact that this is organic. And love the smell! Container is a tube not a bottle.</li>
            <li> Good cleansing gel for my sensitive skin that is prone to dryness and eczema. Use sparingly as too much can cause a rather drying effect. I follow my cleansing routine with rosewater and the sensitive moisturizer from ACURE.&lt;br /&gt;As for eye make-up, you need to precleanse with eye makeup remover before cleansing.</li>
            <li> a great cleanser it works well</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this cleanser!  Use it in conjunction with the facial brightening scrub!</li>
            <li> What I received was not the pictured container :  I got a tube.  The description did not say that it was for oily skin.  I have dry skin but since it was a gel, I decided to try it.  It was extremely irritating to parts of my face and most of my neck.  Those parts became inflamed and very painful. I put Aquaphor on for a couple of days.  It  never dawned on me that a natural product my be so irritating.  You might wan to spot test first. The smell and texture are divine, though.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good cleanser. It smells good and is able to remove my make up at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I love how my face reacts to thes all-natural products. I do massage well with my fingers because it doesn&#x27;t just melt the makeup and oil away, but it works well and quickly. How brilliant of the cosmetic  companies to get us hooked, through false advertising, on products that crate the very problems they claim to cure! Try this once. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> love this facial wash, i havent found anything better</li>
            <li> I need to combine this with an exfoliating wash a few times a week, but other than that I love it!  My face looks and feels wonderful!  I still have problems with blackheads and pimples, but I&#x27;ve only been using the face wash a couple of weeks, and I am bad and don&#x27;t wash my face at night.  So who knows.  But it smells lovely, and it is much better than Zia, the stuff I was using before.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, large pores, and occasional breakouts. This is a very good basic cleanser. It is natural, it removes makeup, it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin too dry, and it smells nice. It is also at a good price for what it does. I have tried many cleansers over the years and this time, I don&#x27;t feel a desire to change cleansers.</li>
            <li> I have several items I love from the Acure line (their green clay mask, argan oil, day cream , haircare). I&#x27;ve slowly but surely found some brand loyalty through my musings at my local Whole Foods, where you can smell and get samples for almost anything. Sure their prices are higher than here, but it&#x27;s usually fresher and there&#x27;s no 3rd party seller to go through. I read about this cleanser here and thoroughly check all reviews before I buy anything. Still i paid the higher WF price to try it immediately and be able to return it if I didn&#x27;t like it. Actual review starts now : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a light citrus (although more lemony to me than grapefruit). Gel is a transparent yellow. I started with a dime sized amount on a wet face, and it had a fair amount of slip to it, so i was thinking it&#x27;d take forever to wash off (the way facial bar soaps do). So this gel was either going to foam excessively (Dry me out) or have residue....but NO! it was perfect and it lathered well but not foaming, took off my fiber mascara (usually only comes off with warm water and wiggling) and all my foundation and waterproof eyeliner. Didn&#x27;t sting my eyes. and washed off on my 1-2nd splash of water. left my face feeling like...my face! no tightness. no itchy eczema patches. no super tight pores either, that would just produce more oil. now as far as the ingredients , you can&#x27;t ask for more. and not at the price of SukiFace (another natural brand i love, but different price bracket). My product came in a tube, not the bottle shown here. Using a dime sized amount 1-2 times a day , i&#x27;d say this last at least 4 months (unless you cleanse your neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;). A cleanser isn&#x27;t a treatment item obviously and it&#x27;s short time on your face means the ingredients have little to no effect. HOWEVER, why would anyone want to put chemicals, toxins, colors, alcohol, parabens, animal byproducts, etc. when for $14 you can have an amazing cleanser? why buy luxury designer brand name skincare that is full of junk? i love this line now, and their simplicity and integrity. i&#x27;ve copied the full ingredient list from the website. I&#x27;m very happy to say, I will definitely be streamlining my face care and getting rid of the several cleansers i have all over the shower/medicine cabinet. I will even be ditching my makeup removing liquid from Sephora that always removed my eye makeup so well (but was def. not green). This gel is a joy to use so a quick lather removes makeup and dirt. follow up with their argan oil and you won&#x27;t be disappointed! p.s. i am combo skin (dry in patches and oilier in other. prone to breakouts, eczema, just a joy really :P )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INGREDIENTS:&lt;br /&gt;Organic Curoxidant(tm) Superfruit Blend (Organic Euterpe oleracea (Acai) Berry, Organic Rubus fruticosus (Blackberry), Organic Rosa canina (Rosehips), Organic Punica granatum (Pomegranate), Organic Calendula oficinalis (Calendula), Organic Matricaria recutita (Chamomile), Fair Trade Certified(tm) Organic Aspalanthus linearis (Rooibos) , Lauryl Glucoside (vegetable derived), Decyl Glucoside (sugar soap), Fair Trade Certified(tm) Organic Olea europaea (Olive oil), Organic Chlorella pyrenoidosa (Chlorella Growth Factor), Glucono Delta Lactone (Fermented sugar), Marrubium vulgare (White horehound) stem cell culture, Echinacea stem cell culture, Fermented Resveratrol Extract (Probiotic), Organic argania spinosa (Argan) oil, Ubiquinone (CoQ10), Olea europea (Olive leaf) extract, Potassium Sorbate (Food grade preservative), Citrus Limon (Lemon) Essential Oil, Citric Acidat is full of junk? i love this line now, and their simplicity and integrity. i&#x27;ve copied the full ingredient list from the website.

            <li> So far, so good. I see some improvement on my skin. will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleanser, non-drying, great scent. I will definitely repurchase this product. Tried the day cream, and it is fantastic too.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser. I was surprised that all you need is a pea size drop to cleanse your entire face. It works great at removing makeup and doesn&#x27;t appear to dry out my skin. It doesn&#x27;t foam up like other cleansers but remember, the foaming agents are harsh, harmful chemicals that we don&#x27;t need anyway in order to cleanse our bodies. This bottle is small but has already lasted me a long time because you don&#x27;t need much. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used two bottles of this cleanser and I have to say it&#x27;s a great cleanser if you don&#x27;t have bad acne or really oily skin because it leaves skin looking healthy and not dry.  It just doesn&#x27;t give me that deep clean feeling after using it. I have super oily, acne prone skin.  I was averaging a pimple a day while using this cleanser which hasn&#x27;t happened in a very long time.  I finally decided to give it up after about two months and two bottles. I&#x27;m not a fan of acure daily oil control lotion either because I would get tiny whiteheads while using it.I would use the lotion right after the cleanser and have decided to give up both.  I do love the acure scrub and it&#x27;s the best I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my regimen now is Bioelements decongestant cleanser and Bioelements beyond hydration facial gel moisturizer.  Let me tell you this is the best cleanser and  moisturizer I have ever used.  Cleanser cleans my skin thoroughly while making it feel refreshed afterwards.  It&#x27;s made with chinese herbs and extracts that nurture the skin.  I don&#x27;t breakout as much and it helps keep the oil down.  I just wished I found this cleanser 13 years ago when I first started breaking out with cysts.  The gel moisturizer doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue and does it&#x27;s job.  It&#x27;s made with plant extracts and helps soothe and moisturize my skin.  I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s leaves my skin super moisturized like other moisturizers, but it leaves my skin feeling comfortable and not oily or irritated in any way.  This is an honest review from someone who&#x27;s been battling acne and the damage it leaves behind for about 13 years.  I use about 2 squirts and a half of the cleanser and leave on for about 1 minute.  Hope this review helps someone.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination skin. This is a wonderful, gentle, non-drying and effective cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love this face cleanser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser works great for my skin. I also love the scent of it. I have very sensitive and acne prone skin. I use this cleanser, with Acure&#x27;s toner and night cream. This regimen has seriously improved the amount of pimples I get. My skin still has a lot of healing to do but after a month of use I have completely stopped getting painful, inflamed pimples.</li>
            <li> For the last 5 years I&#x27;ve lived in Colorado in the blaring high altitude zero humidity sunlight.  I&#x27;m only 25 yet my skin started to wrinkle and dry out even with sunscreen.  All the spots on my face I had picked at in high school even though mom told me not to (gross I know...) suddenly became scars.  Somehow though I still had black heads and really annoying combination skin. I decided to try this and their mud mask solely because it&#x27;s fairly traded and I will always opt for that when it&#x27;s available, and oh man it worked.  If you use this face wash and follow it immediately with one of their moisturizers, you will notice a whole new face in about 10 days.  The scars on my face are less noticeable, my skin feels younger and healthier, the tone is more even,  it almost glows. I don&#x27;t feel any residue or over-dryness after using it, just clean and soft.</li>
            <li> This gel works wonders. My skin feels refreshed. It smells is discreet and very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I am unfortunate enough to have the T-zone complexion and this did seem a little harsh on my cheeks (the drier zone). I have only used this once so I am going to try again tonight. I want to love this, especially since it is toxin free. Overall I&#x27;m sure this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the clean rinse, but it dries out my face so I don&#x27;t use it very often.</li>
            <li> Low EWG rating and works great!  You do not need a lot and it lathers well.  Neutral smell so men and women can use it.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough great things about this face wash. Perfect for sensitive and prone skin and it removes all makeup with just a dime size amount. Been using for about 3 years and I will never switch to anything else</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way. both the gel face wash and moisturizer are a little pricey so it is great that you only need a tab of the gel.</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of makeup and it&#x27;s very good at getting it all off with one good wash. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product line.  I can tell a difference in the bags under my eyes immediately after using.  My pores appeared smaller, and some of the scars and sun spots on my face were less noticeable after only a couple of times using it. My skin seems to do decent with soaps for a month or maybe two, and then it just seems not to do any good anymore.  I have been very pleasantly surprised that this has not been the case with this brand.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year now, and it still does as good of a job as it did in the beginning.  Some people say they don&#x27;t like the smell, and some have referred to it as a fake lemon scent.  It isn&#x27;t lemon scented; it is orange scented, and I&#x27;m thinking maybe their missmelling it might be why they don&#x27;t like the smell.  I like the smell because to me it smells fresh and clean.  I&#x27;m not an all natural junkie, but I do believe that nature provides us with the things we need if we know what to look for.  I&#x27;ve done a lot of research on what natural things are good for the skin, and what each one of them does.  This line, and especially this particular face cleaner is packed with so many of the things that is good for our skin.  I highly recommend it, and truly believe that you won&#x27;t regret giving it a shot..</li>
            <li> My teen daughters have tried a lot of cleansing products.  Like a lot a lot. Like &amp;#34;why do we have another product here when you haven&#x27;t finished that one?&amp;#34; Like &amp;#34;are they paying you to wash your face?&amp;#34; But - according to them - it&#x27;s tricky finding the right balance between cleaning and moisturizing. I&#x27;ll take their word for it. In any case, this is their top choice. &amp;#34;By far&amp;#34;... so that&#x27;s ringing endorsement.</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves my face feeling fresh and deep cleaned. Perfect for my combo skin and seems to be helping o fade my dark marks.</li>
            <li> Amazing face wash. Leaves my combo skin feeling clean and refreshed without stripping the necessary natural oils away.</li>
            <li> I use this along with the oil cleaning method (I use 75% castor oil with 25% grapeseed oil - works like a charm). On days when I don&#x27;t have the time for the ocm this is a great second option. You don&#x27;t need very much and it foams up perfectly. It leaves my skin feeling very clean and doesn&#x27;t aggravate my acne prone sensitive skin. It&#x27;s a great cleanser with no harmful ingredients. Happy I found this brand and I will continue to purchase in the future! (I use derma e moisturizer when needed which is hardly ever as the ocm method isn&#x27;t drying).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the look for new products, especially ones without all the yucky parabens, ect.  I usually use Origins products, but I actually like this better AND it is less expensive!  It smells great too!</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff is amazing. My face is never as clear as it is when I am using this regularly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for my skin but I am disappointed how it doesn&#x27;t clean off my waterproof mascara. I read other reviews that it worked for their waterproof mascara.  I use bare minerals waterproof mascara and the only cleanser that took it off is Avalon Organics Vit. C.  I stopped using the Avalon because it made my skin oily (I have combination skin) and over time would develop zits or cysts.  I&#x27;ll still use ACURE because I like how the rest of my face seems to be clearing up and I love the ingredients.  I&#x27;ll continue to use coconute oil to take off the rest of the waterproof mascara for now.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It cleans my face (without having to remove makeup) very thoroughly. I almost gave it a 4-star rating, though, because I don&#x27;t like the lid from the tube container.  If I accidentally drop the tube in the shower, the lid inevitably breaks.  I therefore can&#x27;t close it properly and end up wasting some of the contents.  Also, once the lid is cracked, the tube can no longer stand on the lid; otherwise, the content leaks out.  ACURE also uses this same design for their shampoos. I have to be extra careful with these tube containers.</li>
            <li> Oh. My. God!&lt;br /&gt;I just bought this face wash. It smells so good. It foams so nicely without a harsh sulfate lather feeling. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight after washing with this, but all the oil and debris is gone!  Smells lightly fruity.&lt;br /&gt;This definitely works for my normal-combination, sensitive skin. (basically, a lot of more conventional face products make my skin ITCH. This does not do that.)&lt;br /&gt;I will update after using this for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use this the rest of my days. Wonderful, light lather (&amp; fragrance)  that removes eye make up and cleans my face so well without any harmful ingredients. Shipped quickly &amp; arrived in good shape.  I love this cleanser!</li>
            <li> i could not say enough good things about this cleanser. i have very oily/acne prone skin, and this has helped a lot. leaves my skin feeling very clean but not tight or dry. washes makeup off so well and has a pleasant, natural smell. have purchased 4 times now and will continue buying.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t very impressed. Wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> This has been my only face wash I will use for over 2 years now and I continue to love it. It removes dirt, oil, and makeup without stripping or drying my combination skin. It has a nice smell and feels like a much more luxurious/expensive product. For me it&#x27;s a major perk that this product works so well while being organic. Also, I find that just a pea sized amount is all I need so one tube ends up lasting quite a while. I love this wash and also use their shampoo and conditioner too.</li>
            <li> Good smell, gentle on face, and a good brand.</li>
            <li> It smells so good. Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin and leaves it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! My face feels clean without feeling pinched. If you have overall dry skin, this is not for you. Combo skin is fine, but you may need to use a heavier cream in the winter. Nice to know my face isn&#x27;t being bathed in chemicals and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and for a while was on the fence as to how I felt about it. This is a gentle, non-stripping, pH neutral cleanser that I rate a solid 3 stars for my skin and needs; however, as a makeup remover, it&#x27;s 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;My biggest recommendation on this is as a make-up remover: a small dollop gets off all of my face and eye makeup super-quickly without getting into or burning my eyes. Because I don&#x27;t have to use a large amount of product, I find it to be more cost-effective than many of the other makeup removers and cleansers I&#x27;ve used for this purpose in the past. Though this cleanser cuts through makeup really well, it doesn&#x27;t seem to deep clean my pores so I generally follow it with a different soap-based cleanser to prevent any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Over the past week or two I&#x27;ve been doing some experimenting and have seen really awesome results when combining this with baking soda (for washing my face AFTER having already removed my makeup); I put some on a wash cloth and and then sprinkle a roughly equal amount (maybe a teaspoon?) of baking soda on top. I then gently scrub my face with it in circular motions for maybe two minutes. Baking soda is mildly abrasive, and when combined with this cleanser it completely smoothes out my skin to most-desirable bright and glowy effects. Disclaimer on my baking soda tip: I follow it immediately with a balancing toner, spot treat with tea tree oil, and then apply a good moisturizer before my skin has a chance to dry out. My skin also responds really well to alkaline cleansers; if you have sensitive skin, break out or otherwise have a reaction (e.g.: redness) when washing your face with soap or soap based (read: alkaline, pH basic) cleansers, I do not recommend you try baking soda on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for for a few months and imagine I will run out in the next six weeks or so. I was already planning on repurchasing it because it&#x27;s so good at gently removing my eye makeup, but am even more happy to do so now given my recent results when using it with baking soda. This is a really good buy for anyone who needs a makeup remover but understands that they will still need to wash their face again after, or someone who doesn&#x27;t wear makeup but has sensitive or normal skin.</li>
            <li> Dries my face but smells good. I prefer a cream to gel though</li>
            <li> My skin loves this product and I am always breaking out even at 61.  Only good part is oily skin at 61 but this product clears up anything and I am allergic to most lotions, soaps and skin products.  THIS ONE IS A DREAM!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice cleanser. I use it in the mornings so not sure if it takes off the makeup or not. but works great for morning cleansing, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, very mild, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> Gentle but effective. The best product I&#x27;ve found for washing your face!</li>
            <li> I was not expecting to love this face wash so much! It is amazing! I use it with my clarisonic and I am in love! Makes my face feel sooo clean and amazing!</li>
            <li> Acure&#x27;s whole brand (well, at least everything I&#x27;ve tried!) is wonderful. I also have the under eye cream, lemongrass shampoo, and lemongrass firming lotion, and love ALL of them! This facial cleaning gel is a product I like a lot, and have been using for about 4 months, but I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars because it&#x27;s not something I would use every day, because I find it a little drying, and also it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t clear up my acne - yet it also does causes any new acne, which is good! This is a product I rotate into my routine 1-3 times a week. I really like how clean it makes my face feel, and how gentle it is, not causing my combination skin to break out any more than it usually does.</li>
            <li> I started to change my facial products and I was on the hunt for a simple facial cleanser.  this cleanser was recommended by someone on IG, and it has &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; ingredients so I decided to buy it.  The tube is pretty big and you only need a little bit of it because a little goes a long way.  I like the way it makes my skin feel after I wash it off and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s made my skin more glowy looking or maybe it&#x27;s a mixture of all the things I&#x27;m using, but I do like the way it makes my skin feel and look!</li>
            <li> Love this face product for cleaning my sensitive skin!!! Helps with my mild acne.</li>
            <li> This product made my face break out even worse.</li>
            <li> This leaves your face fresh, but not stripped of oil.  Great light fruity scent- after one week, my skin is taught and bright.  Love It!!</li>
            <li> This product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* is vegan, meaning it contains no animal ingredients so no individual was murdered for this product,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* has been certified by The Leaping Bunny Program, meaning neither the finished product nor the ingredients that go into the finished product have been tested on animals so no individual was tortured and then murdered for this product,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* is effective, gentle, lathers into a rich foam,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* has no chemical smell; it smells fruity and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily/acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t know what would do without it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember when I ordered this last but it is one of my favorite face washes.  It leaves my face feeling clean and crisp.  It has helped to balance out any imperfections that I might have lingering and helps to keep them away.  To me this product isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy and I need that as I tend to have oily skin or combination skin.</li>
            <li> This Product didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Just switched to this from dermalogica...so far I love it, and it&#x27;s an all natural company/product too.</li>
            <li> This cleanser KILLS my eyes...for like an hour! I keep trying it, hoping the pain will stop ... because I&#x27;m an idiot. I don&#x27;t get the point of a facial cleanser that takes your makeup and sets your eyes on fire.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel great!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading all the reviews and it does not disappoint.  My skin feels great after using this product.</li>
            <li> This cleaner smells horrible. It smells like some toxic household cleaner. and the seller would not let me exchange it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells great too!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I finally found a cleanser that is natural, organic, and actually works. It cleans very well and smells great. It is the only cleanser that has EVER truly worked for me. My skin does not get overly dry or oily with this product.</li>
            <li> This works really well for my sensitive combination skin. It smells nice and citrusy. It takes all my makeup off easily. I use the acure argan oil as a moisturizer after this and my face is looking glowy and feels so soft. I would not recommend this to dry skin types though as I can see how it would be too drying for those skin types.</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser. My face feels clean after washing. However, use just a little. It can be drying to the skin. Just make sure you follow up with a good moisturizer. Also, love the smell.</li>
            <li> Love it for oily skin, smells good too.</li>
            <li> Excellent, natural cleanser for any type of skin.  It is not very moisturizing, but doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin either.  Safe ingredients.  Great lathering and great clean scent.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best face wash I have ever used.  Cleans very well and very gentle on my skin.  Face cleansers I have used in the past have dried my skin out, irritated it, didn&#x27;t clean very well or have burned my skin.  This has actually repaired a lot of the damage.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has a bit of oily skin and it works great.</li>
            <li> I am a complete beauty product junky. I love my natural skincare items and I love the idea behind Acure. This cleansing gel was very pleasant to use but it definitely dried out my skin! It did not get rid of all my makeup which I did not expect it to do. But, other cleansers have been much more effective at removing at least most of my makeup.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I went on an all natural organic beauty hunt.  I know I wanted to slowly replace all of my beauty and make-up products and I did it!!  Aloing this little natural journey, I found the Acure Organic Facial Cleansing Gel at&lt;br /&gt;Whole Foods.  Whole Foods has a wonderful all natural/organic beauty section, you can get lost for hours.  Spending over an hour checking out different products I found this wonderful cleanser!  It smells lovely, it cleans and it also removes my mascara and make-up wonderful, leaving my face soft and clean.  Without hesitation--BUY THIS!!</li>
            <li> I like how the product doesn&#x27;t really foam, indicating there&#x27;s no harsh ingredients... but after 2-3 uses, I found my skin extremely dry/tight...and not a comfortable feeling tight at all. I noticed some weird fine lines with a &amp;#34;pulled&amp;#34; appearance right after using the face wash...I immediately stopped using it, and went back to my normal boscia face wash. Will be returning it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It has a lovely smell a well as being a good gentle cleanser.  I  just ordered some for my daughter as a gift.</li>
            <li> My face loves this stuff and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things. Use it morning and night and you can feel your face is baby smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this cleanser! I literally only use one drop for my whole face, it spreads evenly and foams up a little bit and has an amazing smell! I love that there are no chemicals, and the mixture of ingredients must be perfect for my skin because I use this twice a day and my skin is the clearest it&#x27;s ever been! I wash my face morning and before bed, then follow up with using the ACURE Serioulsy Firming Facial Serum. Every other day I use the ACURE Organics Brightening Facial Scrub Sea Kelp+ Chlorella Growth Factor to switch it up.&lt;br /&gt;I have always been self conscious about my large pores on my cheeks and nose, I&#x27;ve been using this combination of products for about a week and I&#x27;m in love, absolute LOVE with my skin again! It&#x27;s truly amazing! I don&#x27;t normally write reviews for products unless they are terrible, but I have to share! These will be my new skin care products, hands down, and I intend to convert my friends and family onto ACURE!</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser. It&#x27;s the only cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used that actually removes eye makeup completely without getting out of the shower looking like a raccoon. Gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great product! Timely delivery!</li>
            <li> I am new to using this line of facial products, and I have to say I love every one of them.  I am 49 and honestly have not spent a lot of money or effort on skin care products.  I was so pleased to find wonderful products without all the chemicals at a great price.  I love the smell, the feel, and how well they work. Highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love the cleanser, although I do wish it was a bit more thicker and not so runny.  I think Acure should consider putting this cleanser into a pump instead of a tube to prevent loss of product.  Great cleanser, nonetheless.  It leaves my skin feeling cleansed, yet it is not drying like other products.</li>
            <li> Really nice product.  It says normal to oily skin on the tube and my skin is older and sun damaged, but it does not make my skin feel dry or taught.  Just clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser for normal to oily skin. There are no harsh chemical ingredients, which I love, and it&#x27;s also cruelty free. Acure is a great line for Eco-conscious buyers.</li>
            <li> Gets the makeup off great!</li>
            <li> Lathers very nice and smells great!</li>
            <li> Nice and gentle cleansing for my skin. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly what I expected and received in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my face. I always buy at whole food store. I would tell a friend about facial cleansing gel this product is better than soap.</li>
            <li> This cleaner works great and leaves your skin feeling soft, clean, and moisturized. It smells wonderful - citric and fresh. It also gets great reviews from the Environmental Working Group for pure and non-toxic ingredients. It has a gel-like consistency and feels cool to the skin, and rinses easily. It does not foam into a lather.</li>
            <li> This leaves your skin clean without being dry. I noticed that my skin is in great condition after using this for a few weeks. It lathers well so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have been ordering my cleanser from the opposite coast wasting money on shipping, but since I have problem skin and have always thrown away lots of money trying to find the cure, I really didn&#x27;t want to rock the boat and change.  I read about this product in a health magazine decided once again to try, I love it.  My seborric dermitis around my nose and mouth seams to be healing up, the cleanser is so gentle I didn&#x27;t even have to order the sensitive skin line.  I truly recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, nice cleansing without leaving my face tight after that. But the nicest thing is knowing that it&#x27;s safe for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, clean all makeup off without over drying my middle aged skin!!! It&#x27;s affordable too, love that!</li>
            <li> I use this face-wash with other ACURE products. This line of skincare has really made an improvement on my skin. By skin tone has become more even. It doesn&#x27;t over dry or make my skin oily. And my face doesn&#x27;t breakout much anymore.</li>
            <li> I have such a hard time finding something to wash  my face without drying it out or feeling like my face is not clean.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is also super sensitive and that makes finding facial wash that much harder.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a couple of weeks now and so far I am liking it.&lt;br /&gt;I have not broke out and it feels like a good clean.</li>
            <li> Great product, amazing smell. Super natural product. My husband and I love it! My husband has cyctic acne and after using this product coupled with the Acure sensitive skin body lotion (it&#x27;s cheaper than &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; lotion and has great ingredients, so we figured we&#x27;d try it as a face lotion!) his cystic acne has completely gone away. We both have dermatitis/psoriasis and this face wash seems gentle. It also lasts SO long! We share this 4oz tube and have been using it nightly for months. Definitely worth the price in every way.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Acure products and this is a very fine facial cleanser. It has a wonderful, subtle aroma and it&#x27;s very thick and sudsy (it doesn&#x27;t take much at all!!). I highly recommend all Acure products for their purity and safety.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t appear to cause skin redness or other irritation issue so far.</li>
            <li> I LOVE ACURE!!! This facial cleansing gel is so refreshing and easy on my skin! Thank you Acure for another amazing product.</li>
            <li> i very much like the products by this company and both this cleanser and the green scrub 9as well as their argan oil) are wonderful products...</li>
            <li> This wash is so gentle on me skin and has been very affictive! I&#x27;ve noticed less breakouts and smooth fresh feel. I&#x27;ve also been using konjac charcoal sponge with this and my face feels amazing after use.</li>
            <li> The Best!!!!!! I love the Acure product line.  I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING and hands down this is the best!!!!</li>
            <li> I have had horrible skin most of my life and now at 25 it is finally mellowing out. However, I seem to not be able to kick this excess oil regardless of me breaking out or not - I am just always oily. In reality it is really about finding your perfect combination of products, from night oils, creams, and facial wash in combination with your make-up. Everything interacts differently with your bodies chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to make a long story short, right now at this point in my life - I enjoy using this facial wash. It doesn&#x27;t dry me out and doesn&#x27;t leave a film behind. You simply feel clean and fresh after you use it and a small amount goes a long way, so thats always a plus. I buy nothing but cruelty-free cosmetics and beauty products and enjoy almost everything I have tried from ACURE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend giving it a go!</li>
            <li> Really love the smell and consistency of this product. Leaves my face feeling fresh but not overly-dry. I&#x27;ll have to see if the &#x27;skin-renewal&#x27; claims are true over time.</li>
            <li> I love acure organics. They don&#x27;t use any crazy ingredients and it doesn&#x27;t compromise the qualiy of their products.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for a few months now, every night and most mornings and I haven&#x27;t had any issues.&lt;br /&gt;It removes make up really well. I use a toner on a cotton pad after I was my face just to make sure I remove any excess make up and the cotton pad is never super dirty and I&#x27;ve never had to use more than one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and this cleanser, along with my serum I use nightly, have definitely helped balance my skins oiliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with oily skin should definitely purchase this, it really helps.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I should use it again..  It was a good cleanser, but my face was red after use, and my cheeks looked dry.  I use three other ACURE products, so I might try again..</li>
            <li> I have perioral dermatitis and it&#x27;s extemely hard to find products that don&#x27;t aggravate it. I LOVE Acure products. None of them have aggravated my dermatitis whatsoever and the costs are reasonable. I wish it removed my makeup a little better but I will take a more gentle product over complete makeup removal.</li>
            <li> At the three week mark with using this magic. It&#x27;s  the best I&#x27;ve used thus far. I&#x27;ve paid $80+ for crap! Buy on Amazon bc whole foods has it for $10 more! Oh whole foods....you&#x27;re so silly..... I recommend this to everyone but make sure you buy the right stuff for your type of skin! Cheers!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this product. It cleans well, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and even removes physical sunscreen.  It can be slightly drying in the winter. Creamy cleansers won&#x27;t usually remove physical sunscreen, so for a gel, this is gentler than most.</li>
            <li> I felt it&#x27;s somehow harsh on the skin. And it irritates the eyes</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim after getting this brand&#x27;s exfoliating scrub for my skin. I am still in the earlier stages of using it, and am willing to try different things out in order to see what works. Plus, I don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of finding a replacement cleanser. I experimented with OCM methods, and have been using Pumpkin Seed oil-based mixture to &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; my face with for a while. I recently moved to Texas to visit family, and forgot my oil mixture. So, naturally I experiment with different oil mixtures, getting variable results. I noticed that the top layer of my skin needed exfoliating, so I bought the Acure brand&#x27;s exfoliating scrub prior to this product. I have high praise for that product, and will probably write a review after I had more experience with it. Anyways, I bought the cleanser thinking, it would be a good addition to my makeshift skincare regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some pros:&lt;br /&gt;-I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t immediately strip your skin and only a small amount is needed to cleanse your face&lt;br /&gt;-I also like that it boasts mainly of natural, organic ingredients, though there&#x27;s no way to know whether these claims are verifiable or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some VERY big Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-After washing my face with this particular cleanser, I noticed that it looked ashen. It didn&#x27;t provide me with the healthy glow my OCM mixture would. Without proper moisturization, my skin would become very dry-looking.&lt;br /&gt;-Small white-heads started to appear within days of usage. This usually happens when my skin is not thoroughly cleaned-- or worse-- if it&#x27;s irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s too early to say whether this product will help me in my quest for skin perfection, but I am honestly disappointed with what I have seen so far. I might go back to my original routine and see if that makes any difference.</li>
            <li> I like other Acure cleansers better.</li>
            <li> Switched to organic ACURE product after being recommended by a professional to go with organic products. I always used Kiels, and other nice brands but when I found out I was pregnant my hormones through by skin for a loop! These are the only products I&#x27;ve used for the last two weeks and holy cow! Complete turn around! Breakouts stopped, skin looked refreshed rather than greesy in the morning and I even stopped wwaring foundation, just mascara and lip balm needed now. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday, never fails me and smells wonderful! Amazon has the best price hands down, Target Sells it for over $20!</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser. I&#x27;ve tried several brands, this leaves my face clean but doesn&#x27;t strip away my natural oils.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff. This Brand is a SERIOUS treasure!!</li>
            <li> I have mild acne and VERY sensitive skin. This cleanser did not make my face red or break out more after use. It feels gentle and leaves my face soft. However, it is not a miracle worker. But it&#x27;s such a gentle face wash and smells pretty decent. You just need a little bit for foam. overall Great!</li>
            <li> I am the kind of person who has tried TONS of products for my oily skin and none seem to work that well. Acure Organics&#x27; facial cleansing gel wasn&#x27;t exactly the hero - the thing I&#x27;ve been looking for that completely healed my skin, however it has done MUCH better than everything I have tried so far. I used it for about 2 and 1/2 to 3 months (and it still hasn&#x27;t ran out! I&#x27;m currently trying a new product, but I keep this Acure&#x27;s cleansing gel on standby just in case I run out of the new stuff) and although it didn&#x27;t make my pores amazingly smaller and tone my skin, etc., it really did reduce the large pimples I have and kept my skin from developing too many new pimples weekly. So overall, it didn&#x27;t completely clear my skin, but it cleared my skin quite a bit. I didn&#x27;t see much in the way of oil reduction (the bottle says its for normal to oily skin), however it did make my skin look better than most products did. I&#x27;m still in search for the product that goes all the way and reduces my pores, controls oil production, and gets rid of all pimples (small and large - my small tiny pimples/bumps are really hard to get rid off), but Acure was a good start. It did quite good, but not excellent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good for combo skin.</li>
