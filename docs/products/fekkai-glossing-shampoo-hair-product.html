    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Definitely a great purchase!</li>
            <li>Fekkai Glossing Shampoo and conditioner are wonderful.</li>
            <li>I never thought I could be so impressed by a hair product ...</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great and I received a lot of compliments from friends as it made my hair glow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it makes her happy.  </li>
            <li>The sample was amazing!</li>
            <li>and it looked so good despite the fact that I need a trim</li>
            <li>: I found this shampoo to leave a slightly more noticeable glossy sheen than Brilliant Brunette products.</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I received this shampoo as part of a Buzz Campaign (I&#x27;m a Bzzzzz Agent--I love it!)</li>
            <li>I felt very light and glossy touch to my hair, it also smells good.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t be spending that kind of money on this product again.</li>
            <li>and I am a ponytail kind of girl.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>It has a very light scent, and does not make my hair look oily.</li>
            <li>In addition, I was surprised to discover that neither the shampoo nor conditioner smells very good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not been at all satisfied with the product but</li>
            <li>People are always touching it, or remarking about my perfume-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to rush out to buy more.</li>
            <li>I like this shampoo a lot, but my hair just needs more moisture</li>
            <li>This shampoo and the conditioner are fabulous!  </li>
            <li>and  also use the voluminizer shampoo and love that as well.  </li>
            <li>and once you try this you will always purchase more.</li>
            <li>when used with the conditioner, it will leave even the most damaged hair looking healthy with an almost reflective shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never written a review before but received a sample and love this product.</li>
            <li>But after just 2 days I can say that I love it.</li>
            <li>She feels that hers is better with Fekkai.  </li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>Probably not for everyone, but it sure makes it nicer in my house.</li>
            <li>and I had static electricity that I did not have with the sample .</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I received the Glossing Shampoo as part of a Bzz campaign, and I was very excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>I received the Glossing Shampoo as part of a Bzz campaign, and was excited to try it out!  </li>
            <li>I do not need much to wash my hair, it rinses out cleanly and thoroughly, and it smells great.</li>
            <li>but I decided it would be worth it as the product seemed so amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo, makes my hair shiny and glossy, but not limp.</li>
            <li>It is easy to style.</li>
            <li>I still needed a strong leave-in moisturizer.</li>
            <li>When I want my hair to look beautiful for special occasions, this will definitely be the shampoo/conditioner that I use.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I enjoy about it is the great smell.</li>
            <li>Oh, I forgot to mention Glossing also smells fabulous.</li>
            <li>Disclosure: I received a free sample of Fekkai glossing shampoo and conditioner for free from BzzAgent to sample.</li>
            <li>I got this product as a free sample as a Bzzagent for Bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li>These are minor complaints, and I&#x27;m going to stock up on Fekkai products to make my hair beautiful when it counts.</li>
            <li>Foams great, don&#x27;t need a huge amount of product to shampoo with (I have long hair).  </li>
            <li>This is a mild shampoo which has a lovely fresh smell.</li>
            <li>When I received my bottle of Fekkai Glossing Shampoo as part of a Bzz campaign, I was really excited.</li>
            <li>and she just raved over how healthy and pretty it was and asked me what I was using.</li>
            <li>Based on the product description, this sounds as though this might make my super fine hair greasy</li>
            <li>From the scent to the rich texture, I feel like I&#x27;m at a salon when I use it.</li>
            <li>surprised I even tried this, but I&#x27;m very glad I did.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>Normally a splurge for me on shampoo is the $7 bottle vs. the $4 bottle, but I will now happily treat myself to this product which is on the high end of my budget because it is SO WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>When the sample ran out, I couldn&#x27;t wait to purchase full- sized bottles of the product.</li>
            <li>The scent was mild, not perfumy or overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I think I have found my new favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>The most notable result is that my drab dark ash blonde hair seems brighter and has more highlights.</li>
            <li>My first intro to this product was a 3 piece set which included shampoo, conditioner, and glosser.</li>
            <li>I liked the minimal packaging, no fancy bottle, etc.  </li>
            <li>I am going to try using it again, but if my notice consistent hair fall, I will have to stop using it.</li>
            <li>The actual product is nowhere near amazing.</li>
            <li>This shampoo actually makes my hair look shiny and clean!  </li>
            <li>my thin hair looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>shampoo left my hair looking shiny and healthy, and less brittle than most shampoos in the price range.</li>
            <li>Also it lathers very well, and does not take a large amount.</li>
            <li>The price is very hefty</li>
            <li>I will say that I like that I really don&#x27;t need to use much, because I have a LOT of hair and for whatever reason</li>
            <li>and I end up using quite a bit, but with the Fekkai I really don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li>Glossing shampoos almost always make my hair feel very brittle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t notice that much difference on those days, but she seems to.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only shampoo that makes my hair smooth and doesn&#x27;t require washing every day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard excellent things about it and read rave reviews, but my actual experience turned out a little flat.</li>
            <li>I am also able to wash every other day with this shampoo rather than every day.  </li>
            <li>At first I was not sure about it because it was thicker then most shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>apply a small amount of product to wet hair, lather, and rinse in cool to luke warm water.</li>
            <li>I rarely give out 5 stars, but there&#x27;s nothing bad about this great product.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and after a while a lot of shampoos start to way it down.</li>
            <li>I am usually not a product junkie</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue to use this as long as I have some left in the sample, but as a single mother, I can&#x27;t justify spending $20-30 on a bottle of shampoo when I can spend $3 and get something just as good.</li>
            <li>I have actually been wearing my hair down more since I started using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>As someone with very thick, curly and frizzy hair, I found this product to be amazing.</li>
            <li>As a blonde, this shampoo really makes my hair sparkle.</li>
            <li>I still get compliments on how soft my hair is.  </li>
            <li>I am an unabashed product snob and this shampoo surprised even me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair tends to be oily and is also fine which means I usually have to wash it every day.  </li>
            <li>Most shampoos that promise \\&quot;gloss\\&quot; or \\&quot;shine\\&quot; end up weighing my fine, straight hair down, leaving it looking dirty rather than glossy.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair clean, soft, very manageable, and with a subtle glossy sheen!    </li>
            <li>I have thick, wavy hair and, while I&#x27;ve noticed that, today in particular, my hair doesn&#x27;t look extremely messy or frizzy and I have some nice waves, it definitely doesn&#x27;t do anything I haven&#x27;t seen $4 shampoo do.</li>
            <li>I have coarse, frizzy, dry hair and this product, along with the conditioner, really did make it softer and shinier.</li>
            <li>Most hair products leave my hair dry, coarse, and dull.</li>
            <li>and I typically wash my hair every other day and concentrate on the roots as mine tends to get oily quickly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all for purchasing quality products, even if the price tag is a little steep, but my much cheaper shampoo works just as well.</li>

            <li> It is more expensive than the hair products I typically buy, but the bottle seems to be lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> Her hair does come out nice, although she still has what women like to call \\&quot;bad hair</li>
            <li> having spent $40 on the shampoo and conditioner I will definitely have to use it up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as I still have some in the bottle, but once I run out</li>
            <li> The price may be a turn off, but it lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> $22 (Target price) is more than I usually spend on shampoo/conditioner, so I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll use it everyday post-Bzz Campaign, but I know I&#x27;ll replace it when gone and will use it when I need to feel pampered.</li>
            <li> I use a volumnizer and dry .</li>
            <li> My hair is frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> This has led to dry and frizzy ends.  </li>
            <li> My ends aren&#x27;t frizzy and dry.  </li>
            <li> Seemed to dry out my hair</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this shampoo and conditioner makes my hair so soft and manageable!&lt;br /&gt;It also smells terrific!</li>
            <li> - it was still dry looking, frizzy (and my hair is currently unprocessed).  </li>
            <li> With this product, my hair starts to feel a little greasy on the second day.</li>
            <li> I typically go 3-4 days between hair washings, and on the 3rd day I&#x27;ll typically add some dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> and have been using it the last few weeks.</li>
            <li> I live in an area with very, very hard water</li>
            <li> , shampoo always lathers oddly in my hair</li>
            <li> On the negative side, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize my hair sufficiently for everyday use, so it won&#x27;t replace my daily hair products.</li>
            <li> I typically use Alberto VO5 shampoo, which I get for less than $3, and they work just as well as this product.   </li>
            <li> However, they seem to occur less with these Fekkai products.  </li>
            <li> I disliked the amount of chemicals in the product, but if it gets the job done...    </li>

            <li> I received a sample packet of this product. The sample was amazing! I had immediate results. When the sample ran out, I couldn&#x27;t wait to purchase full- sized bottles of the product. The price is very hefty but I decided it would be worth it as the product seemed so amazing. Boy, was I disappointed. The actual product is nowhere near amazing. The only thing I enjoy about it is the great smell. I&#x27;ve not been at all satisfied with the product but having spent $40 on the shampoo and conditioner I will definitely have to use it up. Won&#x27;t be spending that kind of money on this product again.</li>
            <li> As a blonde, this shampoo really makes my hair sparkle. People are always touching it, or remarking about my perfume- it is actually the shampoo and conditioner!  I have used it for over 5 years.</li>
            <li> I received some samples of this shampoo and conditioner at a retail store.  I have thick hair and this shampoo and conditioner makes my hair so soft and manageable!&lt;br /&gt;It also smells terrific!</li>
            <li> Hate it.  Makes my hair feel unclean immediately after washing and blow drying it out.</li>
            <li> When I received my bottle of Fekkai Glossing Shampoo as part of a Bzz campaign, I was really excited. I&#x27;d heard excellent things about it and read rave reviews, but my actual experience turned out a little flat. I typically go 3-4 days between hair washings, and on the 3rd day I&#x27;ll typically add some dry shampoo. With this product, my hair starts to feel a little greasy on the second day. I have thick, wavy hair and, while I&#x27;ve noticed that, today in particular, my hair doesn&#x27;t look extremely messy or frizzy and I have some nice waves, it definitely doesn&#x27;t do anything I haven&#x27;t seen $4 shampoo do. I&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as I still have some in the bottle, but once I run out I&#x27;m not going to rush out to buy more. I will say that I like that I really don&#x27;t need to use much, because I have a LOT of hair and for whatever reason, shampoo always lathers oddly in my hair and I end up using quite a bit, but with the Fekkai I really don&#x27;t need to. That would be one benefit of the $23 price tag, but not enough to make me want to purchase it in the future. I&#x27;m all for purchasing quality products, even if the price tag is a little steep, but my much cheaper shampoo works just as well.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t been to the hair dresser for two years and she just raved over how healthy and pretty it was and asked me what I was using. This shampoo and conditioner is so expensive, but very well worth it. I&#x27;ve gone off and on trying cheaper drugstore products trying to find something, but my hair always ends up damaged. Oh, I forgot to mention Glossing also smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> My first intro to this product was a 3 piece set which included shampoo, conditioner, and glosser. I change off between three brands to avoid build-up (per my hairdresser). Based on the product description, this sounds as though this might make my super fine hair greasy but it doesn&#x27;t. Ditto for the conditioner and glosser when all used together.&lt;br /&gt;I apply a small amount of product to wet hair, lather, and rinse in cool to luke warm water. This is a mild shampoo which has a lovely fresh smell. The most notable result is that my drab dark ash blonde hair seems brighter and has more highlights. It is easy to style. I use a volumnizer and dry . That&#x27;s it. The price may be a turn off, but it lasts for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to review this product today because I looked at my hair this morning after I styled it and it looked so good despite the fact that I need a trim, I had to sing this product&#x27;s praises.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I received a free sample of Fekkai glossing shampoo and conditioner for free from BzzAgent to sample. This does not affect my review of the product.  My hair is frizzy and dry. Most hair products leave my hair dry, coarse, and dull. Fekkai&#x27;s glossing shampoo left my hair looking shiny and healthy, and less brittle than most shampoos in the price range. When I want my hair to look beautiful for special occasions, this will definitely be the shampoo/conditioner that I use.  On the negative side, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize my hair sufficiently for everyday use, so it won&#x27;t replace my daily hair products. In addition, I was surprised to discover that neither the shampoo nor conditioner smells very good (they don&#x27;t have any scents added to cover up the shampoo/conditioner smell). These are minor complaints, and I&#x27;m going to stock up on Fekkai products to make my hair beautiful when it counts.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo, makes my hair shiny and glossy, but not limp. I have fine hair and after a while a lot of shampoos start to way it down. Not this one. Definitely a great purchase! Will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I received the Glossing Shampoo as part of a Bzz campaign, and was excited to try it out!  I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now and I typically wash my hair every other day and concentrate on the roots as mine tends to get oily quickly but I also have frizz issues.  The Pros:   Leaves my hair clean, soft, very manageable, and with a subtle glossy sheen!    Foams great, don&#x27;t need a huge amount of product to shampoo with (I have long hair).  I liked the minimal packaging, no fancy bottle, etc.  The scent was mild, not perfumy or overpowering.  The Cons:  I still needed a strong leave-in moisturizer. I like this shampoo a lot, but my hair just needs more moisture - it was still dry looking, frizzy (and my hair is currently unprocessed).  I don&#x27;t have that issue when I use a cheaper moisturizing shampoo.  I disliked the amount of chemicals in the product, but if it gets the job done...    Bottom Line: I found this shampoo to leave a slightly more noticeable glossy sheen than Brilliant Brunette products.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Fekkai Glossing Shampoo as part of a BzzCampaign and it has changed the way I feel about my hair.  I am usually not a product junkie and I am a ponytail kind of girl.  My hair tends to be oily and is also fine which means I usually have to wash it every day.  This has led to dry and frizzy ends.  Most shampoos that promise \\&quot;gloss\\&quot; or \\&quot;shine\\&quot; end up weighing my fine, straight hair down, leaving it looking dirty rather than glossy.  This shampoo actually makes my hair look shiny and clean!  I love it!  I am also able to wash every other day with this shampoo rather than every day.  My ends aren&#x27;t frizzy and dry.  I have actually been wearing my hair down more since I started using this shampoo.  Normally a splurge for me on shampoo is the $7 bottle vs. the $4 bottle, but I will now happily treat myself to this product which is on the high end of my budget because it is SO WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> The shampoo isn&#x27;t giving any additional \\&quot;gloss\\&quot; to my hair.  Frederic Fekkai&#x27;s technician shampoo yields noticeably softer, shinier hair, but I have been unimpressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I received this shampoo as part of a Buzz Campaign (I&#x27;m a Bzzzzz Agent--I love it!) and have been using it the last few weeks. It&#x27;s luxurious! I rarely give out 5 stars, but there&#x27;s nothing bad about this great product. From the scent to the rich texture, I feel like I&#x27;m at a salon when I use it. $22 (Target price) is more than I usually spend on shampoo/conditioner, so I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll use it everyday post-Bzz Campaign, but I know I&#x27;ll replace it when gone and will use it when I need to feel pampered.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and the conditioner are fabulous!  I live in an area with very, very hard water and I color my hair monthly.  I still get compliments on how soft my hair is.  (And I&#x27;m over 50.)  The results make the cost of the shampoo inconsequential.</li>
            <li> Fekkai Glossing Shampoo and conditioner are wonderful. I have very fine hair and  also use the voluminizer shampoo and love that as well.  Great product and once you try this you will always purchase more. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I received the Glossing Shampoo as part of a Bzz campaign, and I was very excited to try it.  I have coarse, frizzy, dry hair and this product, along with the conditioner, really did make it softer and shinier. I would definitely recommend trying it.  It is more expensive than the hair products I typically buy, but the bottle seems to be lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I am an unabashed product snob and this shampoo surprised even me.&lt;br /&gt;I beat my hair up horribly with dyes, blow dryers, flat irons and various heat stylers and this typically restricts me to ultra moisturizing shampoos and conditioners and that&#x27;s it. Glossing shampoos almost always make my hair feel very brittle.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised I even tried this, but I&#x27;m very glad I did. when used with the conditioner, it will leave even the most damaged hair looking healthy with an almost reflective shine.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before but received a sample and love this product. It detangles well and my thin hair looks beautiful. I never thought I could be so impressed by a hair product ...definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great and I received a lot of compliments from friends as it made my hair glow. It did not make my hair feel heavy. I felt very light and glossy touch to my hair, it also smells good. The only thing I found that on using it the second time, I had a lot of hair fall the next day. I am going to try using it again, but if my notice consistent hair fall, I will have to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I received this product as part of a Buzz marketing promotion. At first I was not sure about it because it was thicker then most shampoo&#x27;s. But after just 2 days I can say that I love it. It has a very light scent, and does not make my hair look oily. Also it lathers very well, and does not take a large amount.I think I have found my new favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> I got this product as a free sample as a Bzzagent for Bzzagent.com. As someone with very thick, curly and frizzy hair, I found this product to be amazing. I do not need much to wash my hair, it rinses out cleanly and thoroughly, and it smells great. In fact, the only reason I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price tag. I typically use Alberto VO5 shampoo, which I get for less than $3, and they work just as well as this product.   I will definitely continue to use this as long as I have some left in the sample, but as a single mother, I can&#x27;t justify spending $20-30 on a bottle of shampoo when I can spend $3 and get something just as good.</li>
            <li> Purchased shampoo and conditioner for my wife at her request.  Have reordered both.  She loves it. Her hair does come out nice, although she still has what women like to call \\&quot;bad hair days\\&quot;.  However, they seem to occur less with these Fekkai products.  I really don&#x27;t notice that much difference on those days, but she seems to.  That&#x27;s what counts.  Personally, my hair comes out the same with almost any shampoo.  She feels that hers is better with Fekkai.  OK.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it makes her happy.  Probably not for everyone, but it sure makes it nicer in my house.</li>
            <li> The results were very different from a sample bottle I had. Seemed to dry out my hair and I had static electricity that I did not have with the sample . Not sure I want to use it again.</li>
            <li> I love this. It&#x27;s the only shampoo that makes my hair smooth and doesn&#x27;t require washing every day. Well worth the price.</li>
