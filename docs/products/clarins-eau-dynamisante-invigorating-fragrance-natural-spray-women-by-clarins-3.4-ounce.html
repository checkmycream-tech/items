            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Clarins Eau Dynamisante is a very light spray fragrance that is very appealing.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>It is fresh and light and great for the summer.</li>
            <li>I use this for over 20 years and still it is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It is always refreshing and uplifting.</li>
            <li>My favorite cologne for years.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t smell light and refreshing...</li>
            <li>Nice scent - clean, not too sweet or perfume-like.</li>
            <li>Clean refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>light...</li>
            <li>in any case, after 27 years, it is BYEBYE BELOVED OLD FORMULA  </li>
            <li>If you want to smell clean, I tell you this fragrance is light and you will receive compliments.  </li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t stick more than 30 minutes on my skin and the scent is much more masculine.</li>
            <li>You could not have a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; day wearing this extraordinary up fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it has been reformulated and does not resemble the original.</li>
            <li>I love it just as much.</li>
            <li>but then, having read the new E.U. cosmetology regulations which appear very good, I am wondering what was in the old formula that had to be taken away and caused this fragrance and fixative to change so much.</li>
            <li>Having used it for many years, I was pleased to find it on Amazon through a third party seller.  </li>
            <li>Love this classic scent.</li>
            <li>I used to own this when I was a teen (over 15 years ago).</li>
            <li>It is fresh...</li>
            <li>Fresh scent.</li>
            <li>My favorite daily fragrance.</li>
            <li>Clarins has readapted their formula to comply with new cosmetology regulations of the E.U. and all the magic of the old formula is gone.</li>
            <li>Received quickly and brand new in box.</li>
            <li>I would certainly like to know.....</li>
            <li>My purchase was shipped promptly and at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I am glad it is no longer tested but such an old product wouldn&#x27;t seem to require the animal testing.</li>
            <li>The new bottle with the NEW FORMULA doesn&#x27;t have the logo Clarins written over the title &amp;#34;Eau Dynamisante&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>maybe you can find the original in other countries....</li>
            <li>I was hoping to find that bottle with the old formula that I adore and have worn since 1987, but it is gone for ever.</li>
            <li>Have adored this for nearly 20 years.</li>
            <li>is famous and quite expensive but worth the money.</li>
            <li>apparently the formula had to be changed for USA regulations....</li>

            <li> My mom has Used and loved this for years. I love it just as much.</li>
            <li> If you want to smell clean, I tell you this fragrance is light and you will receive compliments.  It smells different on everyone.  Them deodorant is a winner.</li>
            <li> My favorite daily fragrance. Clean refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> this one is a keeper. I bought 2 and the lotion.. Very sexy fragrance &amp; my husband loves it!!!!Clarins is famous and quite expensive but worth the money. amazon has the best prices</li>
            <li> I used to own this when I was a teen (over 15 years ago). I absolutely LOVED it!!! I searched everywhere when I ran out. I am sooooo psyched that I found it here. It is fresh... light... just wonderful.</li>
            <li> The new bottle with the NEW FORMULA doesn&#x27;t have the logo Clarins written over the title &amp;#34;Eau Dynamisante&amp;#34;. Any picture showing logo Clarins over it is misleading. I was hoping to find that bottle with the old formula that I adore and have worn since 1987, but it is gone for ever. Clarins has readapted their formula to comply with new cosmetology regulations of the E.U. and all the magic of the old formula is gone. This one doesn&#x27;t stick more than 30 minutes on my skin and the scent is much more masculine. I am sad it is gone but then, having read the new E.U. cosmetology regulations which appear very good, I am wondering what was in the old formula that had to be taken away and caused this fragrance and fixative to change so much. Was it just because one product was routinely tested on animals? I am glad it is no longer tested but such an old product wouldn&#x27;t seem to require the animal testing. So... is it that one product was unhealthy and shown to be promote cancer? I would certainly like to know..... in any case, after 27 years, it is BYEBYE BELOVED OLD FORMULA  I will take any suggestions of products that could substitute for the loss.</li>
            <li> Nice scent - clean, not too sweet or perfume-like. Helps me feel refreshed and revitalized during a long day</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It is fresh and light and great for the summer. I use this for over 20 years and still it is my favorite.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Wonderful&amp;#34; is all that I can say!!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance - is difficult to describe, maybe musk/spice-like. I sent some to my sis in law in the UK. I will definately be buying again!</li>
            <li> Fresh scent. Great for summer days.</li>
            <li> Received quickly and brand new in box. Love this seller and this product!</li>

            <li> Ive been using Clayton&#x27;s way dynamisante on and off for years. It never tires. It is always refreshing and uplifting. I love it!</li>
            <li> Have been wearing this for decades and also use the eau dynamisante deodorant... but sadly, this is a new formula and its awful! it doesn&#x27;t smell light and refreshing... like citrus... its heavy and masculine like clover and patchouli ... I hated it so much, had to take a shower to get rid of the smell... won&#x27;t be buying it again...  apparently the formula had to be changed for USA regulations.... maybe you can find the original in other countries....bonne chance!</li>

            <li> This was for a Mother&#x27;s Day gift from my girls to my wife... She loves it... She loved it before and she was ran out! Now every morning, regardless of the weather outside, she puts it on and she feels a little ray of sunshine on her skin...</li>
            <li> Best stuff. Can be used in place of deodorant too!</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne for years.  Changed the formula, now it stinks!! Literally!! Do not buy!!</li>
