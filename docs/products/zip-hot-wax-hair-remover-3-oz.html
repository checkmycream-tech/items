            <li>I have used zip wax for many years.  </li>
            <li>Works better than anything you can buy in the store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s old-school – a lot more work than wax strips – but it truly removes every hair.</li>
            <li>It used to be better.</li>
            <li>I have tried many wax products and this is by far the most effective.  </li>
            <li>Do not buy this if you are looking for original formula.  </li>
            <li>I wanted the original formula and it is not.  </li>
            <li>I love the way zip wax removes my hair, it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This wax is getting increasingly harder to find in stores but is the only commercially available wax that actually pulls all the hairs, been using this for years and is very effective.</li>
            <li>really shouldn&#x27;t even give it one (1) star</li>
            <li>Wax is back to original recipe.</li>
            <li>Wording in white circle on carton states original formula, it is not.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m still not sure it&#x27;s the original formula, but it does work better than the previous box I purchased.</li>
            <li>There is no other equal.</li>
            <li>Depending on what you&#x27;re waxing - might want to put a little baby powder on first to avoid it sticking to the skin and only sticking to the hair.</li>

            <li> My wife has been using it for years and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I have used zip wax for many years.  It works for me  One does need to be careful because the wax needs to be heated before use..</li>
            <li> This wax is the best you can get!  I have tried many wax products and this is by far the most effective.

            <li> Wax is back to original recipe. It&#x27;s the best. Only wax that has ever worked for me.</li>
            <li> This is the stuff to get for home waxing.  It heats up and melts beautifully and you do not need linen strips.  Just put it on with a little tongue depressor or knife and peel it off.  Works great. I even reuse it and throw it back in the pot, when doing facial hair.  Great stuff.  I would never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything you can buy in the store. It&#x27;s old-school – a lot more work than wax strips – but it truly removes every hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure it&#x27;s the original formula, but it does work better than the previous box I purchased.</li>
            <li> Received my order todayl it is NOT AS ADVERTISED. Wording in white circle on carton states original formula, it is not.  Do not buy this if you are looking for original formula.  FALSE ADVERTISING!!!  I wanted the original formula and it is not.  I am stuck with 6 boxes that I won&#x27;t use.  Only the original formula works, they know it and they falsely advertised it as such.</li>
            <li> Melts very slowly and has to be very hot to melt fully.  It used to be better.</li>
            <li> The wax just does not work it is not the same product.  I will never purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Got the delivery on time but something was wrong with the wax and was not effective as it was supposed to be.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since the 1970s, but unfortunately, this product is not the product I have known and trusted for many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really shouldn&#x27;t even give it one (1) star---it doesn&#x27;t work at all, in any way!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attempted to return (all but one tiny square) for a refund, but was informed that the company doesn&#x27;t accept returns on cosmetic products.&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to save your money.</li>
            <li> I wish I could locate this in Dallas.  I have used this product for 30 years.  There is no other equal.</li>
            <li> I love the way zip wax removes my hair, it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.  I do not use any other wax/cream etc on my face !</li>
            <li> Great at home wax for face!</li>
            <li> Impossible to find in the stores.  Brands offered come in tiny containers that you microwave and don&#x27;t always melt right.</li>
            <li> Used this for years.  Still effective for hair removal.  Does a great job of removing both fine and medium hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T.</li>
            <li> This is still the best wax product on the market!</li>
