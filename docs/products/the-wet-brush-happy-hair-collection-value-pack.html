            <li>I have real fine hair and the brushes</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>So I always bring my own comb and insist that I will get the knots out before they cut it.</li>
            <li>Now they can brush their hair on their own.  </li>
            <li>I even use it on my own hear because it isn&#x27;t so damaging.  </li>
            <li>Best brush for fine hair that tangles easily, or super curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I love love love these brushes!</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.  </li>

            <li>Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>The wet brush is awesome!</li>
            <li>Loved it so much</li>
            <li>This came as a set with a regular sized brush and a travel size, which is great to throw in your purse.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold, easier brushing as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I have always shied away from having anybody else brush my hair, as I find hairdressers like to rip through it quickly with a plastic brush, with no regard for me freaking out when I see them throw huge wads of hair from the brush onto the floor.</li>
            <li>nothing could get rid of my tangles except this special brush the lady at the salon pulled out.</li>
            <li>I will not use any other now that I have experienced these.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brush if you have hair that tangles easily or that even damages or is brittle.  </li>
            <li>But I am more aware of hair loss, and more careful.</li>
            <li>My wet hair brushes out SO much more easily.</li>
            <li>Works fine on my daughter&#x27;s fine hair, but still does &amp;#34;tear&amp;#34; at the tangles causing numerous complaints and whines.  </li>
            <li>And more comfortable psychologically for me since, even though there is plastic, there are also natural boar bristles.</li>
            <li>I use one and bought my daughter and daughter-in-law the same for my grand daughters.</li>
            <li>My husband bought them for me and my 4 year old girl, I have to say we love them, my daughter has some curls that get knots every now and then, and with this brush we have no problem brushing them off softly.</li>
            <li>And she quickly explained that this was no ordinary brush.</li>
            <li>I like the shine brush better for when my hair is dry.</li>
            <li>Seems to get thru the dry tangles better.</li>
            <li>We all shed a certain number of hairs each day.  </li>
            <li>And so much quicker and easier.</li>
            <li>Love the color and design - we have had a wet brush before but the handle broke brushing my hair after about a year.</li>
            <li>These brushes really work on tangles.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a great brush for long easily tangled hairs, especially for the little ones.</li>
            <li>Love the Wet Brush!</li>
            <li>&amp; when it is so easy to brush her hair when its dry now, doesn&#x27;t pull!</li>
            <li>Detangles my daughter&#x27;s wet hair easily without tearing.</li>
            <li>I am 62 years old with very long (almost waist length) thick/course hair that tangles and mats easily.</li>
            <li>It totally changed comb outs and getting ready for school mornings !</li>
            <li>I guess an old dog can learn new tricks after all.ew tricks after all.</li>
            <li>My hair has thinned in recent years, although I still have tons more than the average bear.</li>
            <li>My only diappointment is the colors on the brush are very dull and not as bright as shown in the pictures.</li>
            <li>It is soft on my scalp &amp; doesn&#x27;t rip my hair out.  </li>
            <li>These brushes do what they advertise - my daughter has a very sensitive head and we ended up in tears every day when we brushed her hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only brush my 7 year old will use,,</li>
            <li>Will never go back to my old routine.</li>
            <li>However this brush is very soft which means it&#x27;s easy to be bended if put brush with other hard object in a luggage when travel.</li>
            <li>And then brush dry hair only with a soft boar bristle brush.  </li>

            <li> My 3 year old little girl would cry when I tried to brush her hair after bath everynight, but now she doesn&#x27;t say a word!</li>

            <li> Trying to keep my hair for as long as possible (though I know it is unlikely to look like this when I am 80).</li>
            <li> Works wonders on any hair but especially wet hair.</li>
            <li> These were also open, used and badly tapped back together when I got them from Amazon</li>
            <li> But it seems to be no more than what I lose with a detangling comb.</li>
            <li> used to use the Goody Ouchless brushes, but now they&#x27;ve changed and they are actually quite painful....</li>

            <li> Love these brushes! It&#x27;s the only brush my 7 year old will use,,</li>
            <li> My daughter has very fine long hair and would cry everytime I brush her hair because her hair always gets tangled and painful to brush. Ever since we started using this brush, she doesn&#x27;t mind me brushing her hair anymore, not bothered one bit! She actually would sit still and let me brush. However this brush is very soft which means it&#x27;s easy to be bended if put brush with other hard object in a luggage when travel. But it&#x27;s a great brush for long easily tangled hairs, especially for the little ones.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser told me about this brush. I saw this deal on Amazon so I purchased the 2 for 1 set.  I love this brush!  It is soft on my scalp &amp; doesn&#x27;t rip my hair out.  Great vendor, great price &amp; received very fast!</li>
            <li> THE BEST hairbrush ever!!</li>
            <li> I am 62 years old with very long (almost waist length) thick/course hair that tangles and mats easily. I was taught since childhood to never use a brush on wet hair (comb only) and to never never never use plastic bristles on my head. My long-time routine has always been to use a ton of creme rinse or detangler, then carefully comb the knots out with a wide tooth comb. And then brush dry hair only with a soft boar bristle brush.  My hair has thinned in recent years, although I still have tons more than the average bear. But I am more aware of hair loss, and more careful. Trying to keep my hair for as long as possible (though I know it is unlikely to look like this when I am 80). I get my hair trimmed twice a year. I have always shied away from having anybody else brush my hair, as I find hairdressers like to rip through it quickly with a plastic brush, with no regard for me freaking out when I see them throw huge wads of hair from the brush onto the floor. So I always bring my own comb and insist that I will get the knots out before they cut it. This last time... I pushed the hairdresser away when she came at me with a brush. And she quickly explained that this was no ordinary brush. And I let her.., and she brushed the knots out in about 3 minutes. With no pulling and no gobs of hair in the brush. I was truly astounded. I immediately went home and ordered a few Wet Brushes. And one Shine Brush as well. What a miracle. My wet hair brushes out SO much more easily. In minutes. With minimal hair loss. I won&#x27;t say there is no hair in the brush. We all shed a certain number of hairs each day.  But it seems to be no more than what I lose with a detangling comb. And so much quicker and easier. I like the shine brush better for when my hair is dry. Seems to get thru the dry tangles better. And more comfortable psychologically for me since, even though there is plastic, there are also natural boar bristles. Will never go back to my old routine. I guess an old dog can learn new tricks after all.ew tricks after all.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome. I could not get through brushing my girls hair without tears until I bought this brush.  Now they can brush their hair on their own.  The bristle are soft and flexible instead of hard and stationary.  I even use it on my own hear because it isn&#x27;t so damaging.  I highly recommend this brush if you have hair that tangles easily or that even damages or is brittle.  This came as a set with a regular sized brush and a travel size, which is great to throw in your purse.</li>
            <li> Perfect for me and my daughter</li>
            <li> My husband bought them for me and my 4 year old girl, I have to say we love them, my daughter has some curls that get knots every now and then, and with this brush we have no problem brushing them off softly.</li>
            <li> Love the Wet Brush! Keep one at home &amp; one in pool  or gym bag! Detangles my daughter&#x27;s wet hair easily without tearing.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.  I will not use any other now that I have experienced these.</li>
            <li> Best brush for fine hair that tangles easily, or super curly hair.  I only wish I could&#x27;ve owned one sooner.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my girlfriend, and she loves it!</li>
            <li> used to use the Goody Ouchless brushes, but now they&#x27;ve changed and they are actually quite painful....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i had to switch, and this is great. love it.</li>
            <li> love these brushes!  work great in my daughters hair &amp; mine.  My only diappointment is the colors on the brush are very dull and not as bright as shown in the pictures.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold, easier brushing as advertised.  Cute too.</li>
            <li> Love the color and design - we have had a wet brush before but the handle broke brushing my hair after about a year. I hope it was just a fluke. These brushes do what they advertise - my daughter has a very sensitive head and we ended up in tears every day when we brushed her hair. She LOVES the wet brush because it doesn&#x27;t pull like other brushes. It will still pull a little, but not hard and not hurtful - which makes brushing her hair so much less stressful on both of us.</li>

            <li> The wet brush is awesome! My 3 year old little girl would cry when I tried to brush her hair after bath everynight, but now she doesn&#x27;t say a word! I still have to hold her hair above the knot sometimes to get it out with the brush, but I doesn&#x27;t pull or hurt her head. &amp; when it is so easy to brush her hair when its dry now, doesn&#x27;t pull! Loved it so much I got me one too! Great brush for kids &amp; adults (doesn&#x27;t break your hair when getting out knots!)</li>
            <li> If you are thinking about buying this, then do it for sure!! Great for kids!! Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> nothing could get rid of my tangles except this special brush the lady at the salon pulled out. Amazing.</li>
            <li> These brushes really work on tangles.  I am glad I bought them.</li>
            <li> My sister raved about these for her kids. The set is cute too. I have real fine hair and the brushes won&#x27;t even go through my hair so while they don&#x27;t pull my hair... they don&#x27;t de tangle it either. I don&#x27;t use them. These were also open, used and badly tapped back together when I got them from Amazon</li>
