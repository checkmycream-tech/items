            <li>great stuff.  </li>
            <li>For the money, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li>If you must have a great scent I think you need to upgrade to a Molton Brown or Kiehl&#x27;s type product.</li>

            <li>You can use it as a shampoo, body wash, and bubble bath which is great.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak about using it as shampoo, but this is a great bubble bath.</li>

            <li>great smell.  </li>
            <li>great consistency.  </li>
            <li>I think we women get used to really great products for our hair and this one dries my hair too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I need something inexpensive and that works great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great too.</li>
            <li>love it...will buy again !!</li>
            <li>This is a great soap, and it smells amazing!  </li>
            <li>Great organic body wash and the lemon coconut scent is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing!</li>
            <li>This lathers nicely and smells like a lemon cupcake!</li>
            <li>Awesome, great smell and smooth on skin.</li>
            <li>Pleasant scent -- not like suntan lotion.</li>
            <li>It is a pleasant, cheery good morning to myself when using this.</li>
            <li>Cleanses and foams really good.</li>
            <li>It works surprisingly well to shave my neck and head in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Parabens are not for me, so I was delighted when this all-purpose skin and hair product was suggested by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>great soap, nice smell</li>
            <li>If you are fair skinned, the type of person who doesn&#x27;t tan, just burns, this soap is not for you.</li>
            <li>I can fairly say &amp;#34; I will never buy this product again&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This is a good product to use along with the lotion, but I probably will not buy again.</li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>Good liquid soap for the shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good quality, I think, but the scent is ehh..  </li>
            <li>Every time I use this as my shampoo people rave about how good my hair smells.</li>
            <li>It smells great, I have no reaction to it, and it&#x27;s nice and hydrating.</li>
            <li>But the lather on this soap is quite good too.  </li>
            <li>oh, so good.  </li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and moisturizes beautifully!</li>
            <li>A lot of people were saying that it&#x27;s good to shave with</li>
            <li>good price for the size.</li>
            <li>I like the product, it has a good scent and lathers well.  </li>
            <li>coconut lemon sent is wonderful and fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value from a company that is committed to healthy products.</li>
            <li>Would like more lather, but otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It lathers well, smells incredible, and leaves you feeling clean and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle on my skin and it smells awesome!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>

            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>, it gets the job done, and it smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>Smell is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing price for a premium product.</li>
            <li>Scent is not overpowering and smells nice.</li>
            <li>This stuff smell wonderful  fast delivery</li>
            <li>It lathers up nicely in the shower</li>
            <li>The citrus really gives this soap a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>The scents are nice though.</li>
            <li>I tossed it in the trash and am now making my own body wash.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, not perfumed.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the point -- if you&#x27;re looking for a good, natural, well-priced soap that is eco-safe, this is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li>This soap smells so nice, is affordable and has a matching scented lotion.</li>
            <li>Great lather, nice scent and gets you clean without turning ashy.</li>
            <li>Even the grandaughters love this soap, which smells great and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>Completely natural - you could eat it - and is just a delightful body cleanser.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best soaps on the market and it is all natural.</li>
            <li>This does lather well, gets your skin clean and smells good.</li>
            <li>This soap smells great, is nicely priced, and very practical.  </li>
            <li>Other wise an excellent soap!</li>
            <li>No nasty chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can use it on me and my babies.</li>
            <li>I was able to replace my body soap, my husband&#x27;s body soap and face wash, and both of our separate shampoos with this one item.</li>
            <li>in addition to enjoying softer hair and skin, it&#x27;s also (and I swear this on my life)</li>
            <li>I love the simplicity of this product.</li>
            <li>It makes so many bubbles when I take baths and makes the water smell heavenly.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>smooth!&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying this soap.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did because my daughter loves it as well.</li>
            <li>I love the formulation of this soap and how it makes my skin feel, but the coconut &amp; lemon combination scent didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li>I will order a more &amp;#34;reliable&amp;#34; scent this time.</li>
            <li>I do love that this comes in a 32 oz.</li>
            <li>Glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>Also not organic or as healthy as I thought once I read the ingredients.</li>
            <li>so I find i probably use more than I need to</li>
            <li>but it smells good, doesn&#x27;t leave a gross residue and is definitely great for everyone (and every part of you)</li>
            <li>More lemon than coconut.</li>
            <li>However, the toxicity level is thought to be similar and this is dubious at best.</li>
            <li>I love the lemon coconut scent</li>
            <li>Great body wash for the whole family.  </li>
            <li>My favorite body soap ever.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t lather a ton and doesn&#x27;t make a ton of bubbles, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>This soap rocks, it smells good, and it is a good value for a natural based soap.</li>
            <li>Omg, love, love, love.</li>
            <li>It smells more like a dish detergent than what you&#x27;d want your body to smell like.</li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have researched many similar products and this seems to be the best deal.</li>
            <li>And the ingredients are ok too.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the entire family.</li>
            <li>Like this shower gel better than the Brommer&#x27;s since it doesn&#x27;t burn if it splashes on my face or eyes.</li>
            <li>love this soap.  </li>
            <li>I love this product-</li>
            <li>As a shampoo, it&#x27;s better for men.</li>
            <li>does it all - love it</li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I switch it up and use EO Soap&#x27;s more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s the weakness of trying to do too many things with one product.</li>
            <li>I love it and will order it again.</li>
            <li>smells good, right ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This is a really great gluten free product that is very gentle on the skin I love it</li>
            <li>Thanks EO Products!!!!</li>
            <li>It works great a shampoo as it doesn&#x27;t strip everything too much but it will get your hair clean!</li>
            <li>Considering how many things we use it for, that&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li>(I know you are not supposed to do that, but I like the feel of very clean hair.)</li>
            <li>I normally use this as just body wash, but it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s shampoo too.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is pretty strong, but really pleasant.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice mild smell and gente</li>
            <li>I also use it to clean my makeup brushes!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling SO CLEAN for hours and hours - all day!</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s a great natural emollient -</li>
            <li>Its a gentle soap, and a good shampoo for me.</li>
            <li>Loved it so much I bought for everyone.</li>
            <li>I love this as shampoo and body wash, love the clean light scent.</li>
            <li>Love this eco friendly soap.  </li>
            <li>wish it lathered a little more but still awesome.</li>
            <li>that it comes with a pump so it is easy to dispense</li>
            <li>This soap works pretty well and am pretty happy with it functionally.</li>
            <li>Great smell and love that it has multiple uses.</li>
            <li>The soap smells great, has good ingredients but leaves a heavy film after rinsing off.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing &amp; fresh, lathers really well, &amp; the ingredients are safe for all!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, the combination of lemon with coconut keeps it from being too tart or too sweet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a man for goodness sake and this works fine for me.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s working fine.  </li>
            <li>Lemon&#x27;s fine, and</li>
            <li>and I must say that this is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>It has a light scent, and goes on smoothly and easily.  </li>
            <li>My hair is happy, and my dry itchy skin is SO much better.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a huge amount of lather.</li>
            <li>Fortunately their great customer service credited me the cost of the product without me even having to ship it back.</li>
            <li>Soap is really great and lathers just enough if you use a loofah.</li>
            <li>The matching scent lotion is light and non greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gluten free and have skin sensitives.</li>
            <li>I also own the lavender one, which I really like as well, but I will probably start using that one in the colder months.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a light smell.</li>
            <li>This product is so nice smelling, yet gentle.</li>
            <li>Light scent..</li>
            <li>cruelty free, paraben free, polysorbate free, disodium EDTA free, gluten free, non-GMO verified, sodium laureth/lauryl sulfate</li>
            <li>Scent is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I went to my account info and found out it was no longer available.  </li>
            <li>the sensitive skin note, I&#x27;ve got extremely sensitive skin, and this works out great!</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I loved the idea of natural ingredients and having shampoo and body wash in one bottle.</li>
            <li>I just love using the tropical scents right now.</li>
            <li>The scent is light &amp; clean.  </li>
            <li>The smell is light and clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves you skin feeling smooth and smelling so clean.</li>
            <li>That always makes showers quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Scent is unique.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for my son to use, but I ended up using it too.</li>
            <li>Good to keep in the kitchen for general purpose hand washing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see where it has any significant cleaning properties at all, and would never use this as a shampoo (although the label suggests you can).</li>
            <li>I did not find any of that to be true or accurate with my soap.  </li>
            <li>I used this &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; originally and then tried the  lilac one.  </li>
            <li>Nice, soft feeling skin and really good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The scent is SO heavenly and the lather is rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>However, it leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Makes getting clean every morning an indulgence.</li>
            <li>I bought this soap based on all the positive reviews, and the interesting combination of scents.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good price, but the product itself smells almost a little industrial.</li>
            <li>I feel that I have treated myself special.  </li>
            <li>I was under the mistaken belief that lather was good and necessary.</li>
            <li>I was expecting this to be creamy, but it is kind of clear.</li>
            <li>At least it does to me anyway---not drying, not oily, this is the perfect body wash.</li>
            <li>I think you get good value, when I have purchased several times its 32 oz for $10.</li>
            <li>I keep reordering this bubble bath, because for the price per ounce as far as natural products go this really is the best!</li>
            <li>but I used this one for shaving with not bad results/</li>
            <li>As a shampoo it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>Not a bad cleanser, and</li>
            <li>No nasty ingredients and gluten free for sensitive celiacs, yay!</li>
            <li>It has a clean smell which I love as I&#x27;m very sensitive to perfumes.  </li>
            <li>it is very gentle and great for summer or on days my skin isn&#x27;t very dry.  </li>
            <li>This smells wonderful and last quite a long time in the 32ounce bottle.  </li>
            <li>but well worth it for this otherwise super product.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the little kids without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, very economical as it&#x27;s a huge bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a low maintenance kind of gal.</li>
            <li>My 11 yr old used this in her bath and it did make some bubbles just nothing over the top.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and not overpowering like some soaps.  </li>
            <li>Gentle and healthy soap for the whole family..</li>
            <li>Remember, your skin is a sponge and anything that you put on it is absorbed into your blood stream.</li>
            <li>The scent just makes you smile because it is so clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I haven&#x27;t been able to find any other bubble bath good for sensitive skin that is so cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This soap is positively YUMMY!  </li>
            <li>The ingredients could be a little more Barebone natural – good for a trip</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use very much of it to get the desired effect</li>
            <li>This is an alright shampoo, especially if you need a bulk amount for more than one person to go around.</li>
            <li>It is gluten free and leaves my skin feeling soft and</li>
            <li>I think I will try the aloe one next time :)</li>
            <li>First thing caught my attention from these products was the Everyone 3 in 1 description.</li>
            <li>This is just a head&#x27;s up in case anyone is interested.</li>
            <li>P.S. If you are interested in this topic please check out The Environmental Working Group online.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to use plenty of water in your hair prior to applying this</li>
            <li>Works very well for just about everything!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been researching natural body care products that are paraben and chemical free.</li>
            <li>It IS time to stop using poison products and start supporting companies that put together healthful products for us to use.</li>
            <li>I have used most scents of this product and my current infatuation is the Coconut and Lemon.</li>
            <li>I lather it on my kiddies, I lather it on myself, and I love that it&#x27;s a big bottle that I can pump.  </li>
            <li>I should have done more research before buying such a large amount of soap.</li>
            <li>It smells very good and seems to clean slightly better than a more expensive (3x&#x27;s more expensive!)</li>
            <li>I ordered this through the subscribe and save program and loved the first bottle I got, but then no more showed up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even slightly exaggerating when I say that this is the best shampoo I have ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li>You can pretty much use for everything, hands, body, and face.</li>
            <li>I had bought this because I was looking for a more natural body wash (since I have sensitive skin) and that didn&#x27;t cost too much.</li>
            <li>Two pumps is enough to lather up for a full body wash plus some!</li>
            <li>I believe it is true that, for all natural soaps, they do not lather as intensely as the chemical based soaps do.  </li>
            <li>I love every single EO product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One bottle (which is quite large) lasts my husband and I about 2 months.  </li>
            <li>Nice that it comes in a large bottle to reduce landfill waste.</li>
            <li>This is a gentle, all purpose body soap.  </li>
            <li>While I find that it lathers plenty alone, the castor oil really helps to quadruple the amount of suds you get.</li>
            <li>The sizes are very generous.</li>
            <li>Purchased at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but this bodywash is only lightly lemony.</li>
            <li>The cost is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap and have it as a Subscribe and Save item.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to use a container like this in the shower, without dispensing too much product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lemon-y.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel very soapy at all.  </li>
            <li>since it&#x27;s sulfate free that&#x27;s a bonus, of course it doesn&#x27;t later up because of that</li>
            <li>But natural or not, I still expected this soap to lather, clean and smell nice, but it falls short in all categories.</li>
            <li>My solution has been to replace the original dispenser with a larger one from another product (you might have to trim the tube&#x27;s length).</li>
            <li>The only reason I give it four stars is I have to use a lot of soap for my hair to get clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 years old and have had baby fine, pin straight hair and an oily scalp for my entire life.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve switched back to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Unsecented Baby Mild soap, and both of them are much happier.</li>
            <li>It also is a decent bubble bath for a soak.  </li>
            <li>The coconut is not  even remotely discernible because it is so overpowered by the strong lemon smell.</li>
            <li>and then maybe even once in the evening if I had an event that required me to look better than a greasy mess</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and rinses clean, leaving no residue feel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never put my old body wash in my hair, but this stuff is gentle on hair.</li>
            <li>Normally I would have to wash my hair once in the morning (mandatory)</li>
            <li>I need more moisture in my shampoos however if I was going on vacation for a few days</li>
            <li>I like that it is a natural product and the smell is nice but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>For everyday use I prefer it as a body wash, also as a side note I have very sensitive skin that is prone to drying, while this isn&#x27;t the most moisturizing soap</li>
            <li>&gt;  pure and natural - gentle enough for the whole family</li>
            <li>(I use it for my own bath&#x27;s, too, &amp; add a little lavender essential oil.)</li>
            <li>It smells a bit like a cleaning product, but it&#x27;s not super strong or</li>
            <li>but I completely disagree; it is a thin consistency and washes off too easily to be good for shaving.</li>
            <li>This body wash is soft, gentle, and works pretty well as an all natural, body wash for the entire family.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;  gentle and fragrant with ingredients and essential oils that are pure, natural and organic&lt;br</li>
            <li>just be sure to let the shower rinse the shaved leg &amp; floor so the floor isn&#x27;t slick...</li>
            <li>As a bubble bath it makes the water silky, leaves skin soft and not icky.</li>
            <li>This is the bubbliest natural bubble bath we&#x27;ve found for our son!</li>
            <li>I was also hoping this would be sulfate-free since it&#x27;s a natural product, but no dice!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so refreshing to find a company that offers AFFORDABLE chemical-free products that actually work extremely well.</li>
            <li>This bottle is huge and I see it lasting me a long time.  </li>
            <li>Plus EO is a small, local Bay Area company that deserves to be supported in its effort to produce effective, eco-friendly, plant-based products.</li>
            <li>The only positive thing I can say about this soap is that you get a ton of it for the price.</li>
            <li>Lot&#x27;s of women also dig the fresh, subtle, but clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty mild, but I usually prefer something stronger like peppermint, or citrus or even something herbal.</li>
            <li>I also got the same &#x27;flavor&#x27; in large lotion, which my husband and I both like.  </li>
            <li>pure essential oils nurture and soothe the skin</li>
            <li>my new growth / roots is insane right now, which is awesome!</li>
            <li>Love this soap and it can be hard to find.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every natural soap and body wash</li>
            <li>( I have refrained from tasting it so far)</li>
            <li>Everyone in the family uses it including my 13 month old.</li>
            <li>All in all though, as a shower gel and albeit an all natural one at that, it does the job and it does it well.</li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Maybe they fixed the pump over time.  </li>
            <li>The scent is all natural and</li>
            <li>My 9yr old son loves this wash.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with gluten or sensitive skin issues</li>
            <li>I bought this soap because it claims to have natural (non-toxic) ingredients.  </li>
            <li>So, I couldn&#x27;t see this being the best option for someone who is planning to take a lot of bubble baths and use this as the base, like the manufacturer mentions.  </li>
            <li>Usually I would buy shampoos that were &#x27;thickening,&#x27; &#x27;volumizing,&#x27; or &#x27;clarifying&#x27; to help make the most of what I&#x27;m working with, but recently I decided there was no point in going to the trouble to eat vegan / clean if I am going to coat my body and hair with tons of chemicals.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a large bottle, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The price is fantastic due to the amount that you get in the bottle and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>I have since found this at Whole Foods locally for a similar price.</li>
            <li>I have trouble with multi use products because my hair is very fine and these types of products tend to weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very dry and has not got a very lemony scent.</li>
            <li>Very concentrated, on pump goes a long way!!!</li>
            <li>Anyway - I definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a natural soap and shampoo, with or without the addition of castor oil.</li>
            <li>you can barely smell anything.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t emulsify as much as some other soaps</li>
            <li>Also the shipment was fast and there was no leaking in the packaging which I can&#x27;t say for other products I ordered from different places.</li>
            <li>I originally ordered this only for the bubble bath aspect, so the fact that it doubles as a shampoo &amp; body wash that&#x27;s also cheaper per ounce than other natural ones we&#x27;ve used in the past is just a bonus!</li>
            <li>This soap does the job... can&#x27;t really use it for a shampoo since it seems to make my hair a little dryer than I like it.  </li>

            <li> For the money, it&#x27;s a great deal.</li>
            <li> If you must have a great scent I think you need to upgrade to a Molton Brown or Kiehl&#x27;s type product.</li>

            <li> Awesome, great smell and smooth on skin.</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent -- not like suntan lotion.</li>
            <li> It is a pleasant, cheery good morning to myself when using this.</li>
            <li> Cleanses and foams really good.</li>
            <li> It works surprisingly well to shave my neck and head in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Parabens are not for me, so I was delighted when this all-purpose skin and hair product was suggested by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> great soap, nice smell</li>
            <li> If you are fair skinned, the type of person who doesn&#x27;t tan, just burns, this soap is not for you.</li>
            <li> I can fairly say &amp;#34; I will never buy this product again&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is a good product to use along with the lotion, but I probably will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I loved it</li>
            <li> Good liquid soap for the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality, I think, but the scent is ehh..  </li>
            <li> Every time I use this as my shampoo people rave about how good my hair smells.</li>
            <li> It smells great, I have no reaction to it, and it&#x27;s nice and hydrating.</li>
            <li> But the lather on this soap is quite good too.  </li>
            <li> oh, so good.  </li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and moisturizes beautifully!</li>

            <li> good price for the size.</li>
            <li> I like the product, it has a good scent and lathers well.  </li>
            <li> coconut lemon sent is wonderful and fresh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value from a company that is committed to healthy products.</li>
            <li> Would like more lather, but otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> It lathers well, smells incredible, and leaves you feeling clean and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle on my skin and it smells awesome!</li>

            <li> Smell is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing price for a premium product.</li>
            <li> Scent is not overpowering and smells nice.</li>
            <li> This stuff smell wonderful  fast delivery</li>
            <li> It lathers up nicely in the shower</li>
            <li> The citrus really gives this soap a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> The scents are nice though.</li>
            <li> I tossed it in the trash and am now making my own body wash.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, not perfumed.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the point -- if you&#x27;re looking for a good, natural, well-priced soap that is eco-safe, this is an excellent product.  </li>
            <li> This soap smells so nice, is affordable and has a matching scented lotion.</li>
            <li> Great lather, nice scent and gets you clean without turning ashy.</li>
            <li> Even the grandaughters love this soap, which smells great and rinses clean.</li>
            <li> Completely natural - you could eat it - and is just a delightful body cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best soaps on the market and it is all natural.</li>
            <li> This does lather well, gets your skin clean and smells good.</li>
            <li> This soap smells great, is nicely priced, and very practical.  </li>
            <li> Other wise an excellent soap!</li>
            <li> No nasty chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I love that I can use it on me and my babies.</li>
            <li> I was able to replace my body soap, my husband&#x27;s body soap and face wash, and both of our separate shampoos with this one item.</li>
            <li> in addition to enjoying softer hair and skin, it&#x27;s also (and I swear this on my life)</li>
            <li> I love the simplicity of this product.</li>
            <li> It makes so many bubbles when I take baths and makes the water smell heavenly.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> smooth!&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this soap.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did because my daughter loves it as well.</li>
            <li> I love the formulation of this soap and how it makes my skin feel, but the coconut &amp; lemon combination scent didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
            <li> I will order a more &amp;#34;reliable&amp;#34; scent this time.</li>
            <li> I do love that this comes in a 32 oz.</li>
            <li> Glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Also not organic or as healthy as I thought once I read the ingredients.</li>
            <li> so I find i probably use more than I need to</li>
            <li> but it smells good, doesn&#x27;t leave a gross residue and is definitely great for everyone (and every part of you)</li>
            <li> More lemon than coconut.</li>
            <li> However, the toxicity level is thought to be similar and this is dubious at best.</li>
            <li> I love the lemon coconut scent</li>
            <li> Great body wash for the whole family.  </li>
            <li> My favorite body soap ever.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t lather a ton and doesn&#x27;t make a ton of bubbles, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> This soap rocks, it smells good, and it is a good value for a natural based soap.</li>
            <li> Omg, love, love, love.</li>
            <li> It smells more like a dish detergent than what you&#x27;d want your body to smell like.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have researched many similar products and this seems to be the best deal.</li>
            <li> And the ingredients are ok too.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the entire family.</li>
            <li> Like this shower gel better than the Brommer&#x27;s since it doesn&#x27;t burn if it splashes on my face or eyes.</li>
            <li> love this soap.  </li>
            <li> I love this product-</li>
            <li> As a shampoo, it&#x27;s better for men.</li>
            <li> does it all - love it</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I switch it up and use EO Soap&#x27;s more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s the weakness of trying to do too many things with one product.</li>
            <li> I love it and will order it again.</li>
            <li> smells good, right ingredients.  </li>
            <li> This is a really great gluten free product that is very gentle on the skin I love it</li>
            <li> Thanks EO Products!!!!</li>
            <li> It works great a shampoo as it doesn&#x27;t strip everything too much but it will get your hair clean!</li>
            <li> Considering how many things we use it for, that&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li> (I know you are not supposed to do that, but I like the feel of very clean hair.)</li>
            <li> I normally use this as just body wash, but it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s shampoo too.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is pretty strong, but really pleasant.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a nice mild smell and gente</li>
            <li> I also use it to clean my makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling SO CLEAN for hours and hours - all day!</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s a great natural emollient -</li>
            <li> Its a gentle soap, and a good shampoo for me.</li>
            <li> Loved it so much I bought for everyone.</li>
            <li> I love this as shampoo and body wash, love the clean light scent.</li>
            <li> Love this eco friendly soap.  </li>
            <li> wish it lathered a little more but still awesome.</li>
            <li> that it comes with a pump so it is easy to dispense</li>
            <li> This soap works pretty well and am pretty happy with it functionally.</li>
            <li> Great smell and love that it has multiple uses.</li>
            <li> The soap smells great, has good ingredients but leaves a heavy film after rinsing off.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing &amp; fresh, lathers really well, &amp; the ingredients are safe for all!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, the combination of lemon with coconut keeps it from being too tart or too sweet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man for goodness sake and this works fine for me.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s working fine.  </li>
            <li> Lemon&#x27;s fine, and</li>
            <li> and I must say that this is my absolute favorite!</li>
            <li> It has a light scent, and goes on smoothly and easily.  </li>
            <li> My hair is happy, and my dry itchy skin is SO much better.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a huge amount of lather.</li>
            <li> Fortunately their great customer service credited me the cost of the product without me even having to ship it back.</li>
            <li> Soap is really great and lathers just enough if you use a loofah.</li>
            <li> The matching scent lotion is light and non greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gluten free and have skin sensitives.</li>
            <li> I also own the lavender one, which I really like as well, but I will probably start using that one in the colder months.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a light smell.</li>
            <li> This product is so nice smelling, yet gentle.</li>
            <li> Light scent..</li>
            <li> cruelty free, paraben free, polysorbate free, disodium EDTA free, gluten free, non-GMO verified, sodium laureth/lauryl sulfate</li>
            <li> Scent is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I went to my account info and found out it was no longer available.  </li>
            <li> the sensitive skin note, I&#x27;ve got extremely sensitive skin, and this works out great!</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of natural ingredients and having shampoo and body wash in one bottle.</li>
            <li> I just love using the tropical scents right now.</li>
            <li> The scent is light &amp; clean.  </li>
            <li> The smell is light and clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves you skin feeling smooth and smelling so clean.</li>
            <li> That always makes showers quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Scent is unique.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my son to use, but I ended up using it too.</li>
            <li> Good to keep in the kitchen for general purpose hand washing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see where it has any significant cleaning properties at all, and would never use this as a shampoo (although the label suggests you can).</li>
            <li> I did not find any of that to be true or accurate with my soap.  </li>
            <li> I used this &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; originally and then tried the  lilac one.  </li>
            <li> Nice, soft feeling skin and really good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The scent is SO heavenly and the lather is rich and creamy.</li>
            <li> However, it leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Makes getting clean every morning an indulgence.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap based on all the positive reviews, and the interesting combination of scents.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good price, but the product itself smells almost a little industrial.</li>
            <li> I feel that I have treated myself special.  </li>
            <li> I was under the mistaken belief that lather was good and necessary.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this to be creamy, but it is kind of clear.</li>
            <li> At least it does to me anyway---not drying, not oily, this is the perfect body wash.</li>
            <li> I think you get good value, when I have purchased several times its 32 oz for $10.</li>
            <li> I keep reordering this bubble bath, because for the price per ounce as far as natural products go this really is the best!</li>
            <li> but I used this one for shaving with not bad results/</li>
            <li> As a shampoo it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Not a bad cleanser, and</li>
            <li> No nasty ingredients and gluten free for sensitive celiacs, yay!</li>
            <li> It has a clean smell which I love as I&#x27;m very sensitive to perfumes.  </li>
            <li> it is very gentle and great for summer or on days my skin isn&#x27;t very dry.  </li>
            <li> This smells wonderful and last quite a long time in the 32ounce bottle.  </li>
            <li> but well worth it for this otherwise super product.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for the little kids without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, very economical as it&#x27;s a huge bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a low maintenance kind of gal.</li>
            <li> My 11 yr old used this in her bath and it did make some bubbles just nothing over the top.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and not overpowering like some soaps.  </li>
            <li> Gentle and healthy soap for the whole family..</li>
            <li> Remember, your skin is a sponge and anything that you put on it is absorbed into your blood stream.</li>
            <li> The scent just makes you smile because it is so clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I haven&#x27;t been able to find any other bubble bath good for sensitive skin that is so cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This soap is positively YUMMY!  </li>
            <li> The ingredients could be a little more Barebone natural – good for a trip</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use very much of it to get the desired effect</li>
            <li> This is an alright shampoo, especially if you need a bulk amount for more than one person to go around.</li>
            <li> It is gluten free and leaves my skin feeling soft and</li>
            <li> I think I will try the aloe one next time :)</li>
            <li> First thing caught my attention from these products was the Everyone 3 in 1 description.</li>
            <li> This is just a head&#x27;s up in case anyone is interested.</li>
            <li> P.S. If you are interested in this topic please check out The Environmental Working Group online.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to use plenty of water in your hair prior to applying this</li>
            <li> Works very well for just about everything!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been researching natural body care products that are paraben and chemical free.</li>
            <li> It IS time to stop using poison products and start supporting companies that put together healthful products for us to use.</li>
            <li> I have used most scents of this product and my current infatuation is the Coconut and Lemon.</li>
            <li> I lather it on my kiddies, I lather it on myself, and I love that it&#x27;s a big bottle that I can pump.  </li>
            <li> I should have done more research before buying such a large amount of soap.</li>
            <li> It smells very good and seems to clean slightly better than a more expensive (3x&#x27;s more expensive!)</li>
            <li> I ordered this through the subscribe and save program and loved the first bottle I got, but then no more showed up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even slightly exaggerating when I say that this is the best shampoo I have ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li> You can pretty much use for everything, hands, body, and face.</li>
            <li> I had bought this because I was looking for a more natural body wash (since I have sensitive skin) and that didn&#x27;t cost too much.</li>
            <li> Two pumps is enough to lather up for a full body wash plus some!</li>
            <li> I believe it is true that, for all natural soaps, they do not lather as intensely as the chemical based soaps do.  </li>
            <li> I love every single EO product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One bottle (which is quite large) lasts my husband and I about 2 months.  </li>
            <li> Nice that it comes in a large bottle to reduce landfill waste.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle, all purpose body soap.  </li>
            <li> While I find that it lathers plenty alone, the castor oil really helps to quadruple the amount of suds you get.</li>
            <li> The sizes are very generous.</li>
            <li> Purchased at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> but this bodywash is only lightly lemony.</li>
            <li> The cost is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap and have it as a Subscribe and Save item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to use a container like this in the shower, without dispensing too much product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lemon-y.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel very soapy at all.  </li>
            <li> since it&#x27;s sulfate free that&#x27;s a bonus, of course it doesn&#x27;t later up because of that</li>
            <li> But natural or not, I still expected this soap to lather, clean and smell nice, but it falls short in all categories.</li>
            <li> My solution has been to replace the original dispenser with a larger one from another product (you might have to trim the tube&#x27;s length).</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it four stars is I have to use a lot of soap for my hair to get clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old and have had baby fine, pin straight hair and an oily scalp for my entire life.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve switched back to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Unsecented Baby Mild soap, and both of them are much happier.</li>
            <li> It also is a decent bubble bath for a soak.  </li>
            <li> The coconut is not  even remotely discernible because it is so overpowered by the strong lemon smell.</li>
            <li> and then maybe even once in the evening if I had an event that required me to look better than a greasy mess</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and rinses clean, leaving no residue feel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never put my old body wash in my hair, but this stuff is gentle on hair.</li>
            <li> Normally I would have to wash my hair once in the morning (mandatory)</li>
            <li> I need more moisture in my shampoos however if I was going on vacation for a few days</li>
            <li> I like that it is a natural product and the smell is nice but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> For everyday use I prefer it as a body wash, also as a side note I have very sensitive skin that is prone to drying, while this isn&#x27;t the most moisturizing soap</li>
            <li> &gt;  pure and natural - gentle enough for the whole family</li>
            <li> (I use it for my own bath&#x27;s, too, &amp; add a little lavender essential oil.)</li>
            <li> It smells a bit like a cleaning product, but it&#x27;s not super strong or</li>
            <li> but I completely disagree; it is a thin consistency and washes off too easily to be good for shaving.</li>
            <li> This body wash is soft, gentle, and works pretty well as an all natural, body wash for the entire family.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;  gentle and fragrant with ingredients and essential oils that are pure, natural and organic&lt;br</li>
            <li> just be sure to let the shower rinse the shaved leg &amp; floor so the floor isn&#x27;t slick...</li>
            <li> As a bubble bath it makes the water silky, leaves skin soft and not icky.</li>
            <li> This is the bubbliest natural bubble bath we&#x27;ve found for our son!</li>
            <li> I was also hoping this would be sulfate-free since it&#x27;s a natural product, but no dice!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so refreshing to find a company that offers AFFORDABLE chemical-free products that actually work extremely well.</li>
            <li> This bottle is huge and I see it lasting me a long time.  </li>
            <li> Plus EO is a small, local Bay Area company that deserves to be supported in its effort to produce effective, eco-friendly, plant-based products.</li>
            <li> The only positive thing I can say about this soap is that you get a ton of it for the price.</li>
            <li> Lot&#x27;s of women also dig the fresh, subtle, but clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty mild, but I usually prefer something stronger like peppermint, or citrus or even something herbal.</li>
            <li> I also got the same &#x27;flavor&#x27; in large lotion, which my husband and I both like.  </li>
            <li> pure essential oils nurture and soothe the skin</li>
            <li> my new growth / roots is insane right now, which is awesome!</li>
            <li> Love this soap and it can be hard to find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every natural soap and body wash</li>
            <li> ( I have refrained from tasting it so far)</li>
            <li> Everyone in the family uses it including my 13 month old.</li>
            <li> All in all though, as a shower gel and albeit an all natural one at that, it does the job and it does it well.</li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Maybe they fixed the pump over time.  </li>
            <li> The scent is all natural and</li>
            <li> My 9yr old son loves this wash.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with gluten or sensitive skin issues</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because it claims to have natural (non-toxic) ingredients.  </li>
            <li> So, I couldn&#x27;t see this being the best option for someone who is planning to take a lot of bubble baths and use this as the base, like the manufacturer mentions.  </li>
            <li> Usually I would buy shampoos that were &#x27;thickening,&#x27; &#x27;volumizing,&#x27; or &#x27;clarifying&#x27; to help make the most of what I&#x27;m working with, but recently I decided there was no point in going to the trouble to eat vegan / clean if I am going to coat my body and hair with tons of chemicals.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a large bottle, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The price is fantastic due to the amount that you get in the bottle and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I have since found this at Whole Foods locally for a similar price.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with multi use products because my hair is very fine and these types of products tend to weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very dry and has not got a very lemony scent.</li>
            <li> Very concentrated, on pump goes a long way!!!</li>
            <li> Anyway - I definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a natural soap and shampoo, with or without the addition of castor oil.</li>
            <li> you can barely smell anything.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t emulsify as much as some other soaps</li>
            <li> Also the shipment was fast and there was no leaking in the packaging which I can&#x27;t say for other products I ordered from different places.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this only for the bubble bath aspect, so the fact that it doubles as a shampoo &amp; body wash that&#x27;s also cheaper per ounce than other natural ones we&#x27;ve used in the past is just a bonus!</li>
            <li> This soap does the job... can&#x27;t really use it for a shampoo since it seems to make my hair a little dryer than I like it.  </li>
            <li> I have recently changed to gluten free, and found that wheat and other &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; products in soaps can be irritating as well.  </li>
            <li> I am constantly plagued with dry skin and eczema.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t cause any bad reaction so I will purchase it again for sure, and you cant beat the price!  </li>
            <li> The coconut-lemon scent is the most disappointing.</li>
            <li> After several tries I ended up using it as hand soap.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a minor hassle</li>
            <li> My packaged arrive and soap was left open and half spilled out everywhere.</li>
            <li> I am going to have to pour them into other bottles so that I can actually use them.  </li>
            <li> My only criticism is that the pump dispenser is disproportionately small and doesn&#x27;t provide enough gel in a single pump.</li>
            <li> No sodium laureth sulfate to lift up your skin cells and dry you out!</li>
            <li> I would use only this for my body and hair since it would be less for me to pack.  </li>
            <li> Not super resilient bubbles, but it definitely does the job.</li>
            <li> Half the pleasure in showering, for me, is the way I&#x27;m left smelling afterwards.</li>
            <li> only ding I can find in this product is that it&#x27;s pretty difficult to generate a lot of suds aka &amp;#34;bubbles&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Other soaps have left my skin feeling tight and dry.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry but this doesn&#x27;t strip any additional moisture from it and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as dry as with other products.  </li>
            <li> (yes I know the science behind washing it more often making it oilier - unfortunately I don&#x27;t have the luxury of being gross for days at a time to train my scalp otherwise!).</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I live in an area that has very hard water.  </li>
            <li> I am going to try other EO everyone soaps.</li>
            <li> No irritation like other brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll try other &#x27;flavors&#x27; soon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to the fact it&#x27;s SLS/SLES and gluten-free.</li>
            <li> Does make the shower a bit slippery -- be careful!</li>
            <li> No damage done to the other products</li>
            <li> If only they could eliminate all of the chemicals that are not safe to use on your skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hands a little dry.</li>
            <li> Other soaps I have tried I have had to use a lot less.</li>
            <li> The problem with the soap is that it leaves greasy/soapy residue (especially on the head), which is hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> It came already leaking in the packaging twice... just not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit thin, but knowing it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying other scents!</li>
            <li> This product contains Sodium Coco Sulfate which, according to my research (and I may be wrong here), is almost the same thing as SLS or Sodium Laurel  Sulfate, the difference being this is made from a coconut molecule instead of molecules from several oils etc.</li>
            <li> Not true, and this soap is evidence.</li>
            <li> Spout was broken when it arrived and not worth shipping back.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little... chemical.</li>
            <li> Not sure what that other reviewer is talking about?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t smell the coconut, which is somewhat disappointing, but doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li> I lather and rinse twice and my limp hair comes to life.  </li>
            <li> It scores a 3 on the EWG cosmetics database because of toxic ingredients like BENZYL ALCOHOL, POTASSIUM SORBATE, CITRUS MEDICA LIMONUM (LEMON) PEEL OIL, CAMELLIA SINENSIS (GREEN TEA) LEAF EXTRACT, PANTHENOL, and TOCOPHEROL.  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t buy two bars of disgusting Irish Spring or Dove  or any of the garbage soaps full of poison for that price.</li>
            <li> I usually squirt about four pumps into my hand, and then add a few drops of organic castor oil before stirring it up with my finger.  </li>
            <li> With 32oz for ten bucks; you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> grown my hair by about an inch in the past 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the soap and lotion for the past 4 months and just order my second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually try to avoid putting citrus on my face and head</li>
            <li> This product is delicate for me &amp; the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> But mine is being used in an outdoor shower on a farm at least a couple of times a day.  </li>
            <li> Not good in hard water.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and a lotion from the same company and both of them have bad pumps.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little boring to use the same one for months.</li>
            <li> The only annoying part for me is the height and length of the nozzle.</li>
            <li> A lot of soaps and fragrances make this so much worse.  </li>
            <li> Clutter makes me a sad panda.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so faint</li>
            <li> I am usually wary of body wash/shampoo combo&#x27;s, never like the shampoo part, this is an exception.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is a very thin liquid that produces almost no lather.</li>
            <li> My son suffers from skin allergies and since using this product, his eczema has vanished.</li>
            <li> Besides its creamy softening effect on chapped hands, the lemon and coconut oils in this soap eliminate fishy odors as residue on hands and cutting boards, effectively cutting and neutralizing the ammonia-based fishy smell.</li>
            <li> Also, the pump is vey awkward to use.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks!</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed that I lost the soap.</li>
            <li> I hate having a lot of products in our bathroom.  </li>
            <li> You can petition congress to get this crap out of our products.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed that I did not know this before purchasing it.</li>

            <li> Great soap! Will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> Cleanses and foams really good. No nasty chemicals.  Scent is not overpowering and smells nice. Unisex scent.  I can wash my face, body and hair all in one without having 3 different cleansers.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and rinses clean, leaving no residue feel.  I am going to try other EO everyone soaps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every natural soap and body wash and I must say that this is my absolute favorite! I love that I can use it on me and my babies.</li>
            <li> I use this for a body wash, hand soap, and shaving gel.  The scent is light &amp; clean.  It works surprisingly well to shave my neck and head in the shower.  With 32oz for ten bucks; you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Smells great but the pump doesn&#x27;t work well on this. I switch it out with another bottle.  I probably won&#x27;t buy this again because of the pump.</li>
            <li> great stuff.  smells good, right ingredients.  choice item.</li>
            <li> This is an alright shampoo, especially if you need a bulk amount for more than one person to go around. The ingredients could be a little more Barebone natural – good for a trip or somewhere you may have to share shampoo with a number of people.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle, all purpose body soap.  I hate having a lot of products in our bathroom.  Clutter makes me a sad panda.  I was able to replace my body soap, my husband&#x27;s body soap and face wash, and both of our separate shampoos with this one item. I also use it to clean my makeup brushes! Neither of us had any reaction to it, it gets the job done, and it smells amazing.  One bottle (which is quite large) lasts my husband and I about 2 months.  Considering how many things we use it for, that&#x27;s pretty good.  It&#x27;s also a very reasonable price.  We&#x27;ve been using this soap since 2012 and have never had need to look for another.  We buy several at a time and keep them stocked in our closet.  If you can buy a case at a time, some stores will offer a discount.  In a pinch we can always order here on amazon!  It also is a decent bubble bath for a soak.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff smell wonderful  fast delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old and have had baby fine, pin straight hair and an oily scalp for my entire life. Usually I would buy shampoos that were &#x27;thickening,&#x27; &#x27;volumizing,&#x27; or &#x27;clarifying&#x27; to help make the most of what I&#x27;m working with, but recently I decided there was no point in going to the trouble to eat vegan / clean if I am going to coat my body and hair with tons of chemicals.  I&#x27;m not even slightly exaggerating when I say that this is the best shampoo I have ever used, hands down. It leaves my hair feeling SO CLEAN for hours and hours - all day! Normally I would have to wash my hair once in the morning (mandatory) and then maybe even once in the evening if I had an event that required me to look better than a greasy mess (yes I know the science behind washing it more often making it oilier - unfortunately I don&#x27;t have the luxury of being gross for days at a time to train my scalp otherwise!). I&#x27;ve been using this soap to wash my face (which is also oily and acne prone), body, and hair with wonderful results. I usually squirt about four pumps into my hand, and then add a few drops of organic castor oil before stirring it up with my finger.  While I find that it lathers plenty alone, the castor oil really helps to quadruple the amount of suds you get. Plus it&#x27;s a great natural emollient - in addition to enjoying softer hair and skin, it&#x27;s also (and I swear this on my life) grown my hair by about an inch in the past 2 weeks of use. I recently had my hair colored and my new growth / roots is insane right now, which is awesome! Anyway - I definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a natural soap and shampoo, with or without the addition of castor oil.</li>
            <li> Parabens are not for me, so I was delighted when this all-purpose skin and hair product was suggested by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I love the simplicity of this product. It&#x27;s soap! I use two pumps for body wash and three pumps for a bubble bath. It makes so many bubbles when I take baths and makes the water smell heavenly. It lathers up nicely in the shower and I like that it comes with a pump so it is easy to dispense and I don&#x27;t have to use very much of it to get the desired effect I want.&lt;br /&gt;The coconut lemon sent is wonderful and fresh. The citrus really gives this soap a wonderful smell.</li>
            <li> This soap works pretty well and am pretty happy with it functionally. Not the biggest fan of the Lemon-Coconut scent. It&#x27;s pretty mild, but I usually prefer something stronger like peppermint, or citrus or even something herbal. For the money, it&#x27;s a great deal. If you must have a great scent I think you need to upgrade to a Molton Brown or Kiehl&#x27;s type product.</li>
            <li> Smells great!, Leaves my hands a little dry.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?  Light,fresh, lemony scent.  Completely natural - you could eat it - and is just a delightful body cleanser.</li>
            <li> It smells amazingly wonderful. The only reason I give it four stars is I have to use a lot of soap for my hair to get clean. Other soaps I have tried I have had to use a lot less. Maybe it is the water I have? Don&#x27;t know. Other wise an excellent soap!</li>
            <li> Scent is unique. Soap is really great and lathers just enough if you use a loofah. The matching scent lotion is light and non greasy. I also have the lavender set which is just as nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these soaps and lotions would make great gifts too. The sizes are very generous. Purchased at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> great soap, nice smell</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;m gluten free and have skin sensitives. This product is delicate for me &amp; the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering. Also the shipment was fast and there was no leaking in the packaging which I can&#x27;t say for other products I ordered from different places.</li>
            <li> Very concentrated, on pump goes a long way!!! Lasts forever!!!</li>
            <li> This is great-smelling shampoo, bubble bath and body wash all in one at a great price. It is gluten free and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth!&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> Best soap and bubble bath. I love it!</li>
            <li> Awesome, great smell and smooth on skin. Will definitely buy over and over again. You can pretty much use for everything, hands, body, and face. Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my colored treated hair.  It works wonderfully.  It restores the body to my hair and the shine.  I lather and rinse twice and my limp hair comes to life.  I do also use a conditioner after the soap.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap, and it smells amazing!  You can use it as a shampoo, body wash, and bubble bath which is great.  I need more moisture in my shampoos however if I was going on vacation for a few days I would use only this for my body and hair since it would be less for me to pack.  For everyday use I prefer it as a body wash, also as a side note I have very sensitive skin that is prone to drying, while this isn&#x27;t the most moisturizing soap it is very gentle and great for summer or on days my skin isn&#x27;t very dry.  It also doesn&#x27;t cause any bad reaction so I will purchase it again for sure, and you cant beat the price!  I think I will try the aloe one next time :)</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this soap.  Just like it says, I have used it for everything!  From bubble bath to shampoo.  It also smells great!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak about using it as shampoo, but this is a great bubble bath. Not super resilient bubbles, but it definitely does the job. The smell is a little... chemical. It smells a bit like a cleaning product, but it&#x27;s not super strong or pungent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a large bottle, so it lasts a long time. And I haven&#x27;t been able to find any other bubble bath good for sensitive skin that is so cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the sensitive skin note, I&#x27;ve got extremely sensitive skin, and this works out great! No irritation like other brands.</li>
            <li> I never used this product, but my husband did and said that it was too drying.  My toddler also said that it stung his nether regions when he used it.  We&#x27;ve switched back to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Unsecented Baby Mild soap, and both of them are much happier.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a non-toxic soap product. This soap is it. I&#x27;ve purchased several bottles at this point. I let my girls use it as bubble bath, body soap, and shampoo. The smell is light and clean. It doesn&#x27;t have a huge amount of lather. However, it leaves you feeling clean. I was under the mistaken belief that lather was good and necessary. Not true, and this soap is evidence.</li>
            <li> This soap is positively YUMMY!  It lathers well, smells incredible, and leaves you feeling clean and moisturized.  It&#x27;s a great value from a company that is committed to healthy products.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and a lotion from the same company and both of them have bad pumps.  I am going to have to pour them into other bottles so that I can actually use them.  The scents are nice though.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers well, smells great and also a great price for the quantity. I also washed my hair with it. I bought two bottles and I&#x27;m glad I did because my daughter loves it as well.</li>
            <li> love it...will buy again !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a low maintenance kind of gal. First thing caught my attention from these products was the Everyone 3 in 1 description. I&#x27;ve been using the soap and lotion for the past 4 months and just order my second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend these products.</li>
            <li> I had bought this because I was looking for a more natural body wash (since I have sensitive skin) and that didn&#x27;t cost too much. I love it! It is very gentle on my skin and it smells awesome!</li>
            <li> Even the grandaughters love this soap, which smells great and rinses clean. I&#x27;ve even used it as a lubricant to shave my legs....just be sure to let the shower rinse the shaved leg &amp; floor so the floor isn&#x27;t slick...a problem sometimes with any leg shaving lubricant or any liquid shower soap.  I also got the same &#x27;flavor&#x27; in large lotion, which my husband and I both like.  Very good products with what seems to be good ingredient formula.</li>
            <li> I love the formulation of this soap and how it makes my skin feel, but the coconut &amp; lemon combination scent didn&#x27;t work out for me. Fortunately their great customer service credited me the cost of the product without me even having to ship it back. I will order a more &amp;#34;reliable&amp;#34; scent this time. Pleased with the product and and service!</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit thin, but knowing it&#x27;s natural and I&#x27;m helping the environment alleviates any concern there.  I just ensure I have enough on my hands to wash thoroughly.  I&#x27;ve yet to use as a body or hair shampoo, but I&#x27;ve no doubt it would work.  It has a clean smell which I love as I&#x27;m very sensitive to perfumes.  All in all, will order again.</li>
            <li> Too generic for my taste do not like the s end the Lemon does not work well with the coconut smells too medicinal</li>
            <li> Not for Everyone Soap. If you are fair skinned, the type of person who doesn&#x27;t tan, just burns, this soap is not for you. I&#x27;ve used this soap for a month after which I had rashes on my feet, legs, arms and back. I can fairly say &amp;#34; I will never buy this product again&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful and last quite a long time in the 32ounce bottle.  Totally sold on the EO body wash.</li>
            <li> This does lather well, gets your skin clean and smells good. It just doesn&#x27;t smell like their lotion of the same scent like I was hoping for. It&#x27;s so faint you can barely smell anything. I was expecting this to be creamy, but it is kind of clear. I won&#x27;t use this as a shampoo so I can&#x27;t say how that works. My 11 yr old used this in her bath and it did make some bubbles just nothing over the top. I do love that this comes in a 32 oz. bottle with a pump. That always makes showers quick and easy. This is a good product to use along with the lotion, but I probably will not buy again. Glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Spout was broken when it arrived and not worth shipping back. Also not organic or as healthy as I thought once I read the ingredients. I&#x27;ll stick to Dr. Bronners.</li>
            <li> I loved it but I bought it by accident, I was looking for the every men soap (also for shaving) but I used this one for shaving with not bad results/</li>
            <li> Love this soap! Great smell and love that it has multiple uses. I even use it as a hand soap. My boyfriend loves the smell too.</li>
            <li> I usually try to avoid putting citrus on my face and head but this bodywash is only lightly lemony. It doesn&#x27;t emulsify as much as some other soaps so I find i probably use more than I need to but it smells good, doesn&#x27;t leave a gross residue and is definitely great for everyone (and every part of you)</li>
            <li> No sodium laureth sulfate to lift up your skin cells and dry you out! Great lather, nice scent and gets you clean without turning ashy.</li>
            <li> This lathers nicely and smells like a lemon cupcake! At least it does to me anyway---not drying, not oily, this is the perfect body wash. Two pumps is enough to lather up for a full body wash plus some! Looking forward to trying other scents!</li>
            <li> More lemon than coconut. Good liquid soap for the shower.</li>
            <li> My son suffers from skin allergies and since using this product, his eczema has vanished.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, the combination of lemon with coconut keeps it from being too tart or too sweet. ( I have refrained from tasting it so far) Its a gentle soap, and a good shampoo for me. I am usually wary of body wash/shampoo combo&#x27;s, never like the shampoo part, this is an exception. I think you get good value, when I have purchased several times its 32 oz for $10.</li>
            <li> I love the coconut lemon scent! I use this every day and I have a bottle off the hand sanitizer in the car, one in my purse, and one at work!</li>
            <li> This product contains Sodium Coco Sulfate which, according to my research (and I may be wrong here), is almost the same thing as SLS or Sodium Laurel  Sulfate, the difference being this is made from a coconut molecule instead of molecules from several oils etc. However, the toxicity level is thought to be similar and this is dubious at best. I would call it &amp;#34;Greenwashing&amp;#34; as others have. I am very disappointed that I did not know this before purchasing it. I tossed it in the trash and am now making my own body wash. This is just a head&#x27;s up in case anyone is interested. I will buy from my local health food store from now on...and even there read the labels. I guess we just have to keep reading labels. P.S. If you are interested in this topic please check out The Environmental Working Group online. You can petition congress to get this crap out of our products. Best to all.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this sulfate-free product.  It has a light scent, and goes on smoothly and easily.  The cost is reasonable. I will continue to order it in the future.</li>
            <li> This hangs out in the shower and is used by everyone. It&#x27;s a great shampoo and body wash but I haven&#x27;t tried it as a bubble bath...yet! It works great a shampoo as it doesn&#x27;t strip everything too much but it will get your hair clean! Just make sure to use plenty of water in your hair prior to applying this and you will be good to go-it WILL LATHER!!! Same concept for using as a body wash. Love the smell and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, very economical as it&#x27;s a huge bottle...yep, I am keeping this one in stock!!!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for my son to use, but I ended up using it too. I am gluten intolerant and thought I would try it on my hair to see if it would make a difference in the amount of hair I lose in the shower. I had been losing a ton of hair, now the hair fall is practically nonexistent. I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this both as body wash and shampoo.  I love the lemon coconut scent but it doesn&#x27;t linger which is a plus for me.  I have trouble with multi use products because my hair is very fine and these types of products tend to weigh it down.  It doesn&#x27;t happen with this.  My skin is very dry but this doesn&#x27;t strip any additional moisture from it and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as dry as with other products.  I would happily recommend this product and order it again.</li>
            <li> Great body wash for the whole family.  I like the pump bottle and it&#x27;s smells great.  Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My favorite body soap ever. It leaves you skin feeling smooth and smelling so clean. Other soaps have left my skin feeling tight and dry.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap and have it as a Subscribe and Save item. Everyone in the family uses it including my 13 month old. It hasn&#x27;t caused any skin issues and doesn&#x27;t burn his eyes. It smells great, too! Doesn&#x27;t lather a ton and doesn&#x27;t make a ton of bubbles, but that&#x27;s okay. The only annoying part for me is the height and length of the nozzle. Both are too short.</li>
            <li> This soap smells great, is nicely priced, and very practical.  It smells fresh and not overpowering like some soaps.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This soap rocks, it smells good, and it is a good value for a natural based soap. I like it.</li>
            <li> This soap has a wonderful smell. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Omg, love, love, love. I am both a lemon and cocoanut lover. Like the purity and cleanliness of the smells, especially lemon. This does not disappoint. It is a pleasant, cheery good morning to myself when using this. I feel that I have treated myself special.  I use the shower gel and lotion. Still use Dr Bronners, but this is luxurious. Yum.</li>
            <li> I love this as shampoo and body wash, love the clean light scent. I also own the lavender one, which I really like as well, but I will probably start using that one in the colder months. I just love using the tropical scents right now.</li>
            <li> Works very well for just about everything!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality, I think, but the scent is ehh..  It smells more like a dish detergent than what you&#x27;d want your body to smell like. Half the pleasure in showering, for me, is the way I&#x27;m left smelling afterwards.</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of natural ingredients and having shampoo and body wash in one bottle. The problem with the soap is that it leaves greasy/soapy residue (especially on the head), which is hard to wash out. I had a feeling that I want to wash my head again. After several tries I ended up using it as hand soap.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Smells great and is good for you! No nasty ingredients and gluten free for sensitive celiacs, yay!</li>
            <li> This body wash is soft, gentle, and works pretty well as an all natural, body wash for the entire family.  This bottle is huge and I see it lasting me a long time.  It gets the job done and the scent is welcoming to both men and women alike.  I&#x27;m a man for goodness sake and this works fine for me.  Lot&#x27;s of women also dig the fresh, subtle, but clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only ding I can find in this product is that it&#x27;s pretty difficult to generate a lot of suds aka &amp;#34;bubbles&amp;#34;.  So, I couldn&#x27;t see this being the best option for someone who is planning to take a lot of bubble baths and use this as the base, like the manufacturer mentions.  All in all though, as a shower gel and albeit an all natural one at that, it does the job and it does it well.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this as my shampoo people rave about how good my hair smells. I normally use this as just body wash, but it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s shampoo too. I&#x27;d never put my old body wash in my hair, but this stuff is gentle on hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to EVERYTHING so I can&#x27;t sing the praises of this product enough! It smells great, I have no reaction to it, and it&#x27;s nice and hydrating. It has a great lather and I use it as a body wash, and have used it on occasion as shampoo in a pinch. So glad I was introduced to this product!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, not perfumed. As a bubble bath it makes the water silky, leaves skin soft and not icky. As a shampoo it&#x27;s not bad. As a shower gel it&#x27;s dandy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try other &#x27;flavors&#x27; soon.</li>
            <li> Is lasting me forever!  A little goes a long way.  Smell is amazing.  Love this product</li>
            <li> I love this product. You can use it as a hand soap or body wash. It lasts forever, especially if you use a bath puff for showering. The fragrance is pretty strong, but really pleasant. And the container is perfect for both uses. It&#x27;s much easier to use a container like this in the shower, without dispensing too much product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking to buy another one, but I will try a different fragrance. It&#x27;s a little boring to use the same one for months. I have researched many similar products and this seems to be the best deal. And the ingredients are ok too. No harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Good to keep in the kitchen for general purpose hand washing. Besides its creamy softening effect on chapped hands, the lemon and coconut oils in this soap eliminate fishy odors as residue on hands and cutting boards, effectively cutting and neutralizing the ammonia-based fishy smell. Plus EO is a small, local Bay Area company that deserves to be supported in its effort to produce effective, eco-friendly, plant-based products.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap based on all the positive reviews, and the interesting combination of scents. The only positive thing I can say about this soap is that you get a ton of it for the price. Unfortunately, it is a very thin liquid that produces almost no lather. I don&#x27;t see where it has any significant cleaning properties at all, and would never use this as a shampoo (although the label suggests you can). The coconut-lemon scent is the most disappointing. The coconut is not  even remotely discernible because it is so overpowered by the strong lemon smell. I feel like I&#x27;m bathing with dishwashing liquid. I&#x27;ll accept that this is an all-natural product, whatever that means, but the ingredients label reads like the contents of a chemistry set. But natural or not, I still expected this soap to lather, clean and smell nice, but it falls short in all categories.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing, I read about the pump not working on the bottle.  I also read about the soap not lathering.  I have to say, I did not find any of that to be true or accurate with my soap.  Maybe they fixed the pump over time.  I don&#x27;t know.  But mine is being used in an outdoor shower on a farm at least a couple of times a day.  And it&#x27;s working fine.  I believe it is true that, for all natural soaps, they do not lather as intensely as the chemical based soaps do.  But the lather on this soap is quite good too.  Here&#x27;s the point -- if you&#x27;re looking for a good, natural, well-priced soap that is eco-safe, this is an excellent product.  I plan to order more soon!</li>
            <li> This is the bubbliest natural bubble bath we&#x27;ve found for our son! (I use it for my own bath&#x27;s, too, &amp; add a little lavender essential oil.) I originally ordered this only for the bubble bath aspect, so the fact that it doubles as a shampoo &amp; body wash that&#x27;s also cheaper per ounce than other natural ones we&#x27;ve used in the past is just a bonus! It&#x27;s very lemon-y. Like a lemon rind. I can&#x27;t smell the coconut, which is somewhat disappointing, but doesn&#x27;t really bother me. Lemon&#x27;s fine, and it&#x27;s a light smell. It doesn&#x27;t linger. I keep reordering this bubble bath, because for the price per ounce as far as natural products go this really is the best!</li>
            <li> This soap does the job... can&#x27;t really use it for a shampoo since it seems to make my hair a little dryer than I like it.  I&#x27;ll use up this bottle and probably go back to Dr. Bronners.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel very soapy at all.  Not good in hard water.</li>
            <li> Not worth it. It came already leaking in the packaging twice... just not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> My packaged arrive and soap was left open and half spilled out everywhere. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to the fact it&#x27;s SLS/SLES and gluten-free. Not only that, but it&#x27;s three times cheaper than what I purchase at the local shops. It smells great, too!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing price for a premium product. The scent is all natural and oh, so good.  I have one in every shower/bath in my house.  Thank you EO!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been researching natural body care products that are paraben and chemical free. This lotion is amazing! It smells fantastic and moisturizes beautifully! I love every single EO product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so refreshing to find a company that offers AFFORDABLE chemical-free products that actually work extremely well. Thanks EO Products!!!!</li>
            <li> I like that it is a natural product and the smell is nice but not overwhelming.  Nice that it comes in a large bottle to reduce landfill waste.</li>
            <li> Dislike. Doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut at all - only smells lemony, which I don&#x27;t like since it reminds me of bathroom cleaner. A lot of people were saying that it&#x27;s good to shave with but I completely disagree; it is a thin consistency and washes off too easily to be good for shaving. Doesn&#x27;t feel moisturizing at all. I was also hoping this would be sulfate-free since it&#x27;s a natural product, but no dice! I should have done more research before buying such a large amount of soap. I will be trying to pawn this off on my boyfriend, or holding onto it to wash my dog should I ever get one....</li>
            <li> this stuff is great...I use it to wash my hair and body. I also use it on my kids. I like that it doesn&#x27;t contain a bunch of junk for ingredients. good price for the size.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks! It leaves my skin very dry and has not got a very lemony scent. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is so nice smelling, yet gentle. Perfect for the entire family. Loved it so much I bought for everyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good price, but the product itself smells almost a little industrial. Also, the pump is vey awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Love this eco friendly soap.  I used this &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34; originally and then tried the  lilac one.  I prefer this one.  Cleans my mansuit well and leaves me smelling like lemons.</li>
            <li> Like this shower gel better than the Brommer&#x27;s since it doesn&#x27;t burn if it splashes on my face or eyes. Does make the shower a bit slippery -- be careful! Pleasant scent -- not like suntan lotion.</li>
            <li> love this soap.  great smell.  great consistency.  wish it lathered a little more but still awesome.</li>
            <li> Gentle and healthy soap for the whole family.. It&#x27;s great for the little kids without all the chemicals. Light scent.. We do actual use it on face, hair and body.,,we continue to buy it..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been searching for an inexpensive body soap for my household of five. Finally I have found it in EO&#x27;s products. It smells very good and seems to clean slightly better than a more expensive (3x&#x27;s more expensive!) soap we were using.</li>
            <li> I live in an area that has very hard water.  I am constantly plagued with dry skin and eczema.  A lot of soaps and fragrances make this so much worse.  I have recently changed to gluten free, and found that wheat and other &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; products in soaps can be irritating as well.  I have used this EO Everyone soap for about 2 weeks now, as a head to toe shower soap.  My hair is happy, and my dry itchy skin is SO much better.</li>
            <li> I am taking the time to post the ingredients to this soap for your reading pleasure. This is one of the best soaps on the market and it is all natural. There are no garbage ingredients or poisons that the big manufacturers put in their products. Remember, your skin is a sponge and anything that you put on it is absorbed into your blood stream. It IS time to stop using poison products and start supporting companies that put together healthful products for us to use. The price is fantastic due to the amount that you get in the bottle and how long it lasts. I have calculated it to be about $ 3.00 dollars per month. you can&#x27;t buy two bars of disgusting Irish Spring or Dove  or any of the garbage soaps full of poison for that price. Here are a list of ingredients. I have used most scents of this product and my current infatuation is the Coconut and Lemon. The scent just makes you smile because it is so clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  3 in 1: shampoo, body wash, bath - perfect for a cleansing shampoo, invigorating shower and a fragrant, luxurious, bath&lt;br /&gt;  pure and natural - gentle enough for the whole family&lt;br /&gt;  for the informed, practical, value-conscious consumer&lt;br /&gt;  pure essential oils nurture and soothe the skin&lt;br /&gt;  gentle and fragrant with ingredients and essential oils that are pure, natural and organic&lt;br /&gt;  cruelty free, paraben free, polysorbate free, disodium EDTA free, gluten free, non-GMO verified, sodium laureth/lauryl sulfate free.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients found in this product:&lt;br /&gt;Purified Water, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Sodium Coco-Sulfate, Caprylyl/Capryl Glucoside, Sodium Chloride, Coco-Glucoside, Panthenol, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel Oil, Organic Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Extract, EO Organic Herbal Blend [Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf, Organic Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Organic Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract, and Organic Camelia Sinensis Leaf Extract], Citric Acid, Sodium Phytate, Phenoxyethanol, Benzyl Alcohol, Potassium Sorbate, Tocopherolassium Sorbate, Tocopherol</li>
            <li> I love this product- but use it for a hand soap or bubble bath or bath gel. As a shampoo, it&#x27;s better for men. I think we women get used to really great products for our hair and this one dries my hair too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I put one in the kids bathroom and they love it! Scent is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap - does it all - love it</li>
            <li> I am picky about shampoo.  I need something inexpensive and that works great.  This fits the bill.  And it smells wonderful.  This agrees with my hair, even when I shampoo often.  (I know you are not supposed to do that, but I like the feel of very clean hair.)</li>
            <li> I like the product, it has a good scent and lathers well.  However it was shipped in the same box with a 25 pound bag of corn meal and the plastic bottle was smashed. The soap had lost about a third of the bottle into the plastic it was wrapped in.  No damage done to the other products but I was disappointed that I lost the soap.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing &amp; fresh, lathers really well, &amp; the ingredients are safe for all! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Nice, soft feeling skin and really good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  My 9yr old son loves this wash.  It is lemony and beachy and wakes us up every morning that we use it.  I lather it on my kiddies, I lather it on myself, and I love that it&#x27;s a big bottle that I can pump.  We will use it again and again for daily use.</li>
            <li> This is a really great gluten free product that is very gentle on the skin I love it I would recommend this to anyone with gluten or sensitive skin issues</li>
            <li> This EO shower gel is delightful! The scent is SO heavenly and the lather is rich and creamy. Makes getting clean every morning an indulgence. This jumbo size lasts for months with two of us using it. My only criticism is that the pump dispenser is disproportionately small and doesn&#x27;t provide enough gel in a single pump. My solution has been to replace the original dispenser with a larger one from another product (you might have to trim the tube&#x27;s length). That&#x27;s a minor hassle but well worth it for this otherwise super product. Sometimes I switch it up and use EO Soap&#x27;s more &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scented cucumber/lemon version. It&#x27;s great too.</li>
            <li> The soap smells great, has good ingredients but leaves a heavy film after rinsing off. As a matter of fact, we stopped using it in the shower because it makes the floor of the shower so slippery. I guess that&#x27;s the weakness of trying to do too many things with one product.</li>
            <li> Smells like lemons, not like moth balls? Not sure what that other reviewer is talking about?</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because it claims to have natural (non-toxic) ingredients.  It scores a 3 on the EWG cosmetics database because of toxic ingredients like BENZYL ALCOHOL, POTASSIUM SORBATE, CITRUS MEDICA LIMONUM (LEMON) PEEL OIL, CAMELLIA SINENSIS (GREEN TEA) LEAF EXTRACT, PANTHENOL, and TOCOPHEROL.  I love the scent and that it doesn&#x27;t leave a weird sticky feeling to your skin like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  I will continue to use it, but I don&#x27;t know if I will be purchasing it again.  If only they could eliminate all of the chemicals that are not safe to use on your skin.</li>
            <li> Love this soap and it can be hard to find.</li>
            <li> This soap smells so nice, is affordable and has a matching scented lotion. I love it and will order it again.</li>
            <li> Would like more lather, but otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Not a bad cleanser, and since it&#x27;s sulfate free that&#x27;s a bonus, of course it doesn&#x27;t later up because of that but it&#x27;s a nice mild smell and gente</li>
            <li> I ordered this through the subscribe and save program and loved the first bottle I got, but then no more showed up.  I went to my account info and found out it was no longer available.  I have since found this at Whole Foods locally for a similar price.</li>
            <li> Great organic body wash and the lemon coconut scent is AMAZING!</li>
