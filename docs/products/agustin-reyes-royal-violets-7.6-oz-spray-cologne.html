            <li> Love it!  This brings back so many fond memories from when I was a little girl!  My mother used to rub it on us (no spray bottle back then)  immediately after our baths.  I spray it on my daughters AND on mattresses, pillow cases, sheets, curtains, closetsâ€¦I use it anywhere I want a  nice, soft, subtle yet pretty essence.  The spray bottles are new and fantastic - make everything easier.</li>
            <li> Everything was excellent...the delivery was on time.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne because is was spray (I have the splash on one) and I was delightfully surprised that is was a plastic bottle. After the first initial spray it no longer smelled liked the delicate light floral scent that the glass bottle has. I am disappointed. I would not even use this as room freshener and will be returning it. I believe that the plastic bottle has interfered with the smell of the cologne.</li>
            <li> I love this wonderful fragance, highly recommendable.</li>
            <li> My best friend in childhood and adulthood is Cuban and her mom use to use this on her little brother then we started using it in our teenage years and I used it on my children.  Now I use it on myself with Johnson&#x27;s bedtime lotion and I love the smell and I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> This was mentioned by a celebrity in a magazine article recently read.  I am very disappointed in the fragrance. Perhaps I will try again from a different seller, but this one smells like cheap perfume with a heavy alcohol base, very little fragrance, and not like violets.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy smells really bad.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of innocence and a happy childhood. My mom used this on me when I was a baby, and now I use it every day as an adult. It has a pleasant violet smell. A little bit goes a long way, I don&#x27;t put more than a bit on my hair and wrists because though it is wonderful, too much is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Great produce, it can in sooner than expected. My grand daughter love the cologne and is very pleased that it&#x27;s in a spray.</li>
            <li> This is a staple at my house for babies. I love the soft smell of this baby cologne so much, I use it for myself as well. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> perfume smells good and smells sweet and you can spray on after you bathe. i recommend to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> smells the same as when I was a baby!</li>
            <li> Love this beautiful perfume for my granddaughter.  It reminds me of growing up Cuban. The most perfect Violet scent there is for children!</li>
            <li> Nice scent. Lasts about 30 minutes. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Smells like a warm hug!!!</li>
            <li> I grew up on this cologne. My mom used it for me as a baby and I used it for my children. My children are teenagers and still use it.  I&#x27;m so glad amazon has this product.</li>
            <li> Ever since my friend told me this is what she wore all the time and I smelled it, I was obsessed. If this ever went out of sale I would be incredibly sad.</li>
            <li> Spray comes out the sides and bottom of top and smells more like a household cleaner than a colonge. I would not reccomend</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for the last few generations on babies. Smells delicious!</li>
