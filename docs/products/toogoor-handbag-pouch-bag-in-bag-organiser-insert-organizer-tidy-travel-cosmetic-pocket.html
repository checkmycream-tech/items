            <li>She said it made it easy to access whatever she was looking for without having to take it all out of the bag in the hotel, so she had no concerns of losing anything as we traveled to different places.</li>
            <li>I recommend this item for medium to large bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since my bag is large, the organizer tends to fall on its side.</li>

            <li> And they open up quite wide</li>

            <li> my longchamp bags are always a mess because it has absolutely no compartments.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I needed something inexpensive for my bathroom counter, to keep all the little things I use each morning.</li>
            <li> I have in this past month.</li>
            <li> BUT I am disappointed that within a few days the pulls were unraveling (I did clip them) and just recently one of the plastics snaps on the side just broke.</li>
            <li> Poorly sewn, poorly made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that the handle was shoddily affixed to the fabric.</li>
            <li> (I put a drop of crazy glue at end to prevent threads from coming out further).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had it only a short time and the a seam broke out. Feel the bottom should have a form in it.</li>
            <li> I have had this for over a month now and I like it.  It is holding up.  The price is great. I don&#x27;t see it lasting years but you get your money&#x27;s worth out of it. I have in this past month.</li>
            <li> This organizer is very helpful. Everything was getting lost in my suitcase of a purse, that had no interior pockets. Love this!</li>
            <li> What this item is meant to do it does. The only thing I will say is be carefull when u pack it full and go to lift it by the handles they could break.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery  and love product</li>
            <li> I have two of these, one for my purse and the other in the center console of my car. This has transformed my life. No more digging in the bottom of my purse for key or cell phone. Everything has it&#x27;s own space and I can find things in a snap. I like to switch purses and this makes that a snap. The one in my car organizes all my cords, pens, tissues and all the other essentials I keep in my car. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very well made. I love it!!</li>
            <li> Love it but wish it was bigger. Anyone know where there is a bigger one?</li>
            <li> Got the blue and grey pouch.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in time and came wrapped in plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;It is as advertised, has many pockets where I could put all my items and they fit into my bag. I recommend this item for medium to large bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must mention the following manufacturing/quality misses: one of the two the cloth handles came loose (it was not sewn to pouch) and the zip puller tab-which is the same material as handles-, came with tread ends frizzing out, the material was simply cut out (I put a drop of crazy glue at end to prevent threads from coming out further).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a purse organizer I would I would recommend but there is room for improvement in the finishing quality.</li>
            <li> It broke after a month of use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 3 so far. One for me and two for gifts for purses that I made. They are so helpful although I need to declutter mine right now. They hold a lot and my purse even has room for my eyeglass case next to it. It is so easy to stay organized with this, but hard to me! I purchased these after comparing to some other brands including Pursfection&#x27;s one and decided for the money this was a win! I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. They are sturdy and very well made. And they open up quite wide so lots of stuff fits! Enjoy it you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I needed something inexpensive for my bathroom counter, to keep all the little things I use each morning. This pouch works great! We took a little weekend getaway a few weeks ago, and it was nice to just pick this up and stick it in my travel bag. I already knew I had everything I needed. It&#x27;s lightweight, has lots of different pockets, zippers and snaps to use it the way you want to. The handles came in nice for travel, but for daily use, I just tuck them in so they&#x27;re not in my way. I would definitely buy this product again, and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea for a gift or for your own use</li>
            <li> Works great in big purses to organize and easy to slip into another purse if you want to change purses.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Exactly what was needed!</li>
            <li> It is Cute, functional,  I put it in my work bag to organize the little things yhat fall to the bottom.</li>
            <li> With all those compartments my wife found it easy to store, jewelry, make up, passports, pens, phones, and medications. She said it made it easy to access whatever she was looking for without having to take it all out of the bag in the hotel, so she had no concerns of losing anything as we traveled to different places.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the make up</li>
            <li> Fell apart the first day.</li>
            <li> Just I was looking for  Very pleased</li>
            <li> my longchamp bags are always a mess because it has absolutely no compartments. This solves the problem. Now my shoulder bags are all well organized. When i switch between purses, this makes it a breeze. just pick it up from one purse and drop in the other. No need to worry about forgetting stuff during the transfer any more.</li>
            <li> can handle a lot of stuff at your finger tips.</li>
            <li> Love it. I now can find anything and everything. Total awesome I just don&#x27;t know how I made it without all these years</li>
            <li> Very nice, exactly as pictured</li>
            <li> Very useful for travel and/or everyday in car.</li>
            <li> If I could give a zero I would! I received the bag and was starting to put some of my basic essentials on it like lip gloss and my brush but when I lifted it the handle just broke apart. Poorly sewn, poorly made.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, as described by Amazon &amp; manufacturer, it was shipped on time, arrived within prescribed estimates, the packaging was undamaged, and the product itself was unmolested and made with quality materials.  My wife is using it and so far, she has no complaints regarding functionality, durability or its ability to accommodate all of her pursing needs.</li>
            <li> the organizer is awesome.  I  using it for my computer extras and it is a great purchase.so glad I bought it</li>
            <li> Nice way to have your purse organized! Love the color!! Bought on july 2014 and still works perfect. No damage! Super nice and cheap!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product. Much better quality then I expected.  It&#x27;s very roomy.  I change pocketbooks a lot and it has made it easier. It&#x27;s designed for larger bags.</li>
            <li> This is handy for women who change out purses frequently.</li>
            <li> This bag is soft sided and doesn&#x27;t keep its shape.</li>
            <li> Love the organizers.  I use them often.</li>
            <li> I purchased three...two of which the stitching did not cover the mesh and left a &amp;#34;hole&amp;#34;.  The concept is great, would probably look for a product with a different material.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and my mother and we really love it.  Very durable, it fits in my purses and great pockets and zippered areas for all of my necessities.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it will be very efficient when I travel.</li>
            <li> I love the size of the organizer and it fits in all of my purses. I like all the pockets BUT I am disappointed that within a few days the pulls were unraveling (I did clip them) and just recently one of the plastics snaps on the side just broke. Basically you pay for what you get.</li>
            <li> Very well put together, I love being able to switch purses so easily by keeping all my important stuff in here.</li>
            <li> It is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> although this was a little smaller than I had hoped for, it fit into my Coach bag perfectly and was a great solution to the space that was becoming a &#x27;catch all&#x27;&#x27; now it&#x27;s nicely organized.</li>
            <li> After the first time using one of the handle came loose. Also the stitching around the sides were not done properly. Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great love this item! Will use for many different things thing from cosmetics to tolietries.</li>
            <li> Keeps all my stuff organized and easy to find. Since my bag is large, the organizer tends to fall on its side.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> it works ok for my larger purses..i was going to try to velcro it to the inside of a purse I use often..so it doesn&#x27;t move around whn I stick my hand in looking for something.</li>
            <li> The handle on the bag organizer broke as soon as I lifted it up with items in it.  I&#x27;m disappointed that the handle was shoddily affixed to the fabric.</li>
            <li> light weight &amp; convenient pockets</li>
