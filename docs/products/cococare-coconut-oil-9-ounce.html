            <li> It evaporates slowly, allowing for very long and sensual body rubs.</li>
            <li> The oil could be a little thicker or substantive.</li>
            <li> Its just a little thin especially for winter moisturizing.</li>
            <li> IF I USE IT EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too thin yo hold up.</li>
            <li> and I have been using cold pressed coconut oil for some time.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t even use it because it smelled terrible.</li>

            <li> The product has 3 ingredients; Mineral oil, Coconut oil, and Fragrance.  I am not 100% positive what Mineral Oil is, but everything I have read about it is rather negative.</li>

            <li> This is a great product for massaging your girlfriend. It evaporates slowly, allowing for very long and sensual body rubs. No problem getting it all over her lady parts. And if your tongue later finds the same bits of skin, the mild taste is enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Bought this, used it twice, been sitting in the back of the cupboard since. Didn&#x27;t work on my skin at all. I&#x27;ll just stick to my regular coconut oil.</li>
