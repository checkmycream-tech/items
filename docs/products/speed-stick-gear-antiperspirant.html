    <ol>
            <li>Perfect amount of control</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT, PACKAGED WELL AND SPEEDY SHIPMENT.  </li>
            <li>The scent is great and it does do what it advertises.</li>
            <li>they all said made them smell like a tree lol</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>He is very happy with this Speed Stick brand (his first experience with Speed Stick gels).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on smoothly and leaves no residue on my clothing, which is great.  </li>
            <li>THIS SPEED STICK GEAR GEL DEODERANT IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST DEODERANT</li>
            <li>I have used this for several days and it seems to do a good job of covering up my wonderful odor when I sweat.  </li>
            <li>product works great for them and mom loves it *)</li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s favorite :-)</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s quite a stretch since most of us shower once a day</li>
            <li>This is actually a really great product much to my surprise.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is labeled as a gel, but is more liquidy than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Fresh Force is more like a lemon/lime kind of scent i think</li>
            <li>It has a nice, mild scent that is not too strong.</li>
            <li>Overall good product at covering up my stink!</li>
            <li>Great for him, keeps him fit and busy, but I ended up with the stinky end of the deal when he rides home from work every day.  </li>
            <li>So while his dri-fit top and pants keep that sweat off him, this deodorent does a great job of making my breathing a bit easier, especially in Summer.</li>
            <li>Very good product that keeps me dry and  </li>
            <li>It lasts for a long time and i have been satisfying with it!! :)</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s cheap and I never noticed it not working, so there you go.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is so overwhelming (what is Fresh Force?)</li>
            <li>I received this product as a free trial through Influenster.</li>
            <li>: I don&#x27;t get free stuff or anything like that for posting glowing reviews on Amazon (we&#x27;ve all seen those).</li>
            <li>The scent is quite strong but pleasant - I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a lemon scent, similar to what you&#x27;d find in some dishwashing</li>
            <li>It appears that gel deodorants can react with perspiration, creating something that&#x27;s not fabric color friendly.</li>
            <li>I tend to sweat a lot under my pits without deodorant, and the quality of protection this stuff provides with just a small amount is impressive.</li>
            <li>We have tried both the Fresh Force and Clean Peak in our house&lt;br</li>
            <li>I HAVE EVER USED, SMELLS GOOD AND HOLDS ME ALL DAY LONG...</li>
            <li>Speed Stick does make a different line of deodorant that does not have aluminum, and is excellent with wetness protection and great all day scent, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with that product for the past several months.</li>
            <li>Close examination of the insides of the shirts also revealed discoloration in the &amp;#34;pit&amp;#34; areas that hadn&#x27;t bled through to the outside of the shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried soaking the shirts in warm water with aspirin and washing in vinegar, but the stains are permanent.</li>
            <li>I would give it five stars if it were made with more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>fresh smelling for over 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Smells good and it does help me perspire less under my arms.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell, but does not clash with other fragrances you may wear.</li>
            <li>I reviewed this for Influenster.com and found it to have a pleasant long lasting scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just a dude who decided to get this as a part of my S&amp;S shipment once and wanted to share my positive experience with everyone.</li>
            <li>There really is a lot to love about this deodorant (and I&#x27;ve yet to find a single thing not to like).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean Peak is a little too strong yet for the teenagers</li>
            <li>far everyone much prefers the Fresh Force scent</li>
            <li>(so far, no co workers have said anything to me during meetings, which to me is a sign of success).  </li>
            <li>I really appreciated the lack of residue as well.</li>
            <li>thanks to the level of control you</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had zero \\&quot;breaches\\&quot; and my pits actually feel cool throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>packaging is standard for deodorants and is easy to open.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who was in search of a new deodorant.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell of this speed stick and the easy glide on formula, sadly though, it has Aluminum Zirconium which when mixed with sweat can cause permanent staining in the underarms of shirts/tops.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to a new personal trainer, I now work out about 2-3x a week before going to work - I&#x27;ve become dependent on the &amp;#34;Fresh Force&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s great, but I&#x27;m not that crazy about some of the chemicals listed - C12-15</li>
            <li>My husband clearly hit the midlife crisis age and promptly bought a $3000 bicycle.  </li>
            <li>after a long day of playing basketball with friends on a hot summer day</li>
            <li>a bit of getting used to since do not need to use nearly as much&lt;br /&gt;as</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t feel sticky on his underarm hair, leaves no stains on his clothes, and keeps him dry and odor free all day long.</li>
            <li>Originally, I thought the stains were from bleach, but noticed the damage immediately after putting on a custom silk-screened T-Shirt that I had never worn around harsh cleaners.</li>
            <li>The Fresh Force scent blends well with his other products.</li>
            <li>So having one of these delivered to my house (with my other S&amp;S items) AND paying less for a better stick than anything Wal-Mart carries?</li>
            <li>some of the other kinds they have used before so had to remind them of this *)</li>
            <li>No excessive residue if you use just enough to cover your pit (which you can,</li>
            <li>/&gt;1.) Not only are you able to lift up as much or as little as you want from the holes, but you can also retract it back down if you accidentally lift too much up.</li>
            <li>A single application is definitely enough to last a full 24 hours without having to use any extra amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.)</li>
            <li>My husband is not picky when it comes to his deodorants, he just prefers the gels over the solids but is not partial to any one brand.</li>
            <li>However once I tried it I was pleasantly surprised that I did stay dry during my workouts.</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s at least dry in those armpits (in fact, this keeps him drier than the &#x27;dri fit&#x27;</li>
            <li>I buy diapers for my kid with S&amp;S and sometimes I have trouble deciding what other 4 items we need to take advantage of the full 15% discount.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It does its job and smells nice, but took a little too long to dry with me, which made me wait a little longer than usual to change my shirt in the morning.</li>
            <li> The scent seemed to last a long time.</li>
            <li> You have to wait for it to dry before you put your shirt on.</li>
            <li> Overall, it worked well but having to wait for it to dry was kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> At the time of this review, the price for a single unit of this coupled with the fact that it&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save eligible makes it a no-brainer.</li>
            <li> I like the wet feel for deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I must say at first I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> 48 hour protection seems extreme.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t commented about the performance of the product since the damage it caused made it not worth</li>
            <li> cut down offensive odors when i have to do their laundry&lt;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat alot, but when I do, I need to know my deodorant won&#x27;t destroy my clothes.  </li>
            <li> The shirts were well laundered and past the point of bleeding dye, so it wasn&#x27;t a new-shirt</li>
            <li> I hardly felt any sweat and the scent lasts.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that has hard workout routines and has issues with sweating.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s unlikely that we would need a deodorant that lasts that long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t stink like sweat (as bad - can&#x27;t help the sweat from the rest of the body)</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat alot, but when I do, I need to know my deodorant won&#x27;t destroy my clothes.

Very disappointed in this product.  Speed Stick does make a different line of deodorant that does not have aluminum, and is excellent with wetness protection and great all day scent, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with that product for the past several months.</li>
            <li> This is my staple gel deodorant.  I like the wet feel for deodorant.  Nice smell, but does not clash with other fragrances you may wear.</li>
            <li> It does its job and smells nice, but took a little too long to dry with me, which made me wait a little longer than usual to change my shirt in the morning. But it&#x27;s cheap and I never noticed it not working, so there you go.</li>
            <li> Decent Antiperspirant, but overall pretty expensive for the size.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think just because this gel is &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34; that it won&#x27;t stain your clothing! I ruined four color cotton T-Shirts before I realized it was this deodorant. The shirts were well laundered and past the point of bleeding dye, so it wasn&#x27;t a new-shirt issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the mistake of applying before putting the shirts on. The areas of the shirt that made contact with the anti-antiperspirant while I was putting them on became permanently discolored. Originally, I thought the stains were from bleach, but noticed the damage immediately after putting on a custom silk-screened T-Shirt that I had never worn around harsh cleaners. Close examination of the insides of the shirts also revealed discoloration in the &amp;#34;pit&amp;#34; areas that hadn&#x27;t bled through to the outside of the shirts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried soaking the shirts in warm water with aspirin and washing in vinegar, but the stains are permanent. It appears that gel deodorants can react with perspiration, creating something that&#x27;s not fabric color friendly. Perhaps Colgate should put a warning on the product advising &amp;#34;Test on an inconspicuous area of garment prior to using&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t commented about the performance of the product since the damage it caused made it not worth using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From now on, I&#x27;m sticking with solid sticks!!!</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s favorite :-)</li>
            <li> I was intrigued by this antiperspirant deodorant because it claims to last 48hours. That&#x27;s quite a stretch since most of us shower once a day and it&#x27;s unlikely that we would need a deodorant that lasts that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is standard for deodorants and is easy to open. Based on my testing, it lasted from 8 a.m. to when I showered at night. Thanks to a new personal trainer, I now work out about 2-3x a week before going to work - I&#x27;ve become dependent on the &amp;#34;Fresh Force&amp;#34; speed stick for peace of mind (so far, no co workers have said anything to me during meetings, which to me is a sign of success).  The scent is quite strong but pleasant - I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a lemon scent, similar to what you&#x27;d find in some dishwashing liquids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly and leaves no residue on my clothing, which is great.  For the price, it&#x27;s great, but I&#x27;m not that crazy about some of the chemicals listed - C12-15 alkyl benzoate, cyclomethicone, PEG-8 distearate.  Look these up and you&#x27;ll see what I mean. I would give it five stars if it were made with more natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Very good product that keeps me dry and  fresh smelling for over 24 hours.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time and i have been satisfying with it!! :)</li>
            <li> My husband is not picky when it comes to his deodorants, he just prefers the gels over the solids but is not partial to any one brand. He is very happy with this Speed Stick brand (his first experience with Speed Stick gels). It didn&#x27;t feel sticky on his underarm hair, leaves no stains on his clothes, and keeps him dry and odor free all day long. That is saying something because he works in restaurants. The Fresh Force scent blends well with his other products.</li>
            <li> Keeps me odor-free far longer than the other versions of speed stick.</li>
            <li> I reviewed this for Influenster.com and found it to have a pleasant long lasting scent. My wife definitely approved of it.</li>
            <li> THIS SPEED STICK GEAR GEL DEODERANT IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST DEODERANT I HAVE EVER USED, SMELLS GOOD AND HOLDS ME ALL DAY LONG...</li>
            <li> My husband clearly hit the midlife crisis age and promptly bought a $3000 bicycle.  Great for him, keeps him fit and busy, but I ended up with the stinky end of the deal when he rides home from work every day.  So while his dri-fit top and pants keep that sweat off him, this deodorent does a great job of making my breathing a bit easier, especially in Summer. He doesn&#x27;t stink like sweat (as bad - can&#x27;t help the sweat from the rest of the body) and he&#x27;s at least dry in those armpits (in fact, this keeps him drier than the &#x27;dri fit&#x27; clothing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not cloying or overpowering, so it gets a big thumbs up for me. And heck, I&#x27;d rather he bought the bicycle and used this Speed Stick than running out and having an affair with his secretary instead.</li>
            <li> Get the job done well</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, PACKAGED WELL AND SPEEDY SHIPMENT.  THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is so overwhelming (what is Fresh Force?) that I can&#x27;t put enough on to overcome body odor and still breathe. I would rather breathe and stink than die odorless. I&#x27;m throwing it out.</li>
            <li> This is actually a really great product much to my surprise. The scent is great and it does do what it advertises. I hardly felt any sweat and the scent lasts. I really appreciated the lack of residue as well. I would recommend this to anyone who was in search of a new deodorant.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a free trial through Influenster. I must say at first I was skeptical. 48 hour protection seems extreme. However once I tried it I was pleasantly surprised that I did stay dry during my workouts. I would recommend this product to anyone that has hard workout routines and has issues with sweating. It does keep you dryer longer.</li>
            <li> We have tried both the Fresh Force and Clean Peak in our house&lt;br /&gt;so far everyone much prefers the Fresh Force scent&lt;br /&gt;the Clean Peak is a little too strong yet for the teenagers&lt;br /&gt;and they all said made them smell like a tree lol&lt;br /&gt;the Fresh Force is more like a lemon/lime kind of scent i think&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product works great for them and mom loves it *)&lt;br /&gt;helps cut down offensive odors when i have to do their laundry&lt;br /&gt;especially after a long day of playing basketball with friends on a hot summer day&lt;br /&gt;who knew teenage boys could be so smelly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;took a bit of getting used to since do not need to use nearly as much&lt;br /&gt;as some of the other kinds they have used before so had to remind them of this *)</li>
            <li> This deodorant is labeled as a gel, but is more liquidy than I thought it would be. You have to wait for it to dry before you put your shirt on. It has a nice, mild scent that is not too strong. The scent seemed to last a long time. Overall, it worked well but having to wait for it to dry was kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> There really is a lot to love about this deodorant (and I&#x27;ve yet to find a single thing not to like).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Not only are you able to lift up as much or as little as you want from the holes, but you can also retract it back down if you accidentally lift too much up. Perfect amount of control so you use just the amount you need every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) No excessive residue if you use just enough to cover your pit (which you can, thanks to the level of control you have)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) A single application is definitely enough to last a full 24 hours without having to use any extra amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) I tend to sweat a lot under my pits without deodorant, and the quality of protection this stuff provides with just a small amount is impressive. I&#x27;ve had zero \\&quot;breaches\\&quot; and my pits actually feel cool throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.) At the time of this review, the price for a single unit of this coupled with the fact that it&#x27;s Subscribe &amp; Save eligible makes it a no-brainer. I buy diapers for my kid with S&amp;S and sometimes I have trouble deciding what other 4 items we need to take advantage of the full 15% discount. So having one of these delivered to my house (with my other S&amp;S items) AND paying less for a better stick than anything Wal-Mart carries? YES PLEASE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: I don&#x27;t get free stuff or anything like that for posting glowing reviews on Amazon (we&#x27;ve all seen those). I&#x27;m just a dude who decided to get this as a part of my S&amp;S shipment once and wanted to share my positive experience with everyone.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several days and it seems to do a good job of covering up my wonderful odor when I sweat.  Smells good and it does help me perspire less under my arms.  Overall good product at covering up my stink!</li>
            <li> Good product. Does the job. Timely delivery.</li>
