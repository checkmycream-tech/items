    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This product is awesome.</li>
            <li>my hair is bouncy and my coils and curls are just perfect.  </li>
            <li>Great product and good service!</li>
            <li>It is a great product.  </li>
            <li>and they work wonderfully for me since they give me lots of moisture and a nice hold without flaking.  </li>
            <li>It works great in my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>great</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Smells good, moisturizes, packs shine and works great if you set by air or dryer---and you will save $30-60 bucks.</li>
            <li>When I woke up in the morning, I had a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>really good for curly hair like mine.  </li>
            <li>The best part of all is my hair was tangle free.  </li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>My hair is gorgeous after using this product.  </li>
            <li>My curls are looser when I use this as opposed to the silkening gel or rose h20 cream (which are also great).</li>
            <li>I gives a good shine its not sticky at all.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job.</li>
            <li>And my hair still looks and feel good for days.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product and would purchase it again from seller.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling great and moisturized ized almost all day, definitely my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>This product is great because it adds moisture which makes your curls shiny, bouncy and healthy.</li>
            <li>More definition but nothing great.  </li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing as a detangler and the finished product dissolves nicely into the hair.</li>
            <li>it has effective result for my hair.  </li>
            <li>and then I either add this or the rose h20 to my hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice.  </li>
            <li>Its very light.</li>
            <li>It probably works better on 3a-3c hair.</li>
            <li>It helps to control the volume and keep curls in place for most of the day.</li>
            <li>(Oh how I love a pony puff of ringlets).  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d be at the mercy of my mutinous frizzy hair with no hope of winning the war from my hair&#x27;s anarchy</li>
            <li>For the Naturalistas out there, I have everything in my head from 3a to 4a [3a (front/top)/3b (crown/back)/3c (nape and most of sides)/4a (temple)], literally, with combo hair oily(roots)/dry(ends).</li>
            <li>I will not repurchased because I like Roots of Nature Coil Creme better and it is cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I even tried it as a gel for a twist out,but it didn&#x27;t do an especially stellar job with that either.</li>
            <li>My curls are shiny and well defined, they never looked better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>For a sleeker curl better suited for work or city settings I would recommend something with more hold.</li>
            <li>This item  works fine on her hair.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>I was recommended this product by a stylist who works at my job, and i can&#x27;t believe she gave me this product for free.</li>
            <li>But for sexy, messy, surf curls True Stretch is great.</li>
            <li>you will love the new strectch and defined look!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as if Mizani \\&quot;got\\&quot; the market leader&#x27;s Miss Jessie&#x27;s complaints from consumers: dryness, intense fragrance and greasiness and tried to address them: Mizani&#x27;s curl product is unscented, light and it does soften without beeswax.  </li>
            <li>The next day, I took the twists out expecting an amazing twistout, but</li>
            <li>Ok, so the instructions would have you set your hair overnight or wash &amp; go, which I find my hair nearly incapable of wash and go without the hold from a mousse-like product because of frizz.  </li>
            <li>I applied it on freshly washed hair</li>
            <li>It really worth it.</li>
            <li>Works fine but didn&#x27;t see much difference in my hair when using this versus the much cheaper Cantu shea butter curling cream.</li>
            <li>Considering I work in corporate and the hair must be put together somehow this is a great solution allowing me to wear my hair in its curly state and not flat iron it or pull it into buns all the time.  </li>
            <li>Now, I have a dictatorship over my shoulder length (when straight) hair and can, yes, drum roll please, control it and create curls quickly and in the morning.  </li>
            <li>my skin become more clear really</li>
            <li>I have soft, fine 4a hair.  </li>
            <li>what products or hair styles they will most likely need.  </li>
            <li>So every morning I spray my hair pretty well with a leave in conditioner by Carol&#x27;s Daughter</li>
            <li>This product leaves NO white flake product residue and and it smells fabulous!</li>
            <li>Very well worth it.</li>
            <li>I use a clean wooden applicator stick and apply to my hair in sections using the tips of my fingers to ensure it is applied to the full length of the hair.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every cream and gunk out there.</li>
            <li>I did---and you will never get the stretched, bouncy, elongated curls most women are hoping to see, based upon the ads.  </li>
            <li>My hair is exteremly dry and diff, I have tried many product for it, but they always came up nothing.  </li>
            <li>It does not improved on Nothing But Pure Pudding.</li>
            <li>While Mizani did not create this numerical classification system for black hair (Oprah&#x27;s stylest Andre deserves that kudo), Mizani does a great job of explaining the different numerical types (1,2, 3 and 4)and</li>
            <li>Their hearts are in the right place on differentiating black curling styles---but more science is needed to produce an outcome that delivers on the promise of wash-and-wear hair for Type 4s.      </li>
            <li>The curls I end up with are perfect messy curls for everyday here...  </li>
            <li>I expected better results from this product.</li>
            <li>This product did not do much for my hair.</li>
            <li>I expected more from it .</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Its really a must have in any Naturalista&#x27;s hair care regime.</li>
            <li>Stays for pretty much a full work day without any fuss.&lt;br /&gt;Remember everybody is different</li>
            <li>I live in Perth,  in a pretty surf oriented community.</li>
            <li>Wearing your hair naturally means you HAVE to moisturize it more often than if it were relaxed and you just flat ironed it or set it weekly.</li>
            <li>First off, this leaves my hair very very soft and moisturized....</li>
            <li>The curls have shape and my hair lays down more than it ever has except when I&#x27;ve just finished washing it.</li>
            <li>Mizani is essentially a company with products for straightened or relaxed hair; the new True Textures product is no exception.  </li>
            <li>I generally use it during blow outs and it leave my hair super soft.  </li>
            <li>The high moisture content in the product creates shrinkage.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not thick.</li>
            <li>this product really enlongates the hair and give a light firm hold.  </li>
            <li>Mizani acknowledges wisely that all black women do not have the same curly/kinky pattern and that products need to be tailored to each woman&#x27;s specific curl pattern.  </li>
            <li>I had sewn in was the EXACT same texture.</li>
            <li>at the first sign of humidity in the air, water seeks water and your hair after using this product is back to puff and frizz.  </li>
            <li>I have 3c hair tightly curled and fine.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s important to me since my hair typically does not flake unless I put a product in it that is damaging it.      </li>
            <li>Yet the net result is that Mizani&#x27;s True Textures lacks the shine of Miss Jessie&#x27;s products and definitely their staying power for holding twist and curl patterns.      </li>
            <li>But what I found was that unlike the Curls souffle and Moisture Quenching spray, or using Miss Jessie&#x27;s Quick Curls, which made my hair wild a frizz ball by mid-day, I could use this product as a 2nd and 3rd day curl revitalizer.  </li>
            <li>My hair was soft and moist.  </li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;ve been a natural girl for years</li>
            <li>The Coil Creme works on my twist outs and offers a soft hold.  </li>
            <li>The product simply has too much water in it.  </li>
            <li>If you can not go with Miss Jessie or Kinky Curly, try another old fashioned product Amazon sells:  Pantene Setting Lotion Spray for Relaxed and Natural hair.  </li>
            <li>At about $4 a bottle for each Pantene product, it&#x27;s natural hair</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the results.</li>
            <li>I was under the impression that it would elongate my natural curls and define them for a wash-and- go.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and allows me to shape and elongate my curls.</li>
            <li>This product made my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair is curly and I wear it naturally.</li>
            <li>I added a pomade the next day, but that didn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product with both my hair being natural and now texturizied.</li>
            <li>I literally smooth the product down a clump of what should be curls and wrap it, starting from the ends around my finger and let the curls go</li>
            <li>I have tried many and I mean MANY other products for curly hair ... either too greasy, too heavy or just don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>As a twisting, coiling or other styling agent for Type 4 hair, Mizani True Textures falls flat as well.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different products in the past 3 years, but this is the only one that get the results that I am looking for.</li>
            <li>am of mixed origin so my hair is long, voluminous, and very curly.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to the sisters with natural and kinky hair.</li>
            <li>Pantene Pro-V Relaxed &amp; Natural For Women of Color Daily Oil Cream Moisturizer,</li>
            <li>That is where so many other products aimed at black women fail---Miss Jessie&#x27;s (certain products)and Kinky Curly to name two---they advertise with black women who have loose, springy curl patterns, not the dry type 4a/4b/4c hair that is most prevalent among dark-skinned black women.</li>
            <li>They did a few things right with the marketing and conceptualization of this product:  </li>
            <li>I will find a way to use it up somehow,seeing as I spent such an amount on it( $2.00/oz is an expensive hair product,people,compared to $0.12 per ounce for Eco Styler Olive Oil gel which does in fact define the curls in even 4c-type remarkably well), but I would not agree with its description as a curl extending cream.</li>
            <li>It was billed as a product for elongating and enhancing the natural curls in the hair and despite my several efforts to follow the instructions verbatim,it simply did not deliver as promised.</li>
            <li>Whether dried by air or dryer, don&#x27;t expect any curl pattern you&#x27;re lucky enough to get to actually last:  </li>
            <li>Also use it on a nightly basis on dry hair to set hair for natural styles.</li>
            <li>and I let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li>This product seems to be failing for the type 4 ladies it is marketed to but works very well for my 3a/b mess.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Well I&#x27;ve been a natural girl for years</li>
            <li> The Coil Creme works on my twist outs and offers a soft hold.  </li>
            <li> The product simply has too much water in it.  </li>
            <li> If you can not go with Miss Jessie or Kinky Curly, try another old fashioned product Amazon sells:  Pantene Setting Lotion Spray for Relaxed and Natural hair.  </li>
            <li> At about $4 a bottle for each Pantene product, it&#x27;s natural hair</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the results.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that it would elongate my natural curls and define them for a wash-and- go.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and allows me to shape and elongate my curls.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and I wear it naturally.</li>
            <li> I added a pomade the next day, but that didn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product with both my hair being natural and now texturizied.</li>
            <li> I literally smooth the product down a clump of what should be curls and wrap it, starting from the ends around my finger and let the curls go</li>
            <li> I have tried many and I mean MANY other products for curly hair ... either too greasy, too heavy or just don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> As a twisting, coiling or other styling agent for Type 4 hair, Mizani True Textures falls flat as well.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different products in the past 3 years, but this is the only one that get the results that I am looking for.</li>
            <li> am of mixed origin so my hair is long, voluminous, and very curly.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to the sisters with natural and kinky hair.</li>
            <li> Pantene Pro-V Relaxed &amp; Natural For Women of Color Daily Oil Cream Moisturizer,</li>
            <li> That is where so many other products aimed at black women fail---Miss Jessie&#x27;s (certain products)and Kinky Curly to name two---they advertise with black women who have loose, springy curl patterns, not the dry type 4a/4b/4c hair that is most prevalent among dark-skinned black women.</li>
            <li> They did a few things right with the marketing and conceptualization of this product:  </li>
            <li> I will find a way to use it up somehow,seeing as I spent such an amount on it( $2.00/oz is an expensive hair product,people,compared to $0.12 per ounce for Eco Styler Olive Oil gel which does in fact define the curls in even 4c-type remarkably well), but I would not agree with its description as a curl extending cream.</li>
            <li> It was billed as a product for elongating and enhancing the natural curls in the hair and despite my several efforts to follow the instructions verbatim,it simply did not deliver as promised.</li>
            <li> Whether dried by air or dryer, don&#x27;t expect any curl pattern you&#x27;re lucky enough to get to actually last:  </li>
            <li> Also use it on a nightly basis on dry hair to set hair for natural styles.</li>
            <li> and I let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be failing for the type 4 ladies it is marketed to but works very well for my 3a/b mess.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mizani a little over a month and so far really have no complaints other than it should come in larger sizes for mop heads like me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It flaked,it left white gunk in my hair,it refused to dry.</li>
            <li> Normally, if I was too lazy to reset my hair at night for the 2nd and 3rd day styling,</li>
            <li> It made my 4C hair SOOOO  dry..... washed it out the next day.</li>
            <li> It was most disappointing.  </li>
            <li> About an hour later my hair and the wet and wavy weave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better twistout results using less expensive products.</li>
            <li> In addition,  I let the hair air dry and went to bed.  </li>
            <li> Your hair won&#x27;t be frizzy or dry.</li>
            <li> Using this alone gave my hair a hint of definition leaving it dry by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Mizani is the master of marketing to the black consumer and back end salon.  </li>
            <li> Just rub in a grape sized amount into my short black hair</li>
            <li> My hair frizzes like no other, absorbs water like a sponge (soaking wet center, dry ends), is difficult to clump in curl groups (my strands are individuals), easy to straighten and set (forever dryer time due to sponge effect), and feels as soft as a cotton puff making it difficult to control and manipulate.  </li>
            <li> This hair is not ringlet coils, but spongy, tightly drawn, often coarse hair, that shrinks and hugs the scalp when wet.  </li>
            <li> This I can use on a daily basis (in a tropical climate) and my hair does not get heavy or sticky.</li>
            <li> So I wet my hair and defined the curl with my finger and let it set...</li>
            <li> While it was still wet, I applied the product and put in some twists.</li>
            <li> Curls regain their shape when they get wet.</li>
            <li> This product works as I expected.  </li>
            <li> I use this for my wet n go and my twist outs.</li>
            <li> , is this product has made it so I can control and tame ALL of my hair into 3bish ringlets with minimal effort on dry hair</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any white flakes at all, and i am very heavy handed with it.</li>
            <li> I had a stylist try this product on my natural african-american (4b) hair and needless to say, it flaked big time.</li>
            <li> I apply the moisturizer on small sections of wet hair and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> This product is not good for natural black hair.</li>
            <li> The site does not permit zero stars,so I am obliged to award it one sole -unfortunately undeserved- star.</li>
            <li> The key is to moisturize curls with a butter cream upon takeout (at least for me)</li>
            <li> I discovered there&#x27;s petrolatum in the product, not happy about that as I prefer all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> it will run down your hand if you don&#x27;t hurry up and apply it to your hair.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to report that this product was one of my most expensive hair product failures.</li>
            <li> If you have tightly coiled hair, this product isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li> Now if you have tightly curled locks you can&#x27;t expect to look like an hawaiian princess.</li>
            <li> I had been so anxious to try this product on my type 4a natural african american hair and was ultimately disappointed.</li>
            <li> I will not be purchasing this again; it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> While it will give you a pattern if you go under a hooded dryer, wash and air dry results are weak.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I  bought another product by the same company.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair and two strand twisted it while wet.</li>
            <li> This product, sadly, though aimed at Type 4s, does not deliver on its marketing promises.    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it has effective result for my hair.  My hair is exteremly dry and diff, I have tried many product for it, but they always came up nothing.  This one helps.</li>
            <li> I expected better results from this product. I will not be purchasing this again; it was a waste of money. If you have tightly coiled hair, this product isn&#x27;t for you. It probably works better on 3a-3c hair.</li>
            <li> really good for curly hair like mine.  It helps to control the volume and keep curls in place for most of the day.</li>
            <li> I had a stylist try this product on my natural african-american (4b) hair and needless to say, it flaked big time. It looked like my kids went to town on my hair using paste.  I would never use this again or recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> It is a great product.  I washed my hair and two strand twisted it while wet. In addition,  I let the hair air dry and went to bed.  When I woke up in the morning, I had a pleasant surprise.  My hair was soft and moist.  The best part of all is my hair was tangle free.  I would definitely recommend this product to the sisters with natural and kinky hair.</li>
            <li> Ok, so the instructions would have you set your hair overnight or wash &amp; go, which I find my hair nearly incapable of wash and go without the hold from a mousse-like product because of frizz.  But what I found was that unlike the Curls souffle and Moisture Quenching spray, or using Miss Jessie&#x27;s Quick Curls, which made my hair wild a frizz ball by mid-day, I could use this product as a 2nd and 3rd day curl revitalizer.  I literally smooth the product down a clump of what should be curls and wrap it, starting from the ends around my finger and let the curls go and I end up with bouncy ringlets (Oh how I love a pony puff of ringlets).  Normally, if I was too lazy to reset my hair at night for the 2nd and 3rd day styling, etc., I&#x27;d be at the mercy of my mutinous frizzy hair with no hope of winning the war from my hair&#x27;s anarchy (save soak it and tie it into a bun).  Now, I have a dictatorship over my shoulder length (when straight) hair and can, yes, drum roll please, control it and create curls quickly and in the morning.  I&#x27;d thought that feat impossible.  Considering I work in corporate and the hair must be put together somehow this is a great solution allowing me to wear my hair in its curly state and not flat iron it or pull it into buns all the time.  I admit that I do use Miss Jessie&#x27;s products (Stretch Curl Silker, Curly Meringue, and Baby Buttercreme/Buttercreme) to set and moisturize my hair and they work wonderfully for me since they give me lots of moisture and a nice hold without flaking.  I also like this Mizani product because it does not cause my hair to flake, but makes it shiny.  That&#x27;s important to me since my hair typically does not flake unless I put a product in it that is damaging it.      For the Naturalistas out there, I have everything in my head from 3a to 4a [3a (front/top)/3b (crown/back)/3c (nape and most of sides)/4a (temple)], literally, with combo hair oily(roots)/dry(ends). My hair frizzes like no other, absorbs water like a sponge (soaking wet center, dry ends), is difficult to clump in curl groups (my strands are individuals), easy to straighten and set (forever dryer time due to sponge effect), and feels as soft as a cotton puff making it difficult to control and manipulate.  All I can say, is this product has made it so I can control and tame ALL of my hair into 3bish ringlets with minimal effort on dry hair and I love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using Mizani a little over a month and so far really have no complaints other than it should come in larger sizes for mop heads like me.&lt;br /&gt;I am of mixed origin so my hair is long, voluminous, and very curly.  I have tried many and I mean MANY other products for curly hair ... either too greasy, too heavy or just don&#x27;t work.  This I can use on a daily basis (in a tropical climate) and my hair does not get heavy or sticky. I use a clean wooden applicator stick and apply to my hair in sections using the tips of my fingers to ensure it is applied to the full length of the hair. For me I prefer to finger comb and form the curls that way. Stays for pretty much a full work day without any fuss.&lt;br /&gt;Remember everybody is different so what works for me may not work the same for you.  Only way is to try it.</li>
            <li> My sister told me about this product, after seeing my hair one humid summer day. I had a sew-in, my curls were tighter than the extentsions I had sewn in. She said You should try this curl release cream by Mizani. Well I&#x27;ve been a natural girl for years so I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every cream and gunk out there. So in disbelief I tried it. So I wet my hair and defined the curl with my finger and let it set...About an hour later my hair and the wet and wavy weave I had sewn in was the EXACT same texture. Now if you have tightly curled locks you can&#x27;t expect to look like an hawaiian princess. HOWEVER I GURANTEE you will love the new strectch and defined look! TRY IT AND SEE!</li>
            <li> I have type 4 hair and it is porous and I purchased this from a local beauty supply store.  I applied it on freshly washed hair and I didn&#x27;t see any curl pattern enhanced.  Versus when I use a random hair gel, I get more curl definition.  It tends to leave my hair a bit frizzy but it does keep my hair moisturized.  I will not repurchased because I like Roots of Nature Coil Creme better and it is cheaper.  The Coil Creme works on my twist outs and offers a soft hold.  I will be passing it along to family.</li>
            <li> I will give them credit:  Mizani is the master of marketing to the black consumer and back end salon.  They did a few things right with the marketing and conceptualization of this product:  Mizani acknowledges wisely that all black women do not have the same curly/kinky pattern and that products need to be tailored to each woman&#x27;s specific curl pattern.  That is where so many other products aimed at black women fail---Miss Jessie&#x27;s (certain products)and Kinky Curly to name two---they advertise with black women who have loose, springy curl patterns, not the dry type 4a/4b/4c hair that is most prevalent among dark-skinned black women. This hair is not ringlet coils, but spongy, tightly drawn, often coarse hair, that shrinks and hugs the scalp when wet.  Mizani&#x27;s product promises to tackle and curl this type of hair.     While Mizani did not create this numerical classification system for black hair (Oprah&#x27;s stylest Andre deserves that kudo), Mizani does a great job of explaining the different numerical types (1,2, 3 and 4)and what products or hair styles they will most likely need.  This product, sadly, though aimed at Type 4s, does not deliver on its marketing promises.    Follow the instructions 100 times written on its package---I did---and you will never get the stretched, bouncy, elongated curls most women are hoping to see, based upon the ads.  As a twisting, coiling or other styling agent for Type 4 hair, Mizani True Textures falls flat as well.  The product simply has too much water in it.  While it will give you a pattern if you go under a hooded dryer, wash and air dry results are weak.  The high moisture content in the product creates shrinkage.  Whether dried by air or dryer, don&#x27;t expect any curl pattern you&#x27;re lucky enough to get to actually last:  at the first sign of humidity in the air, water seeks water and your hair after using this product is back to puff and frizz.  It was most disappointing.  It&#x27;s as if Mizani \\&quot;got\\&quot; the market leader&#x27;s Miss Jessie&#x27;s complaints from consumers: dryness, intense fragrance and greasiness and tried to address them: Mizani&#x27;s curl product is unscented, light and it does soften without beeswax.  Yet the net result is that Mizani&#x27;s True Textures lacks the shine of Miss Jessie&#x27;s products and definitely their staying power for holding twist and curl patterns.      Mizani is essentially a company with products for straightened or relaxed hair; the new True Textures product is no exception.  Their hearts are in the right place on differentiating black curling styles---but more science is needed to produce an outcome that delivers on the promise of wash-and-wear hair for Type 4s.      If you can not go with Miss Jessie or Kinky Curly, try another old fashioned product Amazon sells:  Pantene Setting Lotion Spray for Relaxed and Natural hair.  Smells good, moisturizes, packs shine and works great if you set by air or dryer---and you will save $30-60 bucks. Its creme moisturizer softens and adds shine. Set with that and a spray of water at night. At about $4 a bottle for each Pantene product, it&#x27;s natural hair [[ASIN:B003EH23N8 Pantene Pro-V Relaxed &amp; Natural For Women of Color Daily Oil Cream Moisturizer, 8.7-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 4)]]styling that works and saves.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to report that this product was one of my most expensive hair product failures. It flaked,it left white gunk in my hair,it refused to dry. It was billed as a product for elongating and enhancing the natural curls in the hair and despite my several efforts to follow the instructions verbatim,it simply did not deliver as promised.I even tried it as a gel for a twist out,but it didn&#x27;t do an especially stellar job with that either. I was sorely disappointed in its performance. I will find a way to use it up somehow,seeing as I spent such an amount on it( $2.00/oz is an expensive hair product,people,compared to $0.12 per ounce for Eco Styler Olive Oil gel which does in fact define the curls in even 4c-type remarkably well), but I would not agree with its description as a curl extending cream. I guess cost should not be applied as an index for performance.The site does not permit zero stars,so I am obliged to award it one sole -unfortunately undeserved- star.</li>
            <li> Good.I&#x27;m reordering the product !</li>
            <li> This is the only product I use.  I have curly hair (3-4).  This product defines my curls and gets rid of the fizzes.  I apply the moisturizer on small sections of wet hair and let it air dry.  I have tried many different products in the past 3 years, but this is the only one that get the results that I am looking for.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the results. My curls are shiny and well defined, they never looked better. I realize ppl have different results but this product works for me. I will be reordering.</li>
            <li> I had been so anxious to try this product on my type 4a natural african american hair and was ultimately disappointed. I washed and conditioned my hair. While it was still wet, I applied the product and put in some twists. The next day, I took the twists out expecting an amazing twistout, but no. I&#x27;ve had better twistout results using less expensive products. I think the product is mislabeled; it should be called a leave- in conditioner. I was under the impression that it would elongate my natural curls and define them for a wash-and- go. No such luck.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny and controls frizz</li>
            <li> This product did not do much for my hair. I expected more from it . Did not do what was promised</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. It leaves my hair feeling soft and allows me to shape and elongate my curls.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing as a detangler and the finished product dissolves nicely into the hair. Purchased for an unbeatable price too- Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> my skin become more clear really</li>
            <li> Love it! Very satisfied with this product and would purchase it again from seller.</li>
            <li> My hair is gorgeous after using this product.  The key is to moisturize curls with a butter cream upon takeout (at least for me)</li>
            <li> Love this product. It works great in my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> This product made my hair soft and manageable. I use after I wash my hair and on a daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling great and moisturized ized almost all day, definitely my favorite hair product. Smells quite as well.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and I wear it naturally. Wearing your hair naturally means you HAVE to moisturize it more often than if it were relaxed and you just flat ironed it or set it weekly. This product is great because it adds moisture which makes your curls shiny, bouncy and healthy. Your hair won&#x27;t be frizzy or dry. This cream is not as concentrated as a hair moisturizer and it&#x27;s not like a gel. It&#x27;s consistency is kinda like Nutella from the pantry or melted gel but thicker. It&#x27;s not runny but it&#x27;s not thick. If you scoop it out with your fingers (which you will have to do) it will run down your hand if you don&#x27;t hurry up and apply it to your hair. It smells sweet-kind of like the moisturizing silkening lotion/gel in the pump for curly styles. My curls are looser when I use this as opposed to the silkening gel or rose h20 cream (which are also great). I do however have to add a leave in conditioner to my hair before applying this. Curls regain their shape when they get wet. So every morning I spray my hair pretty well with a leave in conditioner by Carol&#x27;s Daughter and then I either add this or the rose h20 to my hair. The curls have shape and my hair lays down more than it ever has except when I&#x27;ve just finished washing it.</li>
            <li> Great product and good service!</li>
            <li> My adopted daughter is of Hatian descent. This item  works fine on her hair. I would not use anything else. Especially at&lt;br /&gt; the price at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Works so well with my wash and go styles. Truly defines my curls  moisturizes my hair also so breakages does not occur.  Also use it on a nightly basis on dry hair to set hair for natural styles.</li>
            <li> This product is not good for natural black hair. It made my 4C hair SOOOO  dry..... washed it out the next day. I&#x27;m probably going to throw it in the trash because I don&#x27;t want anyone I know to go through the same hassle! Unfortunately, I  bought another product by the same company. It&#x27;s unopened, but the seller does not accept returns. I think perhaps the products contain alcohol, but I&#x27;m not positive.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I have 3c hair tightly curled and fine. (corkscrew) this product really enlongates the hair and give a light firm hold.  I gives a good shine its not sticky at all.  Its very light. my hair is bouncy and my coils and curls are just perfect.  If you have hair like mine this is the product for you. It really worth it. I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> This product works as I expected.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have soft, fine 4a hair.  Using this alone gave my hair a hint of definition leaving it dry by the end of the day.  I added a pomade the next day, but that didn&#x27;t do much.  I rewashed my hair using this product adding a medium gel.  More definition but nothing great.  The smell is nice.  It does not improved on Nothing But Pure Pudding.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be failing for the type 4 ladies it is marketed to but works very well for my 3a/b mess. I never heat style...  Just rub in a grape sized amount into my short black hair and I let it dry naturally. FYI I live in Perth,  in a pretty surf oriented community. The curls I end up with are perfect messy curls for everyday here...  For a sleeker curl better suited for work or city settings I would recommend something with more hold. But for sexy, messy, surf curls True Stretch is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years. I use it to keep the moisture in my hair. It does a good job.</li>
            <li> Works fine but didn&#x27;t see much difference in my hair when using this versus the much cheaper Cantu shea butter curling cream.</li>
            <li> This is a staple product for my 4c hair type.  I generally use it during blow outs and it leave my hair super soft.  This product leaves NO white flake product residue and and it smells fabulous! I also use this product to moisturize my ends between washes and styling.  Its really a must have in any Naturalista&#x27;s hair care regime.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. It extends my curls and gives them definition. I have Kinky har and it curls it up like a charm.</li>
            <li> I use this product to help with length after washing my hair it helps with shine luster and length. great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product with both my hair being natural and now texturizied. First off, this leaves my hair very very soft and moisturized....for days. It doesn&#x27;t leave any white flakes at all, and i am very heavy handed with it. I was recommended this product by a stylist who works at my job, and i can&#x27;t believe she gave me this product for free. Very well worth it. I use this for my wet n go and my twist outs. And my hair still looks and feel good for days. In case you&#x27;re wondering my hair texture, it is 4c.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m growing out my hair (now 3.5&amp;#34; after the big chop) and like the way this product set my twist-out and maintained my twist for a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;After I bought it I discovered there&#x27;s petrolatum in the product, not happy about that as I prefer all natural ingredients but it works on my combination 4a (front) and 3c(back) hair.</li>
