    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The Thermo straightening brush is an excellent tool for straightening hair!  </li>
            <li>This product is AWESOME !!</li>
            <li>This brush is great!</li>
            <li>It is one of the best purchases I have ever made.</li>
            <li>I love this brush!!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely great and time saving.</li>
            <li>I think that if my hair were straighter, it would have done a remarkable job, but maybe not so good for curly hair because it tends to snag and get caught.</li>
            <li>getting good results with this brush which is a bit tricky to use since the hair blower needs to stop after every strand of hair is straightned.</li>
            <li>I must say that this brush along with my 2000 watt titanium blow dryer worked wonderfully together leaving my hair straightened and full of body.</li>
            <li>The brush is good quality and straightens nicely.  </li>
            <li>brush is simply amazing - as my title says, it gives me salon quality blowouts at home.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I have no idea why no one thought about it during the design process.</li>
            <li>I have NEVER styled my own head so sleek and smooth!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get this brush through Amazon, but I wanted to share my review of it because I love it so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will update as appropriate.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m damaging my hair more by using this brush.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It gives shine and smooth texture, and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this thing is perfect.</li>
            <li>This brush works great to hold and detangle my hair as I flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I am excited to see how well it work after I am accustomed to the brush.</li>
            <li>This is a dream come true for me, I have been looking for a styling tool to straighten my hair with my blow dryer, yet nothing ever worked.</li>
            <li>Still giving it three stars because it would have done better if my hair were straight.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for giving the final touch to the hair with the flat iron (I use Babyliss).</li>
            <li>It does take some time to get used to holding it the right way to get your hair straight but overall a great brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is very ergonomic and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It came pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>And unlike what a reviewer said, it springs open easily, and it&#x27;s comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was just my first experience with it.</li>
            <li>I think this brush is the best thing ever for my dry damaged hair - I can use my blowdryer on a medium heat setting and barely use my flat iron on it .  </li>
            <li>Definately something I cannot live without!!</li>
            <li>The only times I can ever get my hair straight and smooth is when I pay to have it</li>
            <li>This thing really is a life saver.</li>
            <li>I have heard so much about Denman Brushes</li>
            <li>It came out much smoother than I had anticipated.</li>
            <li>Really, if I spent more time on it.</li>
            <li>Used this brush 3x and didn&#x27;t really care for it.</li>
            <li>and I get shiny straight hair.</li>
            <li>The brush is okay, but I have only used it once so far.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s better than a salon, because I can be gentle on my hair - most hairdressers are extremely rough on hair when blow drying - they pull it so tight and go over and over it with a hot blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need to go over it with the flat iron, but I do quickly go over the layers around my face just to get them to sit how I like.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>And so I would then spend time going over it with a very hot flat</li>
            <li>It takes some time and cordination to get use to holding the brush with one hand and the blow dryer in the other; but once you do it&#x27;s smooth sailing.</li>
            <li>It was in a brand new package.</li>
            <li>Makes hair believably smooth and straight, not like the harsh lines of a regular straightener.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product for bangs, hair straightening, or putting gentle curls at the ends of longer hair.</li>
            <li>first used it to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>If you want straight hair buy a flat iron not this.</li>
            <li>If I had to complain, I would say that the bristles appeared to melt easily on high heat which left me fee like I may need to invest in a &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to blow dry my hair straight before using this brush.</li>
            <li>My locks are pretty long and moderately kinky.</li>
            <li>I could barely get this thing through my hair.</li>
            <li>It is almost impossible to straight my hair on my own (I don&#x27;t use flat iron).</li>

            <li> It is almost impossible to straight my hair on my own (I don&#x27;t use flat iron).</li>
            <li> So all those little kinks I have in my normal hair were not present when using this brush.</li>
            <li> brush is composed of two brushes with a hinge, like a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to replace my use of a flat iron.</li>
            <li> This brush cut my drying time by 10 minutes and makes it a lot easier to straigten with my flat iron.</li>
            <li> I am Black with 4b natural hair.</li>
            <li> I ran the dryer around my head to get it somewhat dry.</li>
            <li> Then I pinned it up and used the tool with my dryer to dry it in sections.</li>
            <li> You have a little tiny rubber band thing (come with the package) to hold the brush together for storage.</li>
            <li> The bristle brush helps to distribute oil evenly so it brings out the shine of my hair (which is extremely rare).&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I am somewhat lazy, I went to bed with my hair as above.</li>
            <li> It smooths my hair and takes away the fuzz I used to get with other blow dryer brushes.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely curly (think pencil and Sharpie sized curls), and this product was a little rough on my hair.</li>
            <li> I used to try to blow dry my hair with a round brush, but it was so hard to get my hair to stay in the brush and the results just would not look the same as when the HD did it.  </li>
            <li> only complaint I have is that there is no mechanism to hold the brush together when you are done with it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really grip it in a way that is helpful, and it&#x27;s difficult to grab a section of hair without getting tangled.</li>
            <li> Sticking to my round brush...</li>
            <li> I must say though, I did not brush with it until AFTER I had blow dried my hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I am having a really hard time with this one.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair</li>
            <li> It was a little awkward handling two hair tools at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again I pinned up my hair and did it in sections, running the flatiron just behind the brush.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t get this brush through Amazon, but I wanted to share my review of it because I love it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is simply amazing - as my title says, it gives me salon quality blowouts at home.  And it&#x27;s better than a salon, because I can be gentle on my hair - most hairdressers are extremely rough on hair when blow drying - they pull it so tight and go over and over it with a hot blow dryer.  With this brush, it helps to hold the hair taut, but not so taut that you can feel it pulling at your roots.  I used to try to blow dry my hair with a round brush, but it was so hard to get my hair to stay in the brush and the results just would not look the same as when the HD did it.  And so I would then spend time going over it with a very hot flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is composed of two brushes with a hinge, like a flat iron.  You hold your hair in between the brushes and follow it with the blow dryer.  I don&#x27;t really need to go over it with the flat iron, but I do quickly go over the layers around my face just to get them to sit how I like.  If my layers were a bit nicer I probably wouldn&#x27;t have to do this.  I think this brush is the best thing ever for my dry damaged hair - I can use my blowdryer on a medium heat setting and barely use my flat iron on it .  I love this brush!!!</li>
            <li> This thing really is a life saver. I have the Asian dark long hair with very course texture. It is almost impossible to straight my hair on my own (I don&#x27;t use flat iron). This brush is very ergonomic and easy to use. The bristle brush helps to distribute oil evenly so it brings out the shine of my hair (which is extremely rare).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that there is no mechanism to hold the brush together when you are done with it. You have a little tiny rubber band thing (come with the package) to hold the brush together for storage. That&#x27;s it. Honestly I have no idea why no one thought about it during the design process. Other than that, this thing is perfect.</li>
            <li> I have heard so much about Denman Brushes but I don&#x27;t know what all the hype is about. I could barely get this thing through my hair. I felt like I was going to pull my hair out. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The brush is good quality and straightens nicely.  It does take some time to get used to holding it the right way to get your hair straight but overall a great brush.</li>
            <li> The Thermo straightening brush is an excellent tool for straightening hair!  My locks are pretty long and moderately kinky. The only times I can ever get my hair straight and smooth is when I pay to have it done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used it to dry my hair.  I ran the dryer around my head to get it somewhat dry. Nothing fancy. Then I pinned it up and used the tool with my dryer to dry it in sections. It came out much smoother than I had anticipated. Really, if I spent more time on it. I don&#x27;t think a flatiron would be necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I am somewhat lazy, I went to bed with my hair as above. Next morning I used the brush with my straightener to finish it off. Again I pinned up my hair and did it in sections, running the flatiron just behind the brush. What a difference! I have NEVER styled my own head so sleek and smooth! I was blown away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was just my first experience with it. I am excited to see how well it work after I am accustomed to the brush. It was a little awkward handling two hair tools at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Initial review does not cover durability. I will update as appropriate.</li>
            <li> Used this brush 3x and didn&#x27;t really care for it. I feel like I&#x27;m damaging my hair more by using this brush.</li>
            <li> This brush works great to hold and detangle my hair as I flat iron.  I pull the brush through and &amp;#34;chase&amp;#34; it with my iron.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush to replace my use of a flat iron. I must say that this brush along with my 2000 watt titanium blow dryer worked wonderfully together leaving my hair straightened and full of body. If I had to complain, I would say that the bristles appeared to melt easily on high heat which left me fee like I may need to invest in a &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34; brush. Nevertheless, I would recommend this product to a friend because it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> This is a dream come true for me, I have been looking for a styling tool to straighten my hair with my blow dryer, yet nothing ever worked. This product is AWESOME !!</li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great and time saving. Love it.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to using this for the summer shen my hair is alot longer.  Since I&#x27;m not relaxing my hair for over a two years now this will do the trick.  Loiking forward to it.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I am having a really hard time with this one. I can&#x27;t really grip it in a way that is helpful, and it&#x27;s difficult to grab a section of hair without getting tangled. Sticking to my round brush...</li>
            <li> Makes hair believably smooth and straight, not like the harsh lines of a regular straightener.  And unlike what a reviewer said, it springs open easily, and it&#x27;s comfortable in the hand. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This brush is great! It smooths my hair and takes away the fuzz I used to get with other blow dryer brushes. I did not have the problem of my hair getting pulled or ripped out while using this product. This brush cut my drying time by 10 minutes and makes it a lot easier to straigten with my flat iron. It takes some time and cordination to get use to holding the brush with one hand and the blow dryer in the other; but once you do it&#x27;s smooth sailing.</li>
            <li> The brush is okay, but I have only used it once so far. It came pretty quickly. It was in a brand new package. It did not yank my hair. I am Black with 4b natural hair. I must say though, I did not brush with it until AFTER I had blow dried my hair. So all those little kinks I have in my normal hair were not present when using this brush.</li>
            <li> getting good results with this brush which is a bit tricky to use since the hair blower needs to stop after every strand of hair is straightned.</li>
            <li> I use it every day! It is one of the best purchases I have ever made. I definitely recommend this product for bangs, hair straightening, or putting gentle curls at the ends of longer hair.</li>
            <li> This is my hair straightening saviour! I have thick curly hair and I don&#x27;t need to blow dry my hair straight before using this brush. I just run it through my hair followed by my straightener and I get shiny straight hair. Definately something I cannot live without!!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for giving the final touch to the hair with the flat iron (I use Babyliss). It gives shine and smooth texture, and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a plug in, but it isnt. You have to have a blow dryer for it to work. It just dryes your hair. If you want straight hair buy a flat iron not this.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely curly (think pencil and Sharpie sized curls), and this product was a little rough on my hair. I think that if my hair were straighter, it would have done a remarkable job, but maybe not so good for curly hair because it tends to snag and get caught. Still giving it three stars because it would have done better if my hair were straight.</li>
