    <ol>
            <li>Great price to keep my hair out of my face!  </li>
            <li>They work great and don&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li>This set of 3 headbands is good value.  </li>
            <li>good sturdy structure and varied appearance is valued and will be used</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>: warm it up using your hairdryer</li>
            <li>Nice head bands.</li>
            <li>Quite pleased.</li>
            <li>This makes them hold your hair in place better, but may cause them to \\&quot;dig in\\&quot; at the ends a bit.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t burn yourself, okay?)</li>
            <li>These work much better than the cheapos from the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>A bit wider and a bit more pliable.  </li>
            <li>If they wouldn&#x27;t make them SOOO angled in on the bottom, it would be so much better.</li>
            <li>Although they are plastic, they are nice looking and don&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear them for long stretches so can&#x27;t comment on long-term comfort, but otherwise they&#x27;re the best inexpensive headbands I&#x27;ve found in years.</li>
            <li>It may take a couple of times doing this, but your bands will fit better eventually.</li>
            <li>They are easy to pack.</li>
            <li>They hold my fine, straight hair better than most bands.</li>
            <li>These headbands don&#x27;t fit well at all.</li>
            <li>cheap plastic</li>
            <li>great headbands and will be used throughout the future.</li>
            <li>They fit well, do not hurt.</li>
            <li>3 pieces of junk, cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>Vidal Sassoon seems to have a good idea what adult women need.</li>
            <li>If they fit and you can wear them, not a bad deal ...</li>
            <li>and hopefully yours will be different, they do look good and they are sturdy</li>
            <li>Here is a suggestion that sometimes works to loosen up new headbands, and help them fit your unique head</li>
            <li>Everybody&#x27;s heads are different shapes but for me these are comfortable and stay on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>They cut into my head behind my ears, even if they look good, if I can&#x27;t wear them for more than 30 minutes, it doesn&#x27;t help me - probably just the shape of my head</li>
            <li>and while it is warm, put it on your head and let it cool down.  </li>
            <li>she loves them and they came very fast.</li>
            <li>I like these very much.</li>
            <li>Not much else to say really, they hold my hair really well and look good.</li>
            <li>I have a smaller head and pretty fine hair that is normally super easy to tame.</li>
            <li>Way to tight for an adult to wear for more than an hour.</li>
            <li>If you are an adult with thick long hair you will love these.  </li>
            <li>These fit my large head and with their teeth and springiness hold back my heavy thick hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> These fit my large head and with their teeth and springiness hold back my heavy thick hair</li>
            <li> These headbands are not for an adult head, they pinch and are too tight to wear</li>
            <li> They are not too tight and will definitely keep your hair pulled back without giving you a headache.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;white\\&quot; (actually, clear) band is about 1/2\\&quot; wide, the black about 3/4\\&quot; wide, and the brown about 1\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The plastic that they are made of is a little springier than some similar headbands.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not really my thing</li>
            <li> Not sure what it is, but these headbands don&#x27;t conform to my head, and don&#x27;t keep my hair back.</li>
            <li> (careful!  </li>
            <li> I have worn other headbands before with thicker hair</li>
            <li> I just feel like mine have sharp edges.</li>
            <li> I bought these for pure utility and they are just too uncomfortable to wear for my taste.  </li>
            <li> I thought that these headbands would give me some reprieve from bangs hanging down in my face while doing volunteer work.  </li>
            <li> I had a 6 hour shift and attempted to wear the thinnest of the bunch (a black one) to see how it would do.  </li>
            <li> If you have a dremmel tool that you can use to grind off about half the little potrusions that dig into your skull when you are using this then you, too, can have a headband that rates a 4, if not, don&#x27;t purchase this because it will hurt to wear it.</li>
            <li> Too tight on the head gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> These are too tight for me.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have a small head, but not a huge one either.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re thin and small .</li>
            <li> , I get a headache after 10 min, break easily, waste of money :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to see someone with thick or curly hair put one of these on.</li>
            <li> After about an hour it became very uncomfortable and the bottom ends were digging into the side of my head ...</li>
            <li> the ends of the headbands are very uncomfortable.</li>

            <li> All 3 of the headbands in this set are quite well done.  They don&#x27;t cause me to have headaches and the colors give me a choice to wear with different outfits.  Am working on letting my hair grow from very short and these will help me to survive the process.</li>
            <li> These fit my large head and with their teeth and springiness hold back my heavy thick hair well. The don&#x27;t pinch. Quite pleased.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have them for a week before they broke.</li>
            <li> They cut into my head behind my ears, even if they look good, if I can&#x27;t wear them for more than 30 minutes, it doesn&#x27;t help me - probably just the shape of my head and hopefully yours will be different, they do look good and they are sturdy</li>

The plastic that they are made of is a little springier than some similar headbands.  This makes them hold your hair in place better, but may cause them to \\&quot;dig in\\&quot; at the ends a bit.  The teeth are a smidgen longer than standard inexpensive headbands, and they are a smidgen fatter.  They hold my fine, straight hair better than most bands. Here is a suggestion that sometimes works to loosen up new headbands, and help them fit your unique head: warm it up using your hairdryer (careful!  don&#x27;t burn yourself, okay?) and while it is warm, put it on your head and let it cool down.  It may take a couple of times doing this, but your bands will fit better eventually.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not really my thing but I thought  I&#x27;d give them a try anyway. They&#x27;re thin and small . If you like head gear this is for you.</li>
            <li> Nice head bands. My daughter loves them and they are made well. Shipment was prompt. I like them.</li>
            <li> They work great and don&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li> purchased for my mother for christmas. she loves them and they came very fast. i would definitely recommend them or buy another color</li>
            <li> These work much better than the cheapos from the grocery store.  A bit wider and a bit more pliable.  Everybody&#x27;s heads are different shapes but for me these are comfortable and stay on my fine hair.  I don&#x27;t wear them for long stretches so can&#x27;t comment on long-term comfort, but otherwise they&#x27;re the best inexpensive headbands I&#x27;ve found in years.</li>

            <li> Not much else to say really, they hold my hair really well and look good. I wear them to work anytime I don&#x27;t feel like spending a ton of time on my hair.</li>
            <li> Shame .... cheap plastic, I get a headache after 10 min, break easily, waste of money :( Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> Love these! Great price to keep my hair out of my face!  Although they are plastic, they are nice looking and don&#x27;t look cheap.</li>
            <li> I just order these to do something different with my hair. Wasn&#x27;t all that impress with them but they will do.</li>
            <li> great headbands and will be used throughout the future. good sturdy structure and varied appearance is valued and will be used</li>
            <li> Two of the headbands broke as I was removing it from my head, otherwise they worked while on my head, take off with caution! I didn&#x27;t realize that each band is a different width.  I use these for my waitressing job and they did keep the hair out of my face!</li>
            <li> Way to tight for an adult to wear for more than an hour.</li>
            <li> These headbands can be used for any occasion. They fit well, do not hurt. They are easy to pack. Buy some</li>
            <li> I thought that these headbands would give me some reprieve from bangs hanging down in my face while doing volunteer work.  I had a 6 hour shift and attempted to wear the thinnest of the bunch (a black one) to see how it would do.  After about an hour it became very uncomfortable and the bottom ends were digging into the side of my head ... plus it gave me a headache!  I have worn other headbands before with thicker hair (my hair is short now but has longer bangs and sides) and not had a problem.  The teeth on these are relentless and I found that the edges just dig.  Ouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a small head, but not a huge one either.  In hats I wear a 7 1/4.  I bought these for pure utility and they are just too uncomfortable to wear for my taste.  If they fit and you can wear them, not a bad deal ... I just feel like mine have sharp edges.</li>
            <li> I like these very much. I would like to have a package where the bands are all the same size.</li>
            <li> 3 pieces of junk, cheap plastic. Don&#x27;t bother to order....the ends of the headbands are very uncomfortable. Can&#x27;t believe Sassoon put his name on them!</li>
