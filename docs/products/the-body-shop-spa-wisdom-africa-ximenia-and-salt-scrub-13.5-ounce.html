            <li>It is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>In those one or two cases, they have commented on how smooth my skin is.</li>
            <li>Love this scrub, it exfoliates and moisturizes in one step and the price is right</li>
            <li>it is very good,out of my imagination,a good experience to use,making my body smooth like a baby,thank you very much.</li>
            <li>actually, it is worth the full price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>The original formula product I had, the exfoliating agent lasted MUCH longer before disolving.  </li>
            <li>Leaving it silky soft with a sweet light scent.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin super soft and there&#x27;s a light scent that is heavenly.</li>
            <li>I used WAY too much the first time around!)</li>
            <li>Also, my skin was soft and perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li>This product has really saved my life!</li>
            <li>I love it personally, but I have given it to friends as gifts!</li>
            <li>Want to buy more of a different scent.</li>
            <li>This formula is ok, though pricy for how fast it disolves; I will be looking for something lasting closer to what I&#x27;d had before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say I wish I knew how small it was before I bought it, but I got it for free, so I can&#x27;t complain &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>scrub certainly lives up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>This product, which used to be pure, ground up</li>
            <li>In fact, I only got this one because it came free with my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>therefore it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling very exfoliated.....</li>
            <li>too creamy and is not really a scrub more like a greasy lotion with a bit of sea salt.</li>
            <li>but it is more creamy than other salt scrubs I bought.</li>
            <li>Exquisite alhtough fragrance was a little too subtle.</li>
            <li>Regardless of how long it lasts, I think that&#x27;s pretty steep.</li>
            <li>This product makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>And the smell is not really that nice either, it is very bland.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much at all per wash, so it does last a long time.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not really that much scrubbing action done by this product.</li>
            <li>long lasting soft feeling.</li>

            <li> I thought the product would be scratchy but it is more creamy than other salt scrubs I bought. Plus the aroma is very nice.</li>
            <li> There is no salt in this salt scrub!  Very disappointed!  Wish I could return it as I have hardly used it.</li>
            <li> this is the best, smells good and very exfoliative (if that is a word)</li>
            <li> The Body Shop Spa Wisdom Africa Ximenia and Salt Scrub works fantastically for me. I have very dry skin that often itches, especially when it&#x27;s cold. Granted, I haven&#x27;t experimented a lot with body washes. In fact, I only got this one because it came free with my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I am SO glad I got it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t as rough as other salt scrubs I&#x27;ve tried. The smell is gorgeous--cool, airy and floral, very subtle yet just noticeable enough. You don&#x27;t need very much at all per wash, so it does last a long time. (It took me a couple tries, though--I used WAY too much the first time around!) Also, my skin was soft and perfectly smooth. No flakes, no white, and no itching! This scrub has shea butter in it, which would explain that. It works as well as a lotion, and almost as well as body butter. In fact, after I use this scrub, I often don&#x27;t even need a lotion afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I&#x27;m not too keen on the price. $28 for 13.5 ounces is two dollars an ounce. Regardless of how long it lasts, I think that&#x27;s pretty steep. I&#x27;d say I wish I knew how small it was before I bought it, but I got it for free, so I can&#x27;t complain &#x3D;)Also, it&#x27;s 100% fair trade, so actually, it is worth the full price. Smooth, moisturized skin, amazing scent, shea butter, fair trade--you probably can&#x27;t do better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is recommended. It&#x27;s worth it. I just hate spending money. And if you qualify for a free Spa Wisdom item with your order, pick this one!</li>

            <li> Love this scrub, it exfoliates and moisturizes in one step and the price is right -- it smells wonderful, leaves me feeling refreshed, exhilarated, smooth and silky too.</li>
            <li> I love this scrub - I use it all the time in the shower.</li>
            <li> long lasting soft feeling.</li>
            <li> My husband got this for me. It did not soften my skin like I thought it would. Very disappointed in the product. I Do not recommend this to anyone looking to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that once or twice since buying this product, I have used it, and in the same day, had a woman rubbing up on me. In those one or two cases, they have commented on how smooth my skin is. This product has really saved my life!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this body scrub many times!! I love it personally, but I have given it to friends as gifts! It&#x27;s always a hit!!</li>
            <li> This scrub is wonderfully refreshing on my skin.  Leaving it silky soft with a sweet light scent.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It was a nice smelling scrub, adequently amount for the money, and nice container. Overall, very low on my radar of scurbs.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this body scrub.</li>
            <li> Had tried the previous version, and was anxious to replace.&lt;br /&gt;This scrub certainly lives up to my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not really that much scrubbing action done by this product. And the smell is not really that nice either, it is very bland. I have used it a couple of times and have to grab quite a lot of it to have it accomplish any serious scrubbing. I did not like this product at all.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the others I bought</li>
            <li> This product, which used to be pure, ground up Adzuki beans has changed since the Body Shop was bought. It made my face greasy, I broke out, and a bit of it got in my mouth as I was rinsing. I had a bad, chemical taste that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
            <li> it is very good,out of my imagination,a good experience to use,making my body smooth like a baby,thank you very much.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I use it weekly to exfoliate my body. It leaves my skin super soft and there&#x27;s a light scent that is heavenly.</li>
            <li> Exquisite alhtough fragrance was a little too subtle. This is a superios product. Want to buy more of a different scent.</li>
            <li> I had to order this product online because they closed the Body Shop that was by my house. It got here quickly and I am super happy. This product makes your skin so soft. It is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> too creamy and is not really a scrub more like a greasy lotion with a bit of sea salt. but oh well i will never buy it again</li>
