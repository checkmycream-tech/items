            <li>She smelled it on me and was kind of like &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>Nice cologne.  </li>
            <li>Cerruti 1881 Pour Homme ,Ceasr&#x27;s is still a decent scent that I find perfectly wearable.</li>
            <li>Very, very strong scent, as in the room will know your there.  </li>
            <li>Ordering was, as always, very easy to do from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Glad I was able to find it.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>I love this cologne spray.  </li>
            <li>and everyone in the house complains about the overwhelming scent.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t quite love it.</li>
            <li>Is Caesar&#x27;s my all time favorite?</li>
            <li>Outstanding.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this cologne</li>
            <li>Really enjoying the fragrance of this cologne.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>It is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>I was satisfied.</li>
            <li>Grand cologne.  </li>
            <li>This has to be my most favorite cologne</li>
            <li>I like the fact the scent stays for a long time, but if the ladies of the house think it is overwhelming than it is not doing the job!!!!!</li>
            <li>So my brother-in-law tried my bottle and loved it so much</li>
            <li>Not an easy brand to find in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>Strong smell</li>
            <li>I sprayed some on, and the odor is still strong after over an hour.  </li>
            <li>I always see these cheap colognes on Amazon</li>
            <li>My husband always gets compliments and a friend liked it so much he asked my husband to order some for him.</li>
            <li>The bottle is so cheap looking and the cologne is just as cheap.  </li>
            <li>ago, Decided to do a search found it on Amazon was ecstatic great fragrance would definitely recommend</li>
            <li>Really Caesar&#x27;s smells kind of like Drakkar Noir.</li>
            <li>The price is ridiculously cheap.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>It is priced very reasonable and I&#x27;ve been purchasing this for the better part of 20 yrs.</li>
            <li>A UNIQUE MANLY SMELL THAT TURNS HEADS AND HAS MEN AND WOMEN ASKING WHATS THAT</li>
            <li>In fact, it turned out to be a pretty safe bet.</li>
            <li>Sexy smell...bought my first bottle in Vegas years ago.</li>
            <li>This cologne smells great and lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li>a true winner</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is definitely similar to Drakkar but more forceful and with better longevity.  </li>
            <li>always have been one of my favorite fragrant in high school.</li>
            <li>I received Caesars a long time ago as a gift and have always loved the scent.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty straightforward smell.</li>
            <li>4-5 sprays will last me 6-7 hours on a warm day.</li>
            <li>so one squirt will defiantly do just right.</li>
            <li>Ranks up there with all of the higher price colognes.  </li>
            <li>First got this when I was stationed in California 20 yrs.&#x27;</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re shopping for a scent, I think you&#x27;re usually better off taking the maker&#x27;s word over the seller&#x27;s and the seller over individual reviewers</li>
            <li>In 5 years when I do run out, I&#x27;ll gladly purchase the exact same replacement!</li>
            <li>Woman have complemented me and told me that they love the smell; that it smells very proper and manly, an sense of sophistication.  </li>
            <li>My in laws first brought this cologne as a gift for me from a trip to Las Vegas.</li>
            <li>Amazon (and everyone else I&#x27;ve ever seen selling this) lists the notes as, &amp;#34;wood, oak, moss, citrus, and sandalwood&amp;#34;, which doesn&#x27;t make a ton of sense, so you&#x27;re pretty much stuck with the reviewers&#x27; descriptions on this one.</li>
            <li>I picked up a bottle of this stuff after because the scent description sounded pretty pleasant, its inexpensive, and the bottle design isn&#x27;t ridiculous.</li>
            <li>Large size bottle.  </li>
            <li>Personally I like Drakkar Noir better for a few bucks more, and</li>
            <li>The aroma is very nastalgic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh in a slightly woodsy kind of way, and a tiny bit piney.</li>
            <li>I found Caesar&#x27;s to be pleasant, fresh, piney, and slightly soapy in the bottle (its also slightly soapy on the skin</li>
            <li>(since scent is highly subjective after all), but there is no description from the maker that I can find.</li>
            <li>Was able to buy two for less than what I used to pay for one!</li>
            <li>Very masculine and smells very equivalent to your grandpa&#x27;s old spice after shave.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this cologne for any man looking to try a new fragrance.</li>
            <li>however the scent  is very strong and does not last long only a couple hours .</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle at Caesar&#x27;s Palace in Reno last year.  </li>
            <li>So, next time I&#x27;ll pay the price for West Indian Lime, which I was seeking in the first place.</li>
            <li>A distinctive and manly scent that frankly is not a very common cologne.</li>
            <li>Has always been my favorite and is getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li>I spray my sheets and pillows every night and after 15 minutes the smell is a masculine woodsy smell that is calming.</li>
            <li>But its definitely decent and definitely wearable ifyou like fougere style colognes.</li>
            <li>Boy did I make it last knowing how hard it would be to get more.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells like cheap Drakkar noir..not unpleasant but cheaply done.</li>
            <li>Personally, I prefer Drakkar Noir, which is more complex (Guy Laroche lists 15 different notes!)</li>
            <li>Barely any is gone out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Apparently this product was discontinued, however, when you&#x27;re paying for something you expect to still function.</li>
            <li>My husband ordered this to try and it&#x27;s not an attractive smell at all :(.  </li>
            <li>Caesar&#x27;s is a  pretty basic Fougere, which means its the typical style of men&#x27;s cologne from before those blue colored &amp;#34;Aquatic&amp;#34; scents got big.</li>

            <li> Very manly and proper for late 30&#x27;s, 40&#x27;s, 50&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> My husband wears it often, and the fragrance lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I am a long time user of this fragrance after visiting Caesar&#x27;s in Vegas 25 years ago.</li>
            <li> She says THIS is what she remembers Drakkar smelling like a long time</li>
            <li> My dad likes it though, so a cheap gifts idea for an older acquaintance is where I would rank it.</li>
            <li> This cologne was not as sharp as I had expected.</li>
            <li> Then came Amazon and boom - delivered in less than 3 days!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a girl magnet to say the least.  </li>
            <li> The smell gives way to an unpleasant odor after several hours that I did not care for.</li>
            <li> It has a pungent, artificial scent that to my nose has very little resemblance to lime.</li>
            <li> But the selles on stop sucks bad.</li>
            <li> For around $15 you probably won&#x27;t be sorry you bought it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong by trying it.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality product.</li>
            <li> This seemed to be a bad buy for me.</li>

            <li> One of the best colognes out there!! Men do yourself a favour and buy some! The ladies also love it!</li>
            <li> smells good. i know this cuz my gf tells me so.  ide do anything for a girl to stick her face in my chest.</li>
            <li> I always see these cheap colognes on Amazon so I thought I would try it for kicks. Very, very strong scent, as in the room will know your there.  Very masculine and smells very equivalent to your grandpa&#x27;s old spice after shave. The smell gives way to an unpleasant odor after several hours that I did not care for. My dad likes it though, so a cheap gifts idea for an older acquaintance is where I would rank it.</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne my husband will wear so I will continue to purchase it through Amazon because it has the best price that I have seen anywhere around.  My husband always gets compliments and a friend liked it so much he asked my husband to order some for him.</li>
            <li> The bottle is so cheap looking and the cologne is just as cheap.  Synthetic foul smelling cologne is defintely not for me.</li>
            <li> Great product. Ranks up there with all of the higher price colognes.  Have used for a couple of years and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle at Caesar&#x27;s Palace in Reno last year.  When we saw it we went to a blackjack table and played to buy it.  Was great, I hit some good cards and a fem mins later we were heading to the gift shop.  LOL  So my brother-in-law tried my bottle and loved it so much I got him one for his birthday.  He Loved It.  And still does.  Kind of a spice smell and it lingers nicely.  Strong smell so one squirt will defiantly do just right.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne spray.  It reminds me of Vegas!  My husband wears it often, and the fragrance lasts a long time.  This is his third or fourth bottle.  I buy it whenever I see it on sale.  Ritzy!</li>
            <li> Great crist cologne- Just what I needed in my teaching profession</li>
            <li> Like the product. But the selles on stop sucks bad.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of this fragrance after visiting Caesar&#x27;s in Vegas 25 years ago. Buying it on Amazon was a lot cheaper than a plane ticket.</li>
            <li> always have been one of my favorite fragrant in high school. im 40 now and it still is good.  This is a must to buy!!</li>
            <li> Excelent ! No questions no complains</li>
            <li> I received Caesars a long time ago as a gift and have always loved the scent. I decided to see if the item was still availabe and to my surprise it was.  A great price  and scent.  It smells great .</li>
            <li> THIS COLOGNE HAS ALWAYS DONE WELL FOR ME. ITS LIKE A CROSS BETWEEN OBSESSION AND DRAKKAR NOIR A UNIQUE MANLY SMELL THAT TURNS HEADS AND HAS MEN AND WOMEN ASKING WHATS THAT YOUR WEARING IT SMELLS GREAT.</li>
            <li> My wife complains every morning that I put this on.  I only spray once in the front and once in the back and everyone in the house complains about the overwhelming scent.  I like the fact the scent stays for a long time, but if the ladies of the house think it is overwhelming than it is not doing the job!!!!!</li>
            <li> First got this when I was stationed in California 20 yrs.&#x27; ago, Decided to do a search found it on Amazon was ecstatic great fragrance would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Use it all of the time.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like cheap Drakkar noir..not unpleasant but cheaply done. Very poor quality product. Gave mine to a friend.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing....I bought it cause my guy wears it and it is a great smell on him. I spray my sheets and pillows every night and after 15 minutes the smell is a masculine woodsy smell that is calming. I will definitely buy this again!!!</li>
            <li> I picked up a bottle of this stuff after because the scent description sounded pretty pleasant, its inexpensive, and the bottle design isn&#x27;t ridiculous. Surprisingly, for a $15 cologne, it also smells nice. In fact, it turned out to be a pretty safe bet. Endurance is also good. 4-5 sprays will last me 6-7 hours on a warm day. Wearing this, I&#x27;ve actually gotten several compliments from both men and women. I like the smell myself but I don&#x27;t quite love it. This is a pretty straightforward smell. If you&#x27;re shopping for a scent, I think you&#x27;re usually better off taking the maker&#x27;s word over the seller&#x27;s and the seller over individual reviewers (since scent is highly subjective after all), but there is no description from the maker that I can find. Amazon (and everyone else I&#x27;ve ever seen selling this) lists the notes as, &amp;#34;wood, oak, moss, citrus, and sandalwood&amp;#34;, which doesn&#x27;t make a ton of sense, so you&#x27;re pretty much stuck with the reviewers&#x27; descriptions on this one. Caesar&#x27;s is a  pretty basic Fougere, which means its the typical style of men&#x27;s cologne from before those blue colored &amp;#34;Aquatic&amp;#34; scents got big. Its a 70&#x27;s or 80&#x27;s style cologne. I found Caesar&#x27;s to be pleasant, fresh, piney, and slightly soapy in the bottle (its also slightly soapy on the skin but that part doesn&#x27;t last). It&#x27;s fresh in a slightly woodsy kind of way, and a tiny bit piney. Really Caesar&#x27;s smells kind of like Drakkar Noir. Personally, I prefer Drakkar Noir, which is more complex (Guy Laroche lists 15 different notes!) but also more expensive. However, there are some people who actually describe Caesar&#x27;s as similar to &amp;#34;vintage&amp;#34; Drakkar Noir, and who prefer it to the current &amp;#34;reformulated&amp;#34; version. Anyway, I rate this five stars for the combination of affordability, endurance, the fact that I like the smell, and the fact that it does not seem to offend anyone around me. Is Caesar&#x27;s my all time favorite? No. But its definitely decent and definitely wearable ifyou like fougere style colognes. Personally I like Drakkar Noir better for a few bucks more, and Cerruti 1881 Pour Homme ,Ceasr&#x27;s is still a decent scent that I find perfectly wearable. For around $15 you probably won&#x27;t be sorry you bought it.</li>
            <li> Outstanding. Just when I thought there was no hope of buying a discontinued product Amazon came through like they always do.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cologne however the scent  is very strong and does not last long only a couple hours .</li>
            <li> I have worn Caesars Man Cologne for almost 30 years.  A distinctive and manly scent that frankly is not a very common cologne.</li>
            <li> good price and value for the size.  way cheaper than in the store. Not an easy brand to find in stores anymore. Perfumemania occasionally has it.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying the fragrance of this cologne. The price was great. Shipping was immediate. Ordering was, as always, very easy to do from Amazon. I would recommend this cologne for any man looking to try a new fragrance. You can&#x27;t go wrong by trying it.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great and lasts a very long time! I wear it daily and have had it for well over a year. Barely any is gone out of the bottle. In 5 years when I do run out, I&#x27;ll gladly purchase the exact same replacement!</li>
            <li> Outstanding cologne at an awesome price.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves Drakkar Noir so I bought some.  She smelled it on me and was kind of like &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I picked up some of this because I saw a lot of reviews saying it is like *vintage* Drakkar Noir.  She smelled this on me and LOVES it.  She says THIS is what she remembers Drakkar smelling like a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely similar to Drakkar but more forceful and with better longevity.  Fantastic stuff, GREAT bargain.</li>
            <li> Hey it&#x27;s great. And arrived with no damage</li>
            <li> Nice cologne.  Large size bottle.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> Makes my husband smell great!</li>
            <li> Good smelling cologne and get lots of compliments on it. So yes I would purchase it again and will!</li>
            <li> good quality product, thank you</li>
            <li> Was a bit stingy and while wanting a West Indian lime cologne, did not want to pay in excess of $40 so I bought this. It was a value-seeking gamble that lost. It has a pungent, artificial scent that to my nose has very little resemblance to lime. So, next time I&#x27;ll pay the price for West Indian Lime, which I was seeking in the first place.</li>
            <li> This cologne smell great, so I am told by others.</li>
            <li> Very good pricing on this cologne.</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this to try and it&#x27;s not an attractive smell at all :(.  You get what you pay for....lesson learned.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a family member who requested. Apparently this product was discontinued, however, when you&#x27;re paying for something you expect to still function. in this case produce the correct odor.</li>
            <li> This seemed to be a bad buy for me. This cologne was not as sharp as I had expected. I would not recommend this cologne to anyone.</li>
            <li> This was at a good price.  It is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> Has always been my favorite and is getting harder and harder to find. Was able to buy two for less than what I used to pay for one!</li>
            <li> Very manly and proper for late 30&#x27;s, 40&#x27;s, 50&#x27;s.  Excellent cologne.  The price is ridiculously cheap.  The aroma is very nastalgic.  Smells of the 40&#x27;s or 50&#x27;s or 60&#x27;s era.  It takes you back in time.....on a journey.  Woman have complemented me and told me that they love the smell; that it smells very proper and manly, an sense of sophistication.  I am in love with this product.  Amazing cologne to add to the collection.  Enjoy.</li>
            <li> it is very nice have used it for years great great great nice nice good good good good good good</li>
            <li> I was satisfied. I&#x27;ve been trying to find this cologne for awhile and couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the stores around here. This was the best deal I found online.</li>
            <li> Sexy smell...bought my first bottle in Vegas years ago.</li>
            <li> This is top-shelf stuff.  I sprayed some on, and the odor is still strong after over an hour.  The fragrance does not fade away.  Grand cologne.  Could not be happier.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine introduced this  cologne to me.  It&#x27;s a girl magnet to say the least.  The fragrance smells and remains&lt;br /&gt;the same for hours.</li>
            <li> My in laws first brought this cologne as a gift for me from a trip to Las Vegas. Boy did I make it last knowing how hard it would be to get more. Then came Amazon and boom - delivered in less than 3 days!</li>
            <li> This has to be my most favorite cologne and I receive compliments every time I&#x27;ve worn it. It is priced very reasonable and I&#x27;ve been purchasing this for the better part of 20 yrs. a true winner</li>
