            <li>it works great !</li>
            <li>This is definately the best compromise between irritation and deodorizing I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li>perfect for someone who does not want to smell about sweating.  </li>
            <li>The best deodorant/antiperspirant that I have found for contact dermatitis.</li>
            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>at home, LOL)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t have as many harmful chemicals as most deodorants have.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything in the stores as good, even if they cost more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Glad  </li>
            <li>I am allergic to most deodorants and get a rash.</li>
            <li>Better with skin allergies...</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most deoderants, I tried Tom&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Also, I find that it lasts for more than one day...</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to the chemicals and fragrances in others, this is the best one that is also cheap.</li>
            <li>There may be better ones that doctors can prescribe and cost a lot more.</li>
            <li>Applies fine but dries like paint.</li>
            <li>Scent free, hypoallergenic, works all day.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, it is odor free, doesn&#x27;t create marks on clothes, &amp; is hypo</li>
            <li>I ordered two clear gel almay fragrance Free deodorants, and when they came they were fragrance free but were the solid kind.</li>
            <li>I think you can expect to use more than regular stick deodorant.</li>
            <li>but one application lasts several days :-).</li>
            <li>My mom is allergic to most deodorants and this is the only one that works for her,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably hypoallergenic, all right, but I don&#x27;t think it works very well.</li>
            <li>the less I have to use the better!  </li>
            <li>I am also super sensitive to scents and chemicals, no issue with this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does only a fair job at keeping you dry.</li>
            <li>This is really hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>bud didn&#x27;t think it was worth the effort of trying to send them back.</li>
            <li>It looks like conventional solid deodorant but is really a gel that gets pushed through slots at the top of the applicator.</li>
            <li>like I do I highly recommend getting the Dry Idea Advanced Dry: http://www.amazon.com/Dry-Idea-Anti-Perspirant-Deodorant-Hypo-Allergenic/dp/B002UFRVR8/ref&#x3D;sr_1_4?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1427916687&amp;sr&#x3D;8-4&amp;keywords&#x3D;dry+idea+hypoallergenic+deodorant</li>
            <li>I have highly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I guess I am the only person that has had this particular incident with this deodorant.</li>
            <li>My rash from regular Old Spice deodorant went away after three weeks use of this.</li>
            <li>After applying this deodorant for the first time it dried and proceeded to turn into a paste like substance after about 25-30 minutes of being applied to my armpits.</li>

            <li> The Almay Hypoallergenic Clear Gel Fragrance Free Deodorant works fine but causes dreadful yellow stains on my clothing when I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> No visual residue either, just comfortably dry armpits all day long.</li>
            <li> I have not developed allergic reactions to this deodorant.</li>
            <li> The gel is messy and hard to control, and the bottles arrived half filled.</li>
            <li> which did not cause any irritation but only lasted half the day.  </li>
            <li> I have no allergic reactions but I find it is too wet.</li>
            <li> Almay&#x27;s does cause a little irritation (much less than regular deoderant).  </li>
            <li> I got this as other deoderants made me itch.  </li>
            <li> I took a look at the other reviews</li>
            <li> I am physically active throughout the day</li>
            <li> That is to say, it smells a little musty out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I use it with a little sprtiz of Cortaid spray</li>
            <li> Clearly shows residue and just feels sticky and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> no more itchy underarms.</li>
            <li> Works unbelievably well.</li>
            <li> Gel is hard; I will have to return it.</li>
            <li> This one itches the least.</li>
            <li> I did not use anti-persperant for years, but finally tired of damp armpits and soggy shirts.</li>
            <li> It looked like I had snail trails in my armpit hair and the surrounding skin and was extremely uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> On a spectrum of Perfume to Terrible Body Odor, this thing falls closer to the latter towards the neutral mark.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Gel is hard; I will have to return it.</li>
            <li> Should say ANTI PERSPIRANT in the title</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Glad  I order this Almay it works great !</li>
            <li> I got this as other deoderants made me itch.  I have no problems with this one</li>
            <li> I took a look at the other reviews and I guess I am the only person that has had this particular incident with this deodorant. After applying this deodorant for the first time it dried and proceeded to turn into a paste like substance after about 25-30 minutes of being applied to my armpits. It looked like I had snail trails in my armpit hair and the surrounding skin and was extremely uncomfortable. The paste was so sticky it was pulling my armpit hair out just raising my arms and resulted in me having to take a shower to get it out of my armpit hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need hypoallergenic deodorant like I do I highly recommend getting the Dry Idea Advanced Dry: http://www.amazon.com/Dry-Idea-Anti-Perspirant-Deodorant-Hypo-Allergenic/dp/B002UFRVR8/ref&#x3D;sr_1_4?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1427916687&amp;sr&#x3D;8-4&amp;keywords&#x3D;dry+idea+hypoallergenic+deodorant</li>
            <li> I ordered two clear gel almay fragrance Free deodorants, and when they came they were fragrance free but were the solid kind. I was really disappointed bud didn&#x27;t think it was worth the effort of trying to send them back.</li>
            <li> On a spectrum of Perfume to Terrible Body Odor, this thing falls closer to the latter towards the neutral mark. That is to say, it smells a little musty out of the tube. I think that goes away once it dries in your pits, but it also doesn&#x27;t seem to prevent B.O. from showing up...like at all.</li>
            <li> Almay advertises this as hypoallergenic. I am allergic to most deodorants and get a rash. Almay delivers all day dryness and no irritation. I&#x27;ve used if for several years and it always works well, works all day.</li>
            <li> There is no scent but this stuff works. It looks like conventional solid deodorant but is really a gel that gets pushed through slots at the top of the applicator. I think you can expect to use more than regular stick deodorant. This is really hypoallergenic. My rash from regular Old Spice deodorant went away after three weeks use of this. I&#x27;m not necessary recommending you do it this way but one application lasts several days :-).</li>
            <li> My mom is allergic to most deodorants and this is the only one that works for her,</li>
            <li> I became allergic to deodorants. This one itches the least. I would prefer a spray deodorant.I have been using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> I have not developed allergic reactions to this deodorant. It works as advertised. I got it for $2, and $2.75 for shipping, which I believe should be waived if included in a $35+ order.</li>
            <li> I have no allergic reactions but I find it is too wet.</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t have as many harmful chemicals as most deodorants have.</li>
            <li> I have highly sensitive skin and this is the only product that I have found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin that also does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Better with skin allergies...no more itchy underarms.</li>
            <li> The Almay Hypoallergenic Clear Gel Fragrance Free Deodorant works fine but causes dreadful yellow stains on my clothing when I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most deoderants, I tried Tom&#x27;s which did not cause any irritation but only lasted half the day.  Almay&#x27;s does cause a little irritation (much less than regular deoderant).  I use it with a little sprtiz of Cortaid spray and I&#x27;m good to go.  Also, I find that it lasts for more than one day...the less I have to use the better!  I&#x27;ve actually gone over a 3 day weekend (at home, LOL) with no problem.  This is definately the best compromise between irritation and deodorizing I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably hypoallergenic, all right, but I don&#x27;t think it works very well.</li>
            <li> Applies fine but dries like paint. Clearly shows residue and just feels sticky and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say whether this works well because I happened to be one of those blessed people who don&#x27;t need deodorants, but I bought this because I use them as anti-chafe. The gel is messy and hard to control, and the bottles arrived half filled.</li>
            <li> perfect for someone who does not want to smell about sweating.  It has no scent</li>
            <li> On the positive side, it is odor free, doesn&#x27;t create marks on clothes, &amp; is hypo allergenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does only a fair job at keeping you dry.</li>
            <li> The best deodorant/antiperspirant that I have found for contact dermatitis. I&#x27;ve used it for years. If you are sensitive to the chemicals and fragrances in others, this is the best one that is also cheap. I haven&#x27;t found anything in the stores as good, even if they cost more. There may be better ones that doctors can prescribe and cost a lot more. I suggest you try this one first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very reliable, too. No odor. Don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
            <li> This is the anti-persperant you&#x27;re looking for. Scent free, hypoallergenic, works all day. I did not use anti-persperant for years, but finally tired of damp armpits and soggy shirts. Works unbelievably well. I am physically active throughout the day and I&#x27;ve never had a problem. No visual residue either, just comfortably dry armpits all day long. Awesome. I am also super sensitive to scents and chemicals, no issue with this stuff.</li>
