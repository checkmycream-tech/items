    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is a great product!  </li>
            <li>Not the best comedone extractor I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I have owned this product for about 5 years, and it works great!</li>
            <li>Its perfect to get into the crease between your nose and cheek.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li>But i would recommend this product just because the quality is really good for the price you are paying!</li>
            <li>Tweezerman has always had great quality tools for the Salon and this one lives up to their name.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>I bought this tool and it works great.</li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>Worked great.</li>
            <li>very nice quality product</li>
            <li>Very nice quality</li>
            <li>This tool works perfectly and easily.</li>
            <li>I always knew that it wasen&#x27;t good to use your  fingernails, and I knew I needed to stop.</li>
            <li>Really good quality.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good for your skin</li>
            <li>Popped me some good ones with this without damaging the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li>Good quality materials and nicely finished.</li>
            <li>I love it, I might just have to buy my boyfriend one!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>It keeps me from trying to pop my own pimples and I never end up with scars, or mishaps.  </li>
            <li>I  use the blackhead side more than the whitehead side, but I think both ends are good.  </li>
            <li>Removes whiteheads effectively.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective on SOME zits</li>
            <li>Although, if you use it in the shower with silicone on your hand the grips can be quite nice.  </li>
            <li>Good for more sanitary skincare.</li>
            <li>Strong, versatile and good quality tool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read reviews from people who have had great success with this tool, but I haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Above all,  I am VERY happy with this product!</li>
            <li>:) If you have any doubts about buying this, put them aside and go for it.</li>
            <li>Make sure that the tool has been sterilized before use (rubbing alcohol works).</li>
            <li>Then if it still hasnt come up, keep pressure on it while rolling it across your face so the loop&#x27;s tip ends up touching the whitehead.  </li>
            <li>I love it,</li>
            <li>I thought this would be better than my tried-and-true Revlon tool for removing skin bumps, but it does not work.  </li>
            <li>having perfect skin until my mid-</li>
            <li>This tool is probably better for men with shaving sometimes causing deeply-ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, I guess.</li>
            <li>the Ace Fogless Shower Mirror is reaganesque innovative entrepreneur  genius</li>
            <li>Once you are comfortable using the tool, it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>period LOVE</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better for your skin than trying to pop pimples with your fingers.  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t do anything to make it look better by any means</li>
            <li>The Tweezerman tool is FAR superior!  </li>
            <li>It is not that effective, you have to prepare your skin first!</li>
            <li>This tool is quick to learn, easy on the skin, and an effective way of getting rid of pesky clogged pores.</li>
            <li>i think in combo with a heat mask or a peel mask or anything else to loosen up your pores and help clean them, it will work much better.</li>
            <li>Before you use this tool make sure that your face is clean, exfoliated, and preferably steamed.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>You must have a medically supervized, Krakatoa-sized monster on your face for this thing to do any kind of good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing to see how much gunk you have in your skin!</li>
            <li>I then decided to take a nice hot shower and try the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>One the best tools for black heads</li>
            <li>At home, I&#x27;ve definitely found that using my clean fingers, after a warm compress, on a blemish can be more effective than this tool.    </li>
            <li>Certainly way better than picking or squeezing, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t cause huge bumps or swelling</li>
            <li>It is such a great tool.  </li>
            <li>Such a great purchase.</li>
            <li>I would order 2 of the Body Toolz (and with free shipping</li>
            <li>works well, probably less abrasive on skin than using your fingers but its best to follow directions (i.e. wash face with warm water/ or use after shower when skin is softer and pores are more open), would def recommend this to someone who has chronic blackheads that return on a weekly basis</li>
            <li>I actually own two of these tools, one is an older design.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t mutilate your skin with this tool; use it correctly and it will become a quick and easy addition to your routine.</li>
            <li>be patient at first when getting the hang of using it and be sure</li>
            <li>Also, Tweezerman&#x27;s guarantee is not customer friendly.</li>
            <li>The Suvorna also has silicone shower friendly grips, yet they are expertly refined.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to clean the tool before and after each use.</li>
            <li>I mean the quality looks good, almost too good and bulky for a comedone extractor.</li>
            <li>but i found not such good results on the whiteheads.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for people like me who see a tiny bump and want to pop it...</li>
            <li>A true quality product.</li>
            <li>It was like a gross, yet fascinating, science experiment.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the Revlon version of this works much better on my skin - it doesn&#x27;t require as much pressure</li>
            <li>and it is pretty easy to use as well.</li>
            <li>Well made product, German stainless, and it works great.</li>
            <li>i usually did more damage than good trying to get them out.</li>
            <li>First off all three work!</li>
            <li>better than an old bobby pin!</li>
            <li>This little tool continues to be a great product.</li>
            <li>DO tell you that you need to wash your face with warm water (or whatever form you choose) to open up the pores.</li>
            <li>and I consider it one of my most important beauty tools for pesky monthly breakouts especially for my teenager.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;gadget\\&quot; is helpful,but painful,I use it to clear the blackheads from my husbands back and works great.</li>
            <li>used it right out of the bag</li>
            <li>right before you have somewhere to go.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the on all of them right now)</li>
            <li>But hey, unless your&#x27;re wanting to clean up a grown blackhead,you probly wont get much out of this tool.</li>
            <li>I recommend this tool for anyone who wants a clean way to \\&quot;pop\\&quot; those pimples... and reduce redness scaring.    </li>
            <li>my new one since stolen by latest ex Tweezerman 2.0 is much flatter (picture posted)    </li>
            <li>I have very large pores and (ew) blackheads on my nose and the apples of my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>Stick to the tweezers, Tweezerman, you had it right the first time around...</li>
            <li>When I stumbled across just as many positive reviews for the negative ones I headed for the bathroom mirror to make up my own mind.      </li>
            <li>then found first one.</li>
            <li>overall, glad i went through with purchase</li>
            <li>first post is from Feb. 2011 and today is Nov. 7, 2013.</li>
            <li>I have had better results from doing the same thing with fine-tipped tweezers.</li>
            <li>I like many others can&#x27;t stand white heads on my skin...</li>
            <li>But I havent been able to use the flat end to remove blackheads.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve healed significantly faster then had I used the old fashioned, squeezing with the fingers method.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have a lot more success with a lot less pain.  </li>
            <li>that well was the blackhead extractor as I only really get them around my nose and the tool was too large to fit in the crevasses.</li>
            <li>However, I found that the whitehead one worked just as well on the ones around my nostrils, so it really didn&#x27;t matter.    </li>
            <li>Even with a very strict wash schedule my face still breaks out.</li>
            <li>It is something that helps so much</li>
            <li>It just works and it&#x27;s well made so you don&#x27;t have to worry too much about bending or breaking either of the hoops or having it rust.</li>
            <li>, I just don&#x27;t see much benefit to this tool.</li>
            <li>I think you have to press kind of hard to make it work right.  </li>
            <li>However, My teenage son even uses the new one nightly, cause it is so easy and does not take alot of time.</li>
            <li>it works extremely well and is much more efficient than using your fingers.</li>
            <li>It works great on myself, except you will only use the small side unless you have monster sized acne.</li>
            <li>skin is soft and supple from a hot shower or something like that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>they are very mature and large.  </li>
            <li>Of course it isn&#x27;t going to be able to target the TINY blackheads but it will get some of the bigger ones.</li>
            <li>It works as well now as it did in 2011 and is super durable and probably will last longer than I will.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does sting for a second, but it&#x27;s over quickly</li>
            <li>The tool will take older blackheads out, but the newer ones and pimples it does not get out at all.</li>
            <li>When used appropriately, this little bugger does the trick every time.  </li>
            <li>I actually didn&#x27;t really have to use very much pressure at all that time.</li>
            <li>I do prefer the older one over the new design.</li>
            <li>rarely works for me, sometimes works on my bf&#x27;s larger blackheads.</li>
            <li>Its really doesn&#x27;t remove much with the bigger loop.</li>
            <li>Very professional and robust item.</li>
            <li>I had thought I lost the first one so bought second.</li>
            <li>The hot towel is not enough.</li>
            <li>All it did was leave a red loop shape on my skin wherever I pressed it, and moving it along my skin didn&#x27;t feel good, more painful than manually expressing my pores.  </li>
            <li>It probably wouldn&#x27;t seem all that professional if they started sticking their fingers all over your face and squishing away!    </li>
            <li>An okay buy. :/</li>
            <li>Beware that after using it on your face that there&#x27;s a good chance that you will look like a meth addict - your face will be red and sore and possibly have a few sores from it.</li>
            <li>Leaves much less of a mark than when you used to pick at your skin as a teen &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>The larger end is too large for 90% of skin types.  </li>
            <li>I use this tool everyday and it has made a huge difference in the feel and looks of my skin.  </li>
            <li>The only part I couldn&#x27;t really get to work</li>
            <li>so far i&#x27;ve gotten rid of about 1/3 of them using this tool.     </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found that it works very well, if at all, for white heads.  </li>
            <li>I think that the loop covers too much surface area to apply sufficient pressure to a specific pore.</li>
            <li>It is not a magic tool, it will work a lot better after a long hot shower or use a facial sauna if you have one.</li>
            <li>If your skin gets clean by scraping with the closed end of a hair pin, then you might as well use that instead of spending $9 to get the same result.</li>
            <li>The small end works fine.  </li>
            <li>For small blackheads, you&#x27;ll do more damage to your skin trying to remove them than if you just left it all alone.</li>
            <li>So now with obvious big red marks on my face... and hormone changes causing mild acne</li>
            <li>Spas use them because, obviously, they&#x27;re dealing with the public and have to follow certain regulations . . .</li>
            <li>I like the large flat end for the occasional good sized white head, and the small end for black heads.</li>
            <li>I find the smaller the loop the better... at least for my skin.</li>
            <li>The flat/large loop for pressing out blackheads is difficult to use on areas like the nose (where I have the most blackheads) and is only useful for isolated instances along flat areas like forehead or cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I am not a professional, but I found this tool easy to use, my only complain is that it feels like it is not going to last very long, but after several months it is still O.K.</li>
            <li>The larger side works well, but the smaller side has the metal loop at a 90 degree angle, so it&#x27;s challenging hard to use.</li>
            <li>This works well for getting rid of blackheads and general acne.  </li>
            <li>This thing should last nearly forever and it works admirably.</li>
            <li>it hurts, stop doing it\\&quot; policy with my sensitive skin, I gave up after several occasions of attempting to use this tool.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t bother me much, but I could see where it would hurt or irritate other people&#x27;s extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but sometimes it&#x27;s exactly the side you need for certain hard to pimples (around the chin especially).</li>
            <li>a limited number of people use them and they really don&#x27;t gain in popularity because most find them mediocre or just all out time-consuming.</li>
            <li>had more of a down angle before the up angle on the small loop side like the picture they use for it...</li>
            <li>The loops on this are broad and flat.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, dry, blemish prone skin with severe environmental allergies and have tried almost every type of product out.</li>
            <li>This is the easiest way to clear white heads--no scarring--no long healing time--</li>
            <li>When I use this, I just get a huge red welt on my face from pressing very hard in an effort to get something to come out.  </li>
            <li>This product has both good and bad reviews, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> works well, probably less abrasive on skin than using your fingers but its best to follow directions (i.e. wash face with warm water/ or use after shower when skin is softer and pores are more open), would def recommend this to someone who has chronic blackheads that return on a weekly basis</li>
            <li> I actually own two of these tools, one is an older design.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t mutilate your skin with this tool; use it correctly and it will become a quick and easy addition to your routine.</li>
            <li> be patient at first when getting the hang of using it and be sure</li>
            <li> Also, Tweezerman&#x27;s guarantee is not customer friendly.</li>
            <li> The Suvorna also has silicone shower friendly grips, yet they are expertly refined.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to clean the tool before and after each use.</li>
            <li> I mean the quality looks good, almost too good and bulky for a comedone extractor.</li>
            <li> but i found not such good results on the whiteheads.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for people like me who see a tiny bump and want to pop it...</li>
            <li> A true quality product.</li>
            <li> It was like a gross, yet fascinating, science experiment.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the Revlon version of this works much better on my skin - it doesn&#x27;t require as much pressure</li>
            <li> and it is pretty easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> Well made product, German stainless, and it works great.</li>
            <li> i usually did more damage than good trying to get them out.</li>
            <li> First off all three work!</li>
            <li> better than an old bobby pin!</li>
            <li> This little tool continues to be a great product.</li>
            <li> DO tell you that you need to wash your face with warm water (or whatever form you choose) to open up the pores.</li>
            <li> and I consider it one of my most important beauty tools for pesky monthly breakouts especially for my teenager.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;gadget\\&quot; is helpful,but painful,I use it to clear the blackheads from my husbands back and works great.</li>
            <li> used it right out of the bag</li>
            <li> right before you have somewhere to go.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the on all of them right now)</li>
            <li> But hey, unless your&#x27;re wanting to clean up a grown blackhead,you probly wont get much out of this tool.</li>
            <li> I recommend this tool for anyone who wants a clean way to \\&quot;pop\\&quot; those pimples... and reduce redness scaring.    </li>
            <li> my new one since stolen by latest ex Tweezerman 2.0 is much flatter (picture posted)    </li>
            <li> I have very large pores and (ew) blackheads on my nose and the apples of my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Stick to the tweezers, Tweezerman, you had it right the first time around...</li>
            <li> When I stumbled across just as many positive reviews for the negative ones I headed for the bathroom mirror to make up my own mind.      </li>
            <li> then found first one.</li>
            <li> overall, glad i went through with purchase</li>
            <li> first post is from Feb. 2011 and today is Nov. 7, 2013.</li>
            <li> I have had better results from doing the same thing with fine-tipped tweezers.</li>
            <li> I like many others can&#x27;t stand white heads on my skin...</li>
            <li> But I havent been able to use the flat end to remove blackheads.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve healed significantly faster then had I used the old fashioned, squeezing with the fingers method.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have a lot more success with a lot less pain.  </li>
            <li> that well was the blackhead extractor as I only really get them around my nose and the tool was too large to fit in the crevasses.</li>
            <li> However, I found that the whitehead one worked just as well on the ones around my nostrils, so it really didn&#x27;t matter.    </li>
            <li> Even with a very strict wash schedule my face still breaks out.</li>
            <li> It is something that helps so much</li>
            <li> It just works and it&#x27;s well made so you don&#x27;t have to worry too much about bending or breaking either of the hoops or having it rust.</li>
            <li> , I just don&#x27;t see much benefit to this tool.</li>
            <li> I think you have to press kind of hard to make it work right.  </li>
            <li> However, My teenage son even uses the new one nightly, cause it is so easy and does not take alot of time.</li>
            <li> it works extremely well and is much more efficient than using your fingers.</li>
            <li> It works great on myself, except you will only use the small side unless you have monster sized acne.</li>
            <li> skin is soft and supple from a hot shower or something like that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they are very mature and large.  </li>
            <li> Of course it isn&#x27;t going to be able to target the TINY blackheads but it will get some of the bigger ones.</li>
            <li> It works as well now as it did in 2011 and is super durable and probably will last longer than I will.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does sting for a second, but it&#x27;s over quickly</li>
            <li> The tool will take older blackheads out, but the newer ones and pimples it does not get out at all.</li>
            <li> When used appropriately, this little bugger does the trick every time.  </li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t really have to use very much pressure at all that time.</li>
            <li> I do prefer the older one over the new design.</li>
            <li> rarely works for me, sometimes works on my bf&#x27;s larger blackheads.</li>
            <li> Its really doesn&#x27;t remove much with the bigger loop.</li>
            <li> Very professional and robust item.</li>
            <li> I had thought I lost the first one so bought second.</li>
            <li> The hot towel is not enough.</li>
            <li> All it did was leave a red loop shape on my skin wherever I pressed it, and moving it along my skin didn&#x27;t feel good, more painful than manually expressing my pores.  </li>
            <li> It probably wouldn&#x27;t seem all that professional if they started sticking their fingers all over your face and squishing away!    </li>
            <li> An okay buy. :/</li>
            <li> Beware that after using it on your face that there&#x27;s a good chance that you will look like a meth addict - your face will be red and sore and possibly have a few sores from it.</li>
            <li> Leaves much less of a mark than when you used to pick at your skin as a teen &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The larger end is too large for 90% of skin types.  </li>
            <li> I use this tool everyday and it has made a huge difference in the feel and looks of my skin.  </li>
            <li> The only part I couldn&#x27;t really get to work</li>
            <li> so far i&#x27;ve gotten rid of about 1/3 of them using this tool.     </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found that it works very well, if at all, for white heads.  </li>
            <li> I think that the loop covers too much surface area to apply sufficient pressure to a specific pore.</li>
            <li> It is not a magic tool, it will work a lot better after a long hot shower or use a facial sauna if you have one.</li>
            <li> If your skin gets clean by scraping with the closed end of a hair pin, then you might as well use that instead of spending $9 to get the same result.</li>
            <li> The small end works fine.  </li>
            <li> For small blackheads, you&#x27;ll do more damage to your skin trying to remove them than if you just left it all alone.</li>
            <li> So now with obvious big red marks on my face... and hormone changes causing mild acne</li>
            <li> Spas use them because, obviously, they&#x27;re dealing with the public and have to follow certain regulations . . .</li>
            <li> I like the large flat end for the occasional good sized white head, and the small end for black heads.</li>
            <li> I find the smaller the loop the better... at least for my skin.</li>
            <li> The flat/large loop for pressing out blackheads is difficult to use on areas like the nose (where I have the most blackheads) and is only useful for isolated instances along flat areas like forehead or cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I am not a professional, but I found this tool easy to use, my only complain is that it feels like it is not going to last very long, but after several months it is still O.K.</li>
            <li> The larger side works well, but the smaller side has the metal loop at a 90 degree angle, so it&#x27;s challenging hard to use.</li>
            <li> This works well for getting rid of blackheads and general acne.  </li>
            <li> This thing should last nearly forever and it works admirably.</li>
            <li> it hurts, stop doing it\\&quot; policy with my sensitive skin, I gave up after several occasions of attempting to use this tool.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t bother me much, but I could see where it would hurt or irritate other people&#x27;s extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but sometimes it&#x27;s exactly the side you need for certain hard to pimples (around the chin especially).</li>
            <li> a limited number of people use them and they really don&#x27;t gain in popularity because most find them mediocre or just all out time-consuming.</li>
            <li> had more of a down angle before the up angle on the small loop side like the picture they use for it...</li>
            <li> The loops on this are broad and flat.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry, blemish prone skin with severe environmental allergies and have tried almost every type of product out.</li>
            <li> This is the easiest way to clear white heads--no scarring--no long healing time--</li>
            <li> When I use this, I just get a huge red welt on my face from pressing very hard in an effort to get something to come out.  </li>
            <li> This product has both good and bad reviews, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.</li>
            <li> The flat loop is much smaller and the rounded loop is not at such a bent angle.</li>
            <li> However small loop came out second time I used it and the big one is too large to be of any use.</li>
            <li> The loops on this tool were not made for normal people&#x27;s little skin imperfections/flaws.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend an extractor with one end similar to the smaller end, with the other end consisting of a lancet to open pores prior to extractions.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly, the small loop (for whiteheads) actually clears out even very small acne, and on tough areas like near my eyes and bridge of nose.    </li>
            <li> Their products are always well made and last a long time!</li>
            <li> Should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I really think that a lot of people giving negative comments were simply attacking a un-cleaned face.</li>
            <li> Minimal swelling later.</li>
            <li> I had another similar tool by another company but it cut my face up as it was sharp.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely anal about blackheads, whiteheads and the occasional pimple....</li>
            <li> However, I find the flat side (for blackheads) rather difficult to use anywhere on my face except my nose, but it&#x27;s not impossible.</li>
            <li> I am not very familiar with such materiel</li>
            <li> Aestheticians typically use these at spas after facial treatments.</li>
            <li> I get much less redness using a quality conservative tool to remove a big liberal whitehead/ blackhead</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get too overzealous though, or you might end up with little red rings on your face.</li>
            <li> , My short hoop is a little off center</li>
            <li> and it will help you from inflaming and irritating your skin as much</li>
            <li> I wish I had it before I spent tons of cash on acne products that haven&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not a whole lot to this product.</li>
            <li> and it worked just as expected.</li>
            <li> it came with instrution, but it was a total waste of time.  </li>
            <li> Little to no scarring results, so I use it every night to clear up just-forming small whiteheads.    </li>
            <li> After browsing online a little, I really started to worry I had wasted my money after reading several reviews on how poor the product was.</li>
            <li> Due to my \\&quot;If</li>
            <li> As some other reviewers have mentioned, I don&#x27;t use the shorter end quite as often</li>
            <li> I was imagining at least the smaller end to be thinner, but it turned out to be just like the closed end of a hair pin.</li>
            <li> I got it home and out of the package only to discover that there were instructions on how to use the instrument, but they were not very good ones.</li>
            <li> Just know that you will have to endure some pain for it to work properly: push the small loop down, enclosing the whitehead within.  </li>
            <li> Biore pore strips work better and are less painful and disfiguring than this little tool.</li>
            <li> So I would recommend this to anyone who gets at least some acne on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> You simply place the loop over the zit and apply pressure while slowly dragging it across the blemish.</li>
            <li> The instructions (while not very detailed)</li>
            <li> If you have small pores, I&#x27;d recommend an exteactor with a hook even smaller than the small hook on this product.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to get your technique down.  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful with it though, use common sense.</li>
            <li> I will spend hours in front of a harsh mirror, squeezing them out.</li>
            <li> A waste of money</li>
            <li> You have to push pretty hard to get the crap out of your pores, and have to drag the tool across your skin.</li>
            <li> I can see how this might not work, or be painful for people with the occasional small blackhead, but it&#x27;s part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> The tool always gives me dry skin and has caused quite a few deep and painful zits after use.</li>
            <li> , I hadn&#x27;t realized that simply poping a white head would create a horrible red blemish on my pale ivory skin.    </li>
            <li> not sure if this is user(my) fault or product.</li>
            <li> I have small pores and this does nothing to extract blackheads or clogged pores.  </li>
            <li> Even so, the small loop often works on blackheads too, so give it a try.    </li>
            <li> I prefer the Suvorna and Tweezerman 1.0 and 2.0 small loop.  </li>
            <li> The Body Toolz is a touch less delicately crafted but not clintonesque crude enough to hurt your hand or face in its use.  </li>
            <li> I recommend lemon juice(it stings really bad... but the red scars will slowly start to go away...</li>
            <li> If your pushing so hard that it hurts, stop using it!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re incredibly bad gripped or find yourself in the predicament of having wet / silicone hands grips (for what ever reason you have silicone on your hand in the shower) that might be a feature to focus on.  </li>
            <li> Had been looking for one of these for a while, after hearing that picking at your skin can create marks and create worse acne from the bacteria under your fingernails.</li>
            <li> This makes for a much less painful extraction.  </li>
            <li> so do not take my comment very seriously.</li>
            <li> When I saw this product I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> In reading the reviews I discovered that the tool isn&#x27;t as complicated as I thought.</li>
            <li> I opened it up and was totally skeptical, but after reading the advice on here and the directions, I was amazed that it worked.</li>
            <li> this tool helps prevent horrible red scars and help prevents picking acne that just isn&#x27;t \\&quot;pickable\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This tool just didn&#x27;t work for me, I&#x27;m afraid.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had a field of blackheads between my eyebrows and up into my forehead that were always very difficult to get out with my fingers.</li>
            <li> I was determined to make it get out at least one nasty blackhead</li>
            <li> A bad buy.</li>
            <li> and i think it&#x27;s bad for my face</li>
            <li> Using this is painful and damaging to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I base my beauty product purchases on Amazon reviews.</li>
            <li> I thought this would do the trick, but it is worthless to me.</li>
            <li> I had some on the edge of my nose that were impossible to get, and I used this tool and they were gone in 30 seconds!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> now my wife acts like a chimp and picks my head for ingrown hairs twice a week :&#x27;(.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been a Cosmetologist for 20yrs now. I actually own two of these tools, one is an older design. I had thought I lost the first one so bought second. then found first one. I do prefer the older one over the new design. The flat loop is much smaller and the rounded loop is not at such a bent angle. However, My teenage son even uses the new one nightly, cause it is so easy and does not take alot of time. Tweezerman has always had great quality tools for the Salon and this one lives up to their name. You will not regret the purchase!</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I bought it for my son who is starting to have skin issues.  This product doesn&#x27;t cause huge bumps or swelling and he can do it himself.</li>
            <li> Not the best comedone extractor I&#x27;ve used.  The larger end is too large for 90% of skin types.  The small end works fine.  I&#x27;d recommend an extractor with one end similar to the smaller end, with the other end consisting of a lancet to open pores prior to extractions.  This makes for a much less painful extraction.  If you don&#x27;t have a lancet on your extractor, use a sterilized needle prior to extracting.  You&#x27;ll have a lot more success with a lot less pain.  If you have small pores, I&#x27;d recommend an exteactor with a hook even smaller than the small hook on this product.</li>
            <li> I use this tool everyday and it has made a huge difference in the feel and looks of my skin.  I had another similar tool by another company but it cut my face up as it was sharp.  The Tweezerman tool is FAR superior!  I use Tweezerman tweezers also.  Their products are always well made and last a long time!</li>
            <li> very nice quality product and it works wonders on blackheads but i found not such good results on the whiteheads. also it often had to pressured to the point of hurting to work...not sure if this is user(my) fault or product. overall, glad i went through with purchase</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t mutilate your skin with this tool; use it correctly and it will become a quick and easy addition to your routine.</li>
            <li> When I saw this product I was skeptical. I got it home and out of the package only to discover that there were instructions on how to use the instrument, but they were not very good ones. After browsing online a little, I really started to worry I had wasted my money after reading several reviews on how poor the product was. When I stumbled across just as many positive reviews for the negative ones I headed for the bathroom mirror to make up my own mind.      In reading the reviews I discovered that the tool isn&#x27;t as complicated as I thought. You simply place the loop over the zit and apply pressure while slowly dragging it across the blemish. It didn&#x27;t bother me much, but I could see where it would hurt or irritate other people&#x27;s extra sensitive skin. When that nasty bacteria simply shot out of my skin, I was very happy!!      I then decided to take a nice hot shower and try the rest of my face. I actually didn&#x27;t really have to use very much pressure at all that time. I really think that a lot of people giving negative comments were simply attacking a un-cleaned face. The instructions (while not very detailed) DO tell you that you need to wash your face with warm water (or whatever form you choose) to open up the pores. The only part I couldn&#x27;t really get to work that well was the blackhead extractor as I only really get them around my nose and the tool was too large to fit in the crevasses. However, I found that the whitehead one worked just as well on the ones around my nostrils, so it really didn&#x27;t matter.    Above all,  I am VERY happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for about 5 years, and it works great! I have very large pores and (ew) blackheads on my nose and the apples of my cheeks.  Even with a very strict wash schedule my face still breaks out. I like the large flat end for the occasional good sized white head, and the small end for black heads. Its perfect to get into the crease between your nose and cheek.  I can see how this might not work, or be painful for people with the occasional small blackhead, but it&#x27;s part of my daily routine. You have to be careful with it though, use common sense. If your pushing so hard that it hurts, stop using it!</li>
            <li> I base my beauty product purchases on Amazon reviews. This product has both good and bad reviews, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. It works great. I am extremely anal about blackheads, whiteheads and the occasional pimple....I will spend hours in front of a harsh mirror, squeezing them out. I always knew that it wasen&#x27;t good to use your  fingernails, and I knew I needed to stop. I bought this tool and it works great. Of course it isn&#x27;t going to be able to target the TINY blackheads but it will get some of the bigger ones. I had some on the edge of my nose that were impossible to get, and I used this tool and they were gone in 30 seconds! Don&#x27;t forget to clean the tool before and after each use. I love it, I might just have to buy my boyfriend one!</li>
            <li> I am not a professional, but I found this tool easy to use, my only complain is that it feels like it is not going to last very long, but after several months it is still O.K. It is not a magic tool, it will work a lot better after a long hot shower or use a facial sauna if you have one. The hot towel is not enough.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had a field of blackheads between my eyebrows and up into my forehead that were always very difficult to get out with my fingers. i usually did more damage than good trying to get them out. so far i&#x27;ve gotten rid of about 1/3 of them using this tool.     heat and moisture help. for tougher ones, i rolled it back and forth a bit in my fingers so that the pressure moves from side to side. this seems to help loosen them up and push them out. i think in combo with a heat mask or a peel mask or anything else to loosen up your pores and help clean them, it will work much better.</li>
            <li> I tried everything for my daughters skin issues. This product worked!&lt;br /&gt;Just be patient at first when getting the hang of using it and be sure&lt;br /&gt;the skin is soft and supple from a hot shower or something like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first post is from Feb. 2011 and today is Nov. 7, 2013. This little tool continues to be a great product. It is something that helps so much and I consider it one of my most important beauty tools for pesky monthly breakouts especially for my teenager. It works as well now as it did in 2011 and is super durable and probably will last longer than I will. :) If you have any doubts about buying this, put them aside and go for it. Totally worth the money and it will help you from inflaming and irritating your skin as much and it is pretty easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> Really good quality. However, there is 2 side, one smaller loop and one bigger loop. I find the smaller the loop the better... at least for my skin. Its almost like i realize i need to find a remover with smaller loops. Its really doesn&#x27;t remove much with the bigger loop. But i would recommend this product just because the quality is really good for the price you are paying!</li>
            <li> This pore extractor works well on blackheads provided they are very mature and large.  I haven&#x27;t found that it works very well, if at all, for white heads.  For small blackheads, you&#x27;ll do more damage to your skin trying to remove them than if you just left it all alone.</li>
            <li> Before you use this tool make sure that your face is clean, exfoliated, and preferably steamed. Make sure that the tool has been sterilized before use (rubbing alcohol works). You have to push pretty hard to get the crap out of your pores, and have to drag the tool across your skin. Beware that after using it on your face that there&#x27;s a good chance that you will look like a meth addict - your face will be red and sore and possibly have a few sores from it. The tool always gives me dry skin and has caused quite a few deep and painful zits after use. Definitely use some sort of toner after use...  Biore pore strips work better and are less painful and disfiguring than this little tool. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> This tool works perfectly and easily. I wish I had it before I spent tons of cash on acne products that haven&#x27;t worked. This one&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not a whole lot to this product. It just works and it&#x27;s well made so you don&#x27;t have to worry too much about bending or breaking either of the hoops or having it rust. This thing should last nearly forever and it works admirably. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> It is such a great tool.  It keeps me from trying to pop my own pimples and I never end up with scars, or mishaps.  I  use the blackhead side more than the whitehead side, but I think both ends are good.  Such a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality, My short hoop is a little off center but it&#x27;s not an issue. Good quality materials and nicely finished.</li>
            <li> Very professional and robust item. But it did not work for me, it hurts the skin. I am not very familiar with such materiel so do not take my comment very seriously.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It&#x27;s amazing to see how much gunk you have in your skin! I never need to buy pore strips again! I use this tool to get all of my blackheads out. However, I find the flat side (for blackheads) rather difficult to use anywhere on my face except my nose, but it&#x27;s not impossible. Ditch the strips and try this product!</li>
            <li> I think the effectiveness of this product may depend on pore size.  I have small pores and this does nothing to extract blackheads or clogged pores.  Using this is painful and damaging to the skin.  When I use this, I just get a huge red welt on my face from pressing very hard in an effort to get something to come out.  The loops on this are broad and flat. I think that the loop covers too much surface area to apply sufficient pressure to a specific pore. I have had better results from doing the same thing with fine-tipped tweezers.</li>
            <li> who has blackheads this big? rarely works for me, sometimes works on my bf&#x27;s larger blackheads. the whitehead side doesnt work at all, but i wasnt buying it for that.</li>
            <li> I have been considering purchasing one of these for years, but have always been dubious about their effectiveness.  I wish I had bought one years ago, when my teenagers were struggling with skin issues.  This is the easiest way to clear white heads--no scarring--no long healing time--it&#x27;s amazing.  I always get a pimple or two when I eat chocolate (yes, I eat it anyway from time to time) and last week was no exception.  I tried this tool and it was cleared away in seconds, and healed by morning.  No redness, no issues.&lt;br /&gt;It does sting for a second, but it&#x27;s over quickly and it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> I was imagining at least the smaller end to be thinner, but it turned out to be just like the closed end of a hair pin. If your skin gets clean by scraping with the closed end of a hair pin, then you might as well use that instead of spending $9 to get the same result. I mean the quality looks good, almost too good and bulky for a comedone extractor. But hey, unless your&#x27;re wanting to clean up a grown blackhead,you probly wont get much out of this tool.</li>
            <li> It works great on myself, except you will only use the small side unless you have monster sized acne. It also in my opinion makes acne heal faster and leaves smaller scabs than if you were to do it by hand and it can get blackheads you can&#x27;t get with just your fingers. So I would recommend this to anyone who gets at least some acne on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiancee but ended up stealing it from her... it works extremely well and is much more efficient than using your fingers. Don&#x27;t get too overzealous though, or you might end up with little red rings on your face. Lol.</li>
            <li> Removes whiteheads effectively. But I havent been able to use the flat end to remove blackheads. You can also use this to pop zits/acnes without having to worry about scars.</li>
            <li> This tool just didn&#x27;t work for me, I&#x27;m afraid.  All it did was leave a red loop shape on my skin wherever I pressed it, and moving it along my skin didn&#x27;t feel good, more painful than manually expressing my pores.  Due to my \\&quot;If it hurts, stop doing it\\&quot; policy with my sensitive skin, I gave up after several occasions of attempting to use this tool.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it.  I&#x27;ve read reviews from people who have had great success with this tool, but I haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I had been eying these sorts of tools for a while online, wondering if they could actually do anything for my acne/blackhead problem.    I decided to buy this one day after seeing that in its category, this item was highest rated on makeupalley(dot)com.    Surprisingly, the small loop (for whiteheads) actually clears out even very small acne, and on tough areas like near my eyes and bridge of nose.    The flat/large loop for pressing out blackheads is difficult to use on areas like the nose (where I have the most blackheads) and is only useful for isolated instances along flat areas like forehead or cheeks.  Even so, the small loop often works on blackheads too, so give it a try.    Little to no scarring results, so I use it every night to clear up just-forming small whiteheads.    Just know that you will have to endure some pain for it to work properly: push the small loop down, enclosing the whitehead within.  Then if it still hasnt come up, keep pressure on it while rolling it across your face so the loop&#x27;s tip ends up touching the whitehead.  The combined pressure on 3 sides is usually enough to remove anything (though it does hurt).    Definitely recommended, though moreso for whiteheads than blackheads. (cystic acne.. no chance)</li>
            <li> Aestheticians typically use these at spas after facial treatments. At home, I&#x27;ve definitely found that using my clean fingers, after a warm compress, on a blemish can be more effective than this tool.    Unless your the finicky type (ARGGGGHHHH! Never touch your face or it&#x27;s the end of the world!!!!!), I just don&#x27;t see much benefit to this tool. Spas use them because, obviously, they&#x27;re dealing with the public and have to follow certain regulations . . . It probably wouldn&#x27;t seem all that professional if they started sticking their fingers all over your face and squishing away!    It&#x27;s effective on SOME zits but I just don&#x27;t see it as a necessity and the majority of people I&#x27;ve spoken to view it in the same manner.    These have been around forever and yet only a limited number of people use them and they really don&#x27;t gain in popularity because most find them mediocre or just all out time-consuming.</li>
            <li> This thing is *solid*. I love it, used it right out of the bag and it worked just as expected.</li>
            <li> I did give a lot of pressure but still could not get the junk out! A bad buy.</li>
            <li> This product actually works. I opened it up and was totally skeptical, but after reading the advice on here and the directions, I was amazed that it worked. Hmmm, looks can be deceiving.</li>
            <li> The tool will take older blackheads out, but the newer ones and pimples it does not get out at all. An okay buy. :/</li>
            <li> I thought this would be better than my tried-and-true Revlon tool for removing skin bumps, but it does not work.  Except, maybe, as a lemon zester?  I think I&#x27;ll sterilize it and put it in my kitchen drawer.  Also, Tweezerman&#x27;s guarantee is not customer friendly.</li>
            <li> I like many others can&#x27;t stand white heads on my skin... having perfect skin until my mid- 20&#x27;s, I hadn&#x27;t realized that simply poping a white head would create a horrible red blemish on my pale ivory skin.    So now with obvious big red marks on my face... and hormone changes causing mild acne.... I got this product... if anything... it&#x27;s good for people like me who see a tiny bump and want to pop it... this tool helps prevent horrible red scars and help prevents picking acne that just isn&#x27;t \\&quot;pickable\\&quot;. I recommend this tool for anyone who wants a clean way to \\&quot;pop\\&quot; those pimples... and reduce redness scaring.    P.S. For those redness scars... I recommend lemon juice(it stings really bad... but the red scars will slowly start to go away... after treat with Vitamin E oil- help healing)</li>
            <li> The loops on this tool were not made for normal people&#x27;s little skin imperfections/flaws.  You must have a medically supervized, Krakatoa-sized monster on your face for this thing to do any kind of good.  This tool is probably better for men with shaving sometimes causing deeply-ingrown hairs. Even then, I question if it would work. Stick to the tweezers, Tweezerman, you had it right the first time around...</li>
            <li> Worked great. Easy to use and did not irritate my skin. However small loop came out second time I used it and the big one is too large to be of any use. Lasted for one use.</li>
            <li> I bought this tool for my teenage daughter and she said it works to remove blackheads. It&#x27;s ok, I guess.</li>
            <li> works well, probably less abrasive on skin than using your fingers but its best to follow directions (i.e. wash face with warm water/ or use after shower when skin is softer and pores are more open), would def recommend this to someone who has chronic blackheads that return on a weekly basis</li>
            <li> I think you have to press kind of hard to make it work right.  It does leave red marks temporarily so you don&#x27;t want to do it right before you have somewhere to go.</li>
            <li> I purchased the   1) Suvorna Whitehead / Acne Remover and Comedone Extractor   2) Tweezerman Skin Care Tool   3) Body Toolz Double Loop Facial Skin Care Tool    First off all three work! And they all work well.. I get much less redness using a quality conservative tool to remove a big liberal whitehead/ blackhead then fingers etc.  I think both the Tweezerman and the Suvorna are expertly crafted.  Note My 1st Tweezerman 1.0 (stolen by an ex who scoffed at the idea) had more of a down angle before the up angle on the small loop side like the picture they use for it... my new one since stolen by latest ex Tweezerman 2.0 is much flatter (picture posted)    The Body Toolz is a touch less delicately crafted but not clintonesque crude enough to hurt your hand or face in its use.  The handle is just not as expertly refined.  Although, if you use it in the shower with silicone on your hand the grips can be quite nice.  The Suvorna also has silicone shower friendly grips, yet they are expertly refined. If you&#x27;re incredibly bad gripped or find yourself in the predicament of having wet / silicone hands grips (for what ever reason you have silicone on your hand in the shower) that might be a feature to focus on.  I happen to like to shave and use it in the shower (sans silicone) with the Ace Fogless Shower Mirror is reaganesque innovative entrepreneur  genius I must say!      Loops:  I prefer the Suvorna and Tweezerman 1.0 and 2.0 small loop.  I prefer the firmness of the Body Toolz big loop.     How would I rate them for myself considering my shower hands? 1) Suvorna 2) Body Toolz 3) Tweezerman.    How would I rate them according to the quality of craft? 1) Tweezerman 2) Suvorna 3) Body Toolz.    With all that said what would I buy? They all work and well, you can&#x27;t lose with them.  I would order 2 of the Body Toolz (and with free shipping it&#x27;s the on all of them right now) you can place one in the car (with a 10% benzoyl peroxide solution for after use) and one in your showeror make-up mirror for aprox the same as the others.  I order 3-4 at a time and just count on GFs stealing them.  In fact, I look at every girl I meet at the bar and say \\&quot;ya she is gonna cost me two drinks and $5.45 body toolz\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Had been looking for one of these for a while, after hearing that picking at your skin can create marks and create worse acne from the bacteria under your fingernails. Of course Amazon had just the product I was looking for, and it couldn&#x27;t be easier to use! As some other reviewers have mentioned, I don&#x27;t use the shorter end quite as often but sometimes it&#x27;s exactly the side you need for certain hard to pimples (around the chin especially). Leaves much less of a mark than when you used to pick at your skin as a teen &#x3D;) and the skin seems to heal faster when you use this tool. Remember to sterilize with rubbing alcohol or risk infecting your skin all over again! Despite my leaving it out on the bathroom counter numerous times in water, it has yet to rust or show any discoloration. A true quality product.</li>
            <li> i ORDERED THESE TWO ITEMS AND NEVER DID RECEIVE THEM.  The USPS code indicates that I did get the items, but I never did.  I did get mail on the date indicated 10/23/2010, but this was not included.  I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this tool last night at my local drugstore.  It takes a little practice to get your technique down.  Once you are comfortable using the tool, it&#x27;s amazing how well it works. It was like a gross, yet fascinating, science experiment.  I had no idea all the junk that was sitting in my pores!  The blemishes and zits that I had are almost entirely gone after one night! They&#x27;ve healed significantly faster then had I used the old fashioned, squeezing with the fingers method.  I have sensitive, dry, blemish prone skin with severe environmental allergies and have tried almost every type of product out. This tool is quick to learn, easy on the skin, and an effective way of getting rid of pesky clogged pores. This is definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> Maybe it was just me, but I cannot get this product to work. I am male and have larger pores. I thought this would do the trick, but it is worthless to me.</li>
            <li> now my wife acts like a chimp and picks my head for ingrown hairs twice a week :&#x27;(.</li>
            <li> works as advertized !</li>
            <li> I love this thing. period LOVE</li>
            <li> it came with instrution, but it was a total waste of time.  it didn&#x27;t do anything the package said it would.</li>
            <li> Well made product, German stainless, and it works great. Should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;gadget\\&quot; is helpful,but painful,I use it to clear the blackheads from my husbands back and works great. Minimal swelling later.</li>
            <li> This works well for getting rid of blackheads and general acne.  It&#x27;s much better for your skin than trying to pop pimples with your fingers.  Good for more sanitary skincare.</li>
            <li> One the best tools for black heads</li>
            <li> The larger side works well, but the smaller side has the metal loop at a 90 degree angle, so it&#x27;s challenging hard to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grandson thinking it would be the answer to his blackhead problem. It does not work at all. I was determined to make it get out at least one nasty blackhead but it just didn&#x27;t happen. A waste of money</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good for your skin...works okay.  bought it cuz i wanted to do it myself and i think it&#x27;s bad for my face and it doesn&#x27;t do anything to make it look better by any means</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the Revlon version of this works much better on my skin - it doesn&#x27;t require as much pressure</li>
            <li> Strong, versatile and good quality tool. Popped me some good ones with this without damaging the surrounding skin.</li>
            <li> better than an old bobby pin!</li>
            <li> When used appropriately, this little bugger does the trick every time.  Certainly way better than picking or squeezing, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> It is not that effective, you have to prepare your skin first! But, this is not stated on the instructions.</li>
