            <li>As a result my hair looks great and smooth.</li>
            <li>The kind that I would buy it regardless of the price kind of thing.  </li>
            <li>Be Gone is that it smooths out the frizz and gives my hair a nice bit of a shine.  </li>
            <li>Nice non-toxic hair styler.</li>
            <li>Very good on my hair it makes it nice and soft</li>
            <li>I also love the smell-it&#x27;s just so fresh and pleasant -kind of</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>LOve</li>
            <li>LOve LOVE this product...</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>The combo of the two products is the best I have found after years of experimenting with different items.  </li>
            <li>Once done with that I move to the top of the head to stop the frizz</li>
            <li>used to use CHI Silk Infusion or Biosilk, but wanted to find a serum that was cruelty-free and didn&#x27;t have as many chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>and I love this product.</li>
            <li>Makes knots more manageable.</li>
            <li>OMG, love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My cat knocked it over and it spilled out on the counter, so I bought some more.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>For a line that is (for the most part) pretty organic, and doesn&#x27;t have too many unnatural chemicals in it, this frizz be gone has a good amount of silicone in it.</li>
            <li>A nice by-product is that it makes my white streaks glisten beautifully.</li>
            <li>It works really well on my frizzy hair and smells so nice!</li>
            <li>I just like to use it on my roots on top and just smooth all over.</li>
            <li>Its not as strong as some of the others but not sticky either.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair this product will not be your friend, but if you&#x27;re like me with course wiry hair then you can pile this on and your hair will absorb it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also has a nice, clean scent, which dissipates pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is comparatively smooth, but freeze has been always a problem.</li>
            <li>I went from hating my hair to loving the natural curl once I was able to control the frizz.</li>
            <li>Amazing product, I highly recommend it to anyone with frizz issues.</li>
            <li>I am also a natural nut and the &amp;#34;chemicals&amp;#34; in this are more naturally reoccurring and therefore a good alternative to more damaging products (I had a chemist look into this who is also an organic nut).</li>
            <li>I usually do not take more than a drop of water in my hands (lower than shoulders hair) and apply it mostly to the ends of the hair.</li>
            <li>Feels like pure silk, but it&#x27;s light on your hair and gives it a fantastic shine!</li>
            <li>Honestly, this is the magic product that takes my hair to the next level.</li>
            <li>In addition, it smells so nice and natural and is chemical free.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making an effective natural product for my hair.</li>
            <li>While argon oil is very popular, it turns out that synthetic dimethicone is actually more similar to the oil naturally produced in our hair, and is the ingredient in frizz be gone.</li>
            <li>I mean the best!  </li>
            <li>Will certainly order again and already told 3 others that were also looking for it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product along with Giovanni LA Gel for my super curly, frizz prone hair for 5 years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great serum and really goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>love everything that I&#x27;ve tried from the Giovanni line so far!</li>
            <li>I bought this to calm friz</li>
            <li>like fresh gardenias.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, because I love how soft my hair feels when I use it.</li>
            <li>This was the best product for my dry, curly, long hair when I bought it at Target.  </li>
            <li>kid used it, her hair is more straight with far less curls or frizz and said it worked great...</li>
            <li>I have excessively curly hair, which is great, but some days, they can exhibit frizziness.  </li>
            <li>I get it people make mistakes but part of your job is paying attention and making sure your client receives the proper order...</li>
            <li>I cannot rave enough about how much I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Better with the pump, but same trat product.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair silky soft and frizz free.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>i have 2 daughters and we all have pretty straight hair.  </li>
            <li>It tames the static during the dry winter.</li>
            <li>You just have to be sure to add some water to it if you put in on dry hair.</li>
            <li>we use then when air drying and it comes out super soft and smooth without if you don&#x27;t have for drying and flat ironing.  </li>
            <li>It really has gotten rid of the frizz.</li>
            <li>It really does take care of frizz.</li>
            <li>It really work well.</li>
            <li>If I use just gel without this product, my hair is very frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product really does the trick.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to use too much of it, just one to two pumps</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair</li>
            <li>Smells nice, makes my hair silky smooth, and definitely helps tame frizz.</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy hair and this product doesn&#x27;t do a lot to control my frizz (that&#x27;s why I blow dry), but it does make my hair super soft and</li>
            <li>The directions state you can apply it to wet or dry hair, but I find it works best when applied to wet hair.</li>
            <li>I use a dime sized amount of this in my dry hair before I brush and after every shower and it has made my hair much more shiny, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I like the new pump bottle too!</li>
            <li>This Giovanni one is just as good as the other two brands, while also meeting those other</li>
            <li>I even started putting a little drop in my 17 month old daughters hair (which means I feel it is a safe product made from organic/natural ingredients).</li>
            <li>The first ingredient is a silicone, with dimethicone being the third ingredient.     </li>
            <li>This makes my hair super soft if I shower at night, put this in and let my hair dry while I sleep.</li>
            <li>I have very thick and curly hair, and this product keeps it real nice, without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>It took me a long time to find a product which worked and was also cruelty free, but I finally found it.</li>
            <li>it clearly says SOLD AS SET.</li>
            <li>Does not smell; comes out clear.</li>
            <li>I have curly ringlets and without this product my hair doesn&#x27;t shine and isn&#x27;t as soft.</li>
            <li>about the same really...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure some find this more useful, but I personally find it annoying and wasteful.  </li>
            <li>This product has not gotten rid of the problem completely, but stopped it quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I just wish they would switch back to the old squeeze bottle like in the picture</li>
            <li>It does contain silicone (which I try to avoid as much as possible), so I only use it occasionally, when my frizz is really bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only does it take the frizz away, but it also makes my hair feel incredibly soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>especially my little kid has noodle curls and it works fine on her hair.</li>
            <li>You only need to use a small amount so it lasts, making it well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I need a fairly large amount of this product for my long and thick hair, so pumping out the product just takes too long and is too much of a hassle.</li>

            <li> Just to make it clear, i do use this product along with three other ones.</li>
            <li> but when I flat iron my hair and use this my hair shines like it did when I was a youngster.</li>
            <li> it wont be AS flat as a flat iron would make it</li>
            <li> And as long and frizzy as my hair is, I go through a lot of this, so every last drop counts.</li>
            <li> My hair does not look frizzy and does not need flat ironing anymore to look sleek and shiny.</li>
            <li> Just a few tiny drops of this helps get rid of the frizz that can plague my wavy hair on the second and third days after washing.</li>
            <li> Its heavy and makes my natural hair silky</li>
            <li> And, they go a long way!</li>
            <li> Bout the same as any other anti-frizz product.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair, it does what it says.</li>
            <li> A little bottle would last a long time for me, I bought the three pack</li>
            <li> I use it on wet hair and let it dry to a glorious shine, but you can also apply to dry hair!!!</li>
            <li> Quality product as expected</li>

            <li> This product will help to tame the wildest frizz!! i use it every day and it does not weight my curls down at all.  There is no build up</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. My hair is curly and dry, and it tames it down without weight. It took me a long time to find a product which worked and was also cruelty free, but I finally found it.</li>
            <li> My hair just recently turned from wavy to super-curly, so I had no idea how to care for it or prevent it from frizzing.  I have to use organic hair products due to severe environmental allergies, and I have been using the Giovanni hair spray without any problem.  I decided to try this to see if it would work for my hair and had wonderful results without triggering my allergies.  I went from hating my hair to loving the natural curl once I was able to control the frizz.</li>
            <li> Giovanni frizz be gone has changed my hair. I have a great hair dresser who recommended that I use a hair oil. While argon oil is very popular, it turns out that synthetic dimethicone is actually more similar to the oil naturally produced in our hair, and is the ingredient in frizz be gone. I use a dime sized amount of this in my dry hair before I brush and after every shower and it has made my hair much more shiny, soft and manageable. It really has gotten rid of the frizz. I also appreciate the ethics of Giovanni as a company. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have excessively curly hair, which is great, but some days, they can exhibit frizziness.  Since I have been using this product, I&#x27;ve got my frizz under control.  A nice by-product is that it makes my white streaks glisten beautifully.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is the magic product that takes my hair to the next level. I have curly ringlets and without this product my hair doesn&#x27;t shine and isn&#x27;t as soft. It really does take care of frizz. In addition, it smells so nice and natural and is chemical free. Amazing product, I highly recommend it to anyone with frizz issues.</li>
            <li> I have long thick wavy hair that gets tons of frizz when humid. I don&#x27;t use any hair care products except S&amp;C and this. This makes my hair super soft if I shower at night, put this in and let my hair dry while I sleep. My fiance loves the smell of it. I love that it has organic ingredients! Retail these go for apx. $11 each, buy it here! And, they go a long way!</li>
            <li> LOve LOve LOVE this product... My hair is so curly but when I flat iron my hair and use this my hair shines like it did when I was a youngster.</li>
            <li> I put this in my hair before my leave in conditioner, and gel. My curly hair looks its best with this product! Every girl needs to try this!! It helps with second day hair too. Putting a little all through my hair helps it shine for my up-do.</li>
            <li> i have 2 daughters and we all have pretty straight hair.  we use then when air drying and it comes out super soft and smooth without if you don&#x27;t have for drying and flat ironing.  it wont be AS flat as a flat iron would make it but it&#x27;s a great difference!  so if you&#x27;re on the go, this is a great product for that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great serum and really goes a long way.  A little bottle would last a long time for me, I bought the three pack so I could put one in each of my girls&#x27; bathrooms too.</li>
            <li> It really work well. I apply it after shampoo on a damp hair. I use it for my two kids too. especially my little kid has noodle curls and it works fine on her hair.</li>
            <li> Very good on my hair it makes it nice and soft its hard to find this product in stores I love it</li>
            <li> it works great I&#x27;ve ordered it before and I will tell everybody I know it how well it works thank you</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair this product will not be your friend, but if you&#x27;re like me with course wiry hair then you can pile this on and your hair will absorb it. I just like to use it on my roots on top and just smooth all over. It does the job for a reasonable price, and because I&#x27;m so heavy handed, I don&#x27;t feel guilty, come on. . .pea sized, who does that?!</li>
            <li> great product i love it</li>
            <li> I bought this to calm friz but it&#x27;s a little too thick to just use only dry hair. Feels a little like putting honey on you hair. I haven&#x27;t used it a lot so maybe I haven&#x27;t given it enough chances.</li>
            <li> I love Giovanni products and thus I buy in bulk!</li>
            <li> This was the best product for my dry, curly, long hair when I bought it at Target.  I mean the best!  The kind that I would buy it regardless of the price kind of thing.  Ruined it...</li>
            <li> I use this before blow drying, and again before straightening as an anti-frizz and to protect my hair from the heat.  It does both of those things perfectly and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I have hair that is severely frizzy. I didn&#x27;t find that this worked that well for it. Bout the same as any other anti-frizz product. Frizz Ease makes a similar frizz control serum that is twice as expensive that works about the same really... I&#x27;ve used probably every serum there is. Nothing controls my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My kid used it, her hair is more straight with far less curls or frizz and said it worked great...so give it a try or don&#x27;t ... everything depends on the person.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, makes my hair silky smooth, and definitely helps tame frizz. I like the pump bottle I just wish they would switch back to the old squeeze bottle like in the picture, it&#x27;s near impossible to get every last drop out. And as long and frizzy as my hair is, I go through a lot of this, so every last drop counts. I am also a natural nut and the &amp;#34;chemicals&amp;#34; in this are more naturally reoccurring and therefore a good alternative to more damaging products (I had a chemist look into this who is also an organic nut). Outside of that an excellent product and this is the best price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product along with Giovanni LA Gel for my super curly, frizz prone hair for 5 years.  The combo of the two products is the best I have found after years of experimenting with different items.  My hair product grave yard had become quite large!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about Frizz Be Gone is that it smooths out the frizz and gives my hair a nice bit of a shine.  I just need to be careful not to use too much or it will make my hair too soft and limp.  If I use just gel without this product, my hair is very frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giovanni recently &#x27;upgraded&#x27; the packaging on this product to a pump bottle.  I&#x27;m sure some find this more useful, but I personally find it annoying and wasteful.  I just pull out the straw and use it as a twist off cap.  I need a fairly large amount of this product for my long and thick hair, so pumping out the product just takes too long and is too much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is great in addition to it working as it is supposed. I usually do not take more than a drop of water in my hands (lower than shoulders hair) and apply it mostly to the ends of the hair. Once done with that I move to the top of the head to stop the frizz (do not overuse as hair will be greasy). My hair is comparatively smooth, but freeze has been always a problem. This product has not gotten rid of the problem completely, but stopped it quite a bit. Just to make it clear, i do use this product along with three other ones. As a result my hair looks great and smooth. ( I also use it&#x27;s a 10,  I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Quality product as expected</li>
            <li> Discovered it while shopping in Tokyo of all places. Product works to tame my unruly coarse, curly and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> For a line that is (for the most part) pretty organic, and doesn&#x27;t have too many unnatural chemicals in it, this frizz be gone has a good amount of silicone in it. The first ingredient is a silicone, with dimethicone being the third ingredient.     Ingredients: Cyclopentasiloxane, soybean protein (glycine soja), dimethicone, tocopherols (vitamin E), panthenol (vitamin B5), rosemary (rosmarinus officinalis), nettle (urtica dioica) oil, thyme (thymus vilgaris) oil, fragrance with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Just a few tiny drops of this helps get rid of the frizz that can plague my wavy hair on the second and third days after washing. I try to avoid my roots the days that I use this, and instead concentrate on using it from mid-shaft down to the ends.  It does contain silicone (which I try to avoid as much as possible), so I only use it occasionally, when my frizz is really bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a nice, clean scent, which dissipates pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use CHI Silk Infusion or Biosilk, but wanted to find a serum that was cruelty-free and didn&#x27;t have as many chemicals.  This Giovanni one is just as good as the other two brands, while also meeting those other criteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love everything that I&#x27;ve tried from the Giovanni line so far!</li>
            <li> The product actually is great the problem I had was the fact that they shipped me 1 when ordered a set of three... What added to my frustration was the fact that who ever packed it was no paying attention because on the plastic wrap it came it clearly says SOLD AS SET. I&#x27;m just so annoyed by this I get it people make mistakes but part of your job is paying attention and making sure your client receives the proper order...</li>
            <li> I cannot rave enough about how much I love this product.  I have tried countless products for my hair from mousse to oil trying to tame my frizz.  This product really does the trick.  Not only does it take the frizz away, but it also makes my hair feel incredibly soft and shiny.  You only need to use a small amount so it lasts, making it well worth the price.  I also love the smell-it&#x27;s just so fresh and pleasant -kind of like fresh gardenias.  I will not use another product again...LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> Feels like pure silk, but it&#x27;s light on your hair and gives it a fantastic shine! I use it on wet hair and let it dry to a glorious shine, but you can also apply to dry hair!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect product ..thanks</li>
            <li> I had been using John Frieda Frizz-Ease for years. I grabbed this in desperation one day last year when I was at an organic supermarket and this was the closest thing they had to Frizz-Ease. I am so glad I did. Frizz Be Gone works WONDERS on my hair. The directions state you can apply it to wet or dry hair, but I find it works best when applied to wet hair. It truly has transformed my thick, wavy hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Giovanni Products for years, but the Frizz Be Gone is my favorite! It works really well on my frizzy hair and smells so nice! I like the new pump bottle too! Thank you for making an effective natural product for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been lookin for someone who carried this product since Target stopped. Thank gosh!  The bottle is. Better with the pump, but same trat product. Will certainly order again and already told 3 others that were also looking for it!!</li>
            <li> Great Product. I have very thick and curly hair, and this product keeps it real nice, without weighing it down. I don&#x27;t even have to use too much of it, just one to two pumps and that&#x27;s enough. Good price too!</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and I love this product. I even started putting a little drop in my 17 month old daughters hair (which means I feel it is a safe product made from organic/natural ingredients). It tames the static during the dry winter. Tames the frizz during the summer. Makes knots more manageable. I have tried plain coconut oil and olive oil but that leaves my hair looking a little oily. This product does not! I have been using it for probably 5-10 years now and will continue to.</li>
            <li> Nice non-toxic hair styler. Does not smell; comes out clear. Its not as strong as some of the others but not sticky either.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Its heavy and makes my natural hair silky</li>
            <li> OMG, love this stuff.  I am a product junkie and have tried EVERYTHING, from the outrageously expensive to drug store brands.  I have over-processed, bleach blonde, waist-length hair.  This product makes my hair silky soft and frizz free.  It shines and bounces, and the results last all day.  I wake up without tangles.  I will never be without this product.</li>
            <li> My hair felt like silk the moment I applied it! I will definitely by from Giovanni again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, because I love how soft my hair feels when I use it. I have fine, wavy hair and this product doesn&#x27;t do a lot to control my frizz (that&#x27;s why I blow dry), but it does make my hair super soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains silicone, which may be bad for your hair depending on who you talk to. I haven&#x27;t noticed any acceleration of damage to my hair since I began using Giovanni Frizz Be Gone, so the silicone doesn&#x27;t concern me.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine bought me a bottle of this initially. My cat knocked it over and it spilled out on the counter, so I bought some more. I do like it because it does not have alcholol in it so it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair, it does what it says. You just have to be sure to add some water to it if you put in on dry hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smooths my hair &amp; adds shine. No frizz anymore!</li>
            <li> I use this after using 50:50 shampoo with the silky conditioner from Giovanni. My hair does not look frizzy and does not need flat ironing anymore to look sleek and shiny.</li>
