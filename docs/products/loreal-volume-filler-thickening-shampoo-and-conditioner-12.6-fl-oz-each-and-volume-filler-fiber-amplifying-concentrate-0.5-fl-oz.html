            <li>awesome shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>Excellent product!  </li>
            <li>However, for 1 day I had great hair!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product and I am hoping over time that it makes my hair thicker with out using it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using the line for sure!!!!!</li>
            <li>I am so so impressed.</li>
            <li>It was great for my hair</li>
            <li>Hair is fuller, has great body.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a very pleasant scent and lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li>but this system has done nothing good for it at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to see that others have seen better results.</li>
            <li>excellent product....and very fast delivery</li>
            <li>My lovely silver hair just keep getting compliments - even from strangers!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s AMAZING.</li>
            <li>if anyone has a better product to recommend, I&#x27;d love to hear about it!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and after completing the 3 step shampoo I loved the results.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.</li>
            <li>or if it will get even better overtime.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this.</li>
            <li>And its just getting better after every use of this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s been maybe 6 weeks now, possibly more, and I started using the treatment and the densifying gelee as well, and I just have to say,</li>
            <li>this product gets better and better with time.</li>
            <li>and I love the way that my hair feels and looks now.</li>
            <li>Love all the volume/thickening line.</li>
            <li>I have extremely fine hair.</li>
            <li>Perhaps someone with very fine but not thin hair would have more noticeable results.</li>
            <li>So, this might be OK if gaining body is more important to  you, but that is not a trade-off I am willing to make.  </li>
            <li>So, back to Kerestase and great shine.</li>
            <li>just like when I used cheap shampoos.</li>
            <li>I wrote it after using it for five days, and was pretty pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Ladies, simply put, if you cant get to the salon to get a blow-out, purchase a good moose, round brush &amp; try the best you can to finagle both to get the volume you desire.</li>
            <li>but this product did nothing special to help with volume even after adding root pumping products before blow-drying.</li>
            <li>As one reviewer said, while I may not have double the volume, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m having a good hair day.</li>
            <li>in shower while using the product, but after I blow dried it out, it looked like a really good hair day!</li>
            <li>found the best price at Target, I paid a little over $15 for all 3 products and the shampoo and conditioner are both 25.4 oz, almost twice as much as here.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love and have found my new shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and bought all five of the volume filler products: shampoo, conditioner, fiber amplifying concentrate, filler densifying gelee, and boost it high lift creation spray.</li>
            <li>My hair is super dry and full of static.</li>
            <li>I was mostly worried that this product would leave a heavy product in my hair that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to wash out.</li>
            <li>The scent of it is too strong - it could just be that I am sensitive to the smell, but I can smell it in my hair all day.</li>
            <li>This stuff actually DOES give more coverage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products and never been dazzled by any, but I always hope the next one will be IT!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Yes, it most definitely gives you the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of thicker hair but doesnt quite give the illusion.</li>
            <li>and when I get up the next day, my hair still feels better than it used to.</li>
            <li>only thing I would warn about is make sure that if you need to dye your hair, do so before using a filler tube.</li>
            <li>I dyed my hair one week after using the first tube and it did take some of the fullness</li>
            <li>used them as directed...and found ABSOLUTELY ZERO effect on my hair!</li>
            <li>Surely there are laws against making such outlandish claims?!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting &amp;#34;2X&amp;#34; thicker, but I also wasn&#x27;t expecting ZERO improvement!</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>There is no miracle cure to flat hair besides good product &amp; proper salon blow-out but this does semi-okay for at home thickening.</li>
            <li>I suppose it might work on SOME people&#x27;s hair, but it certainly didn&#x27;t work on mine.</li>
            <li>I really did notice a difference after one use.</li>
            <li>The biggest difference I&#x27;ve noticed is that it really does work all day.</li>
            <li>My hair feels much nicer to the touch too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Having read an article in the press about L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s &amp;#34;filloxane&amp;#34; I was really eager to try it for myself.</li>
            <li>Not so, my hair was left soft and light.</li>
            <li>The only positive thing is that they&#x27;re not expensive</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner make my hair soft and shiny, but fuller and thicker, not so much.  </li>
            <li>Every 3 weeks you mix in one of the filler tubes with your normal shampoo routine and let it sit in for 5 minutes and rinse it out.</li>
            <li>Normally, my hair (long, fine) is quite shiny, and the difference is obvious.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve skipped that a few times and my hair does look better than when I&#x27;d do that before--but not enough so that I will completely eliminate that from my routine.</li>
            <li>It seemed to make my hair more limp than give it any extra body, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons of products that are supposed to help with fullness and body because I have very fine and thin hair</li>
            <li>The ends of my hair showed a slight plumpness but nothing worth tying me into buying this hair care regiment again.</li>
            <li>However, it never helped with disguising my thin area on top.</li>
            <li>The science behind it seemed convincing, the article raved about its hair-plumping properties.</li>
            <li>Just dont forget to use your concentrator attachment on your blow-dryer so you can get heat right on the hair while using your round brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the products daily (sometimes trying different combinations to ensure I wasn&#x27;t adding too much product to my hair) and as directed for four weeks, but have seen absolutely no difference in my hair&#x27;s volume.</li>
            <li>I only used this product once so far,  and I don&#x27;t know how long it will last</li>
            <li>This promises 2X the volume for fine, thin hair--not in my case.</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t use a lot of conditioner because it weighs it down.</li>
            <li> My shampoo set arrived this morning a little after 9:30 A.M.</li>
            <li> This product does indeed make hair seem a little thicker (after two weeks of use).  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s thin med, this actually did make my hair thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  not sure there is truly twice the volume</li>
            <li> I was left with feeling as stated before that this product is, just mediocre.</li>
            <li> Please note that I am writing this review based on the products&#x27; claims to add volume (as a shampoo and conditioner, there is nothing wrong with the products--they do an average job in that regard).</li>
            <li> My hair is thin with medium texture.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to try this shampoo &amp; conditioner for awhile but was skeptical because of the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked, deff buy again</li>
            <li> and I absolutely hate it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> awesome shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  My 68-year-old hair is very thin and fine.  Using the Volume Filler Thickening Shampoo, I can now style my hair and look like I just left the salon!  My lovely silver hair just keep getting compliments - even from strangers!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and after completing the 3 step shampoo I loved the results. I didn&#x27;t feel a diff. in shower while using the product, but after I blow dried it out, it looked like a really good hair day! I was mostly worried that this product would leave a heavy product in my hair that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to wash out. Not so, my hair was left soft and light. I only used this product once so far,  and I don&#x27;t know how long it will last or if it will get even better overtime. However, for 1 day I had great hair!</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine hair. Can&#x27;t use a lot of conditioner because it weighs it down. Then I tried is shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> My shampoo set arrived this morning a little after 9:30 A.M. I had already had a shower earlier but couldn&#x27;t wait to try out this shampoo and conditioner set. The shampoo has a very pleasant scent and lathers up nicely. I followed the directions on the conditioner and the fiber amplifying concentrate filloxane box and mixed them together and left it in my hair for the 2 minutes. I felt a big difference in my hair immediately while rinsing it out. My hair looks and feels a lot thicker and fuller. I am very happy with this product and I am hoping over time that it makes my hair thicker with out using it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!! For almost a year I&#x27;d been using that conditioning cleanser meant to replace regular shampoo. However, it never helped with disguising my thin area on top. This stuff actually DOES give more coverage. Even Rogaine didn&#x27;t help. I&#x27;m  not sure there is truly twice the volume but there IS a big and noticeable difference. I&#x27;ll keep using the line for sure!!!!!</li>
            <li> This promises 2X the volume for fine, thin hair--not in my case. I&#x27;ve tried many products and never been dazzled by any, but I always hope the next one will be IT!&lt;br /&gt; My hair is thin with medium texture. Perhaps someone with very fine but not thin hair would have more noticeable results. I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for a month, just tried the concentrate. I shampoo 4-5 times a week. As one reviewer said, while I may not have double the volume, it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m having a good hair day. I normally use a little LOreal InvisiGel and blow dry to add body. I&#x27;ve skipped that a few times and my hair does look better than when I&#x27;d do that before--but not enough so that I will completely eliminate that from my routine. I will continue using the shampoo and conditioner as the cost is the same as for the other products I&#x27;d been using, John Frieda Luxurious Volume. Some reviewers found the scent off-putting. I don&#x27;t but it is noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I found the best price at Target, I paid a little over $15 for all 3 products and the shampoo and conditioner are both 25.4 oz, almost twice as much as here.&lt;br /&gt;And if anyone has a better product to recommend, I&#x27;d love to hear about it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this. I could tell a difference after just the 1st use. And its just getting better after every use of this product. Love it. I would recommend this for any woman who has thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Please note that I am writing this review based on the products&#x27; claims to add volume (as a shampoo and conditioner, there is nothing wrong with the products--they do an average job in that regard). I have fine hair and bought all five of the volume filler products: shampoo, conditioner, fiber amplifying concentrate, filler densifying gelee, and boost it high lift creation spray. I&#x27;ve used the products daily (sometimes trying different combinations to ensure I wasn&#x27;t adding too much product to my hair) and as directed for four weeks, but have seen absolutely no difference in my hair&#x27;s volume. I was hoping this would be the system that &amp;#34;worked&amp;#34; for me, but I&#x27;ll keep searching. I&#x27;m happy to see that others have seen better results.</li>
            <li> I already wrote a review on the product that was just the shampoo and conditioner. I wrote it after using it for five days, and was pretty pleased with it. Well, it&#x27;s been maybe 6 weeks now, possibly more, and I started using the treatment and the densifying gelee as well, and I just have to say, this product gets better and better with time. It&#x27;s AMAZING. I am so so impressed.</li>
            <li> This product does indeed make hair seem a little thicker (after two weeks of use).  However, not enough to make up for the noticeable loss of shine.  Normally, my hair (long, fine) is quite shiny, and the difference is obvious.  So, this might be OK if gaining body is more important to  you, but that is not a trade-off I am willing to make.  So, back to Kerestase and great shine. Nothing against this stuff, it just isn&#x27;t for  me.</li>
            <li> excellent product....and very fast delivery</li>
            <li> I personally feel that this didn&#x27;t work well for me.  It seemed to make my hair more limp than give it any extra body, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li> There is no miracle cure to flat hair besides good product &amp; proper salon blow-out but this does semi-okay for at home thickening. As a previous cosmetologist I can say this product is mediocre but for at home users may be satisfying. Yes, it most definitely gives you the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of thicker hair but doesnt quite give the illusion. Its a bit of a conundrum. You would think/hope that as you feel that thickness develop, as soon as the shampoo hits your hair, that would in turn show up once you style. However this was not the case for me. I have long hair which is always a pull on my roots getting the volume I desire but this product did nothing special to help with volume even after adding root pumping products before blow-drying. I was left with feeling as stated before that this product is, just mediocre. The ends of my hair showed a slight plumpness but nothing worth tying me into buying this hair care regiment again. Ladies, simply put, if you cant get to the salon to get a blow-out, purchase a good moose, round brush &amp; try the best you can to finagle both to get the volume you desire. Just dont forget to use your concentrator attachment on your blow-dryer so you can get heat right on the hair while using your round brush. For thin/fine haired women this will just not suffice compared to product &amp; proper drying techniques.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this system for about a week and I absolutely hate it. The scent of it is too strong - it could just be that I am sensitive to the smell, but I can smell it in my hair all day. I&#x27;ve tried tons of products that are supposed to help with fullness and body because I have very fine and thin hair but this system has done nothing good for it at all. My hair is super dry and full of static. And it is flatter than it has been in years - just like when I used cheap shampoos. I&#x27;m going back to Organix Biotin and Collagen Shampoo and Conditioner that actually gives my hair some fullness and body. It could be just that this product just isn&#x27;t for my hair but I hope this review helps other prospective buyers.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to try this shampoo &amp; conditioner for awhile but was skeptical because of the price. Bought it one day cause I had a coupon.Ive tried so many\\&quot;volume\\&quot; hair products, I lost count.I have very fine hair. I really did notice a difference after one use. I&#x27;m in love and have found my new shampoo &amp; conditioner.I will be buying from now on even if it&#x27;s not on sale or I don&#x27;t have a coupon!!!</li>
            <li> So does it double the volume? Not quite, which is why I took one star away, but it does give a noticeable difference and I definitely feel a difference. The biggest difference I&#x27;ve noticed is that it really does work all day. I even go to bed and when I get up the next day, my hair still feels better than it used to. My hair feels much nicer to the touch too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would warn about is make sure that if you need to dye your hair, do so before using a filler tube. I dyed my hair one week after using the first tube and it did take some of the fullness out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also add that it&#x27;s very simple to use. Every 3 weeks you mix in one of the filler tubes with your normal shampoo routine and let it sit in for 5 minutes and rinse it out. It doesn&#x27;t irritate your scalp or damage your hair whatsoever. So, yes, I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I bought all 3 of these items (shampoo, conditioner and filler tubes) for $21 at my local grocery store (Publix) so shop around before buying!</li>
            <li> Having read an article in the press about L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s &amp;#34;filloxane&amp;#34; I was really eager to try it for myself. The science behind it seemed convincing, the article raved about its hair-plumping properties. I went ahead and bought the shampoo, conditioner, and the &amp;#34;fiber amplifying concentrate&amp;#34;...used them as directed...and found ABSOLUTELY ZERO effect on my hair! Zilch. Nada. Niente. The only positive thing is that they&#x27;re not expensive so I haven&#x27;t wasted too much cash on them. I do feel cheated/mislead though. How they can claim &amp;#34;hair feels 2X thicker&amp;#34; is beyond me. Surely there are laws against making such outlandish claims?! I wasn&#x27;t really expecting &amp;#34;2X&amp;#34; thicker, but I also wasn&#x27;t expecting ZERO improvement! I suppose it might work on SOME people&#x27;s hair, but it certainly didn&#x27;t work on mine.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner make my hair soft and shiny, but fuller and thicker, not so much.  I do not think I would pay that price for this again.  And would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> It was great for my hair and I love the way that my hair feels and looks now. I would recommend this to anyone to try.</li>
            <li> I have a lotta hair but it&#x27;s thin med, this actually did make my hair thicker. I&#x27;m shocked, deff buy again</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Love all the volume/thickening line. Hair is fuller, has great body.</li>
