    <ol>
            <li>This product is the best of all...</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>and this is the best pleasant tasting and best working spray I have found.  </li>
            <li>, it is very refreshing!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know where all these great reviews are coming from, I am a Cancer survivor trying to ease some pain.</li>
            <li>But I am happy  with it except that it is so pricey.</li>
            <li>It works good.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s so good</li>
            <li>It came in good time.  </li>
            <li>Works and tastes nice</li>
            <li>Great spray that really works !</li>
            <li>XyliMelrs work better.</li>
            <li>It is nothing more than some lime juice and mostly water.</li>
            <li>I have tried Biotene and the Mouth Kote Moisturizer is considerably better.</li>
            <li>she said the taste could be better, but believes it helps</li>
            <li>this item is very good for dry mouth like I have from all of the medications that I take.  </li>
            <li>It is fairly easy to use, but I did seem to spray it too much.  </li>
            <li>Mouth Kote is handy to have around and just a few sprays and my mouth and throat feel fine for awhile  and as a bonus the taste of the spray is pretty good-so if you are out and about it&#x27;s more convenient to carry Mouth Kote than bottles of water.</li>
            <li>She said it works well and has fresh flavor.</li>
            <li>She has tried many other products and this is by far superior.</li>
            <li>Use it after singing a lot and it will cost your throat just right</li>
            <li>This product came very fast.  </li>
            <li>It really worked!</li>
            <li>It really helps!</li>
            <li>I ordered 3 large bottles based on the reviews, ordered 2 day service</li>
            <li>It does a pretty decent job and seems to be better than oasis&#x27;s dry mouth spray.</li>
            <li>i was drinking so much water</li>
            <li>I use the Biotiee spray but my Rite Aide has been out of it for weeks, so I thought I would try something new.</li>
            <li>My wife has had a dry mouth for years and all the doctor suggested was sipping water but not much of a cure when it&#x27;s at night that she has the problem, waking up with her mouth just about stuck shut, but after spraying with this she gets a much better sleep, well until the cat wants to go out at 5.0 am</li>
            <li>The Biotene is a light gel spray, this is nothing but water, it swishes right down your system in seconds with no lasting effect to ease the dryness.</li>
            <li>Mariah Carey uses this same exact spray...</li>
            <li>Bought for 88 year old mother whom experiences drty mouth from meds.  </li>
            <li>really ghelps my dry mouth after radiation treatment</li>

    <ol>
            <li> My problem has been radiation therapy, which burned the salivary glands. Now, 6 weeks out of radiation, I still have sores between the gums and cheeks. I tested this spray on litmus paper the other day, and it&#x27;s almost off the acid scale. I won&#x27;t be using it anymore.  I did the same litmus test with Biotene Moisturizing Mouth Spray, and it was virtually neutral. [[ASIN:B0015HPTQW Biotene Moisturizing Mouth Spray 1.5 fl oz (45 ml)]] I don&#x27;t need any further aggravation to my sores.</li>
            <li> I bought this spray because I kept getting dry mouth, especially when I sing. It works good. My mouth stays moist when I sing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything to relieve dry mouth and the bad taste lingers.</li>
            <li> I gave this a try for .my dry mouth. The spray lasts about an hour. XyliMelrs work better.</li>
            <li> It really worked! Mariah Carey uses this and she is really serious about her voice so I knew I wasn&#x27;t gonna be upset. It does not causes mucous build up. Use it after singing a lot and it will cost your throat just right</li>
            <li> I have a problem where my salivary glands do not produce enough saliva and to lubricate my dry mouth and throat i was drinking so much water I felt like a goldfish in a bowl.  Mouth Kote is handy to have around and just a few sprays and my mouth and throat feel fine for awhile  and as a bonus the taste of the spray is pretty good-so if you are out and about it&#x27;s more convenient to carry Mouth Kote than bottles of water.</li>
            <li> This product is the best of all...forget Vocal Eze and Clear Voice, they are amateur sprays unlike this one, It&#x27;s so good Mariah Carey uses this same exact spray...I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Works and tastes nice</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 large bottles based on the reviews, ordered 2 day service and it came today and I am extremely disappointed in this product. It is nothing more than some lime juice and mostly water. It does not help with dry mouth at all. I will have to throw it down the drain. Unfortunately i also have 3 -  2 oz bottles coming, Gezz what a costly mistake. I use the Biotiee spray but my Rite Aide has been out of it for weeks, so I thought I would try something new. I don&#x27;t know where all these great reviews are coming from, I am a Cancer survivor trying to ease some pain. The Biotene is a light gel spray, this is nothing but water, it swishes right down your system in seconds with no lasting effect to ease the dryness. Save your money this is nothing but a waste.</li>
            <li> I did not find this to work at all.  My dentist recommended it, but it did not work for me or my husband</li>
            <li> this item is very good for dry mouth like I have from all of the medications that I take.  I keep it by my bed at night and use it when I wake up with my mouth stuck shut.</li>
            <li> It came in good time.  I have a hard time rating it as it is being used for someone who is not able to communicate with me. But I am happy  with it except that it is so pricey.</li>
            <li> Works well but wish it wasn&#x27;t so temporary…..</li>
            <li> It does a pretty decent job and seems to be better than oasis&#x27;s dry mouth spray. It feels soothing once you spray it on.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works to help dry mouth.  I had a hard time with the taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> really ghelps my dry mouth after radiation treatment</li>
            <li> Helped but just not For long period of time.</li>
            <li> Bought for 88 year old mother whom experiences drty mouth from meds.  She said it works well and has fresh flavor.</li>
            <li> This product came very fast.  It is fairly easy to use, but I did seem to spray it too much.  The taste is tolerable, unlike other dry mouth rinses.  It did help the dry mout feeling.</li>
            <li> I have tried Biotene and the Mouth Kote Moisturizer is considerably better. Keeps mouth moist for longer period of time while sleeping.</li>
            <li> I ordered it for my wife, because her doctor said she needed to use a mouth spray for dry mouth. she said the taste could be better, but believes it helps</li>
            <li> This product should be taken of the market. It has a horribly acrid taste and doesn&#x27;t relieve my dry mouth. Violence mouth spray workks</li>
            <li> The spray works just as well as Bioten an it I like the citrus flavor I don&#x27;t mind it, it is very refreshing!</li>
            <li> My 92 year mother has Sujourn&#x27;s and her body no longer produces saliva. Sleeping has been expecially difficult for her as her mouth gets so dry she cannot swallow. This product taken at bedtime seems to have a lasting effect. She swallows after swishing and it also relieves the dryness in her throat. She has tried many other products and this is by far superior.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth and this is the best pleasant tasting and best working spray I have found.  Great spray that really works !</li>
            <li> I have a problem with dry mouth and started using this when I wake up at night. It really helps!</li>
            <li> I have no complaints.  It works well.</li>
            <li> My wife has had a dry mouth for years and all the doctor suggested was sipping water but not much of a cure when it&#x27;s at night that she has the problem, waking up with her mouth just about stuck shut, but after spraying with this she gets a much better sleep, well until the cat wants to go out at 5.0 am then everyone&#x27;s awake.</li>
            <li> I like the taste and long lasting effect.</li>
            <li> This product does not work it did not do a thing for me except taste terrible I would not recommend</li>
