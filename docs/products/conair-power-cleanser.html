            <li>I used baking soda and gave myself my own microdermabrasion and now my skin looks great</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on this cleanser and decided that the Conair would be a good place to start.</li>

            <li>Once or twice a week is good for me.</li>

            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this!</li>
            <li>We just love it!</li>

            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t make them any more!</li>
            <li>an aside, I love the idea from another reviewer to use it as a stain-removing brush for clothing!</li>
            <li>I love this in the shower!  </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth after use, my pores are minimized and there&#x27;s a great improvement for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>but it is amazing.</li>
            <li>I think they would do more damage than good</li>
            <li>Would not buy again, didn&#x27;t do a thing, better off a purchase on a good quality item.</li>
            <li>My teenagers would like to use this, however, they need their own brush.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice finishing touch after you use the scrubber brush.</li>
            <li>He is very into taking care of himself and says this works perfectly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of a germaphobe</li>
            <li>While I had a reviewer&#x27;s copy, it was nice to see the cleanser have two AA batteries included with it.</li>
            <li>Never had one of these before, but am absolutely loving it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice added feature.  </li>
            <li>I am loving this item.</li>
            <li>I like this thing, my skin always feels nice after using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works great to clean out the pores in  your face.  </li>
            <li>Oh, what a great feeling to get your face so clean.</li>
            <li>And the fact that they include the batteries makes them even more exceptional in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth and bright.</li>
            <li>The attachments (a brush for exfoliation and a sponge for moisturizing) were very easy to attach and remove.</li>
            <li>It works okay, but I own the BriteLeafs one also and</li>
            <li>IF you put it directly on the brush; best to dot the wash on your face THEN use the brush on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that you use your own cleanser and moisturizer with this device.  </li>
            <li>and my skin looks super nice after every use!</li>
            <li>It works great, a reasonable price, good timing with shipping, keep up the good work and thanks!</li>
            <li>Worked great at first.</li>
            <li>Just good, clean, healthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works great nice style gets face clean and soft wish I would have bought one sooner fits hand great easy to control</li>
            <li>The lotion applicator is great, I feel super smooth and well moisturized when I use it</li>
            <li>Was pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Real good facial cleansing tool.</li>
            <li>If I wouldve read the description/reviews better</li>
            <li>Others commented that they used more moisturizing lotion with the buffing applicator</li>
            <li>I am glad I have bought this product.</li>
            <li>Excellent facial cleaner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and it works very well.</li>
            <li>and I glad that conair made one that was well made and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I love that you can use it in the shower and it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;crap out&amp;#34; after being submerged in water.</li>
            <li>I.&lt;br /&gt;I put this in my travel bag, which I keep packed for emergencies, and bought a more quality brush.</li>
            <li>so Im able to handle it.</li>
            <li>but maybe once a week would be ok.</li>
            <li>but I think I was looking for something better.</li>
            <li>To me there is no sense spending more on something else.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is the best solution for my oily skin.</li>
            <li>I love how it cleans your have</li>
            <li>I use the sponge attachment to apply moisturizer and I love the effect.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I purchased this item as an alternative to some of the more pricey items on the market.</li>
            <li>It was perfect with all necessary information on how to operate it.</li>
            <li>My four teenaged daughters love these.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, gets</li>
            <li>Used with a mask or soap and water, it is a practical and safe way to cleanse the skin.</li>
            <li>I find it does maintain a healthy glow to my face by removing dirt and helping to control blackheads/pimples.</li>
            <li>Besides the practical use, it feels wonderful and can be a low-key way to relax by treating yourself to a facial massage.</li>
            <li>If they do offer this I wasn&#x27;t able to find it by searching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a good laugh</li>
            <li>I am fairly satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>So for the price instead of spending hundreds of dollars on one I would say I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love this product and Love this price.</li>
            <li>I was more impressed with the Conair Power Facial Cleanser than I thought I would be.</li>
            <li>I love that you can use your favorite face wash with this product.</li>
            <li>Spend more and get something you can use in the shower.</li>
            <li>The product was ok for the price</li>
            <li>and I am so glad that I bought it.  </li>
            <li>a week) then build to using it more gradually(2-3 times a week).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure after more uses, the pad will distribute lotion as it&#x27;s supposed to...</li>
            <li>I would not recommend keeping it in the shower (as someone else mentioned) unless you can be sure it isn&#x27;t going to get water in it as its not waterproof.  </li>
            <li>but it is nice to have available.</li>
            <li>I love this item.</li>
            <li>better used on scrubbing off clothes&#x27; stains as one of the reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>His face is so much better.</li>
            <li>I was glad to see it was made by Conair as I have been using their hair appliances for years and trust the brand.  </li>
            <li>Taking it out of the box I was glad to see 2 AA batteries provided.  </li>
            <li>I do think my skin benefited more with the moisturizer sponge applicator and would use that attachment</li>
            <li>used the brush 3 times in a row and was glad to see that it did NOT adversely irritate the rosacea prone areas.  </li>
            <li>I do think my skin benefited more with the moisturizer sponge applicator and would use that attachment</li>
            <li>used the brush 3 times in a row and was glad to see that it did NOT adversely irritate the rosacea prone areas.  </li>
            <li>There are so many warnings about keeping the unit away from water -</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s healthy, and glowing.</li>
            <li>love the simplicity if it.</li>
            <li>I am  satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>but I really love it.</li>
            <li>I love this face scrubber, it also comes with the rotating pad so you can apply your lotion with it.</li>
            <li>Purchased a Clensure and has worked better and lasted longer.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>gently clean tile grout (with whitening toothpaste), buff out water rings or spots on wood (using the sponge applicator) and more!</li>
            <li>but it did clean out my pores and make my skin nice.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quick and gentle yet does a very good job.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to avoid using it in the shower and remove the brushes to clean them !</li>
            <li>, I needed something that would really get into my pores effectively and this is it!</li>
            <li>It is nice that I can use my cleanser, but honestly, the brush almost immediately irritates my skin, causing it to turn bright red.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap alternative to a facial cleanser you&#x27;ve already owned, this probably isn&#x27;t your best option.</li>
            <li>2 speeds, highest is very powerful, low is wonderfully soothing.</li>
            <li>My skin has NEVER looked or felt so good...soft, smooth and better absorption of moisturizer with the sponge applicator.</li>
            <li>Love the way my face feels so clean after using this, it cleans so well, and so worth the price!!</li>
            <li>It keeps mty skin nice and smooth after years of suffering with mild acne.</li>
            <li>The bristle brush ALMOST feels too rough on my skin, but it does seem to do an excellent job at exfolation and my skin feels very clean and smooth after cleansing.  </li>
            <li>I love this, it is powerful!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see how my pores and skin respond after more uses.</li>
            <li>The biggest flaws are the fact that the brush head comes off easily.</li>
            <li>It was shipped very quickly &amp;</li>
            <li>Water can easily get into the battery compartment.  </li>
            <li>It works for the value and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The size also makes it easy to pack in a suitcase.</li>
            <li>I had great hopes that the CONAIR POWER FACIAL CLEANSER would work for me and exfoliate my skin to reveal a more youthful glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They can be used with any soap and are easily cleaned and switched out.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use but</li>
            <li>The batteries snap in easily and don&#x27;t add any weight to the already lightweight cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was a decent price, and had fairly good reviews, so I got it.  </li>
            <li>then this is a decent one for a good price.  </li>
            <li>then this is a decent one for a good price.  </li>
            <li>Its a nice gift to give to someone though at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>in all this is a pretty nice product.</li>
            <li>I think that moisturizer and makeup go on more smoothly, since my skin is so perfectly clean.  </li>
            <li>It works fine if you use it once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>The system works fine...</li>
            <li>Once received I really wasn&#x27;t too happy with it after my first use.  </li>
            <li>this will be fine for me.</li>
            <li>Came uber quick!</li>
            <li>the very first time i used it,  my face is softer and more clearer that it was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking it could also be used to clean sliver more quickly and easily (with silver polish),</li>
            <li>Bought 1 for myself and one for my daughter  works great no problems with this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>My skin feels extremely smooth  after using it.</li>
            <li>The BriteLeafs one costs slightly more $ but is worth the added expense.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s be nice to have somewhere to store your brushes, but I guess you can&#x27;t expect too much from a $15.00 product.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the moisture sponge head.</li>
            <li>#cheap</li>

            <li>B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, 0.68-Fluid</li>
            <li>Not waterproof; however, I don&#x27;t think any cheap ones are.</li>
            <li>I would suggest using a light touch because the bristles on the brush can be a bit scratchy and could irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>Cleanses my skin gently and effectively.</li>
            <li>I use this on low speed, makes my face feel great</li>
            <li>Apply light to medium pressure in circular upward strokes.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t be used in a tub or shower, takes batteries, and is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this cleanser as it makes me feel as I had</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth</li>
            <li>The low speed is best for those with more sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Use light brush strokes.</li>
            <li>More powerful than it looks.</li>
            <li>great facial cleanser for the money</li>
            <li>and so far so good with this one.</li>
            <li>This Power Facial Cleanser from Conair is reasonable priced at about $15 and it is awesome!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised by all the good reviews...</li>
            <li>works very well and can&#x27;t beat the price !!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly upset !!!!</li>
            <li>It is very effective in cleaning the skin; I use a creme facial cleanser in the morning and a microscrub in the evening.</li>
            <li>It actually provides a great clean feeling after using it.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!!!</li>
            <li>My skin breaks out easily but isn&#x27;t sensitive to abrasion (no, this product is not abbrasive, just effective)</li>
            <li>battery operated, but still worth it!  </li>
            <li>wish this was shower friendly.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I wanted it to do and even more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not expecting this to last very long, but I&#x27;m glad I got it because it does make my skin look and feel nice, and it was a great way to test out a product like this.</li>
            <li>Really clean opens up your pores .</li>
            <li>feels really clean</li>
            <li>My face feels really clean.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using it and there are days when it feels really good to have that extra stimulation on the skin.</li>
            <li>I cleans my face so clean that my oily skin has improved quite a bit.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean after using makeup all day and it is not drying either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as though the manufacturers felt that if they weren&#x27;t scraping away the cells, your skin wouldn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li>my face feels refreshed and clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Just what I wanted to clean my pores.</li>
            <li>It cleans my face and seems to clean the pores.  </li>
            <li>price is right , great for facial cleaning.</li>
            <li>it is very small and light, yet works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It does it&#x27;s job, but there&#x27;s nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>Clean is good enough!  </li>
            <li>Great concept, but was too rough for my wife&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>The battery life seems to be good, I have had it for several months and have not replaced the batteries yet.  </li>
            <li>The reverse mechanism is cool and the dual speeds.</li>
            <li>Good for daily use.</li>
            <li>I really wanted a face scrubber but couldn&#x27;t stomach the $300 price tag of the others,  I really really love this brush.</li>
            <li>facial brush is good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to, but I think it&#x27;s a good product, especially at the cost.  </li>
            <li>When it first came it worked wonderfully, but it just became less powerful overtime</li>
            <li>The brush is quite wonderful on your face and really does the trick of taking off all the dead skin and making it shine....</li>
            <li>I have blackhead prone skin and this product has helped me tremendously.</li>
            <li>I have mild rosacea however and have been a bit leary of trying one.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this brush with your favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li>I used it three times and it works and pretty cheap too.</li>
            <li>I fall inlove to this Brush, at first I am hesitant to buy this brush because its cheap.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted and the price was fantastic.</li>
            <li>You will clean your face far better with a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>By itself, without using the brush attachment first, it leaves your skin fresh, smooth, and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Yes your skin is exfoliated, but it is too much, too strong.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels good to exfoliate the dry skin</li>
            <li>With several brush heads and easy to use right out of the box, the Conair Power Facial Cleanser does a great job at removing her make-up and keeping her face clean.</li>
            <li>just kind of polished the surface, and the others broke after a few weeks, this one is still going strong!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this brush so far !</li>
            <li>First, it is not waterproof!</li>
            <li>Dry patches and oily T-zone become more prominent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use the brush is not too hard or too soft and it has the perfect speeds.</li>
            <li>Very important feature to have if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I love that it gives instant results, my face feels smooth and polished after the very first use and after every use.</li>
            <li>While it only has two speeds, the cleanser did a fine job of cleaning and refreshing my face.</li>
            <li>little gem is the best tool by far for me.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical to buy this because it was so cheap, but its great!</li>
            <li>love the circular action.  </li>
            <li>but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Love it, use it at least once a week to do a good cleaning to my face.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>i changed the head to the sponge attachment to put on my lotion, and it was soft and helped my skin absorb the moisturizer much better.</li>
            <li>and I do not think it is as powerful</li>
            <li>It does help stimulate the pores of the skin which helps to renew it and give the face a fresh glow.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft, looks better.</li>
            <li>I love this thing, my skin is getting so clear and even toned</li>
            <li>GREAT BUT BRUSH HEAD IS HARD TO CLEAN</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price, as many other comparable products sell for much more.</li>
            <li>I used it every day, so the batteries got drained pretty quickly, but then I started to use rechargeable batteries, and it became a non-issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried the CONAIR POWER FACIAL CLEANSER because I am always looking for better, gentler ways to clean and freshen my aging skin.  </li>
            <li>I was so right.</li>
            <li>Price was right.</li>
            <li>product stopped work right after the 30 days was up for the return</li>
            <li>recommend it to everyone who wants to see their skin glowing and clean.</li>
            <li>it seems to clean gently yet getting all the oils etc off the face.</li>
            <li>but I am not sure if it was more effective</li>
            <li>but I am not sure if it was more effective</li>
            <li>Pay a little more and maybe get a better product.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend for daily use, but other wise it is an OKay product.</li>
            <li>I looked for replacement parts but couldn&#x27;t find any, probably because this device is so cheap you can just buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>Loved it used daily made my face clear up.</li>
            <li>The low price was good for my first cleanser, and since a lot of the facial cleansers can cost from $40 - $200, I was willing to risk the $15 I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  Good for a first time user for the price, but now that I know I like facial cleansers, I am going to get a higher priced, waterproof one.</li>
            <li>The reverse action action is a nice addition to the 3 speeds.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Actually LOVED the brush for as long as it lasted and jumped at this opportunity to have a new and improved version.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this every now and again for extra clean feeling while I shower.</li>
            <li>but my face definitely feels so smooth and clean and refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li>Spins great but the brush is so hard it scratched up my face.</li>
            <li>I love my new facial cleanser , it&#x27;s makes your skin feel so clean and refresh,</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spend money on any of the higher priced brands--this works just as well.  </li>
            <li>It caused irreparable harm to my face the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I used it today for the first time and had to write a review.</li>
            <li>but it seems to make me break out more if used daily.</li>
            <li>I wish it had a larger surface and a bit more power.  </li>
            <li>the BriteLeafs one seems higher quality.</li>
            <li>This is not a soft brush, and if you are sensitive to pinching feelings, this will probably not be good for you.</li>
            <li>I recommend paying $5-$10 extra and getting a better one.</li>
            <li>I bought this product again because the first one I bought lasted for 5 years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also durable enough for men whose skin may be a bit more &amp;#</li>
            <li>The cleanser worked exactly as advertised</li>
            <li>My skin is all tingly and glowy :) Definitely helps with acne.</li>
            <li>No Splash Guard Bristles like many newer facial brushes:</li>
            <li>you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I love about Power Facial</li>
            <li>Most facial brushes on the market just vibrate, this one rotates at two speeds and goes both directions!</li>
            <li>No Clairsonic in my future :)</li>
            <li>No Clairsonic in my future :)</li>
            <li>I can really only see using this once or twice a week at the most, after I have worn makeup.  </li>
            <li>I am completely willing to overlook.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It will not make you look 20, or take away your wrinkles, cure your acne, or be the first step to world peace.  </li>
            <li>Just used this yesterday for the first time.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I received my facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>There are many similar products on the market.</li>
            <li>He uses it at least three times a week and it has greatly inproved his acem problems.  </li>
            <li>This facial brush is much more affordable than others.  </li>
            <li>I ran hot water on it to see if the bristles would soften</li>
            <li>I have so many skin problems that it would take a book to list them and a medical dictionary for me to spell them.  </li>
            <li>The next step is to dot your favorite moisturizer on forehead, cheeks, nose and chin</li>
            <li>After using the facial cleanser be sure to rinse your attachments well and leave to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just so I don&#x27;t irritate my skin, but I think it does a good job of scrubbing away dead skin.  </li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s spinning, it also kind of sounds like it&#x27;s going to stop working at any second (even with brand new batteries).</li>
            <li>I think the Conair&#x27;s price is just right, and it works really well.</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and have been using Original Noxema since age 16.</li>
            <li>Its the perfect speeds, and it half the price of the other brands</li>
            <li>so this is why I decided to try this one and my sister raves that this makes her skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>just as good as the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>I finally purchased a power cleaner and love this one, it gently exfoliates my face</li>
            <li>It is good for removing chapped skin or small blemishes.</li>
            <li>I have used this a few days now and love how clean and polished my face feels.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m cursed with super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was looking for a deep clean but this product only seems to cleanse the top layer of skin...</li>
            <li>The heads are easily removed and cleaned but still will likely wear out over time.</li>
            <li>Benefits: Quality, Power, Ergonomics, Sustainability at a decent price point!</li>
            <li>Benefits: Quality, Power, Ergonomics, Sustainability at a decent price point!</li>
            <li>Really cleaned up my face, pores in my nose particularly, which is why I bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t that great for me personally,  I got a few uses out of it</li>
            <li>I absolutely like this product but out of the box you will scratch your head because it didn&#x27;t came with instructions or guide</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>My daughter loves it - probably over-priced for a Conair brand but cheaper than the real name brands.</li>
            <li>it was reasonable priced.</li>
            <li>doesnt really have a lot of power in its spin</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I used to use those strips that you wet and stick to your nose to pull out yucky stuff, now I never have anything on those, so I don&#x27;t use them any more.</li>
            <li>Okay, but not much power.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not waterproof, and I don&#x27;t think it is very water resistant either.  </li>
            <li>Eats the batteries fast though</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it and it prompted me to purchase another one for myself.  </li>
            <li>The brush is gentle and exfoliates.  </li>
            <li>My skin is much cleaner and brighter.  </li>
            <li>Real upset</li>
            <li>This really helps with BOTH cleansing and applying moisturizer.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The stiffness of the brush is just too much.  </li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>it makes my face feel much cleaner and healthier.  </li>
            <li>instruction manual really didn&#x27;t offer much.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>I really like using this Powered Cleanser for washing my face.</li>
            <li>i would recommend it to any one with skin issues because it really does cleanse.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my sister she has very oily skin</li>
            <li>I only wish it didn&#x27;t have only a woman pictured on the box, because it&#x27;s an ideal grooming gadget for young men to use as a deep cleaner and acne preventer.</li>
            <li>It feels fresh and not so sensitive when I apply moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t use the sponge attachment so much</li>
            <li>Conair Products are very reliable products.</li>
            <li>I really like this cleanser.</li>
            <li>The attachments snap on and off very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>or I just spent more time on my skin with the brush than I do with a washcloth.  </li>
            <li>or I just spent more time on my skin with the brush than I do with a washcloth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing and my fingers don&#x27;t get greasy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t used all that much.  </li>
            <li>Not that much money, but</li>
            <li>It is better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>when i opened it, i thought the brush bristles were very coarse, but when i used it on my face it felt really good and left my skin soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I used the clarisonic before and even though expensive it is more effective for decreasing acne.</li>
            <li>So, the applicator sponge was misshapen after the first use (with more moisturizer going into sponge than on skin) and any sort of pressure s-l-o-w-s the unit down to almost nothing.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good product for clear skin user but if your looking for that deep action clean, you might want to spend a little more money.</li>
            <li>This power facial cleanser is just as good as the more expensive brand that is out there right now.</li>
            <li>The bristels are kind of on the stiff side (but still gentle), which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Thankfully this product is basically idiot-proof and I was able to get going even with the less than stellar</li>
            <li>It works and it does exactly what it says it does, nothing more and nothing less.</li>
            <li>I was excited about receiving this especially since it took me awhile to buy it.  </li>
            <li>I was looking at using a power facial cleanser to help clean my face (remove all the oil) without drying my skin.</li>
            <li>The cleanser helps to clean the face deeply.</li>
            <li>I tried to us it a few more times just to see if maybe it was just the first us</li>
            <li>If a company wants to remain successful, it must stand behind its products</li>
            <li>You can also use the sponge applicator with a mild, cream exfoliator if you aren&#x27;t interested in using the (very soft) brush attachment to deep clean and exfoliate at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems cheap and the brushes are not soft enough to clean our skin.</li>
            <li>Be careful not to get water into the battery compartment and take off the exfoliating / massaging head to clean.,!</li>
            <li>I have always wanted a facial scrubber, but they were always out of my price range or required special pads.  </li>
            <li>with any facial cleansing brush, skin results will only be as good as the facial cleanser, serums and moisturizer you use with it.  </li>
            <li>If your face is sensitive, low speed should be fine.</li>
            <li>Replacement parts wouldn&#x27;t be much cheaper than a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how it was going to go, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on such an item initially.</li>
            <li>better than some the more expensive brands which just vibrate.</li>
            <li>I love to use a mask or some time of facial cleanser that exfoliates, and when I saw the Conair Power Facial Cleanser I wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li>It then boils down to whether or not those features are important enough to pay a huge chunk of change for them?</li>
            <li>I wish I would have used it in high school.</li>
            <li>I have only had this product for a short time, but think it does a great job for daily face cleansing, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>We would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>so I was pleasantly surprised when this cleanser exfoliated my skin very well but did not leave me super red!</li>
            <li>And the sponge applicator actually works pretty well too!</li>
            <li>I love this little machine.</li>
            <li>The Conair Power Facial Cleanser is a nice little gadget that will easily and thoroughly cleanse your face, ridding it of dulling dead skin cells and letting your fresh new skin shine through.  </li>
            <li>This is amazing to say the least.  </li>
            <li>Well, it seems to be very well made and the brushes aren&#x27;t overly abrasive while still leaving her with shiny, soft skin.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s soft and works very well.</li>
            <li>the bristles are soft and the spinning is gentle.  </li>
            <li>Its soft and gentle on my face.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it &amp;#34;clicked or snapped&amp;#34; in place, but it doesnt (at least mine doesnt).</li>
            <li>My skin has cleared up considerably since using this product, I&#x27;ve used 3 other brands with rotating heads similar to this one, this one is so far the best, the other brushes bristles were too soft and didn&#x27;t get into my pores...</li>
            <li>It worked well for the cost...wish it had a few more attachments included.it was gift for my daughter for xmas.</li>
            <li>But, this product was worth the money just as a facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>Once a week sure, everyday</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older my skin has gotten very sensitive.</li>
            <li>the brush got worn super fast, and the instructions say it cant get wet...</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin, and everything turns my skin red</li>
            <li>Not too big and just strong enough.</li>
            <li>I did like it that it had a two speed and circling right and left.</li>
            <li>Of course, at only $14.99 it is just as easy to purchase an entire new one when needed.</li>
            <li>Of course, at only $14.99 it is just as easy to purchase an entire new one when needed.</li>
            <li>I just soak the head in peroxide from time to time to kill any bacteria and it&#x27;s likew new.</li>
            <li>and then it just would have problems where the NEW batteries weren&#x27;t working the head</li>
            <li>The included one was a little rough for my liking, and I&#x27;d love to actually use this product more often, but I don&#x27;t think my sensitive skin could handle it.</li>
            <li>I almost cried because ai have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The low power is gentle and the high power isn&#x27;t too high.  </li>
            <li>A very soft brush and a sponge applicator.  </li>
            <li>Very classy.</li>
            <li>The sponge attachment also does a fine job at working moisturizer into my skin, but I suspect it wastes a bit of moisturizer each time as some inevitably gets absorbed by the sponge and has to be rinsed out after each use.  </li>
            <li>Occasionally, I did use the higher speed, and had no problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some were up to $100, yet did the exact same thing as this one.</li>
            <li>many of the upscale cleansers that we have had in the past have not lived up to these standards</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of a facial brush cleanser.  </li>
            <li>While it works fairly well as others here have noted the one brush wears out fairly quickly and it&#x27;s impossible to get a replacement.</li>
            <li>It was mildly abrasive on my face and it felt like it was too rough</li>
            <li>So gross, but so cool at the same time!</li>
            <li>I could not believe the price of under $15 would get a tool that would make my skin feel so alive after only the first use.  </li>
            <li>Works in a circular motion I just wish it was a little more powerful if you press down on it, it stops working.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft but not too soft!</li>
            <li>but otherwise it is comfortable and it is not actually recommended to be used dry.</li>
            <li>The brush is a little rough, I use it with a mild cleanser most days, only once in a while with a scrub because I wouldn&#x27;t want to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Apparently sponge is for buffing to a high shine--pass...</li>
            <li>Now i use it without batteries and my face is still clear, i don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>2 months later the effects are still very visible.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both use the brush daily and find that it cleans really well.  </li>
            <li>I think it is just too much for my skin on a daily basis</li>
            <li>So far we have had no problems with either device.  </li>
            <li>but it is very convenient for traveling since it is smaller and battery operated</li>

            <li>Olay Professional Pro-X Replacement Brush Heads, 2 Count]]...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll bet I would not have developed age spots if I had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m over 60 with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>: I wish they had the option of purchasing a separate brush that is softer or designed for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>only beauty trick that really cleans out my pores</li>
            <li>Even for OLD skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a sensitive face.</li>
            <li>I also like the idea (although it seemed strange at first) of using the foam pad attachment to apply my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>oh well I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and it still didn&#x27;t go as far as it used to.</li>
            <li>Beware if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have not used the soft attachment yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks, but I&#x27;m really pleased with</li>
            <li>As we reach the age of 50, our skin gets much more sensitive, and it loses its elasticity.  </li>
            <li>it comes with a little sponge so you can add your lotion after you clean your face.  </li>
            <li>: wet your face at the sink, add cleanser and use the spinning brush to deep clean your pores.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would not recommend buying the CONAIR POWER FACIAL CLEANSER if you have older skin.  </li>
            <li>The bristles on the brush are pretty soft and tend to all move toward the center of the brush head in use.</li>
            <li>It has 2 speeds, low &amp; high, as well as a forward &amp; a reverse button&lt;</li>
            <li>I bought this at the modest start of my new facial regimen.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced, works well and is very gentle for my sensitive, small pore, allergic reaction prone skin.  </li>
            <li>I recommend that the first step is to first wet your face with a splash of water or wet washcloth.  </li>
            <li>I used the same amount I would normally use.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected and was looking for.</li>
            <li>The sponge lasted for about 5 mins and the brush is pretty rough plastic.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my face because my skin feel so soft and like velvet not like the sad wrinkled woman that it makes me wonder who that really is when I look in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>This was a gift for my daughter last year, it broke with in two months, just quit working, She is a grown woman, not hard on things.</li>
            <li>The brushed could be a little softer, but my face feels soft and clean after using.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as powerful as a previous one that I owned.</li>
            <li>However my first choice would be one with a protective case and maybe a couple of other skin cleansing accessories.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same OLD version complete with the same OLD problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time it died was because the batteries that came with it were not fully charged (in general, when a product comes with batteries, they don&#x27;t typically last very long), which did not surprise me.  </li>
            <li>Using the lower speed was good, it was not too harsh for me to use up to two times a day (although, I am not sure I would recommend using it either multiple times a day or even daily for someone with sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>That said, my face certainly feels cleaner after using this and it&#x27;s not at all damaging or too rough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple, inexpensive alternative to more fancy and ridiculously over priced devises.</li>
            <li>I use it daily to keep my skin clear</li>
            <li>While I think it should be reserved for two to three times a week, it is not harsh enough to do damage</li>
            <li>As for the actually scrubbing... with frequent use it cleans dirt well and minimizes the chance of breakouts.</li>
            <li>The brush attachment has soft enough bristles to reduce the risk of damage to fabrics.</li>
            <li>a professional facial done.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t any more irritating than a washcloth would be.</li>
            <li>It removes dry skin very well and polishes the moisturizer deep into the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other products similar to this one and was surprised this one was so reasonably priced and so efficient.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean as deeply as she would like, but it&#x27;s much less expensive than many on the market.  </li>
            <li>either because the bristles became soiled and hard to clean off.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have stated, Clarisonic (and other brands) of similar facial cleansing brushes can run over $100 for a starter set; while they have replacement parts available, those extra brushes and sponges also run about $40 each.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had an actual professional facial, but this left my skin feeling softer and cleaner.</li>
            <li>It has a small, powerful motor, and my skin is just glowing from using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I first looked at this product, I read the reviews and saw alot of people saying it was too harsh</li>
            <li>Bristles are a tad tough but as long as you don&#x27;t press down too hard, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>I suggest experimenting with the settings as the highest one may feel too harsh for sensitive skin, and the lower one may feel ineffective--it depends on the state of your skin for that particular day.</li>
            <li>It does eat batteries, but no worse than other facial cleaners similar to it.</li>
            <li>I can hardly believe how quickly the Facial Cleanser arrived.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say that if my skin starts to look even a tiny bit as young and alive as this little brush has made my face feel, I will never be without one again.  </li>
            <li>The brush is soft enough it would be difficult to overdo it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a nice little budget facial cleanser.</li>

            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t make them any more!</li>
            <li> an aside, I love the idea from another reviewer to use it as a stain-removing brush for clothing!</li>
            <li> I love this in the shower!  </li>
            <li> My skin is smooth after use, my pores are minimized and there&#x27;s a great improvement for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> but it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I think they would do more damage than good</li>
            <li> Would not buy again, didn&#x27;t do a thing, better off a purchase on a good quality item.</li>
            <li> My teenagers would like to use this, however, they need their own brush.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice finishing touch after you use the scrubber brush.</li>
            <li> He is very into taking care of himself and says this works perfectly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of a germaphobe</li>
            <li> While I had a reviewer&#x27;s copy, it was nice to see the cleanser have two AA batteries included with it.</li>
            <li> Never had one of these before, but am absolutely loving it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice added feature.  </li>
            <li> I am loving this item.</li>
            <li> I like this thing, my skin always feels nice after using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works great to clean out the pores in  your face.  </li>
            <li> Oh, what a great feeling to get your face so clean.</li>
            <li> And the fact that they include the batteries makes them even more exceptional in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth and bright.</li>
            <li> The attachments (a brush for exfoliation and a sponge for moisturizing) were very easy to attach and remove.</li>
            <li> It works okay, but I own the BriteLeafs one also and</li>
            <li> IF you put it directly on the brush; best to dot the wash on your face THEN use the brush on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that you use your own cleanser and moisturizer with this device.  </li>
            <li> and my skin looks super nice after every use!</li>
            <li> It works great, a reasonable price, good timing with shipping, keep up the good work and thanks!</li>
            <li> Worked great at first.</li>
            <li> Just good, clean, healthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works great nice style gets face clean and soft wish I would have bought one sooner fits hand great easy to control</li>
            <li> The lotion applicator is great, I feel super smooth and well moisturized when I use it</li>
            <li> Was pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Real good facial cleansing tool.</li>
            <li> If I wouldve read the description/reviews better</li>
            <li> Others commented that they used more moisturizing lotion with the buffing applicator</li>
            <li> I am glad I have bought this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent facial cleaner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and it works very well.</li>
            <li> and I glad that conair made one that was well made and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I love that you can use it in the shower and it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;crap out&amp;#34; after being submerged in water.</li>
            <li> I.&lt;br /&gt;I put this in my travel bag, which I keep packed for emergencies, and bought a more quality brush.</li>
            <li> so Im able to handle it.</li>
            <li> but maybe once a week would be ok.</li>
            <li> but I think I was looking for something better.</li>
            <li> To me there is no sense spending more on something else.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is the best solution for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> I love how it cleans your have</li>
            <li> I use the sponge attachment to apply moisturizer and I love the effect.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as an alternative to some of the more pricey items on the market.</li>
            <li> It was perfect with all necessary information on how to operate it.</li>
            <li> My four teenaged daughters love these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, gets</li>
            <li> Used with a mask or soap and water, it is a practical and safe way to cleanse the skin.</li>
            <li> I find it does maintain a healthy glow to my face by removing dirt and helping to control blackheads/pimples.</li>
            <li> Besides the practical use, it feels wonderful and can be a low-key way to relax by treating yourself to a facial massage.</li>
            <li> If they do offer this I wasn&#x27;t able to find it by searching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a good laugh</li>
            <li> I am fairly satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> So for the price instead of spending hundreds of dollars on one I would say I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this product and Love this price.</li>
            <li> I was more impressed with the Conair Power Facial Cleanser than I thought I would be.</li>
            <li> I love that you can use your favorite face wash with this product.</li>
            <li> Spend more and get something you can use in the shower.</li>
            <li> The product was ok for the price</li>
            <li> and I am so glad that I bought it.  </li>
            <li> a week) then build to using it more gradually(2-3 times a week).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure after more uses, the pad will distribute lotion as it&#x27;s supposed to...</li>
            <li> I would not recommend keeping it in the shower (as someone else mentioned) unless you can be sure it isn&#x27;t going to get water in it as its not waterproof.  </li>
            <li> but it is nice to have available.</li>
            <li> I love this item.</li>
            <li> better used on scrubbing off clothes&#x27; stains as one of the reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> His face is so much better.</li>
            <li> I was glad to see it was made by Conair as I have been using their hair appliances for years and trust the brand.  </li>
            <li> Taking it out of the box I was glad to see 2 AA batteries provided.  </li>
            <li> I do think my skin benefited more with the moisturizer sponge applicator and would use that attachment</li>
            <li> used the brush 3 times in a row and was glad to see that it did NOT adversely irritate the rosacea prone areas.  </li>
            <li> I do think my skin benefited more with the moisturizer sponge applicator and would use that attachment</li>
            <li> used the brush 3 times in a row and was glad to see that it did NOT adversely irritate the rosacea prone areas.  </li>
            <li> There are so many warnings about keeping the unit away from water -</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s healthy, and glowing.</li>
            <li> love the simplicity if it.</li>
            <li> I am  satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> but I really love it.</li>
            <li> I love this face scrubber, it also comes with the rotating pad so you can apply your lotion with it.</li>
            <li> Purchased a Clensure and has worked better and lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> gently clean tile grout (with whitening toothpaste), buff out water rings or spots on wood (using the sponge applicator) and more!</li>
            <li> but it did clean out my pores and make my skin nice.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quick and gentle yet does a very good job.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to avoid using it in the shower and remove the brushes to clean them !</li>
            <li> , I needed something that would really get into my pores effectively and this is it!</li>
            <li> It is nice that I can use my cleanser, but honestly, the brush almost immediately irritates my skin, causing it to turn bright red.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap alternative to a facial cleanser you&#x27;ve already owned, this probably isn&#x27;t your best option.</li>
            <li> 2 speeds, highest is very powerful, low is wonderfully soothing.</li>
            <li> My skin has NEVER looked or felt so good...soft, smooth and better absorption of moisturizer with the sponge applicator.</li>
            <li> Love the way my face feels so clean after using this, it cleans so well, and so worth the price!!</li>
            <li> It keeps mty skin nice and smooth after years of suffering with mild acne.</li>
            <li> The bristle brush ALMOST feels too rough on my skin, but it does seem to do an excellent job at exfolation and my skin feels very clean and smooth after cleansing.  </li>
            <li> I love this, it is powerful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see how my pores and skin respond after more uses.</li>
            <li> The biggest flaws are the fact that the brush head comes off easily.</li>
            <li> It was shipped very quickly &amp;</li>
            <li> Water can easily get into the battery compartment.  </li>
            <li> It works for the value and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The size also makes it easy to pack in a suitcase.</li>
            <li> I had great hopes that the CONAIR POWER FACIAL CLEANSER would work for me and exfoliate my skin to reveal a more youthful glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They can be used with any soap and are easily cleaned and switched out.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use but</li>
            <li> The batteries snap in easily and don&#x27;t add any weight to the already lightweight cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a decent price, and had fairly good reviews, so I got it.  </li>
            <li> then this is a decent one for a good price.  </li>
            <li> then this is a decent one for a good price.  </li>
            <li> Its a nice gift to give to someone though at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> in all this is a pretty nice product.</li>
            <li> I think that moisturizer and makeup go on more smoothly, since my skin is so perfectly clean.  </li>
            <li> It works fine if you use it once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> The system works fine...</li>
            <li> Once received I really wasn&#x27;t too happy with it after my first use.  </li>
            <li> this will be fine for me.</li>
            <li> Came uber quick!</li>
            <li> the very first time i used it,  my face is softer and more clearer that it was.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking it could also be used to clean sliver more quickly and easily (with silver polish),</li>
            <li> Bought 1 for myself and one for my daughter  works great no problems with this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> My skin feels extremely smooth  after using it.</li>
            <li> The BriteLeafs one costs slightly more $ but is worth the added expense.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s be nice to have somewhere to store your brushes, but I guess you can&#x27;t expect too much from a $15.00 product.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the moisture sponge head.</li>
            <li> #cheap</li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, 0.68-Fluid</li>
            <li> B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, 0.68-Fluid</li>
            <li> Not waterproof; however, I don&#x27;t think any cheap ones are.</li>
            <li> I would suggest using a light touch because the bristles on the brush can be a bit scratchy and could irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> Cleanses my skin gently and effectively.</li>
            <li> I use this on low speed, makes my face feel great</li>
            <li> Apply light to medium pressure in circular upward strokes.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be used in a tub or shower, takes batteries, and is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this cleanser as it makes me feel as I had</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth</li>
            <li> The low speed is best for those with more sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Use light brush strokes.</li>
            <li> More powerful than it looks.</li>
            <li> great facial cleanser for the money</li>
            <li> and so far so good with this one.</li>
            <li> This Power Facial Cleanser from Conair is reasonable priced at about $15 and it is awesome!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by all the good reviews...</li>
            <li> works very well and can&#x27;t beat the price !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly upset !!!!</li>
            <li> It is very effective in cleaning the skin; I use a creme facial cleanser in the morning and a microscrub in the evening.</li>
            <li> It actually provides a great clean feeling after using it.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My skin breaks out easily but isn&#x27;t sensitive to abrasion (no, this product is not abbrasive, just effective)</li>
            <li> battery operated, but still worth it!  </li>
            <li> wish this was shower friendly.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I wanted it to do and even more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not expecting this to last very long, but I&#x27;m glad I got it because it does make my skin look and feel nice, and it was a great way to test out a product like this.</li>
            <li> Really clean opens up your pores .</li>
            <li> feels really clean</li>
            <li> My face feels really clean.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy using it and there are days when it feels really good to have that extra stimulation on the skin.</li>
            <li> I cleans my face so clean that my oily skin has improved quite a bit.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean after using makeup all day and it is not drying either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as though the manufacturers felt that if they weren&#x27;t scraping away the cells, your skin wouldn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li> my face feels refreshed and clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted to clean my pores.</li>
            <li> It cleans my face and seems to clean the pores.  </li>
            <li> price is right , great for facial cleaning.</li>
            <li> it is very small and light, yet works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job, but there&#x27;s nothing special about it.</li>
            <li> Clean is good enough!  </li>
            <li> Great concept, but was too rough for my wife&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> The battery life seems to be good, I have had it for several months and have not replaced the batteries yet.  </li>
            <li> The reverse mechanism is cool and the dual speeds.</li>
            <li> Good for daily use.</li>
            <li> I really wanted a face scrubber but couldn&#x27;t stomach the $300 price tag of the others,  I really really love this brush.</li>
            <li> facial brush is good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to, but I think it&#x27;s a good product, especially at the cost.  </li>
            <li> When it first came it worked wonderfully, but it just became less powerful overtime</li>
            <li> The brush is quite wonderful on your face and really does the trick of taking off all the dead skin and making it shine....</li>
            <li> I have blackhead prone skin and this product has helped me tremendously.</li>
            <li> I have mild rosacea however and have been a bit leary of trying one.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush with your favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li> I used it three times and it works and pretty cheap too.</li>
            <li> I fall inlove to this Brush, at first I am hesitant to buy this brush because its cheap.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted and the price was fantastic.</li>
            <li> You will clean your face far better with a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> By itself, without using the brush attachment first, it leaves your skin fresh, smooth, and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and gentle on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Yes your skin is exfoliated, but it is too much, too strong.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels good to exfoliate the dry skin</li>
            <li> With several brush heads and easy to use right out of the box, the Conair Power Facial Cleanser does a great job at removing her make-up and keeping her face clean.</li>
            <li> just kind of polished the surface, and the others broke after a few weeks, this one is still going strong!</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush so far !</li>
            <li> First, it is not waterproof!</li>
            <li> Dry patches and oily T-zone become more prominent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use the brush is not too hard or too soft and it has the perfect speeds.</li>
            <li> Very important feature to have if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I love that it gives instant results, my face feels smooth and polished after the very first use and after every use.</li>
            <li> While it only has two speeds, the cleanser did a fine job of cleaning and refreshing my face.</li>
            <li> little gem is the best tool by far for me.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy this because it was so cheap, but its great!</li>
            <li> love the circular action.  </li>
            <li> but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Love it, use it at least once a week to do a good cleaning to my face.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> i changed the head to the sponge attachment to put on my lotion, and it was soft and helped my skin absorb the moisturizer much better.</li>
            <li> and I do not think it is as powerful</li>
            <li> It does help stimulate the pores of the skin which helps to renew it and give the face a fresh glow.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft, looks better.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, my skin is getting so clear and even toned</li>
            <li> GREAT BUT BRUSH HEAD IS HARD TO CLEAN</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price, as many other comparable products sell for much more.</li>
            <li> I used it every day, so the batteries got drained pretty quickly, but then I started to use rechargeable batteries, and it became a non-issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried the CONAIR POWER FACIAL CLEANSER because I am always looking for better, gentler ways to clean and freshen my aging skin.  </li>
            <li> I was so right.</li>
            <li> Price was right.</li>
            <li> product stopped work right after the 30 days was up for the return</li>
            <li> recommend it to everyone who wants to see their skin glowing and clean.</li>
            <li> it seems to clean gently yet getting all the oils etc off the face.</li>
            <li> but I am not sure if it was more effective</li>
            <li> but I am not sure if it was more effective</li>
            <li> Pay a little more and maybe get a better product.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend for daily use, but other wise it is an OKay product.</li>
            <li> I looked for replacement parts but couldn&#x27;t find any, probably because this device is so cheap you can just buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> Loved it used daily made my face clear up.</li>
            <li> The low price was good for my first cleanser, and since a lot of the facial cleansers can cost from $40 - $200, I was willing to risk the $15 I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  Good for a first time user for the price, but now that I know I like facial cleansers, I am going to get a higher priced, waterproof one.</li>
            <li> The reverse action action is a nice addition to the 3 speeds.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Actually LOVED the brush for as long as it lasted and jumped at this opportunity to have a new and improved version.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this every now and again for extra clean feeling while I shower.</li>
            <li> but my face definitely feels so smooth and clean and refreshed after using it.</li>
            <li> Spins great but the brush is so hard it scratched up my face.</li>
            <li> I love my new facial cleanser , it&#x27;s makes your skin feel so clean and refresh,</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend money on any of the higher priced brands--this works just as well.  </li>
            <li> It caused irreparable harm to my face the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I used it today for the first time and had to write a review.</li>
            <li> but it seems to make me break out more if used daily.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a larger surface and a bit more power.  </li>
            <li> the BriteLeafs one seems higher quality.</li>
            <li> This is not a soft brush, and if you are sensitive to pinching feelings, this will probably not be good for you.</li>
            <li> I recommend paying $5-$10 extra and getting a better one.</li>
            <li> I bought this product again because the first one I bought lasted for 5 years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also durable enough for men whose skin may be a bit more &amp;#</li>
            <li> The cleanser worked exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> My skin is all tingly and glowy :) Definitely helps with acne.</li>
            <li> No Splash Guard Bristles like many newer facial brushes:</li>
            <li> you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I love about Power Facial</li>
            <li> Most facial brushes on the market just vibrate, this one rotates at two speeds and goes both directions!</li>
            <li> No Clairsonic in my future :)</li>
            <li> No Clairsonic in my future :)</li>
            <li> I can really only see using this once or twice a week at the most, after I have worn makeup.  </li>
            <li> I am completely willing to overlook.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It will not make you look 20, or take away your wrinkles, cure your acne, or be the first step to world peace.  </li>
            <li> Just used this yesterday for the first time.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I received my facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> There are many similar products on the market.</li>
            <li> He uses it at least three times a week and it has greatly inproved his acem problems.  </li>
            <li> This facial brush is much more affordable than others.  </li>
            <li> I ran hot water on it to see if the bristles would soften</li>
            <li> I have so many skin problems that it would take a book to list them and a medical dictionary for me to spell them.  </li>
            <li> The next step is to dot your favorite moisturizer on forehead, cheeks, nose and chin</li>
            <li> After using the facial cleanser be sure to rinse your attachments well and leave to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just so I don&#x27;t irritate my skin, but I think it does a good job of scrubbing away dead skin.  </li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s spinning, it also kind of sounds like it&#x27;s going to stop working at any second (even with brand new batteries).</li>
            <li> I think the Conair&#x27;s price is just right, and it works really well.</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and have been using Original Noxema since age 16.</li>
            <li> Its the perfect speeds, and it half the price of the other brands</li>
            <li> so this is why I decided to try this one and my sister raves that this makes her skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> just as good as the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I finally purchased a power cleaner and love this one, it gently exfoliates my face</li>
            <li> It is good for removing chapped skin or small blemishes.</li>
            <li> I have used this a few days now and love how clean and polished my face feels.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m cursed with super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was looking for a deep clean but this product only seems to cleanse the top layer of skin...</li>
            <li> The heads are easily removed and cleaned but still will likely wear out over time.</li>
            <li> Benefits: Quality, Power, Ergonomics, Sustainability at a decent price point!</li>
            <li> Benefits: Quality, Power, Ergonomics, Sustainability at a decent price point!</li>
            <li> Really cleaned up my face, pores in my nose particularly, which is why I bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that great for me personally,  I got a few uses out of it</li>
            <li> I absolutely like this product but out of the box you will scratch your head because it didn&#x27;t came with instructions or guide</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li> My daughter loves it - probably over-priced for a Conair brand but cheaper than the real name brands.</li>
            <li> it was reasonable priced.</li>
            <li> doesnt really have a lot of power in its spin</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I used to use those strips that you wet and stick to your nose to pull out yucky stuff, now I never have anything on those, so I don&#x27;t use them any more.</li>
            <li> Okay, but not much power.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not waterproof, and I don&#x27;t think it is very water resistant either.  </li>
            <li> Eats the batteries fast though</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it and it prompted me to purchase another one for myself.  </li>
            <li> The brush is gentle and exfoliates.  </li>
            <li> My skin is much cleaner and brighter.  </li>
            <li> Real upset</li>
            <li> This really helps with BOTH cleansing and applying moisturizer.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The stiffness of the brush is just too much.  </li>
            <li> highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it makes my face feel much cleaner and healthier.  </li>
            <li> instruction manual really didn&#x27;t offer much.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> I really like using this Powered Cleanser for washing my face.</li>
            <li> i would recommend it to any one with skin issues because it really does cleanse.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sister she has very oily skin</li>
            <li> I only wish it didn&#x27;t have only a woman pictured on the box, because it&#x27;s an ideal grooming gadget for young men to use as a deep cleaner and acne preventer.</li>
            <li> It feels fresh and not so sensitive when I apply moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t use the sponge attachment so much</li>
            <li> Conair Products are very reliable products.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser.</li>
            <li> The attachments snap on and off very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> or I just spent more time on my skin with the brush than I do with a washcloth.  </li>
            <li> or I just spent more time on my skin with the brush than I do with a washcloth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soothing and my fingers don&#x27;t get greasy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t used all that much.  </li>
            <li> Not that much money, but</li>
            <li> It is better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> when i opened it, i thought the brush bristles were very coarse, but when i used it on my face it felt really good and left my skin soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I used the clarisonic before and even though expensive it is more effective for decreasing acne.</li>
            <li> So, the applicator sponge was misshapen after the first use (with more moisturizer going into sponge than on skin) and any sort of pressure s-l-o-w-s the unit down to almost nothing.  </li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a good product for clear skin user but if your looking for that deep action clean, you might want to spend a little more money.</li>
            <li> This power facial cleanser is just as good as the more expensive brand that is out there right now.</li>
            <li> The bristels are kind of on the stiff side (but still gentle), which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Thankfully this product is basically idiot-proof and I was able to get going even with the less than stellar</li>
            <li> It works and it does exactly what it says it does, nothing more and nothing less.</li>
            <li> I was excited about receiving this especially since it took me awhile to buy it.  </li>
            <li> I was looking at using a power facial cleanser to help clean my face (remove all the oil) without drying my skin.</li>
            <li> The cleanser helps to clean the face deeply.</li>
            <li> I tried to us it a few more times just to see if maybe it was just the first us</li>
            <li> If a company wants to remain successful, it must stand behind its products</li>
            <li> You can also use the sponge applicator with a mild, cream exfoliator if you aren&#x27;t interested in using the (very soft) brush attachment to deep clean and exfoliate at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems cheap and the brushes are not soft enough to clean our skin.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to get water into the battery compartment and take off the exfoliating / massaging head to clean.,!</li>
            <li> I have always wanted a facial scrubber, but they were always out of my price range or required special pads.  </li>
            <li> with any facial cleansing brush, skin results will only be as good as the facial cleanser, serums and moisturizer you use with it.  </li>
            <li> If your face is sensitive, low speed should be fine.</li>
            <li> Replacement parts wouldn&#x27;t be much cheaper than a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how it was going to go, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on such an item initially.</li>
            <li> better than some the more expensive brands which just vibrate.</li>
            <li> I love to use a mask or some time of facial cleanser that exfoliates, and when I saw the Conair Power Facial Cleanser I wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li> It then boils down to whether or not those features are important enough to pay a huge chunk of change for them?</li>
            <li> I wish I would have used it in high school.</li>
            <li> I have only had this product for a short time, but think it does a great job for daily face cleansing, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> We would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> so I was pleasantly surprised when this cleanser exfoliated my skin very well but did not leave me super red!</li>
            <li> And the sponge applicator actually works pretty well too!</li>
            <li> I love this little machine.</li>
            <li> The Conair Power Facial Cleanser is a nice little gadget that will easily and thoroughly cleanse your face, ridding it of dulling dead skin cells and letting your fresh new skin shine through.  </li>
            <li> This is amazing to say the least.  </li>
            <li> Well, it seems to be very well made and the brushes aren&#x27;t overly abrasive while still leaving her with shiny, soft skin.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s soft and works very well.</li>
            <li> the bristles are soft and the spinning is gentle.  </li>
            <li> Its soft and gentle on my face.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it &amp;#34;clicked or snapped&amp;#34; in place, but it doesnt (at least mine doesnt).</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up considerably since using this product, I&#x27;ve used 3 other brands with rotating heads similar to this one, this one is so far the best, the other brushes bristles were too soft and didn&#x27;t get into my pores...</li>
            <li> It worked well for the cost...wish it had a few more attachments included.it was gift for my daughter for xmas.</li>
            <li> But, this product was worth the money just as a facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Once a week sure, everyday</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older my skin has gotten very sensitive.</li>
            <li> the brush got worn super fast, and the instructions say it cant get wet...</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, and everything turns my skin red</li>
            <li> Not too big and just strong enough.</li>
            <li> I did like it that it had a two speed and circling right and left.</li>
            <li> Of course, at only $14.99 it is just as easy to purchase an entire new one when needed.</li>
            <li> Of course, at only $14.99 it is just as easy to purchase an entire new one when needed.</li>
            <li> I just soak the head in peroxide from time to time to kill any bacteria and it&#x27;s likew new.</li>
            <li> and then it just would have problems where the NEW batteries weren&#x27;t working the head</li>
            <li> The included one was a little rough for my liking, and I&#x27;d love to actually use this product more often, but I don&#x27;t think my sensitive skin could handle it.</li>
            <li> I almost cried because ai have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The low power is gentle and the high power isn&#x27;t too high.  </li>
            <li> A very soft brush and a sponge applicator.  </li>
            <li> Very classy.</li>
            <li> The sponge attachment also does a fine job at working moisturizer into my skin, but I suspect it wastes a bit of moisturizer each time as some inevitably gets absorbed by the sponge and has to be rinsed out after each use.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally, I did use the higher speed, and had no problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some were up to $100, yet did the exact same thing as this one.</li>
            <li> many of the upscale cleansers that we have had in the past have not lived up to these standards</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of a facial brush cleanser.  </li>
            <li> While it works fairly well as others here have noted the one brush wears out fairly quickly and it&#x27;s impossible to get a replacement.</li>
            <li> It was mildly abrasive on my face and it felt like it was too rough</li>
            <li> So gross, but so cool at the same time!</li>
            <li> I could not believe the price of under $15 would get a tool that would make my skin feel so alive after only the first use.  </li>
            <li> Works in a circular motion I just wish it was a little more powerful if you press down on it, it stops working.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft but not too soft!</li>
            <li> but otherwise it is comfortable and it is not actually recommended to be used dry.</li>
            <li> The brush is a little rough, I use it with a mild cleanser most days, only once in a while with a scrub because I wouldn&#x27;t want to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Apparently sponge is for buffing to a high shine--pass...</li>
            <li> Now i use it without batteries and my face is still clear, i don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> 2 months later the effects are still very visible.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use the brush daily and find that it cleans really well.  </li>
            <li> I think it is just too much for my skin on a daily basis</li>
            <li> So far we have had no problems with either device.  </li>
            <li> but it is very convenient for traveling since it is smaller and battery operated</li>

            <li> Olay Professional Pro-X Replacement Brush Heads, 2 Count]]...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll bet I would not have developed age spots if I had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 60 with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> : I wish they had the option of purchasing a separate brush that is softer or designed for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> only beauty trick that really cleans out my pores</li>
            <li> Even for OLD skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a sensitive face.</li>
            <li> I also like the idea (although it seemed strange at first) of using the foam pad attachment to apply my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> oh well I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and it still didn&#x27;t go as far as it used to.</li>
            <li> Beware if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have not used the soft attachment yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks, but I&#x27;m really pleased with</li>
            <li> As we reach the age of 50, our skin gets much more sensitive, and it loses its elasticity.  </li>
            <li> it comes with a little sponge so you can add your lotion after you clean your face.  </li>
            <li> : wet your face at the sink, add cleanser and use the spinning brush to deep clean your pores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would not recommend buying the CONAIR POWER FACIAL CLEANSER if you have older skin.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush are pretty soft and tend to all move toward the center of the brush head in use.</li>
            <li> It has 2 speeds, low &amp; high, as well as a forward &amp; a reverse button&lt;</li>
            <li> I bought this at the modest start of my new facial regimen.</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced, works well and is very gentle for my sensitive, small pore, allergic reaction prone skin.  </li>
            <li> I recommend that the first step is to first wet your face with a splash of water or wet washcloth.  </li>
            <li> I used the same amount I would normally use.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and was looking for.</li>
            <li> The sponge lasted for about 5 mins and the brush is pretty rough plastic.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching my face because my skin feel so soft and like velvet not like the sad wrinkled woman that it makes me wonder who that really is when I look in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter last year, it broke with in two months, just quit working, She is a grown woman, not hard on things.</li>
            <li> The brushed could be a little softer, but my face feels soft and clean after using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as powerful as a previous one that I owned.</li>
            <li> However my first choice would be one with a protective case and maybe a couple of other skin cleansing accessories.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same OLD version complete with the same OLD problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time it died was because the batteries that came with it were not fully charged (in general, when a product comes with batteries, they don&#x27;t typically last very long), which did not surprise me.  </li>
            <li> Using the lower speed was good, it was not too harsh for me to use up to two times a day (although, I am not sure I would recommend using it either multiple times a day or even daily for someone with sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li> That said, my face certainly feels cleaner after using this and it&#x27;s not at all damaging or too rough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple, inexpensive alternative to more fancy and ridiculously over priced devises.</li>
            <li> I use it daily to keep my skin clear</li>
            <li> While I think it should be reserved for two to three times a week, it is not harsh enough to do damage</li>
            <li> As for the actually scrubbing... with frequent use it cleans dirt well and minimizes the chance of breakouts.</li>
            <li> The brush attachment has soft enough bristles to reduce the risk of damage to fabrics.</li>
            <li> a professional facial done.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t any more irritating than a washcloth would be.</li>
            <li> It removes dry skin very well and polishes the moisturizer deep into the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products similar to this one and was surprised this one was so reasonably priced and so efficient.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean as deeply as she would like, but it&#x27;s much less expensive than many on the market.  </li>
            <li> either because the bristles became soiled and hard to clean off.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, Clarisonic (and other brands) of similar facial cleansing brushes can run over $100 for a starter set; while they have replacement parts available, those extra brushes and sponges also run about $40 each.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an actual professional facial, but this left my skin feeling softer and cleaner.</li>
            <li> It has a small, powerful motor, and my skin is just glowing from using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I first looked at this product, I read the reviews and saw alot of people saying it was too harsh</li>
            <li> Bristles are a tad tough but as long as you don&#x27;t press down too hard, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I suggest experimenting with the settings as the highest one may feel too harsh for sensitive skin, and the lower one may feel ineffective--it depends on the state of your skin for that particular day.</li>
            <li> It does eat batteries, but no worse than other facial cleaners similar to it.</li>
            <li> I can hardly believe how quickly the Facial Cleanser arrived.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say that if my skin starts to look even a tiny bit as young and alive as this little brush has made my face feel, I will never be without one again.  </li>
            <li> The brush is soft enough it would be difficult to overdo it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a nice little budget facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, but with 3 kids and number 4 on the way I&#x27;m always looking for a way to multi-task and my only time to really focus on my skincare is during my morning shower before the kids are</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it to buy an entire new unit just to replace one worn-out brush.</li>
            <li> It does not have a splash guard like some of the much more expensive alternatives, but at this price point it is a minor inconvenience</li>
            <li> I suspect it&#x27;s not the most durable of products but--paying less than $20 for it--you can do a lot worse than this product by Conair.</li>
            <li> I used this almost daily and the soft bristles do the job without being hard on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It just shattered all by itself for no apparent reason.  </li>
            <li> I wonder how long the brush and sponge attachments will last.  </li>
            <li> I wonder how long the brush and sponge attachments will last.  </li>
            <li> but way too harsh on my normal skin areas.</li>
            <li> That said, the instructions do state that the cleanser should NOT be used in the following cases: Tuberculosis, diabetes, benign and malignant tumors, inflammation of the skin, phlebitis and thrombosis, open and fresh wounds, bruises, broken skin or varicose</li>

            <li> After rinsing off your face and patting dry--especially if you have dry skin--apply moisturizer and use the sponge applicator to massage it deeply into your skin.</li>
            <li> I am especially looking forward to using it in the winter when I get dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at the end of February and used it less than once a week becaue of my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft enough to use the product dry and feel a slight burn on your skin</li>
            <li> only complaint and reason for 4 stars is not knowing how much, how often, and where I might find replacement parts.  </li>
            <li> It has some (only a few) bristles that are not so soft...</li>
            <li> I am older and was not sure if I would like it......</li>
            <li> The brush is very stiff, regardless of the speed; I don&#x27;t see much difference between fast and slow.  </li>
            <li> the brush is way too hard and even on the gentle cycle it hurts my skin.</li>
            <li> I wish I have purchased it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hopeful it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> but my skin is way too sensitive for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I had one a long time ago and never knew what happened to it.</li>
            <li> After I was finished I rinsed my face and it felt smoother than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li> FOR A LONG TIME, BUT</li>
            <li> The Conair rotates clockwise and counterclockwisein and has a slow an fast speed.</li>
            <li> and I would hate to throw away a perfectly good cleanser because the brush and/or pad wore out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Especially in winter, when we all have some leftover tan, the air is drying, and the time inside results in dry dull skin, exfoliating can give your face the appearance of new life.  </li>
            <li> i was originally going to purchase the Clarisonic face washer, but it is way too expensive, so i opted for the Conair version.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Especially with a low price point, the Conair Power Facial Cleanser would make a terrific stocking stuffer or small gift at the holidays.</li>
            <li> The only reason it didn&#x27;t get five stars was it didn&#x27;t come with a protective case or other \\&quot;parts\\&quot; to use to cleanse your skin.</li>
            <li> Buy something a little more expensive.</li>
            <li> The brush is very rough on tender facial skin and it never occured to me that this product would not be waterproof.</li>
            <li> Use a moisturizer after this cause your face will be dry.</li>
            <li> As my skin can get dry, I found the cleanser helped keep it moist and it helped remove flaky, dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that the attachment brush would remove more of the makeup than the plain washcloth.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical that the attachment brush would remove more of the makeup than the plain washcloth.  </li>
            <li> I usually do it all in one swoop with a soft washcloth and circular motions.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a deep cleaning but did not want to use other harsh facial products.</li>
            <li> product last it less than a month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I chose this one and not a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> My only complain is its not water proof and its a little tricky keeping it dry while using water and soap on your face.</li>
            <li> The bristle head could be a little bigger</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Conair Power Facial Cleanser for a little over a month.</li>
            <li> Now mines rotates slower than a snail..and its not due to batteries :/.</li>
            <li> There is no way that these little attachments are gonna last forever</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too hard or too soft.</li>
            <li> Used for about two months and the batteries became wet and it no longer works.</li>
            <li> Definitely too harsh it makes you feel like you&#x27;re scrubbing your skin off</li>
            <li> so u have to be careful pressing it against ur face.</li>
            <li> DONT get it wet.</li>
            <li> Delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> If the bristles were any stiffer it would be too rough</li>
            <li> I found that the bristles on the brush were to course and rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> Mine only worked for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Yes, I use my power facial cleasner everyday.</li>
            <li> My switch broke within only a few uses..</li>
            <li> * Not Waterproof: its not meant to get wet at all; water in the battery compartment or even the humidity of a steamy bathroom will ruin it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the CONAIR POWER FACIAL CLEANSER is just too harsh on my skin.  </li>
            <li> but I got mine wet</li>
            <li> My face breaks out all the time, but with my facial cleanser it get rid of all the dirt trapped in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was worried it would feel too rough, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Not much power.</li>
            <li> This was  not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> in my humble opinion, it feels and works the same</li>
            <li> I keep it in the shower and it has never gotten the inside wet or broke.</li>
            <li> I got this facial brush after buying a manual brush a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I spent on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this about 3 or 4 times and I love that it cleans deep, and gets rid of annoying blackheads</li>
            <li> It left me a little pink, but nothing extreme.</li>
            <li> I have tried other similar products and found that the cleaning brushes were extremely irritating to my skin - and I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The directions were a little vague and didn&#x27;t include anything on how to clean the brush, care for the machine, etc.</li>
            <li> Gave as Christmas gift to my mom who is recovering from a stroke and is unable to use her right hand/arm.  </li>
            <li> THEY WERE TOO EXPENSIVE, THIS ONE HAS JUST THE RIGHT ATTACHMENTS FOR CLEANING.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful.  </li>
            <li> and I only wet the brush, thus I am not sure if it is waterproof.</li>
            <li> The rotating brush is firm and can be a little harsh for sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li> I use the scrub every other day.  </li>
            <li> This item burned out on me like a lot of other items I have purchased by conair in the store.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Conair products for myself in the past and still using them years later</li>
            <li> It comes with two scrubbers, one is a brush and the other is a sponge.  </li>
            <li> Takes off make up and all other skin clogging residues.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I, too, wonder about the availability of replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> It my be a little rough on the skin for some due to the longer bristles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m concerned about the batteries getting wet, but I&#x27;ve very carefully used it a few times in the shower and have no had a problem yet.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time, the brush is a little rough though.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I was concerned this would be too tough on my skin.  </li>
            <li> My pimples and black heads and minimal now just need to get rid of black spots starred on ambi</li>
            <li> The brush is extremely hard and caused blisters with open sores.</li>
            <li> No worth a purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth buying.</li>
            <li> but she says the brush is too harsh and rough on her face</li>
            <li> The moisturizing sponge attachment wore down &amp; eventually fell apart.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> gets the cleanser down in your pores</li>
            <li> One tip, don&#x27;t press down on your skin with the cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> I have tried some of the name-brand beauty cleansing brushes, only to be left disappointed by how soft the brushes were, or how inefficiently they cleaned my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then less than a month after I bought it it died.</li>
            <li> My face is brighter, smoother, less oily, and clearer.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Conair Sauna System which included this brush from ULTA on clearance for less than $20 about 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> the change of brushes is slightly inconvenient.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This allows you to use less exfoliating cream in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I did find that I could use less moisturizer with the sponge applicator.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worthy the 14$</li>
            <li> I tried several replacements, but she complained that the bristles on all of them were too stiff.</li>
            <li> battery compartment does not close tight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this if you&#x27;re like me and want something like this, but are afraid to splurge and spend the big bucks on other skincare brushes on the market.shes on the market.</li>
            <li> Was expecting the brush/ bristles to be a little firmer.</li>
            <li> It was a little abrasive but worked well</li>
            <li> This little cleaner has improved my complexion.</li>
            <li> I would try to rinse off the brush head after I took it off the device, but water still managed to get into the compartment, which eventually started to cause a little bit of rust.  </li>
            <li> it takes a little bit of jiggling sometimes.</li>
            <li> have used this little guy for a few days and haven&#x27;t felt any discomfort or irritation to my skin.</li>
            <li> and it is way too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> I did use it everyday, and sometimes twice a day (in the morning and at night).  </li>
            <li> Ive been using it for a few months</li>
            <li> After a few months, this item stopped working.</li>
            <li> I disliked that it was battery operated instead of  </li>
            <li> * Replacement brushes and sponge applicators: Not available neither via Amazon nor Conair</li>
            <li> Epic fail</li>
            <li> No blotches or uneven texture.</li>
            <li> So as not to waste moisturizer I will probably keep applying moisturizer with my fingertips rather than this device.  </li>
            <li> I been using it for about a week now, everyday and its too harsh for everyday use.</li>
            <li> My skin is normal in the summer and dry in the winter, I have nothing bad to say about the product.  </li>
            <li> I read replacement heads are hard to come by, but one of the other comments on here tell you how to get one.</li>
            <li> Some reviews say the bristles are too stiff but I disagree.  </li>
            <li> Can slow it down with a little pressure.</li>
            <li> Unless in the shower...you will make a splashing mess, when brush turns on!</li>
            <li> I bought it because my trip was extended, and I had left my system at home (not a good way to save luggage weight!).</li>
            <li> It was sitting behind some lotion, not near the edge, and was never dropped.  </li>
            <li> It definitely exfoliated but unfortunately, it also caused my sensitive face to get broken blood vessels!</li>
            <li> tried other and none compares to this!!!</li>
            <li> The head brush was hard and harsh again my skin.</li>
            <li> with hard bristles - can be used to slough off dead skin along the oily t-zone/scabs</li>
            <li> bad, but its not going to last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I hesitantly purchased this product not sure if it would work.</li>
            <li> like the option to choose the direction of the spin, and I like the two speeds since I was not sure of my skin&#x27;s sensitivity to cleansers like these.  </li>
            <li> I had read some reviews and was afraid it would have bristles that were too soft, but this wasn&#x27;t the case with this item.</li>
            <li> It has 2 speeds, but I found the low speed to be relatively useless.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin this will leave you with dry patches (which are just as annoying as blackheads).</li>
            <li> I have black heads on my nose and cheeks, after using the Conair face Cleanser twice, I can hardly see them!</li>
            <li> The bristles are way too hard.</li>
            <li> I just hope replacement brushes aren&#x27;t too hard to find as I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll hold up forever.</li>
            <li> The bristles are really tough, and so harsh against my skin.</li>
            <li> I use at least 4 times a week</li>
            <li> I should have gotten at least six months out of it.  </li>
            <li> The brush is hard and it feels very rough and uncomfortable on my face.  </li>
            <li> It isnt very expensive, which is a big reason I bought it.  </li>
            <li> No need for those very expensive facial devices.</li>
            <li> After reading about a facial steamer that blew up in a customer&#x27;s face and burning her badly, then Conair&#x27;s rude treatment of her afterward, I will NEVER buy a Conair product again.  </li>
            <li> Weirdly if I&#x27;m already broke out in one area this seems to help if I use it with a little acne cleanser.</li>
            <li> When this dies, I won&#x27;t feel as guilty about buying one that&#x27;s a little pricier because I know I&#x27;ll get use out of it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have no money and thick skin, this is for you!</li>
            <li> It is made in China and is in a poor condition.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used the provided cleanser with it yet, as I am addicted to another brand&#x27;s product, but this baby is a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This brush allows me to exfoliate without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> However, it stopped working a few weeks after use. :(</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> but those are so expensive to buy.</li>
            <li> This product works just as well as the expensive product you would get somewhere else.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> Which is a difficult thing to avoid when you&#x27;re washing your face...</li>
            <li> Sadly i stopped using it.  </li>
            <li> worst thing about it is that the directions say to NEVER get it wet.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed as this darn thing quit working less than 6 months after I bought it.</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t get it I feel sorry for you!</li>
            <li> Brush quality is bad.</li>
            <li> and now I can&#x27;t seem to fix it :(</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t going to change your life or replace cosmetic surgery, so if you are looking for that, you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worst brush ever.</li>
            <li> What a terrible face thingy.</li>
            <li> The sponge for moisturizing smells AWFUL</li>
            <li> Awful quality.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Was pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Used for about two months and the batteries became wet and it no longer works. Worked great at first.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong I absolutely like this product but out of the box you will scratch your head because it didn&#x27;t came with instructions or guide, it didn&#x27;t came with a how to. It just came in a box,  2 batteries and 2 styles of spin heads and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Real good facial cleansing tool. Not the heaviest duty but for the price it is a good buy. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have had this brush for several months now and it works. It isnt very expensive, which is a big reason I bought it.  The battery life seems to be good, I have had it for several months and have not replaced the batteries yet.  The biggest flaws are the fact that the brush head comes off easily. It would be nice if it &amp;#34;clicked or snapped&amp;#34; in place, but it doesnt (at least mine doesnt). Also, the fact that it is not water proof is a bummer. If I wouldve read the description/reviews better I wouldve chosen a brush I could use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I hesitantly purchased this product not sure if it would work. It actually provides a great clean feeling after using it. Others commented that they used more moisturizing lotion with the buffing applicator but I did not have that problem. I used the same amount I would normally use. All &amp; all I am glad I have bought this product. Shipping was great too!! No complaints here!! Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> broke almost instantly</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift to mom. It works great, a reasonable price, good timing with shipping, keep up the good work and thanks!</li>
            <li> Was expecting the brush/ bristles to be a little firmer. The price was reasonable.  However, would probably purchase something different.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using Conakry Power Facial Cleanser my face looks and feels wonderful I wish I would have used it in high school.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these.  It was a little abrasive but worked well and my teenage son noticed a big improvement on his face.  However, it stopped working a few weeks after use. :(</li>
            <li> Thank you..no problems</li>
            <li> Excellent facial cleaner.</li>
            <li> GREAT BUT BRUSH HEAD IS HARD TO CLEAN</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter last year, it broke with in two months, just quit working, She is a grown woman, not hard on things.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter but she says the brush is too harsh and rough on her face so she won&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> like it.  Should be sold with replacement brush.</li>
            <li> Gave as Christmas gift to my mom who is recovering from a stroke and is unable to use her right hand/arm.  This is perfect for her to cleanse her face.  She loves it.  Plan to order one for myself.  The brush is great for cleanser and the sponge is perfect for her night cream.</li>
            <li> It was mildly abrasive on my face and it felt like it was too rough but it did clean out my pores and make my skin nice. And the probe was really good compared to others</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it - probably over-priced for a Conair brand but cheaper than the real name brands.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted one of these, but wonder if they worked.  It works great to clean out the pores in  your face.  It was shipped very quickly &amp; it was reasonable priced.</li>
            <li> Really clean opens up your pores . I suggest you wash your face with the brush part then use a cleanser after that use a moisturizing cream feels really clean I used it three times and it works and pretty cheap too. My pimples and black heads and minimal now just need to get rid of black spots starred on ambi it looks like it working . Please buy this brush its great</li>
            <li> Loved it used daily made my face clear up. Then less than a month after I bought it it died.</li>
            <li> This little cleaner has improved my complexion. It removes dry skin very well and polishes the moisturizer deep into the skin. I wish I have purchased it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I had a proactive facial scrubber about my toddler got her hands on it and broke it. So I bought this hoping it would be comparable and it is way too harsh on my skin. Definitely too harsh it makes you feel like you&#x27;re scrubbing your skin off</li>
            <li> Bought 1 for myself and one for my daughter  works great no problems with this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Used it for like a month in the shower and then it stopped working and not because of the battery. doesnt really have a lot of power in its spin so u have to be careful pressing it against ur face. DONT get it wet.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected and was looking for.</li>
            <li> Bought it for the wife, haven&#x27;t herd any complaints and she still using it.</li>
            <li> Delivered as expected. Works well</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend money on any of the higher priced brands--this works just as well.  And the sponge applicator actually works pretty well too!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to buy this because it was so cheap, but its great! My skin feels extremely smooth  after using it. I have black heads on my nose and cheeks, after using the Conair face Cleanser twice, I can hardly see them! My only complain is its not water proof and its a little tricky keeping it dry while using water and soap on your face.</li>
            <li> Brought this for my granddaughter for her skin cream she loves it and does a great job and well constructed. Thanks</li>
            <li> Worst brush ever. It caused irreparable harm to my face the first time I used it. The brush is extremely hard and caused blisters with open sores. 2 months later the effects are still very visible.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything like this product! It&#x27;s great and it works very well. I use it every day!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a cleansing brush for a while and I glad that conair made one that was well made and inexpensive. I love that you can use it in the shower and it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;crap out&amp;#34; after being submerged in water.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use the brush daily and find that it cleans really well.  I think that moisturizer and makeup go on more smoothly, since my skin is so perfectly clean.  I used to use those strips that you wet and stick to your nose to pull out yucky stuff, now I never have anything on those, so I don&#x27;t use them any more.</li>
            <li> the brush got worn super fast, and the instructions say it cant get wet... so no shower use! Bummer for my teen daughter and I.&lt;br /&gt;I put this in my travel bag, which I keep packed for emergencies, and bought a more quality brush.</li>
            <li> Okay, but not much power.</li>
            <li> The bristles are way too hard. I think they would do more damage than good</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, and everything turns my skin red so I was pleasantly surprised when this cleanser exfoliated my skin very well but did not leave me super red!</li>
            <li> I had never used a facial cleanser/brush before, so I wanted a low cost one to try.  This was a decent price, and had fairly good reviews, so I got it.  It lasted longer for me than for others.  Mine worked for three months.  The first time it died was because the batteries that came with it were not fully charged (in general, when a product comes with batteries, they don&#x27;t typically last very long), which did not surprise me.  I replaced the batteries, and it started to work again.  I used it every day, so the batteries got drained pretty quickly, but then I started to use rechargeable batteries, and it became a non-issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the option to choose the direction of the spin, and I like the two speeds since I was not sure of my skin&#x27;s sensitivity to cleansers like these.  I did use it everyday, and sometimes twice a day (in the morning and at night).  Using the lower speed was good, it was not too harsh for me to use up to two times a day (although, I am not sure I would recommend using it either multiple times a day or even daily for someone with sensitive skin).  Occasionally, I did use the higher speed, and had no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not waterproof, and I don&#x27;t think it is very water resistant either.  Water can easily get into the battery compartment.  I would try to rinse off the brush head after I took it off the device, but water still managed to get into the compartment, which eventually started to cause a little bit of rust.  Shortly after the rust-colored water appeared, it died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was a good purchase for a beginner.  The low price was good for my first cleanser, and since a lot of the facial cleansers can cost from $40 - $200, I was willing to risk the $15 I paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  Good for a first time user for the price, but now that I know I like facial cleansers, I am going to get a higher priced, waterproof one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple, inexpensive alternative to more fancy and ridiculously over priced devises. It works fine if you use it once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush so far ! Ive been using it for a few months and I swear my skin has never been softer. If the bristles were any stiffer it would be too rough so Im able to handle it. The reverse mechanism is cool and the dual speeds. I just wish it came with an extra scrub head.</li>
            <li> Great item. I had read some reviews and was afraid it would have bristles that were too soft, but this wasn&#x27;t the case with this item. It works great with my skin.</li>
            <li> GREAT DEAL AND PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> My pores have never been happier! 2 speeds, highest is very powerful, low is wonderfully soothing. My skin has cleared up considerably since using this product, I&#x27;ve used 3 other brands with rotating heads similar to this one, this one is so far the best, the other brushes bristles were too soft and didn&#x27;t get into my pores...just kind of polished the surface, and the others broke after a few weeks, this one is still going strong! I just soak the head in peroxide from time to time to kill any bacteria and it&#x27;s likew new. The bristels are kind of on the stiff side (but still gentle), which is what I wanted. My skin breaks out easily but isn&#x27;t sensitive to abrasion (no, this product is not abbrasive, just effective) , I needed something that would really get into my pores effectively and this is it! If your face is sensitive, low speed should be fine. My face actually breaks out if I skip a day. For best results use a foam face wash, I use L&#x27;Occitane immortelle and......wow! What amazing results!</li>
            <li> Works good! Eats the batteries fast though</li>
            <li> I found that the bristles on the brush were to course and rough on my skin. When I was finished using the brush it felt like my face was all scratched up.</li>
            <li> After a few months, this item stopped working.</li>
            <li> The brush is quite wonderful on your face and really does the trick of taking off all the dead skin and making it shine....Conair is a trusted brand and lives up to its name.  Arrived when it said it would.....</li>
            <li> I love this! I had one similar to this way back in the 1970&#x27;s, I loved it then, and I&#x27;m loving it now! Get one!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! I used it today for the first time and had to write a review. It exfoliates great and my face looks amazing after one use. My blackheads are gone all around my nose. This does just as good of a job as going to the dermatologist and I&#x27;ve been there several times having several different kinds of treatments done. Definitely follow up with a toner and moisturizer after using. My skin feels great!  Will continue to make this part of my beauty routine!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t last a month before it broke. Do not use in shower.</li>
            <li> It does all I expect ...and for the price...it is wonderful!  I&#x27;m hopeful it lasts a long time.  I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks, but I&#x27;m really pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the circular action.  My face feels really clean.  I like using it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would help me remove my liquid makeup at night but it seems to make me break out more if used daily. Weirdly if I&#x27;m already broke out in one area this seems to help if I use it with a little acne cleanser. I think it is just too much for my skin on a daily basis but maybe once a week would be ok. Use a moisturizer after this cause your face will be dry.</li>
            <li> I use the scrub every other day.  I wish it had a larger surface and a bit more power.  It is good for removing chapped skin or small blemishes.</li>
            <li> No worth a purchase. It is made in China and is in a poor condition. It seems cheap and the brushes are not soft enough to clean our skin. Also it&#x27;s not convenient to use batteries</li>
            <li> I have this and the dermabrush. I prefer this one I just wish it was easier to find replacement heads. It keeps mty skin nice and smooth after years of suffering with mild acne. I use it daily to keep my skin clear</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas after pricing more expensive models.  She absolutely loves it and it prompted me to purchase another one for myself.  It is easy to use and gentle on the skin.  I guess you can purchase more expensive brands, but why??  If this one breaks, I&#x27;ll just get another one at this great price.  So far we have had no problems with either device.  We just love it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean as deeply as she would like, but it&#x27;s much less expensive than many on the market.  Good for daily use.</li>
            <li> Eh it was good for its price but I think I was looking for something better. It gets the job done but it doesn&#x27;t get what I wanted done. You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I love this, it is powerful! I used baking soda and gave myself my own microdermabrasion and now my skin looks great</li>
            <li> My daughter is 14 and she loves this facial cleanser. She wanted the one she saw on tv from proactive but those are so expensive to buy. I decided to get her this one and it works just great.</li>
            <li> I wish you could put it in water, I dont want to shock myself so I will not try it.  It works for the value and is easy to use.  I havent figured out the need for the sponge attachment but it does the job.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel great after I use it! Nice and smooth and bright. If you&#x27;re expecting the quality of a Clairsonic, though, you&#x27;re going to be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I switch it on, I have to put the On switch in the perfect position for it to work...it takes a little bit of jiggling sometimes. When it&#x27;s spinning, it also kind of sounds like it&#x27;s going to stop working at any second (even with brand new batteries). I&#x27;m not expecting this to last very long, but I&#x27;m glad I got it because it does make my skin look and feel nice, and it was a great way to test out a product like this. When this dies, I won&#x27;t feel as guilty about buying one that&#x27;s a little pricier because I know I&#x27;ll get use out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it if you&#x27;ve never used a product like this and you just want to &amp;#34;stick your toe in&amp;#34;...but if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap alternative to a facial cleanser you&#x27;ve already owned, this probably isn&#x27;t your best option.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this every now and again for extra clean feeling while I shower. It does eat batteries, but no worse than other facial cleaners similar to it.</li>
            <li> It works okay, but I own the BriteLeafs one also and the BriteLeafs one seems higher quality. The BriteLeafs one costs slightly more $ but is worth the added expense.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter to take with her to college. There are many electronic facial cleansers on the market and some are really ridiculously expensive. I purchased the Conair model figuring it was a great price and if it only worked for a month, so be it. Well, it seems to be very well made and the brushes aren&#x27;t overly abrasive while still leaving her with shiny, soft skin. Definitely a nice product for the price!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any experience with similar products, so I can&#x27;t offer any points of comparison.  That said, my face certainly feels cleaner after using this and it&#x27;s not at all damaging or too rough.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and I have never used a more expensive brand; this works quite well for me. Have been very happy with it. To me there is no sense spending more on something else.</li>
            <li> Mine only worked for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Unless in the shower...you will make a splashing mess, when brush turns on!</li>
            <li> Since I have oily skin, after I wash my face with facial cleanser and a towel my face remains oily. Sometimes I would have to wash my face twice just to remove the oil from my face which caused drying. I was looking at using a power facial cleanser to help clean my face (remove all the oil) without drying my skin. I picked this one for the price, ability to use any facial/exfoliate product, and the two different speeds and directions of the brush head. I don&#x27;t use mine in the shower and I only wet the brush, thus I am not sure if it is waterproof. Yes, I use my power facial cleasner everyday. Overall, this is the best solution for my oily skin. My face is brighter, smoother, less oily, and clearer. I would recommend this product for anyone with oily skin who want to reduced the oil on their face without drying out their skin.</li>
            <li> I love how it cleans your have was a bit unsure to buy this product because of the reviews but it was worth it. I wish it do deep cleaning on my skin then it would give it five stars.</li>
            <li> battery case leaks....product last it less than a month</li>
            <li> The brush is gentle and exfoliates.  My skin is much cleaner and brighter.  I use the sponge attachment to apply moisturizer and I love the effect.  Must buy</li>
            <li> I have only had this product for a short time, but think it does a great job for daily face cleansing, especially for the price.  Some Amazon reviewers have commented that they could not locate replacement parts, soI called Conair to find out how to obtain them.  Here is the information needed for ordering:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conair Customer Service: 1-800-326-6247&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phone lines are open Monday thru Friday, 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. and Saturday thru Sunday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The model number for the Conair Power Facial Cleanser is 3710N.  The part number for the replacement brush is MDS2-B.  The cost, including shipping is $2.50, plus state tax if applicable.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time, the brush is a little rough though. I would not recommend for daily use, but other wise it is an OKay product.</li>
            <li> I used this almost daily and the soft bristles do the job without being hard on my sensitive skin. I just hope replacement brushes aren&#x27;t too hard to find as I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll hold up forever.</li>
            <li> use this at night to remove mineral foundation, work like a charm! my skin is so extra glowy and it has improved my circulation 100%!!! looooove it!</li>
            <li> What a terrible face thingy. Would not buy again, didn&#x27;t do a thing, better off a purchase on a good quality item.</li>
            <li> Love it, use it at least once a week to do a good cleaning to my face.</li>
            <li> This item burned out on me like a lot of other items I have purchased by conair in the store.</li>
            <li> Got it today, put the batteries in (both facing same way) and hit the on switch! Tried both directions and different speeds--comes w/2 attachments--brush &amp;  sponge! Prefer lower speed w/brush which cleans skin well w/out abrading! Apparently sponge is for buffing to a high shine--pass...Clean is good enough!  😉</li>
            <li> I love it I use at least 4 times a week the only problem is they do not sell replacement brushes</li>
            <li> It does the job.. but it hurts. This is not a soft brush, and if you are sensitive to pinching feelings, this will probably not be good for you. The sponge for moisturizing smells AWFUL and I had to stop using it because the smell did not wear off. I recommend paying $5-$10 extra and getting a better one.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the $200 competing facial brushes. Cleared up my acne and keeps my face moisturized with the extra moisture brush! Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I fall inlove to this Brush, at first I am hesitant to buy this brush because its cheap. But then I am satisfied and happy on the result.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the modest start of my new facial regimen. I wasn&#x27;t sure how it was going to go, so I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on such an item initially. So, I bought this one at a very good price, figuring if I was still maintaining when it gave out I&#x27;d trade up...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;m still working on my face and this thing just keeps humming along! Really cleaned up my face, pores in my nose particularly, which is why I bought it in the first place. (yuck!)</li>
            <li> I love the power cleanser! The bristle head could be a little bigger but it&#x27;s soft and works very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product again because the first one I bought lasted for 5 years.  I guess I should have known when they started selling it on a subscription basis.  I think I should get a refund!!!</li>
            <li> get the job done for me!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as an alternative to some of the more pricey items on the market. Some were up to $100, yet did the exact same thing as this one. The Conair rotates clockwise and counterclockwisein and has a slow an fast speed. Very important feature to have if you have sensitive skin or maybe you&#x27;re removing different types of make-up. Stage make-up versus every day wear. It&#x27;s also durable enough for men whose skin may be a bit more &amp;#34;tough.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one issue that I have is that I can&#x27;t seem to find any replacement brushes. My teenagers would like to use this, however, they need their own brush. Also, it&#x27;s be nice to have somewhere to store your brushes, but I guess you can&#x27;t expect too much from a $15.00 product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted a face scrubber but couldn&#x27;t stomach the $300 price tag of the others,  I really really love this brush. I have unruly pores so I need to exfoliate quite a bit.  It&#x27;s easy to use the brush is not too hard or too soft and it has the perfect speeds. I also enjoy the moisture sponge head. It gives a nice finishing touch after you use the scrubber brush. For the price I think this product is great! Just be sure to avoid using it in the shower and remove the brushes to clean them !</li>
            <li> price is right , great for facial cleaning.</li>
            <li> My switch broke within only a few uses..</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my grandson and he loves it. He is very into taking care of himself and says this works perfectly</li>
            <li> The head brush was hard and harsh again my skin. I disliked that it was battery operated instead of  rechargeable; however, I can deal with it. I did like it that it had a two speed and circling right and left. Overall, I did not like it. I would not recommend any to buy this product!</li>
            <li> The cleanser worked exactly as advertised and I was very happy with it.  However, after one use, and after sitting on my counter for about one week, the face brush attachment shattered.  It was sitting behind some lotion, not near the edge, and was never dropped.  It just shattered all by itself for no apparent reason.  I now have to investigate whether they have replacement parts for sale.  If they do, and I order one,  I am worried that it may happen again.</li>
            <li> I can hardly believe how quickly the Facial Cleanser arrived. It was perfect with all necessary information on how to operate it. I read the reviews on this cleanser and decided that the Conair would be a good place to start. I was so right. I am happier with it than I was with my manual cleaning brush. The reviewers were correct: it should be used 2 to 3 times a week, not every day. It is exactly what I wanted and the price was fantastic.</li>
            <li> While it works fairly well as others here have noted the one brush wears out fairly quickly and it&#x27;s impossible to get a replacement. It&#x27;s not worth it to buy an entire new unit just to replace one worn-out brush.</li>
            <li> Bristles are a tad tough but as long as you don&#x27;t press down too hard, it&#x27;s perfect. My skin is all tingly and glowy :) Definitely helps with acne.</li>
            <li> My four teenaged daughters love these. They work great and the price is very good! No need for those very expensive facial devices. These get the job done.</li>
            <li> It worked well for the cost...wish it had a few more attachments included.it was gift for my daughter for xmas.</li>
            <li> She like this. it&#x27;s a great price and work well. she said she can tell the difference in they way her face feels.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, gets the job done</li>
            <li> Good product but the bristles kind of hurt. I wish they were softer.</li>
            <li> The wife loves it and uses it daily.</li>
            <li> It is not the same as the Clarisonic but it is very convenient for traveling since it is smaller and battery operated</li>
            <li> This product has reduced the appearance of acne with use of toner by 100%. It has also contributed to an enhanced facial complexion</li>
            <li> Very disappointed as this darn thing quit working less than 6 months after I bought it. Real upset</li>
            <li> Skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> Its a great purchase! I use it like 2 times a week and my skin looks super nice after every use!</li>
            <li> My girls loved hem. Great gift for teens.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for! #cheap The sponge lasted for about 5 mins and the brush is pretty rough plastic. It definitely exfoliated but unfortunately, it also caused my sensitive face to get broken blood vessels! If you have no money and thick skin, this is for you!</li>
            <li> The Conair Power Facial Cleanser has two speeds to help exfoliate the skin while it massages. Used with a mask or soap and water, it is a practical and safe way to cleanse the skin. I find it does maintain a healthy glow to my face by removing dirt and helping to control blackheads/pimples. Besides the practical use, it feels wonderful and can be a low-key way to relax by treating yourself to a facial massage. The size also makes it easy to pack in a suitcase.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Conair Sauna System which included this brush from ULTA on clearance for less than $20 about 5 years ago. The Sauna is still functioning . However, the facial brush bit the dust within a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually LOVED the brush for as long as it lasted and jumped at this opportunity to have a new and improved version. Surprise...It&#x27;s the same OLD version complete with the same OLD problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Not Waterproof: its not meant to get wet at all; water in the battery compartment or even the humidity of a steamy bathroom will ruin it. Don&#x27;t risk using it in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;* No Splash Guard Bristles like many newer facial brushes: face wash flings everywhere IF you put it directly on the brush; best to dot the wash on your face THEN use the brush on your face.&lt;br /&gt;* The moisturizing sponge attachment wore down &amp; eventually fell apart.&lt;br /&gt;* Replacement brushes and sponge applicators: Not available neither via Amazon nor Conair website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any facial cleansing brush, skin results will only be as good as the facial cleanser, serums and moisturizer you use with it.  Results may not be seen with one use; in a week you&#x27;ll see improvement if it&#x27;s working for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I love about Power Facial Cleanser:&lt;br /&gt;* Most facial brushes on the market just vibrate, this one rotates at two speeds and goes both directions! This really helps with BOTH cleansing and applying moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;* The rotating brush is firm and can be a little harsh for sensitive skin types. It may not be for daily twice a day use for some. It&#x27;s best at night for banishing the day&#x27;s accumulated pollution, grime and leftover makeup.&lt;br /&gt;* My skin has NEVER looked or felt so good...soft, smooth and better absorption of moisturizer with the sponge applicator. Definite inducement to using it regularly and attaining results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this Power Facial brush with some reservations about it&#x27;s durability, brush and applicator replacement availability. I don&#x27;t want to re-purchase an entire unit when I only need a brush or an applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wish would be to meld the best of this brush with the Olay System Brush [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, 0.68-Fluid Ounce]][[ASIN:B0043OWJG2 Olay Professional Pro-X Replacement Brush Heads, 2 Count]]...Benefits: Quality, Power, Ergonomics, Sustainability at a decent price point! No Clairsonic in my future :)r replacement availability. I don&#x27;t want to re-purchase an entire unit when I only need a brush or an applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wish would be to meld the best of this brush with the Olay System Brush [[ASIN:B0043OYFKU Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System, 0.68-Fluid Ounce]][[ASIN:B0043OWJG2 Olay Professional Pro-X Replacement Brush Heads, 2 Count]]...Benefits: Quality, Power, Ergonomics, Sustainability at a decent price point!

            <li> Not very powerful.  Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> battery compartment does not close tight</li>
            <li> I tried the CONAIR POWER FACIAL CLEANSER because I am always looking for better, gentler ways to clean and freshen my aging skin.  As we reach the age of 50, our skin gets much more sensitive, and it loses its elasticity.  I had great hopes that the CONAIR POWER FACIAL CLEANSER would work for me and exfoliate my skin to reveal a more youthful glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the CONAIR POWER FACIAL CLEANSER is just too harsh on my skin.  The brush is very stiff, regardless of the speed; I don&#x27;t see much difference between fast and slow.  It is nice that I can use my cleanser, but honestly, the brush almost immediately irritates my skin, causing it to turn bright red.  I can really only see using this once or twice a week at the most, after I have worn makeup.  I do have to say that this is a great makeup remover. The problem is that it removes layers of skin, too.  OUCH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the sponge attachment which comes with the CONAIR POWER FACIAL CLEANSER.  The purpose of this attachment is to buff your moisturizer into your skin.  After dabbing my moisturizer onto your face, you can use the sponge on either speed to evenly spread your moisturizer and to help it saturate into your skin.  I did quite like this feature.  By itself, without using the brush attachment first, it leaves your skin fresh, smooth, and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would not recommend buying the CONAIR POWER FACIAL CLEANSER if you have older skin.  The stiffness of the brush is just too much.  Yes your skin is exfoliated, but it is too much, too strong.  When the living skin is coming off, too, then I say to give the CONAIR POWER FACIAL CLEANSER a pass.</li>
            <li> great value!  no need to spend $100 dollars, this works perfect. battery operated, but still worth it!  just as good as the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> After reading about a facial steamer that blew up in a customer&#x27;s face and burning her badly, then Conair&#x27;s rude treatment of her afterward, I will NEVER buy a Conair product again.  If a company wants to remain successful, it must stand behind its products</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this for the price. It does not have a splash guard like some of the much more expensive alternatives, but at this price point it is a minor inconvenience I am completely willing to overlook.</li>
            <li> i was originally going to purchase the Clarisonic face washer, but it is way too expensive, so i opted for the Conair version. it is very small and light, yet works wonderfully. when i opened it, i thought the brush bristles were very coarse, but when i used it on my face it felt really good and left my skin soft and refreshed. i changed the head to the sponge attachment to put on my lotion, and it was soft and helped my skin absorb the moisturizer much better. highly recommended!</li>
            <li> wife sees great results for the price... many of the upscale cleansers that we have had in the past have not lived up to these standards</li>
            <li> I use this item once a week, that is all, do not want to overdue it on my skin, that is all I want to say.</li>
            <li> it makes my face feel much cleaner and healthier.  I wish I had bought it years ago,  I&#x27;ll bet I would not have developed age spots if I had.</li>
            <li> Some reviews say the bristles are too stiff but I disagree.  They are perfect.  I&#x27;m over 60 with sensitive skin and it doesnt bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my eye on a product similar to this, but with a much larger price tag for quite sometime. So given the chance to try out a product that seems to do the same thing I had to jump at the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Conair Power Facial Cleanser seems to do what it says. I&#x27;ve never had an actual professional facial, but this left my skin feeling softer and cleaner. I know for a fact several clogged pores were cleared after initial use. So gross, but so cool at the same time! I&#x27;m cursed with super sensitive skin so I used it for only a portion of the recommended time. It left me a little pink, but nothing extreme. I&#x27;ll definitely add this to my weekly/bi-weekly skincare regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I wish they had the option of purchasing a separate brush that is softer or designed for sensitive skin. The included one was a little rough for my liking, and I&#x27;d love to actually use this product more often, but I don&#x27;t think my sensitive skin could handle it. If they do offer this I wasn&#x27;t able to find it by searching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instruction manual really didn&#x27;t offer much. Although it does advice not to use while sleeping which gave my husband and I a good laugh ;) The directions were a little vague and didn&#x27;t include anything on how to clean the brush, care for the machine, etc. I&#x27;m kind of a germaphobe so stuff like that is a big deal with me. Thankfully this product is basically idiot-proof and I was able to get going even with the less than stellar instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish this was shower friendly. Not a huge deal, but with 3 kids and number 4 on the way I&#x27;m always looking for a way to multi-task and my only time to really focus on my skincare is during my morning shower before the kids are up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a pretty nice product. I&#x27;m excited to see how my pores and skin respond after more uses. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this if you&#x27;re like me and want something like this, but are afraid to splurge and spend the big bucks on other skincare brushes on the market.shes on the market.</li>
            <li> great value.  I have purchased this for myself and kids ( 3 total).</li>
            <li> The Conair Power Facial Cleanser is a nice little gadget that will easily and thoroughly cleanse your face, ridding it of dulling dead skin cells and letting your fresh new skin shine through.  Especially in winter, when we all have some leftover tan, the air is drying, and the time inside results in dry dull skin, exfoliating can give your face the appearance of new life.  It will not make you look 20, or take away your wrinkles, cure your acne, or be the first step to world peace.  It will, however, get your face cleaner than soap, water, and your fingertips will.  While I think it should be reserved for two to three times a week, it is not harsh enough to do damage should you decide to use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box:  the cleanser, the cleansing brush, the moisturizer sponge, and 2 batteries.  Use your own skin care products and you are good to go!  It has 2 speeds, but I found the low speed to be relatively useless.  The brush is soft enough it would be difficult to overdo it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a nice little budget facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love this!  My skin is smooth after use, my pores are minimized and there&#x27;s a great improvement for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> This product hurt my face. I used the clarisonic before and even though expensive it is more effective for decreasing acne.</li>
            <li> Spins great but the brush is so hard it scratched up my face. I almost cried because ai have very sensitive skin and when I put on face cream it burned.  The foam brush it comes with doesn&#x27;t work or hold in the product. Epic fail</li>
            <li> Just used this yesterday for the first time. It works really well and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I&#x27;m glad that I chose this one and not a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> I am fairly satisfied with this product it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than some of the cleansers you see out there and I do not think it is as powerful but my face definitely feels so smooth and clean and refreshed after using it. So for the price instead of spending hundreds of dollars on one I would say I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this! It&#x27;s soft but not too soft! Does exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It works well but I got mine wet and now I can&#x27;t seem to fix it :( Why would they make a face washer that you cant keep in the shower?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush 3 times a week and my face feels great!!  I would highly recommend this brush with your favorite cleanser.</li>
            <li> I really like using this Powered Cleanser for washing my face. it&#x27;s quick and gentle yet does a very good job.</li>
            <li> I picked this facial cleaner up for my wife and she can&#x27;t stop raving about it.  With several brush heads and easy to use right out of the box, the Conair Power Facial Cleanser does a great job at removing her make-up and keeping her face clean. She tells me her face feels cleaner after she&#x27;s used it and she&#x27;s very pleased.  We would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I received my facial cleanser.  My face breaks out all the time, but with my facial cleanser it get rid of all the dirt trapped in my skin.  So now my face doesn&#x27;t look like a teenager.</li>
            <li> better than some the more expensive brands which just vibrate. only beauty trick that really cleans out my pores</li>
            <li> works great nice style gets face clean and soft wish I would have bought one sooner fits hand great easy to control</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this about 3 or 4 times and I love that it cleans deep, and gets rid of annoying blackheads but my skin is way too sensitive for everyday use. If you have sensitive skin this will leave you with dry patches (which are just as annoying as blackheads). Once or twice a week is good for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product and Love this price. I had one a long time ago and never knew what happened to it. Thinking about buying another one for a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Wish it was rechargeable. The brushed could be a little softer, but my face feels soft and clean after using.</li>
            <li> Never had one before and thought I would try it.  Good for starters. Face feels a lot cleaner and smoother.</li>
            <li> The bristles are really tough, and so harsh against my skin. But I still use it cus it&#x27;s something.</li>
            <li> I was more impressed with the Conair Power Facial Cleanser than I thought I would be. While it only has two speeds, the cleanser did a fine job of cleaning and refreshing my face. As my skin can get dry, I found the cleanser helped keep it moist and it helped remove flaky, dry skin. While I had a reviewer&#x27;s copy, it was nice to see the cleanser have two AA batteries included with it. I suspect it&#x27;s not the most durable of products but--paying less than $20 for it--you can do a lot worse than this product by Conair.</li>
            <li> I love to use a mask or some time of facial cleanser that exfoliates, and when I saw the Conair Power Facial Cleanser I wanted to give it a try. I love that you can use your favorite face wash with this product. After spreading my facial cleanser on my face, I turned on the Conair and in circular motions cleaned my face. It felt so good! I was worried it would feel too rough, but it didn&#x27;t. After I was finished I rinsed my face and it felt smoother than it has in a long time. I think the Conair&#x27;s price is just right, and it works really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Conair Power Facial Cleanser for a little over a month. It is very effective in cleaning the skin; I use a creme facial cleanser in the morning and a microscrub in the evening. The cleanser helps to clean the face deeply. I suggest experimenting with the settings as the highest one may feel too harsh for sensitive skin, and the lower one may feel ineffective--it depends on the state of your skin for that particular day. This product isn&#x27;t going to change your life or replace cosmetic surgery, so if you are looking for that, you will be disappointed. (I didn&#x27;t have those expectations, but I did wonder if any great changes would happen, and no, I have nothing to report.)  It does help stimulate the pores of the skin which helps to renew it and give the face a fresh glow. I enjoy using it and there are days when it feels really good to have that extra stimulation on the skin.</li>
            <li> I got this because it had good reviews. I would not buy another one. Not much power. Can slow it down with a little pressure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as powerful as a previous one that I owned.</li>
            <li> I am older and was not sure if I would like it......but it is AWESOME.  Even for OLD skin.  LOL</li>
            <li> I have tried some of the name-brand beauty cleansing brushes, only to be left disappointed by how soft the brushes were, or how inefficiently they cleaned my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This little gem is the best tool by far for me. It has a small, powerful motor, and my skin is just glowing from using it.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the provided cleanser with it yet, as I am addicted to another brand&#x27;s product, but this baby is a keeper.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everyone who wants to see their skin glowing and clean.</li>
            <li> this was a gift so I don&#x27;t know how well it works but the person who got it seems to like it.</li>
            <li> The brush is very rough on tender facial skin and it never occured to me that this product would not be waterproof. Guess I should have known that from the price. Spend more and get something you can use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I found it to be too abrasive &amp; scratchy.  I am going to try a midrange priced power cleanser instead.</li>
            <li> works excellently. i can feel it cleaning my skin! i would recommend it to any one with skin issues because it really does cleanse.</li>
            <li> This product works just as well as the expensive product you would get somewhere else.  It removes makeup well and that&#x27;s what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Oh, what a great feeling to get your face so clean. I felt like it got all the dirt out. Made my face feel refreshed. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I like the reversing feature on it also.</li>
            <li> gets the cleanser down in your pores</li>
            <li> Great concept, but was too rough for my wife&#x27;s face.  Admittedly, she has sensitive skin, but this was just too rough on her skin.  She&#x27;ll revert back to her Earth Therapeutics Softouch Complexion Brush.</li>
            <li> I love my new facial cleanser , it&#x27;s makes your skin feel so clean and refresh, Thanks a lot</li>
            <li> The product was ok for the price but overall I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone like me who has moderate acne. I was looking for a deep clean but this product only seems to cleanse the top layer of skin...wasn&#x27;t good for makeup either because the bristles became soiled and hard to clean off. Overall it&#x27;s a good product for clear skin user but if your looking for that deep action clean, you might want to spend a little more money.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price! I have been using it for about 4 weeks now. I love that it gives instant results, my face feels smooth and polished after the very first use and after every use. I like that the brush is removable and I also like that an additional component (attachable sponge) comes with it for applying moisturizer or any skin care product that needs to be massaged into the pores after cleansing. The only thing is I might be needing additional brushes as the bristles are showing signs of being worn.</li>
            <li> I CHOSE THE RATING OF 5 STARS, BECAUSE IT IS JUST WHAT I WANTED  FOR A LONG TIME, BUT THEY WERE TOO EXPENSIVE, THIS ONE HAS JUST THE RIGHT ATTACHMENTS FOR CLEANING. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE AS A MATTER OF FACT, I BOUGHT ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER AND SHE LOVES IT ALSO.&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted this facial cleanser machine and I am so glad that I bought it.  I cleans my face so clean that my oily skin has improved quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sister she has very oily skin and so far so good with this one. I have purchased Conair products for myself in the past and still using them years later so this is why I decided to try this one and my sister raves that this makes her skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I love this little machine. I use the brush to wash my face and the sponge to put on my moisturizer. Works in a circular motion I just wish it was a little more powerful if you press down on it, it stops working.</li>
            <li> Never had one of these before, but am absolutely loving it. I read replacement heads are hard to come by, but one of the other comments on here tell you how to get one. Skin feels soft, looks better. I can see the dirt on the scrubber. Not waterproof; however, I don&#x27;t think any cheap ones are. I&#x27;m concerned about the batteries getting wet, but I&#x27;ve very carefully used it a few times in the shower and have no had a problem yet.</li>
            <li> Product does not work well and I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t just return it. This was  not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> First, it is not waterproof! Even the slightest bit of water will tamper with it. Now mines rotates slower than a snail..and its not due to batteries :/. As for the actually scrubbing... with frequent use it cleans dirt well and minimizes the chance of breakouts. Its best to begin slowly(once a week) then build to using it more gradually(2-3 times a week).</li>
            <li> The wife&#x27;s Tide Stainbrush finally died after all these years. They don&#x27;t make them any more! I tried several replacements, but she complained that the bristles on all of them were too stiff. I stumbled on this by accident and figured if it&#x27;s meant for your face, it must be soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She thinks it works great on laundry stains along with Shout[[ASIN:B0008EWSMQ Shout 30 Oz Trigger]]. I have no idea about using it on your skin, though.</li>
            <li> I find this facial brush to be un-extraordinary. It does it&#x27;s job, but there&#x27;s nothing special about it. The bristles on the brush are pretty soft and tend to all move toward the center of the brush head in use. The sponge pad soaked up my lotion and I had to reapply to my face using my hands. I&#x27;m sure after more uses, the pad will distribute lotion as it&#x27;s supposed to... maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst thing about it is that the directions say to NEVER get it wet. Which is a difficult thing to avoid when you&#x27;re washing your face...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This facial brush is good.</li>
            <li> Purchased two if these as gifts. They arrived on time and as described. There are many similar products on the market. This is a great brand; excellent quality. Can&#x27;t beat the price, as many other comparable products sell for much more.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, Clarisonic (and other brands) of similar facial cleansing brushes can run over $100 for a starter set; while they have replacement parts available, those extra brushes and sponges also run about $40 each. No, this handy-dandy facial scrubber can&#x27;t be used in the shower, and no, it doesn&#x27;t have a spatter guard. It&#x27;s also about 1/10th the price of brands that DO offer waterproof and splatter guard features. It then boils down to whether or not those features are important enough to pay a huge chunk of change for them? If they are, terrific... if not, this might be the power facial brush for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very basic: wet your face at the sink, add cleanser and use the spinning brush to deep clean your pores. After rinsing off your face and patting dry--especially if you have dry skin--apply moisturizer and use the sponge applicator to massage it deeply into your skin. You can also use the sponge applicator with a mild, cream exfoliator if you aren&#x27;t interested in using the (very soft) brush attachment to deep clean and exfoliate at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially with a low price point, the Conair Power Facial Cleanser would make a terrific stocking stuffer or small gift at the holidays. I only wish it didn&#x27;t have only a woman pictured on the box, because it&#x27;s an ideal grooming gadget for young men to use as a deep cleaner and acne preventer. Preteen and teenaged girls will be happy to have this among their pile o&#x27; gifts... but don&#x27;t rule out giving it to a guy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, I love the idea from another reviewer to use it as a stain-removing brush for clothing! The brush attachment has soft enough bristles to reduce the risk of damage to fabrics. I&#x27;m thinking it could also be used to clean sliver more quickly and easily (with silver polish), gently clean tile grout (with whitening toothpaste), buff out water rings or spots on wood (using the sponge applicator) and more!</li>
            <li> I used this product paired with a creamy cleanser and received a great exfoliation. I would suggest using a light touch because the bristles on the brush can be a bit scratchy and could irritate the skin. The attachments (a brush for exfoliation and a sponge for moisturizing) were very easy to attach and remove. I was quite happy with the end result and will add this to my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that great for me personally,  I got a few uses out of it and then it just would have problems where the NEW batteries weren&#x27;t working the head would not spin unless i pushed it then it would start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not bad, but its not going to last you a long time.</li>
            <li> the brush is way too hard and even on the gentle cycle it hurts my skin. it felt like someone was rubbing my face across the carpet. I used it once and threw it away. pay the money for a good one!</li>
            <li> This power facial cleanser is just as good as the more expensive brand that is out there right now. Cleanses my skin gently and effectively.</li>
            <li> The system works fine...the only problem I have with it is the brush. It has some (only a few) bristles that are not so soft...I intend to trim those back and see how it goes. The price is certainly good. I bought it because my trip was extended, and I had left my system at home (not a good way to save luggage weight!). Over all a good product.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted a facial scrubber, but they were always out of my price range or required special pads.  This Power Facial Cleanser from Conair is reasonable priced at about $15 and it is awesome!  It comes with two scrubbers, one is a brush and the other is a sponge.  They can be used with any soap and are easily cleaned and switched out.  The unit takes two AA batteries, which it comes with.  It works at different speeds and goes forward and back.  I have used this a few days now and love how clean and polished my face feels.  I would not recommend keeping it in the shower (as someone else mentioned) unless you can be sure it isn&#x27;t going to get water in it as its not waterproof.  Since its not plugged in, I wouldn&#x27;t worry about getting electrocuted but they unit may stop working if water gets inside.  I looked for replacement parts but couldn&#x27;t find any, probably because this device is so cheap you can just buy a new one.  Replacement parts wouldn&#x27;t be much cheaper than a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this device and it works great.  I am especially looking forward to using it in the winter when I get dry skin.</li>
            <li> Hurts like heck. I don&#x27;t have a sensitive face.</li>
            <li> I use my Clarisonic every day and I do need to replace it so when I saw this product, I was hoping it was comparable to my Clarisonic and it is.  the bristles are soft and the spinning is gentle.  it comes with a little sponge so you can add your lotion after you clean your face.  it&#x27;s a nice added feature.  it seems to clean gently yet getting all the oils etc off the face. I think I will keep using this one instead of buying a Clarisonic. in my humble opinion, it feels and works the same</li>
            <li> As winter approaches, my skin becomes finicky. Dry patches and oily T-zone become more prominent. This brush allows me to exfoliate without irritating my skin. It feels fresh and not so sensitive when I apply moisturizer. The reverse action action is a nice addition to the 3 speeds. I probably won&#x27;t use the sponge attachment so much but it is nice to have available.</li>
            <li> I love this item. It cleans my face so good. Its soft and gentle on my face. Not like you would think. I keep it in the shower and it has never gotten the inside wet or broke. I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li> It came with two replaceable tips: a sponge and a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sponge - somewhat soft on skin and provides a facial massage in counterclockwise and clockwise motions at fast or slow pace, whatever your preference is. Easy to use but the change of brushes is slightly inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brush with hard bristles - can be used to slough off dead skin along the oily t-zone/scabs but way too harsh on my normal skin areas. The brush is def. better used on scrubbing off clothes&#x27; stains as one of the reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products similar to this one and was surprised this one was so reasonably priced and so efficient. The only reason it didn&#x27;t get five stars was it didn&#x27;t come with a protective case or other \\&quot;parts\\&quot; to use to cleanse your skin. Would I buy this again? Yes. However my first choice would be one with a protective case and maybe a couple of other skin cleansing accessories. Its a nice gift to give to someone though at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Does the job it was designed to do. It was a Christmas gift for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> A gimmick. It&#x27;s not worth buying. You will clean your face far better with a wash cloth. I fell for the ad LOL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by all the good reviews...I bought this product at the end of February and used it less than once a week becaue of my sensitive skin.  It has already stopped working.</li>
            <li> i love it. the very first time i used it,  my face is softer and more clearer that it was.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this to, but I think it&#x27;s a good product, especially at the cost.  I have sensitive skin, so I was concerned this would be too tough on my skin.  However, that wasn&#x27;t an issue. The low power is gentle and the high power isn&#x27;t too high.  I do only use this a couple of times a week, just so I don&#x27;t irritate my skin, but I think it does a good job of scrubbing away dead skin.  I won&#x27;t use the sponge, just because I feel like it would waste too much lotion. But, this product was worth the money just as a facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teen age grandson.  He uses it at least three times a week and it has greatly inproved his acem problems.  His face is so much better.</li>
            <li> I needed a deep cleansing.  I am 60 years old and have been using Original Noxema since age 16. I wanted a deep cleaning but did not want to use other harsh facial products. As I&#x27;ve gotten older my skin has gotten very sensitive. With my Noxema and the Power Facial Cleanser, it did the trick. Conair Products are very reliable products. I would recommend this product to any one.</li>
            <li> This facial brush is much more affordable than others.  I use it about 2-3 times per week on the scrub brush and daily with the lotion applicator.  The brush is a little rough, I use it with a mild cleanser most days, only once in a while with a scrub because I wouldn&#x27;t want to irritate my skin. The lotion applicator is great, I feel super smooth and well moisturized when I use it and it&#x27;s almost like a mini massage!  My skin is normal in the summer and dry in the winter, I have nothing bad to say about the product.  I believe this is a great product for the price!</li>
            <li> I use this on low speed, makes my face feel great and I have had no problems w/ it.</li>
            <li> I was excited about receiving this especially since it took me awhile to buy it.  Once received I really wasn&#x27;t too happy with it after my first use.  The brush is hard and it feels very rough and uncomfortable on my face.  I tried to us it a few more times just to see if maybe it was just the first us but it was still the same.  I ran hot water on it to see if the bristles would soften but they didn&#x27;t.  Sadly i stopped using it.  I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleanser. It&#x27;s not too hard or too soft. I even use it in the shower but I don&#x27;t submerge it and no problems yet.</li>
            <li> Great, I love it. It works and it does exactly what it says it does, nothing more and nothing less.</li>
            <li> This facial brush is just what I needed. I have blackhead prone skin and this product has helped me tremendously.</li>
            <li> Why spend $200 on a product with enough power to scrape the skin off of your face? I know the benefits of exfoliation and have used a buff puff for years. I found this and have been using it for about a month. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the speed and amount of exfoliation. It my be a little rough on the skin for some due to the longer bristles.</li>
            <li> This is amazing to say the least.  I could not believe the price of under $15 would get a tool that would make my skin feel so alive after only the first use.  I have so many skin problems that it would take a book to list them and a medical dictionary for me to spell them.  Let&#x27;s just say that if my skin starts to look even a tiny bit as young and alive as this little brush has made my face feel, I will never be without one again.  I can&#x27;t stop touching my face because my skin feel so soft and like velvet not like the sad wrinkled woman that it makes me wonder who that really is when I look in the mirror.  I know it isn&#x27;t surgery but it is amazing.</li>
            <li> You ladies have to try this one. I have never used a facial cleansing brush before and this one is the TOPS! I even used the sponge to put on my lotion. I am loving this item. My skin feels so clean after using makeup all day and it is not drying either. For the price and the name Conair you can&#x27;t beat this one. So if you don&#x27;t get it I feel sorry for you!</li>
            <li> works very well and can&#x27;t beat the price !!! tried other and none compares to this!!! great buy for this product!!!very satisfied with it !!!</li>
            <li> I like this thing, my skin always feels nice after using it.&lt;br /&gt;It feels good to exfoliate the dry skin and I like the way it massages moisturiser into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Just Be careful not to get water into the battery compartment and take off the exfoliating / massaging head to clean.,!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting one of these power facial cleansers for awhile.  I have mild rosacea however and have been a bit leary of trying one.  I was glad to see it was made by Conair as I have been using their hair appliances for years and trust the brand.  When I received this one through the Amazon Vine program I immediately tried it out.  Taking it out of the box I was glad to see 2 AA batteries provided.  The batteries snap in easily and don&#x27;t add any weight to the already lightweight cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser comes with two attachments.  A very soft brush and a sponge applicator.  There are two speeds on the cleanser (hi and low) as well as a rotation direction change feature.  The attachments snap on and off very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions state to 1) apply a generous amount of exfoliating cream to your face.  I recommend that the first step is to first wet your face with a splash of water or wet washcloth.  This allows you to use less exfoliating cream in my opinion.  Step 2) At the speed of your choice, massage cleanser on your face in a circular motion, not to exceed two minutes.  I switched the rotation direction after 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you exfoliate the instructions recommend you use an astringent to close the pores.  The next step is to dot your favorite moisturizer on forehead, cheeks, nose and chin (I include my neck area).  Then attach the sponge applicator.  Apply light to medium pressure in circular upward strokes.  The sponge almost tickles but maybe that is just me.  I did find that I could use less moisturizer with the sponge applicator.  After using the facial cleanser be sure to rinse your attachments well and leave to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that the technical issues have been covered I will let you know what I personally thought of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I am not one to remove my eye makeup separately from the rest of my face makeup.  I usually do it all in one swoop with a soft washcloth and circular motions.  I was skeptical that the attachment brush would remove more of the makeup than the plain washcloth.  It did but I am not sure if it was more effective or I just spent more time on my skin with the brush than I do with a washcloth.  I wouldn&#x27;t use the facial cleanser to remove makeup nightly but I WOULD use it a couple of times a week simply to exfoliate.  I do think my skin benefited more with the moisturizer sponge applicator and would use that attachment nightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the brush 3 times in a row and was glad to see that it did NOT adversely irritate the rosacea prone areas.  That said, the instructions do state that the cleanser should NOT be used in the following cases: Tuberculosis, diabetes, benign and malignant tumors, inflammation of the skin, phlebitis and thrombosis, open and fresh wounds, bruises, broken skin or varicose veins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all if you feel like you can benefit from a power exfoliator then this is a decent one for a good price.  I wonder how long the brush and sponge attachments will last.  I tried to find a source for attachment replacements but couldn&#x27;t find one.  Of course, at only $14.99 it is just as easy to purchase an entire new one when needed.I was skeptical that the attachment brush would remove more of the makeup than the plain washcloth.

            <li> The bristles are soft enough to use the product dry and feel a slight burn on your skin but otherwise it is comfortable and it is not actually recommended to be used dry. Wasn&#x27;t any more irritating than a washcloth would be. Can&#x27;t be used in a tub or shower, takes batteries, and is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> I have tried other similar products and found that the cleaning brushes were extremely irritating to my skin - and I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s as though the manufacturers felt that if they weren&#x27;t scraping away the cells, your skin wouldn&#x27;t feel clean. Not the case with this Power Facial Cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  It has 2 speeds, low &amp; high, as well as a forward &amp; a reverse button&lt;br /&gt;  There is a bristle brush for cleaning &amp; a foam pad for your moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;  It is battery operated and they supply the batteries&lt;br /&gt;  It is made by Conair which is always a quality product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  I looked all through the paperwork but could not find any information on replacement brushes or pads&lt;br /&gt;  There are so many warnings about keeping the unit away from water - I started getting paranoid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this little guy for a few days and haven&#x27;t felt any discomfort or irritation to my skin. I also like the idea (although it seemed strange at first) of using the foam pad attachment to apply my moisturizer.  It&#x27;s very soothing and my fingers don&#x27;t get greasy. Who knew? My face looks and feels terrific. No blotches or uneven texture. Just good, clean, healthy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint and reason for 4 stars is not knowing how much, how often, and where I might find replacement parts.  There is no way that these little attachments are gonna last forever and I would hate to throw away a perfectly good cleanser because the brush and/or pad wore out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it is an excellent product. And the fact that they include the batteries makes them even more exceptional in my opinion. Very classy.</li>
            <li> I love this in the shower!  I put my cleanser on it and let the brush do the rest!</li>
            <li> Awful quality. When you turn it on and put it to your face, it just stops moving. Definitely do not purchase.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this cleanser as it makes me feel as I had a professional facial done.  My face feels smooth, it&#x27;s healthy, and glowing.</li>
            <li> I love this thing, my skin is getting so clear and even toned, my pores look great also. Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced, works well and is very gentle for my sensitive, small pore, allergic reaction prone skin.  I do recommend.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!!! Love the way my face feels so clean after using this, it cleans so well, and so worth the price!!</li>
            <li> Came uber quick! love the simplicity if it. Takes off make up and all other skin clogging residues.Noticed skin to be brighter and clearer in 4 days!</li>
            <li> I am  satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> I got this facial brush after buying a manual brush a few weeks ago. I read EVERY review about it and was very pleased with the product when I got it. The low setting is somewhat laggy but I really love it. Left my face (pores!) looking and feeling great!</li>
            <li> Makes the face feel so good</li>
            <li> When I first looked at this product, I read the reviews and saw alot of people saying it was too harsh and I was like oh well I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin this will be fine for me. I been using it for about a week now, everyday and its too harsh for everyday use. Once a week sure, everyday no. Would I buy it again, ya. But from now on it will be every week exfoiliation.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  The low speed is best for those with more sensitive skin but overall it does well with deep cleaning and exfoliating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good cleansing tool. One tip, don&#x27;t press down on your skin with the cleansing brush. Use light brush strokes.</li>
            <li> I love this face scrubber, it also comes with the rotating pad so you can apply your lotion with it. Its the perfect speeds, and it half the price of the other brands and it does the same thing. /I bought the olay one and it broke in a month. This product is great and its quality. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t used all that much.  Never dropped.  Stopped working at around the 3 week mark.  I&#x27;m done with this crappola!  I feel ripped off.  Not that much money, but I should have gotten at least six months out of it.  Pay a little more and maybe get a better product.</li>
            <li> When it first came it worked wonderfully, but it just became less powerful overtime, i kept it away from water and replaced the batteries and it still didn&#x27;t go as far as it used to. Now i use it without batteries and my face is still clear, i don&#x27;t recommend it. Buy something a little more expensive.</li>
            <li> This item broke within 2 weeks of buying it. It would not turn off. Purchased a Clensure and has worked better and lasted longer.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day maybe once a week, but it does what I need it to do. my face feels refreshed and clean after using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. I don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of a facial brush cleanser.  It is better than I expected.  It does exactly what I wanted it to do and even more.  It does a great job on my face.</li>
            <li> More powerful than it looks. Beware if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worthy the 14$ I spent on it. The batteries are already dying after a week and the brush is already tearing up. I need a replacement.</li>
            <li> great facial cleanser for the money</li>
            <li> Brush quality is bad. Brussels looks like a used brush. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> I love that you use your own cleanser and moisturizer with this device.  The bristle brush ALMOST feels too rough on my skin, but it does seem to do an excellent job at exfolation and my skin feels very clean and smooth after cleansing.  The sponge attachment also does a fine job at working moisturizer into my skin, but I suspect it wastes a bit of moisturizer each time as some inevitably gets absorbed by the sponge and has to be rinsed out after each use.  So as not to waste moisturizer I will probably keep applying moisturizer with my fingertips rather than this device.  Like other reviewers, I, too, wonder about the availability of replacement heads.  The heads are easily removed and cleaned but still will likely wear out over time.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted to clean my pores. Not too big and just strong enough. I like it! Price was right.</li>
            <li> It cleans my face and seems to clean the pores.  I also use a facial cleanser with it as well.</li>
            <li> So, the applicator sponge was misshapen after the first use (with more moisturizer going into sponge than on skin) and any sort of pressure s-l-o-w-s the unit down to almost nothing.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I finally purchased a power cleaner and love this one, it gently exfoliates my face atleast 3 times a week and does a very good job...I have not used the soft attachment yet. I rub in cleanser and brush entire face area and rinse.... A+++</li>
            <li> product stopped work right after the 30 days was up for the return I&#x27;m highly upset !!!! 😡</li>
