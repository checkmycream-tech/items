            <li>Then I found this face wash on Amazon and tried it because of all the awesome reviews.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li>The cream cleanser is too greasy, but the gel is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff!</li>
            <li>Thank you, Amazon.com, for providing this wonder product - and at a great price.</li>

            <li>She has had great results with this product when she has used it with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This product wasn&#x27;t as great as what others say.  </li>
            <li>I have not been using this product twice-a-day like it recommends on the label, but once per day has been great to me.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how every review here is so great when this product seemed so ineffective for me and for my wife.</li>
            <li>but I have a great face moisturizer to counter that.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>I read all the great reviews</li>
            <li>My order arrived in great condition, no leaks and arrived as scheduled.  </li>
            <li>At night I even put a dab of gel on any blemishes I have and they are greatly improved or goine by morning.  </li>
            <li>The pack of 4 for the price is a great deal in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because of the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>Its great to remove makeup</li>
            <li>This product is great for my age.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great cleanser.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that Amazon carries this because I could not find it in any store.  </li>
            <li>Great product for people with ezcema as well.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>but this  item is a cheap(but very effective) replacement.    </li>
            <li>It has been very effective at clearing up breakouts in my t-zone area.  </li>
            <li>How lucky are we that the best face wash also turns out to be the best value?  </li>
            <li>A pleasant smell is a MUST for me.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the good reviews</li>
            <li>So anything that can do that to me is a good product.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good cleanser to take off my makeup as well as for my acne or pimples that I would occassionally get</li>
            <li>and I had always had good skin</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day in the shower with a good moisturizer &amp; have no breakouts.</li>
            <li>It is really good for the skin.    </li>
            <li>so I was delighted to discover that Amazon had it.</li>
            <li>I had forgotten what a good product this is.</li>
            <li>Good price and good on skin.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.  </li>
            <li>, I am going to stock up and make sure that I always have  this product available because I am now a very happy woman.</li>
            <li>I even use their scrub and love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it here!</li>
            <li>I wish it was still available at CVS, but I&#x27;m happy that I can buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I think the trick is you have to find a balance of things that work for you that kind of normalize your skin.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered myself a nice pack of 4 that will keep me going for a while.</li>
            <li>it would unavoidably splash all over the place and run through my fingers (kind of like water).</li>
            <li>Save your money to buy nice moisturizers and serums for treating and controlling your skin issues.</li>
            <li>Good but not my favorite.........</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m yet to try the product, but it smells nice and has a nice texture.</li>
            <li>I never had a face wash before this, so it was a very good first starter.</li>
            <li>I got it becuase of all of the good reviews, It makes my face feel good after I wash it, I always feel fresh.</li>
            <li>but since I got a 4 pack it will be probably a year before I need more! :)</li>
            <li>this is a great price for a facial wash that is actually good!</li>
            <li>This product works the best and is not harsh on her skin.</li>
            <li>This seems to work best and is also  working for my 16 year old.</li>
            <li>This is far the best.</li>
            <li>I love phisoderm, it makes my skin feel great and cleared up the acne quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found for my skin because it does not dry my face.  </li>
            <li>The reason pHisoderm is so excellent is because it gets rid of acne, and it does not dry the skin out.  </li>
            <li>This is very good if you have sensitive skin, however it does have a scent to it that may not be tolerated by people with allergies.</li>
            <li>I love phisoderm.</li>
            <li>i think it&#x27;s the best facial cleaner there is.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>It takes my makeup off better than my face wash specifically for makeup did.   </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know for sure</li>
            <li>if its just been this product or not, I do know for sure</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is okay.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now and love the results.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more happier so</li>
            <li>Every generation has to have a \\&quot;concept\\&quot; of what&#x27;s healthy.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic results!  </li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products for acne over my life, still have problems at 55.  </li>
            <li>soo glad I didn&#x27;t pay for expedited shipping.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the results, or lack thereof.</li>
            <li>I decided to give it a try since 4 bottles cost almost as much as that one Neutrogena bottle and what a great purchase.  </li>
            <li>Even if I continue to buy and use both these products, prefer the \\&quot;body wash\\&quot; version :-)</li>
            <li>While we still get some breakouts I can tell a difference the more</li>
            <li>This product has a nice light lemony fragrance that doesn&#x27;t bother my sinuses.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Ok, maybe not my life but my skin and</li>
            <li>I changed to a healthier diet, slept more, detoxed, facials, name brand face washes...</li>
            <li>And nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;After much research and reviews, I came upon this product on amazon and read the great reviews it has for this product.</li>
            <li>cannot emphasize how much I love this product.</li>
            <li>but I also have many embarrassing acne scars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a problem with tugh was, but not my skin feels like it&#x27;s going to split like a couple that has fallen out of love.</li>
            <li>A person could spend much more money and still not get the quality of skin care as they do from this product</li>
            <li>FREE OF PIMPLES!</li>
            <li>But what he loves most was the price.</li>
            <li>i love phisoderm.</li>
            <li>so i cant use many products.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>I used Proactive and my face broke out more.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for many many years, since even before Phisoderm bought the product, but i&#x27;ll have to shop around for an alternative now.</li>
            <li>I myself like it better</li>
            <li>Been using it for more that 15 years.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better an clearer than before.  </li>
            <li>My 16 year old daughter finds this product brilliant.  </li>
            <li>Love it and will order it again.</li>
            <li>Love the pHisoderm gel as a facewash.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite the gel thickness did not see right, the product still worked good.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful wash that doesn&#x27;t have its own agenda to fight all the other stuff going on.</li>
            <li>I think this is a great wash for \\&quot; normal \\&quot; skin.</li>
            <li>was thrilled to find a facial wash pack that didn&#x27;t cost a  fortune and was great on our skin.</li>
            <li>It is smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt and looks better than it has since I was a teenager.      </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad that it&#x27;s available on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>It removes oils, dirt, make-up easily and without drying effects.</li>
            <li>So glad I finally found a great skin care routine.</li>
            <li>I was a bit reluctant to purchase the body wash because one or two of the reviews stated it had a strong odor.</li>
            <li>This wash cleans pretty well and foams nicely.</li>
            <li>The product is fine, but it was packaged and sent in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li>my face and body feels super smooth!</li>
            <li>Works great, a little drying on its own.</li>
            <li>this has definetly made a huge difference in my skin,  </li>
            <li>, my makeup I think was a huge factor in breaking me out, but I know how it is</li>
            <li>Heck, I don&#x27;t want to sound like an infomercial,</li>
            <li>I went back to what I was using before and it works great.</li>
            <li>that is incredibly important to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great feeling when you don&#x27;t see acne waking up.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that i have finally found the answer to my problem.</li>
            <li>I hope this will always be available.</li>
            <li>If you loved phisohex in a bright green bottle as a teenager years ago and you can no longer find it in drug stores this is a close replacement.</li>
            <li>In my case, this seems to keep breakouts at bay; I&#x27;ve had good results so far.    </li>
            <li>Buying four at a time saves me trips to the store and is VERY economical.  </li>
            <li>yourself a favor and get a nice normal face wash that you enjoy</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a quick and easy application.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very gentle, but still able to remove all my makeup at the end of the day, and it doesn&#x27;t over-dry my skin.</li>
            <li>Great price and quick delivery of a product that we can no longer find locally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to explain this to myself but cannot come up with a coherent and logical explanation.</li>
            <li>It can be drying in some areas like my cheeks though, but totally worth it!</li>
            <li>but it has reduced my acne significantly.</li>
            <li>I like how foamy it gets and how clean it leaves my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for three months and my face has never been this clean.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and as a teenager, I tried all of the popular products-</li>
            <li>Great for acne, makes skin smooth, sudsing power is terrific and it really gets your face clean.</li>
            <li>Over time it has gone through some changes but, it has never failed to keep my skin clear and feeling good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li>yeah, it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>it had turned into a full blown reaction.</li>
            <li>My skin was full of scars, acne, and blemishes.</li>
            <li>The face wash smells nice so far, it leaked out during shipping.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really smell much of a fragrance, which is good for most with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It heals quickly and I move on with a glowing youthful complextion.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied, and for $15 a pack of 4, I think it&#x27;s a steal</li>
            <li>great for slightly oily skin</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my daughter is who has very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most anti-blemish products.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too excited at first</li>
            <li>At first it seemed fine and very gentle but after a week</li>
            <li>My skin seems pretty clean after drying with a towel.</li>
            <li>so I apply a little face lotion on these areas but otherwise this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple years now as a body wash and rarely break out.</li>
            <li>We have switched to the Avon brand and not only is it effective (showed improvements within 24 days), it does not sting or irriate my daughters skin or eyes.</li>
            <li>But, since each case is different, every skin is unique and each person has their own perspective, I understand that this product may have been very satisfactory for some.</li>
            <li>I used this back in high school and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s just the right thickness.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and my skin felt oily even right after using this product.</li>
            <li>It also felt comforting with the pleasant, tingly, slightly minty sensation.</li>
            <li>It gives me a gentle clean.</li>
            <li>I originally rated this product very high, but based on my most recent purchase, I&#x27;m changing it to a 1 star.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>I was also very, very attracted to the price.      </li>
            <li>So I found it here for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, not one store in Casper, Wyoming sells any of the Phisoderm products.</li>
            <li>I used to use the cleanser included in Neutrogena&#x27;s \\&quot;Advanced Solutions Complete Acne Therapy System,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>but then I would get my oily skin back and more breakouts.</li>
            <li>My nose and forehead areas especially look much better.</li>
            <li>Back then, it was the medicinal smell thing :-)    </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews on this product I purchased the body wash and the facial wash and love both.</li>
            <li>I was EXTREMELY SATISFIED with this order, I ordered this item around 11pm on a Thurs, and recieved the item around 10am the following Saturday!</li>
            <li>but I started to get MORE tiny pimples since I started using this.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely a cure for those who have acne breakouts, blemishes, and a better self-esteem.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying this for the first time, don&#x27;t buy the 4 pack.  </li>
            <li>did not do much in my opinion!~</li>
            <li>He have been a returning customer of this product ever since I first bought it for him about 4 years ago.</li>
            <li>And by the way, this is my first review on amazon-because nothing has ever surpassed my expectations like this before.</li>
            <li>I love this facial wash</li>
            <li>Other than that I love it!</li>
            <li>But that characteristic made it very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I recommend you check out Aveeno or Cetaphil Gentel Skin Cleanser for super sensitive skin, and Basis Cleaner Clean face wash or Clean &amp; Clean Sensitive face wash for mildly sensitive to normal Skin.</li>
            <li>Trial and error is the only way to know for sure, but I think this is so worth a shot though, as I have had so many problems with other products, but never a problem with this.</li>
            <li>B001LFI33E Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst</li>
            <li>I have tried everything - clearasil, oxy, sea breeze, clean and clear, dove, olay, aveeno, neutragena, cetaphil, clinique, este lauder, shiseido, proactive.</li>
            <li>Clean but not tight.</li>
            <li>If you have come across another review I wrote for another face wash, pretty much what I said is</li>
            <li>I was becoming hopeless and depressed because I couldn&#x27;t find anything that helped but at the same time I didn&#x27;t want to give up to prescriptions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a harsh product either and feels rather mild.  </li>
            <li>(there were 8 large pimples in a 1\\&quot; radius).  </li>
            <li>I bought this after reading the positive reviews, but it didn&#x27;t do much for my skin.</li>
            <li>Other than that it has a light pleasant scent and if salicylic acid has worked for you in the past, then this worth a try.</li>
            <li>This product in conjunction with palmers skin success fade cream as a moisturizer because my skin gets a little dry after using, has been a great beauty regime.</li>
            <li>Now as far as the product, I love Phisoderm anti blemish gel face wash, it has helped with minimizing new acne and depleting old acne scars.</li>
            <li>The only thing I like more than my clear skin is the price!</li>
            <li>After spending literally hundreds of dollars on expensive products, I couldn&#x27;t believe how amazing this cheap product (per bottle) was!</li>
            <li>I couldnt swear that is really helps with acne though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that I have not broken out while using this</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my skin wouldve cleared up as much as it did without it really.  </li>
            <li>It cleans your face, but I feel that it doesn&#x27;t really get all the oil off my face.</li>
            <li>subscribed to this when it was available on Amazon to get the extra saving.</li>
            <li>The ones I received did not appear much as a gel and seemed to be watered</li>
            <li>My face is very oily but this cleanser really helps me control my skin&#x27;s oil level.    </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try this one, I really need my miracle product.</li>
            <li>I think that the combination of salicylic acid and lactic acid really works for my skin.</li>
            <li>It cleans the skin throughly, preventing acne, gently, without drying the skin.    </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really deliver a feeling of being \\&quot;washed\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Again, I prefer the Biore Ice Cleanser, with which I had the satisfaction of feeling clean and refreshed, yet not dry.</li>
            <li>well soon after my skin started to get really itchy</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see any improvements</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>As for being anti-blemish....not so much.</li>
            <li>So far all I can say is it smells so fresh and</li>
            <li>the phisoderm family are gentle yet effecfive.</li>
            <li>It has really helped the complexion problem I was having.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything for my very oily skin, nothing zapped my zits like this</li>
            <li>but it has made my skin so much smoother and cleared up my breakouts.</li>
            <li>and I have not broken out.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this to everyone!  </li>
            <li>In attempt to bring some sexy back to my borderline 30 yr old skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find anything better, and certainly not at the price.    </li>
            <li>I figured with 70+ reviews that average strong results--I need to try it!</li>
            <li>I love it, and it&#x27;s not irritating like some of the other products.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t written or recommended any other face-washing product for acne because I haven&#x27;t found one good enough until pHisoderm.</li>
            <li>Dove, Aveeno, Clearisil, Clean and Clear, Neutrogena, Oil of Olay, St. Ives, Proactiv, and even the Loreal line of adult acne treatments.    </li>
            <li>My daughter can&#x27;t use most any other face wash.  </li>
            <li>These days--at age 56--I still have skin that is inclined to break out, so pHisoderm STILL works better than any other product.  </li>
            <li>I see a greater next-day improvement in pimples with this face wash than with any other wash I&#x27;ve used and it doesn&#x27;t over-dry your face.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t always prevent breakouts from occurring but it has worked better than the other product I did try.  </li>
            <li>I have to use 2-3 pumps to clean my face, where I would only need 1 pump of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable as long as you qualify for free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>This product is sooooh good that not only cleansed my face but lighten the dark spots as well.</li>
            <li>I then tried the Phisoderm anti-blemish gel facial wash and it&#x27;s as good as the previous phisoderm products.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did because the scar causing acne that was developing is gone now almost completely, so this really made a difference as well with the other things I&#x27;ve been using on my face.</li>
            <li>But this new formulation becomes very flaky, and makes it look like your skin is peeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This works wonders on my older childrens skin.  </li>
            <li>After trying a wide variety of products, this combination seems to work the best to keep her acne at bay without irritating her skin.</li>
            <li>the older you get.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only facial cleanser that keeps my face free from blemishes on a consistent basis.  </li>
            <li>The seller shipped it in an envelope, a box might have been better, as well as making sure the lids where on tight, now some of the bottles are not completely full.</li>
            <li>So, of course, I recommend this product highly for all ages.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s high rating</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe I found an inexpensive fast wash that controls my adult acne and oily skin problem.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m young (since I still have blemish problems) and don&#x27;t really like smelly like a grandma after washing my face.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel clean, removes all the oil, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that wants clear skin.  </li>
            <li>Then, the entire packaging changed, again, to what it is now -- small (dang) -- and clear -- the modern version of \\&quot;good for your skin\\&quot; concept.    </li>
            <li>it is pretty much the same product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how phisoderm can be so effective at such an extremely low cost and low popularity.</li>
            <li>Just normal face wash.  </li>
            <li>I had trouble finding the product locally, but, of course, was able to find it on Amazon and at the right price.</li>
            <li>pHisoderm Anti-Blemish Gel Facial Wash. This stuff goes on your face, right there where your nose is, unavoidably reeking and creeping up your nostrils...</li>
            <li>In my experience, you only have to use this once a day for it to be effective, so these bottles will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Keeps new pimples from forming</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try because I was breaking out quite a bit (1 or 2 new pimples a day).  </li>
            <li>but it prevents new ones from forming.  </li>
            <li>I am now out and was desperate that I would not be able to get more.</li>
            <li>After that, it changed bottles, again, but was still white, and available in big sizes.    </li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive skin this may not be the product for you.  </li>
            <li>Well after trying many of face washes over the past year I saw the consumer report review and thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li>I obviously stopped using it and for the first time in my life I had to go to the allergist/</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get such positive results.</li>
            <li>It was very stressful trying to find a new facial wash because I tried everything and nothing was working for me.  </li>
            <li>Both are 20+ but struggled with acne but after using this stuff their skin is really clear now.  </li>
            <li>For a none prescription, my wife claims it keeps her skin clear of blemishes &amp; leaves skin radient.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used everything on the market plus ProActive to clear up acne and some worked</li>
            <li>Besides, Biore Ice Cleanser DID help keep my face clear.    </li>
            <li>This wash contains salicylic acid, which is widely used for treating light facial blemishes.</li>
            <li>It is that clear cut for me.</li>
            <li>B001E5D0BQ St. Ives Swiss Formula Clear Pore Cleanser, Purifying Face Wash, 10-Ounce Pump Bottles (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li>After a month, my skin was CLEAR.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin and moderate acne as a very hopeful solution to your problem.</li>
            <li>I am in my 30&#x27;s and have oily skin with adult acne.</li>
            <li>This works well on her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin and have never reacted to anything in my life.</li>
            <li>so far  </li>
            <li>Try it you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This item was shipped and delivered extremely fast for it to be standard shipping!</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the linen closet in a old people&#x27;s home--is it musty or musky?</li>
            <li>I have gone through several face washes that make me sneeze uncontrollably or have way too much menthol</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 62 years old and have used Phisoderm products since I was 18 years   old.  </li>
            <li>a must have for sensitive faces.</li>
            <li>I have had acne for 11 years and I am 20 yrs old.</li>
            <li>My face feels soooo soft and my scars are all clearing up.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne--</li>
            <li>As far as the product goes, I tried using it</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t return it and didn&#x27;t want to toss it, so I used it as a body wash for my back (not necessarily needed but couldn&#x27;t hurt, right?).    </li>
            <li>I have used Phisoderm for many years, not easy to find in local stores.</li>
            <li>This would result in dire consequences as I inevitably would break out for the duration of the time I was using the other cleanser (as stubborn and cheap as I am</li>
            <li>I would not describe this product as a gentle cleanser, it is pretty strong, sometimes I only use half a pump or dilute it a little with water.</li>
            <li>but like I said I do believe this has had a major factor in my skin being clear and staying that way.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about the  anti-blemish Facial Wash!</li>
            <li>and now Im back to normal.</li>
            <li>I have absolutely no pimples with consistent use.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer the viscosity of Biore Ice Cleanser (or any other such viscose cleanser), which allows me to pump gently into my hand, control the amount in each pump, and lasted me about 4 months</li>
            <li>pHisoderm is gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>Granted, this consistency may make it easier for some people to spread; but you end up using too much product, consuming the whole bottle within a few weeks.</li>
            <li>The smell is less than fresh.</li>
            <li>I found it to be a clean smelling product and not overwhelming in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d used general mainstream products, as well as products aimed and marketed specifically towards men.  </li>
            <li>This product is the only thing that keeps my face clear.</li>
            <li>This product cleared my face and two days later it was clear.</li>
            <li>I have only been washing my face with pHisoderm for a week, and my skin is already completely clear.  </li>
            <li>I use this cleanser once daily to keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>I still get a couple pimples but this facial wash has fixed 80-90% of my pimples.  </li>
            <li>The glowing reviews prompted me to chime in with my two cents, since my experience was the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>Finally I tried the old Phisohex   product and it cleaned my skin without irritation.  </li>
            <li>Oh and I also use bare escentuals blemish therapy powder as a spot treatment the moment I see something coming up on my face.</li>
            <li>actually turned into $60 + with the doctor, shot and topicals to get my face back to normal.</li>
            <li>Lathering my face with it felt weird, kind of \\&quot;off\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I can only use it at night though or it will dry my skin out too much.  </li>
            <li>Especially if I have a super dry face from the winter air or when my pores are really open after a long workout.</li>
            <li>but I am very optimistic when reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li>(To clear up my acne I used crushed aspirin) and then this to maintain clear skin.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t help keep my face clear, and actually set me back a couple of months of treatment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple products and always come back to this one to keep my face clear without drying it out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unfortunate that the company isn&#x27;t too concerned with selling the product, as they did back in the 70s when it was available in gigantic glaring green bottles, was white, and had a medicinal smell :-)  </li>
            <li>It does not dry my skin.  </li>
            <li>I did find it cheeper at Big Lots for less than $3.00 a bottle after I ordered it on here, one of the first times I found something cheeper somewhere than amazon.</li>
            <li>Not long ago, I couldn&#x27;t walk out of the house without any foundation on.</li>
            <li>The only problem for me is that this facial wash doesn&#x27;t exactly keep all the pimples away although it has cut them down by a lot.  </li>

            <li> Then I found this face wash on Amazon and tried it because of all the awesome reviews.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> The cream cleanser is too greasy, but the gel is perfect.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Thank you, Amazon.com, for providing this wonder product - and at a great price.</li>

            <li> This is a great product and it does work.  </li>
            <li> No matter your age, this is a great product if you suffer from problems with acne.  </li>
            <li> She has had great results with this product when she has used it with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t as great as what others say.  </li>
            <li> I have not been using this product twice-a-day like it recommends on the label, but once per day has been great to me.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how every review here is so great when this product seemed so ineffective for me and for my wife.</li>
            <li> but I have a great face moisturizer to counter that.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I read all the great reviews</li>
            <li> My order arrived in great condition, no leaks and arrived as scheduled.  </li>
            <li> At night I even put a dab of gel on any blemishes I have and they are greatly improved or goine by morning.  </li>
            <li> The pack of 4 for the price is a great deal in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> Its great to remove makeup</li>
            <li> This product is great for my age.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great cleanser.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that Amazon carries this because I could not find it in any store.  </li>
            <li> Great product for people with ezcema as well.</li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> but this  item is a cheap(but very effective) replacement.    </li>
            <li> It has been very effective at clearing up breakouts in my t-zone area.  </li>
            <li> How lucky are we that the best face wash also turns out to be the best value?  </li>
            <li> A pleasant smell is a MUST for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good reviews</li>
            <li> So anything that can do that to me is a good product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good cleanser to take off my makeup as well as for my acne or pimples that I would occassionally get</li>
            <li> and I had always had good skin</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day in the shower with a good moisturizer &amp; have no breakouts.</li>
            <li> It is really good for the skin.    </li>
            <li> so I was delighted to discover that Amazon had it.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten what a good product this is.</li>
            <li> Good price and good on skin.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  </li>
            <li> , I am going to stock up and make sure that I always have  this product available because I am now a very happy woman.</li>
            <li> I even use their scrub and love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found it here!</li>
            <li> I wish it was still available at CVS, but I&#x27;m happy that I can buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I think the trick is you have to find a balance of things that work for you that kind of normalize your skin.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered myself a nice pack of 4 that will keep me going for a while.</li>
            <li> it would unavoidably splash all over the place and run through my fingers (kind of like water).</li>
            <li> Save your money to buy nice moisturizers and serums for treating and controlling your skin issues.</li>
            <li> Good but not my favorite.........</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m yet to try the product, but it smells nice and has a nice texture.</li>
            <li> I never had a face wash before this, so it was a very good first starter.</li>
            <li> I got it becuase of all of the good reviews, It makes my face feel good after I wash it, I always feel fresh.</li>
            <li> but since I got a 4 pack it will be probably a year before I need more! :)</li>
            <li> this is a great price for a facial wash that is actually good!</li>
            <li> This product works the best and is not harsh on her skin.</li>
            <li> This seems to work best and is also  working for my 16 year old.</li>
            <li> This is far the best.</li>
            <li> I love phisoderm, it makes my skin feel great and cleared up the acne quick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found for my skin because it does not dry my face.  </li>
            <li> The reason pHisoderm is so excellent is because it gets rid of acne, and it does not dry the skin out.  </li>
            <li> This is very good if you have sensitive skin, however it does have a scent to it that may not be tolerated by people with allergies.</li>
            <li> I love phisoderm.</li>
            <li> i think it&#x27;s the best facial cleaner there is.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> It takes my makeup off better than my face wash specifically for makeup did.   </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know for sure</li>
            <li> if its just been this product or not, I do know for sure</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is okay.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now and love the results.  </li>
            <li> and I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happier so</li>
            <li> Every generation has to have a \\&quot;concept\\&quot; of what&#x27;s healthy.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic results!  </li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products for acne over my life, still have problems at 55.  </li>
            <li> soo glad I didn&#x27;t pay for expedited shipping.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the results, or lack thereof.</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try since 4 bottles cost almost as much as that one Neutrogena bottle and what a great purchase.  </li>
            <li> Even if I continue to buy and use both these products, prefer the \\&quot;body wash\\&quot; version :-)</li>
            <li> While we still get some breakouts I can tell a difference the more</li>
            <li> This product has a nice light lemony fragrance that doesn&#x27;t bother my sinuses.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe not my life but my skin and</li>
            <li> I changed to a healthier diet, slept more, detoxed, facials, name brand face washes...</li>
            <li> And nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;After much research and reviews, I came upon this product on amazon and read the great reviews it has for this product.</li>
            <li> cannot emphasize how much I love this product.</li>
            <li> but I also have many embarrassing acne scars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with tugh was, but not my skin feels like it&#x27;s going to split like a couple that has fallen out of love.</li>
            <li> A person could spend much more money and still not get the quality of skin care as they do from this product</li>
            <li> FREE OF PIMPLES!</li>
            <li> But what he loves most was the price.</li>
            <li> i love phisoderm.</li>
            <li> so i cant use many products.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> I used Proactive and my face broke out more.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for many many years, since even before Phisoderm bought the product, but i&#x27;ll have to shop around for an alternative now.</li>
            <li> I myself like it better</li>
            <li> Been using it for more that 15 years.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better an clearer than before.  </li>
            <li> My 16 year old daughter finds this product brilliant.  </li>
            <li> Love it and will order it again.</li>
            <li> Love the pHisoderm gel as a facewash.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite the gel thickness did not see right, the product still worked good.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful wash that doesn&#x27;t have its own agenda to fight all the other stuff going on.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great wash for \\&quot; normal \\&quot; skin.</li>
            <li> was thrilled to find a facial wash pack that didn&#x27;t cost a  fortune and was great on our skin.</li>
            <li> It is smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt and looks better than it has since I was a teenager.      </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad that it&#x27;s available on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> It removes oils, dirt, make-up easily and without drying effects.</li>
            <li> So glad I finally found a great skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I was a bit reluctant to purchase the body wash because one or two of the reviews stated it had a strong odor.</li>
            <li> This wash cleans pretty well and foams nicely.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, but it was packaged and sent in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> my face and body feels super smooth!</li>
            <li> Works great, a little drying on its own.</li>
            <li> this has definetly made a huge difference in my skin,  </li>
            <li> , my makeup I think was a huge factor in breaking me out, but I know how it is</li>
            <li> Heck, I don&#x27;t want to sound like an infomercial,</li>
            <li> I went back to what I was using before and it works great.</li>
            <li> that is incredibly important to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great feeling when you don&#x27;t see acne waking up.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that i have finally found the answer to my problem.</li>
            <li> I hope this will always be available.</li>
            <li> If you loved phisohex in a bright green bottle as a teenager years ago and you can no longer find it in drug stores this is a close replacement.</li>
            <li> In my case, this seems to keep breakouts at bay; I&#x27;ve had good results so far.    </li>
            <li> Buying four at a time saves me trips to the store and is VERY economical.  </li>
            <li> yourself a favor and get a nice normal face wash that you enjoy</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a quick and easy application.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very gentle, but still able to remove all my makeup at the end of the day, and it doesn&#x27;t over-dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Great price and quick delivery of a product that we can no longer find locally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to explain this to myself but cannot come up with a coherent and logical explanation.</li>
            <li> It can be drying in some areas like my cheeks though, but totally worth it!</li>
            <li> but it has reduced my acne significantly.</li>
            <li> I like how foamy it gets and how clean it leaves my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for three months and my face has never been this clean.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and as a teenager, I tried all of the popular products-</li>
            <li> Great for acne, makes skin smooth, sudsing power is terrific and it really gets your face clean.</li>
            <li> Over time it has gone through some changes but, it has never failed to keep my skin clear and feeling good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li> yeah, it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> it had turned into a full blown reaction.</li>
            <li> My skin was full of scars, acne, and blemishes.</li>
            <li> The face wash smells nice so far, it leaked out during shipping.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really smell much of a fragrance, which is good for most with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It heals quickly and I move on with a glowing youthful complextion.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am very satisfied, and for $15 a pack of 4, I think it&#x27;s a steal</li>
            <li> great for slightly oily skin</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter is who has very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most anti-blemish products.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too excited at first</li>
            <li> At first it seemed fine and very gentle but after a week</li>
            <li> My skin seems pretty clean after drying with a towel.</li>
            <li> so I apply a little face lotion on these areas but otherwise this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple years now as a body wash and rarely break out.</li>
            <li> We have switched to the Avon brand and not only is it effective (showed improvements within 24 days), it does not sting or irriate my daughters skin or eyes.</li>
            <li> But, since each case is different, every skin is unique and each person has their own perspective, I understand that this product may have been very satisfactory for some.</li>
            <li> I used this back in high school and absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just the right thickness.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and my skin felt oily even right after using this product.</li>
            <li> It also felt comforting with the pleasant, tingly, slightly minty sensation.</li>
            <li> It gives me a gentle clean.</li>
            <li> I originally rated this product very high, but based on my most recent purchase, I&#x27;m changing it to a 1 star.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> I was also very, very attracted to the price.      </li>
            <li> So I found it here for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, not one store in Casper, Wyoming sells any of the Phisoderm products.</li>
            <li> I used to use the cleanser included in Neutrogena&#x27;s \\&quot;Advanced Solutions Complete Acne Therapy System,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> but then I would get my oily skin back and more breakouts.</li>
            <li> My nose and forehead areas especially look much better.</li>
            <li> Back then, it was the medicinal smell thing :-)    </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on this product I purchased the body wash and the facial wash and love both.</li>
            <li> I was EXTREMELY SATISFIED with this order, I ordered this item around 11pm on a Thurs, and recieved the item around 10am the following Saturday!</li>
            <li> but I started to get MORE tiny pimples since I started using this.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely a cure for those who have acne breakouts, blemishes, and a better self-esteem.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying this for the first time, don&#x27;t buy the 4 pack.  </li>
            <li> did not do much in my opinion!~</li>
            <li> He have been a returning customer of this product ever since I first bought it for him about 4 years ago.</li>
            <li> And by the way, this is my first review on amazon-because nothing has ever surpassed my expectations like this before.</li>
            <li> I love this facial wash</li>
            <li> Other than that I love it!</li>
            <li> But that characteristic made it very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I recommend you check out Aveeno or Cetaphil Gentel Skin Cleanser for super sensitive skin, and Basis Cleaner Clean face wash or Clean &amp; Clean Sensitive face wash for mildly sensitive to normal Skin.</li>
            <li> Trial and error is the only way to know for sure, but I think this is so worth a shot though, as I have had so many problems with other products, but never a problem with this.</li>
            <li> B001LFI33E Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst</li>
            <li> I have tried everything - clearasil, oxy, sea breeze, clean and clear, dove, olay, aveeno, neutragena, cetaphil, clinique, este lauder, shiseido, proactive.</li>
            <li> Clean but not tight.</li>
            <li> If you have come across another review I wrote for another face wash, pretty much what I said is</li>
            <li> I was becoming hopeless and depressed because I couldn&#x27;t find anything that helped but at the same time I didn&#x27;t want to give up to prescriptions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a harsh product either and feels rather mild.  </li>
            <li> (there were 8 large pimples in a 1\\&quot; radius).  </li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the positive reviews, but it didn&#x27;t do much for my skin.</li>
            <li> Other than that it has a light pleasant scent and if salicylic acid has worked for you in the past, then this worth a try.</li>
            <li> This product in conjunction with palmers skin success fade cream as a moisturizer because my skin gets a little dry after using, has been a great beauty regime.</li>
            <li> Now as far as the product, I love Phisoderm anti blemish gel face wash, it has helped with minimizing new acne and depleting old acne scars.</li>
            <li> The only thing I like more than my clear skin is the price!</li>
            <li> After spending literally hundreds of dollars on expensive products, I couldn&#x27;t believe how amazing this cheap product (per bottle) was!</li>
            <li> I couldnt swear that is really helps with acne though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that I have not broken out while using this</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my skin wouldve cleared up as much as it did without it really.  </li>
            <li> It cleans your face, but I feel that it doesn&#x27;t really get all the oil off my face.</li>
            <li> subscribed to this when it was available on Amazon to get the extra saving.</li>
            <li> The ones I received did not appear much as a gel and seemed to be watered</li>
            <li> My face is very oily but this cleanser really helps me control my skin&#x27;s oil level.    </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try this one, I really need my miracle product.</li>
            <li> I think that the combination of salicylic acid and lactic acid really works for my skin.</li>
            <li> It cleans the skin throughly, preventing acne, gently, without drying the skin.    </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really deliver a feeling of being \\&quot;washed\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Again, I prefer the Biore Ice Cleanser, with which I had the satisfaction of feeling clean and refreshed, yet not dry.</li>
            <li> well soon after my skin started to get really itchy</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any improvements</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> As for being anti-blemish....not so much.</li>
            <li> So far all I can say is it smells so fresh and</li>
            <li> the phisoderm family are gentle yet effecfive.</li>
            <li> It has really helped the complexion problem I was having.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for my very oily skin, nothing zapped my zits like this</li>
            <li> but it has made my skin so much smoother and cleared up my breakouts.</li>
            <li> and I have not broken out.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend this to everyone!  </li>
            <li> In attempt to bring some sexy back to my borderline 30 yr old skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find anything better, and certainly not at the price.    </li>
            <li> I figured with 70+ reviews that average strong results--I need to try it!</li>
            <li> I love it, and it&#x27;s not irritating like some of the other products.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t written or recommended any other face-washing product for acne because I haven&#x27;t found one good enough until pHisoderm.</li>
            <li> Dove, Aveeno, Clearisil, Clean and Clear, Neutrogena, Oil of Olay, St. Ives, Proactiv, and even the Loreal line of adult acne treatments.    </li>
            <li> My daughter can&#x27;t use most any other face wash.  </li>
            <li> These days--at age 56--I still have skin that is inclined to break out, so pHisoderm STILL works better than any other product.  </li>
            <li> I see a greater next-day improvement in pimples with this face wash than with any other wash I&#x27;ve used and it doesn&#x27;t over-dry your face.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t always prevent breakouts from occurring but it has worked better than the other product I did try.  </li>
            <li> I have to use 2-3 pumps to clean my face, where I would only need 1 pump of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Price is reasonable as long as you qualify for free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> This product is sooooh good that not only cleansed my face but lighten the dark spots as well.</li>
            <li> I then tried the Phisoderm anti-blemish gel facial wash and it&#x27;s as good as the previous phisoderm products.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did because the scar causing acne that was developing is gone now almost completely, so this really made a difference as well with the other things I&#x27;ve been using on my face.</li>
            <li> But this new formulation becomes very flaky, and makes it look like your skin is peeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This works wonders on my older childrens skin.  </li>
            <li> After trying a wide variety of products, this combination seems to work the best to keep her acne at bay without irritating her skin.</li>
            <li> the older you get.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only facial cleanser that keeps my face free from blemishes on a consistent basis.  </li>
            <li> The seller shipped it in an envelope, a box might have been better, as well as making sure the lids where on tight, now some of the bottles are not completely full.</li>
            <li> So, of course, I recommend this product highly for all ages.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s high rating</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I found an inexpensive fast wash that controls my adult acne and oily skin problem.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;m young (since I still have blemish problems) and don&#x27;t really like smelly like a grandma after washing my face.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel clean, removes all the oil, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that wants clear skin.  </li>
            <li> Then, the entire packaging changed, again, to what it is now -- small (dang) -- and clear -- the modern version of \\&quot;good for your skin\\&quot; concept.    </li>
            <li> it is pretty much the same product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how phisoderm can be so effective at such an extremely low cost and low popularity.</li>
            <li> Just normal face wash.  </li>
            <li> I had trouble finding the product locally, but, of course, was able to find it on Amazon and at the right price.</li>
            <li> pHisoderm Anti-Blemish Gel Facial Wash. This stuff goes on your face, right there where your nose is, unavoidably reeking and creeping up your nostrils...</li>
            <li> In my experience, you only have to use this once a day for it to be effective, so these bottles will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Keeps new pimples from forming</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try because I was breaking out quite a bit (1 or 2 new pimples a day).  </li>
            <li> but it prevents new ones from forming.  </li>
            <li> I am now out and was desperate that I would not be able to get more.</li>
            <li> After that, it changed bottles, again, but was still white, and available in big sizes.    </li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive skin this may not be the product for you.  </li>
            <li> Well after trying many of face washes over the past year I saw the consumer report review and thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li> I obviously stopped using it and for the first time in my life I had to go to the allergist/</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get such positive results.</li>
            <li> It was very stressful trying to find a new facial wash because I tried everything and nothing was working for me.  </li>
            <li> Both are 20+ but struggled with acne but after using this stuff their skin is really clear now.  </li>
            <li> For a none prescription, my wife claims it keeps her skin clear of blemishes &amp; leaves skin radient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used everything on the market plus ProActive to clear up acne and some worked</li>
            <li> Besides, Biore Ice Cleanser DID help keep my face clear.    </li>
            <li> This wash contains salicylic acid, which is widely used for treating light facial blemishes.</li>
            <li> It is that clear cut for me.</li>
            <li> B001E5D0BQ St. Ives Swiss Formula Clear Pore Cleanser, Purifying Face Wash, 10-Ounce Pump Bottles (Pack of 3)]]</li>
            <li> After a month, my skin was CLEAR.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin and moderate acne as a very hopeful solution to your problem.</li>
            <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s and have oily skin with adult acne.</li>
            <li> This works well on her sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin and have never reacted to anything in my life.</li>
            <li> so far  </li>
            <li> Try it you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This item was shipped and delivered extremely fast for it to be standard shipping!</li>
            <li> It reminds me of the linen closet in a old people&#x27;s home--is it musty or musky?</li>
            <li> I have gone through several face washes that make me sneeze uncontrollably or have way too much menthol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 years old and have used Phisoderm products since I was 18 years   old.  </li>
            <li> a must have for sensitive faces.</li>
            <li> I have had acne for 11 years and I am 20 yrs old.</li>
            <li> My face feels soooo soft and my scars are all clearing up.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne--</li>
            <li> As far as the product goes, I tried using it</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t return it and didn&#x27;t want to toss it, so I used it as a body wash for my back (not necessarily needed but couldn&#x27;t hurt, right?).    </li>
            <li> I have used Phisoderm for many years, not easy to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> This would result in dire consequences as I inevitably would break out for the duration of the time I was using the other cleanser (as stubborn and cheap as I am</li>
            <li> I would not describe this product as a gentle cleanser, it is pretty strong, sometimes I only use half a pump or dilute it a little with water.</li>
            <li> but like I said I do believe this has had a major factor in my skin being clear and staying that way.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about the  anti-blemish Facial Wash!</li>
            <li> and now Im back to normal.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no pimples with consistent use.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer the viscosity of Biore Ice Cleanser (or any other such viscose cleanser), which allows me to pump gently into my hand, control the amount in each pump, and lasted me about 4 months</li>
            <li> pHisoderm is gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Granted, this consistency may make it easier for some people to spread; but you end up using too much product, consuming the whole bottle within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The smell is less than fresh.</li>
            <li> I found it to be a clean smelling product and not overwhelming in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used general mainstream products, as well as products aimed and marketed specifically towards men.  </li>
            <li> This product is the only thing that keeps my face clear.</li>
            <li> This product cleared my face and two days later it was clear.</li>
            <li> I have only been washing my face with pHisoderm for a week, and my skin is already completely clear.  </li>
            <li> I use this cleanser once daily to keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> I still get a couple pimples but this facial wash has fixed 80-90% of my pimples.  </li>
            <li> The glowing reviews prompted me to chime in with my two cents, since my experience was the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> Finally I tried the old Phisohex   product and it cleaned my skin without irritation.  </li>
            <li> Oh and I also use bare escentuals blemish therapy powder as a spot treatment the moment I see something coming up on my face.</li>
            <li> actually turned into $60 + with the doctor, shot and topicals to get my face back to normal.</li>
            <li> Lathering my face with it felt weird, kind of \\&quot;off\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I can only use it at night though or it will dry my skin out too much.  </li>
            <li> Especially if I have a super dry face from the winter air or when my pores are really open after a long workout.</li>
            <li> but I am very optimistic when reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li> (To clear up my acne I used crushed aspirin) and then this to maintain clear skin.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help keep my face clear, and actually set me back a couple of months of treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple products and always come back to this one to keep my face clear without drying it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate that the company isn&#x27;t too concerned with selling the product, as they did back in the 70s when it was available in gigantic glaring green bottles, was white, and had a medicinal smell :-)  </li>
            <li> It does not dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> I did find it cheeper at Big Lots for less than $3.00 a bottle after I ordered it on here, one of the first times I found something cheeper somewhere than amazon.</li>
            <li> Not long ago, I couldn&#x27;t walk out of the house without any foundation on.</li>
            <li> The only problem for me is that this facial wash doesn&#x27;t exactly keep all the pimples away although it has cut them down by a lot.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t kept my face completely clear, but compared to other products I&#x27;ve tried, it works as well as the most expensive cleansers out there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So between being less usable for normal scrubbing, and drying to a flaky/chalk substance</li>
            <li> I have pretty normal skin but have pretty bad allergies.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from extremely oily skin and adult acne.</li>
            <li> Ive been dealing with acne for about seven years now since a little after high school began.</li>
            <li> This is because the face wash isn&#x27;t on your face long enough to do anything and you only rinse all those \\&quot;active\\</li>
            <li> The creams made me get dry and red and then the breakouts would be back.    </li>
            <li> While it did clear up a few bigger breakouts, it cause smaller ones.</li>
            <li> Plus I had a deep cystic acne pimple that was under the skin for a long time and it made it come up.</li>
            <li> the four pack will last you FOREVER, doesnt dry out my skin, and i think it kept my acne at bay</li>
            <li> When I got this product in the mail, one of the bottles came open and almost the entire thing at leaked out onto all the other ones leaving me with far less product than I paid for.</li>
            <li> But be careful ordering it from a place that doesn&#x27;t have free shipping or Amazon Prime, at $6.98 for shipping, and this becomes extremely expensive for facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from adult acne for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> but they are few and far between.  </li>
            <li> It does not clear up existing breakouts</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and suddenly acne prone, I knew I couldn&#x27;t use proactive or any other harsh cleanser</li>
            <li> but I believe it was my other facial products I have been using as well all as this altogether.   </li>
            <li> It has not only prevented breakouts, but it is also clearing out the little white heads that were on my forehead (I have oily skin) and blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also back to using it, and have recommended it to other family members.</li>
            <li> I tried several other products but each one burned or irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> When i couldn&#x27;t find it locally, I tried other anti-blemish products but they broke my face out, even after using them for a month while giving my skin time to get used tho the change.  </li>
            <li> However, my skin is sometimes too dry..</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my face either.</li>
            <li> I still get breakouts and my skin is still oily (with dry patches) after using this face wash.</li>
            <li> My forehead doesn&#x27;t dry out anymore either.</li>
            <li> My skin became DRY.</li>
            <li> In the morning my face isn&#x27;t dry and peeling as a result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once dry, you couldn&#x27;t even notice it there.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of pHisoderm as it works and costs a lot less than other products advertising to do the same.  </li>
            <li> I cut down to using it to only once a day to see if that would help and it did a bit but was still dry.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d have one huge pimple on a random part of my face once every other week or so.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past 6 years or so, and it is proven to keep my skin clear of blemishes.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I used soap and I would get breakouts occasionally.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other salicylic washes, and this does the same job for me without the inflated price of other brands.</li>
            <li> or so I noticed it started to make my skin VERY dry..</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive combination skin, and I&#x27;ve tried everything from Proactiv (which made it worse) to Neutrogena (which worked for a while, but not well enough).</li>
            <li> In the winter it can be a little drying - only on my cheeks</li>
            <li> Be careful if you use this...</li>
            <li> A few years ago they quit selling the white Phisoderm in my area.  </li>
            <li> They changed the formula, and now it&#x27;s so chalky that it&#x27;s much harder to use.&lt;br /&gt;Phisoderm</li>
            <li> I have switched a few times to ProActiv but always come back.  </li>
            <li> I am sad that this product has been discontinued and I am not sure what I am going to use after this is no longer available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps this is just a wee bit unfair to pHisoderm, as I may have been expecting the tingly and fresh feeling of the product I used previously.    </li>
            <li> the other products I use</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t bring myself just to throw the other bottle out).  </li>
            <li> I bought this product due to</li>
            <li> Bought this product in a bulk deal (5 in a pack) due to all the rave reviews.</li>
            <li> In other words, those products didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference from any other acne wash I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> the other product&#x27;s that I have used.</li>
            <li> I occasionally get a small zit</li>
            <li> Not sure if the cleanser is actually pH balanced or not.</li>
            <li> It does make my face a little dry</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was hoping this would help (along with my other facial products) to help clear my face.</li>
            <li> This is truly a miracle product without the strong prescriptions and bad side effects that may bring you.</li>
            <li> It has tea tree oil in it, and St. Ives has never let me down.</li>
            <li> I went down to once day, but there have been no improvements.</li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> used to like to rub a small amount into a problem area, and just let it dry.</li>
            <li> my whole left cheek was extremely bad</li>
            <li> Using one pump, twice a day, I think a bottle typically lasts me about 6 weeks.     </li>
            <li> (applied with a slight buff) and benzoil peroxide wash in the evening.</li>
            <li> Since using this product I have not seen any change in less blemishes on my face.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how oily your skin was in your youth, it&#x27;s less so</li>
            <li> My subject says it all folks.</li>
            <li> states that this was to make it \\&quot;less</li>
            <li> and now I have a little scarring from that</li>
            <li> and I decided to buy this product because it had Salicylic acid in it which I did a little research on and found out that Salicylic acid treats your acne.  </li>
            <li> I have been using phisoderm for a little over a month</li>
            <li> I disliked the consistency, which I found to be too runny.</li>
            <li> Waste of product.</li>
            <li> I disliked the feeling of this cleanser on my face.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have everyday breakouts from the sweat and dirt.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my bf a few years ago, he likes using it, seem to help with his acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately 20 years now (through teenage years and beyond).  </li>
            <li> , I wash my face everyday 1-2 a day.</li>
            <li> I have less breakouts and my face is getting clearer each day!    </li>
            <li> Of course, I was skeptical because this is relatively inexpensive compared with the other mainstream products I&#x27;d used.  </li>
            <li> I do use other things as well though for my skin here lately</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used expensive and ineffective products in the past, try this one and you may be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to any acne suffers.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find but works extremely well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a ton of zits even when I was a teenager, but when I would get them, they&#x27;d never be of the small variety.  </li>
            <li> I dont usually write reviews</li>
            <li> I went to my dermatologist and he was not able to help.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed at the fact that I could no longer locate  it at Walmarts, Walgreens, or CVS&#x27; but with this fast shipping I have no problem ordering here..</li>
            <li> I had been unable to find it for a long time</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> This item in the gel is getting hard to find in stores now.</li>
            <li> because it has lidocaine in it to dull the pain.</li>
            <li> I always end up buying it here on amazon because it can be hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> but at least you can still get it at amazon</li>
            <li> My face is burning like crazy and the only thing that&#x27;s helping is [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s not cute!</li>
            <li> I have normal/dry skin usually in case you were wondering!</li>
            <li> I noticed before I tried this that I was starting to get acne really badly again</li>
            <li> My skin became so bad that I even started putting on a face mask and gave the excuse that I was \\&quot;sick\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> but I always kept coming back to pHisoderm due to horrible breakouts.  </li>
            <li> This simply does not work for my combo skin at all. :(</li>
            <li> At the very least, I&#x27;ll settle for a non-offensive smell.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s somewhat hard for me to find it in stores.  </li>
            <li> Not overdrying or irritating for me.</li>
            <li> and I know how frustrating it is.  </li>
            <li> So you can imagine how frustrating it is to wake up in the morning with whiteheads and pimples all over your face.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a serious break out in years (knock on wood)!  </li>
            <li> it is because just a few years ago I had broken out really badly</li>
            <li> My daughter and my niece now use it, and I&#x27;ve seen a dramatic difference in their skin.</li>
            <li> Generally, they&#x27;d be largish and nasty.  </li>
            <li> and I was starting to break out real badly again.  </li>
            <li> For the price, you cannot go wrong with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s useless buying face washes that contain any of these \\&quot;active\\&quot; ingredients.</li>
            <li> It has salicylic acid that is suppose to work with troubled skin, but if you are like me, it does jack.</li>
            <li> Forget the expensive face washes and facials, phisoderm can CURE ACNE.</li>
            <li> And I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> My acne isn&#x27;t horrible but it is still enough to look like a pizza face.</li>
            <li> It has been very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> What I like about it too is that it doesn&#x27;t sting my face or dry it out real bad like my makeup remover</li>
            <li> I picked up this product  after using everything else out there and  desperately trying to find something to help control my over middle-age oily skin, clogged pores and breakouts.</li>
            <li> , I know how frustrating and annoying</li>
            <li> unpleasant, every time I washed.</li>
            <li> Then I tried Neutrogena for Men ($7 for 4 oz!), which made me break out badly</li>
            <li> I would not use this product for bad acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really frustrated with my problem with acne</li>
            <li> I absolutely hated this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely HATED the smell of</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great for slightly oily skin</li>
            <li> I love phisoderm. i think it&#x27;s the best facial cleaner there is. I wish they sold it in the U.s. but at least you can still get it at amazon</li>
            <li> My daughter can&#x27;t use most any other face wash.  This product works the best and is not harsh on her skin. Hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this face wash for years.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found for my skin because it does not dry my face.  The pH balance keeps my skin moist &amp; radiant.  So thankful to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> If you loved phisohex in a bright green bottle as a teenager years ago and you can no longer find it in drug stores this is a close replacement.</li>
            <li> I picked up this product  after using everything else out there and  desperately trying to find something to help control my over middle-age oily skin, clogged pores and breakouts. Neutrogena was a joke, Aveno was a mistake, and I could go on and on.  Phisoderm did the trick and I LOVE IT. Unfortunately, not one store in Casper, Wyoming sells any of the Phisoderm products. A local drug store chain found 4 bottles at another store. I am now out and was desperate that I would not be able to get more. Thank you, Amazon.com, for providing this wonder product - and at a great price. I hope this product stays around FOREVER! Either way, I&#x27;m stocking up. Who da thot I would go from using Phisohex in the 60&#x27;s to using Phisoderm as I get close to my 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I like this face wash. I got it becuase of all of the good reviews, It makes my face feel good after I wash it, I always feel fresh. I couldnt swear that is really helps with acne though. I do plan to keep using it though, I have used it for about 3 1/2 months now. I did find it cheeper at Big Lots for less than $3.00 a bottle after I ordered it on here, one of the first times I found something cheeper somewhere than amazon. Even with the automatic delivery.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did. I have tried everything from A to Z in acne products since I was a kid. I wonder if they had this back then because I should have bought it. I remember phisoderm products but don&#x27;t recall using them. Anyway this stuff is great! I use it in the day and night too. Not overdrying or irritating for me. If a pimple starts to form within a day or two it is gone. Keeps new pimples from forming I have found. Plus I had a deep cystic acne pimple that was under the skin for a long time and it made it come up. So anything that can do that to me is a good product. It works and I just ordered my second bottle because I don&#x27;t want to run out. I am in my 30&#x27;s and have oily skin with adult acne. I never write reviews but I had to for this one. It keeps the oil reduced as well. A +!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good cleanser to take off my makeup as well as for my acne or pimples that I would occassionally get and this was awesome.  It takes my makeup off better than my face wash specifically for makeup did.   What I like about it too is that it doesn&#x27;t sting my face or dry it out real bad like my makeup remover seemed to do.  I&#x27;ve noticed that I have not broken out while using this for I believe its been two or almost three weeks now and there for a while I was getting a couple of pimples or so every week and I was starting to break out real badly again.  I don&#x27;t know for sure if its just been this product or not, I do know for sure this has definetly made a huge difference in my skin,  but I believe it was my other facial products I have been using as well all as this altogether.   I think the trick is you have to find a balance of things that work for you that kind of normalize your skin.  I can say though that I have not gotten one pimple since using this.  I do use other things as well though for my skin here lately but like I said I do believe this has had a major factor in my skin being clear and staying that way.  I think it does do a great job in cleaning your skin and pores.  Like I said though I think you have to try to find things that work for you, I know how frustrating and annoying it is because just a few years ago I had broken out really badly and I had always had good skin and now I have a little scarring from that, my makeup I think was a huge factor in breaking me out, but I know how it is and I know how frustrating it is.  You just have to try to find a balance for your skin.  I noticed before I tried this that I was starting to get acne really badly again and I didn&#x27;t want anymore scars on my face so I read the reviews on this and bought this and I&#x27;m glad I did because the scar causing acne that was developing is gone now almost completely, so this really made a difference as well with the other things I&#x27;ve been using on my face.I can&#x27;t give this 100% credit because like I said it was this and the other products I use but this has definetly helped and I don&#x27;t think my skin wouldve cleared up as much as it did without it really.  I&#x27;m very happy with it and I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is okay. It cleans your face, but I feel that it doesn&#x27;t really get all the oil off my face. I have to use 2-3 pumps to clean my face, where I would only need 1 pump of [[ASIN:B001LFI33E Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst Detoxifying Facial Cleanser with Oxygen-Infused Formula, 8-Ounce Pump Bottle]] to get the oily feeling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I subscribed to this when it was available on Amazon to get the extra saving. But be careful ordering it from a place that doesn&#x27;t have free shipping or Amazon Prime, at $6.98 for shipping, and this becomes extremely expensive for facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Pros - This item in the gel is getting hard to find in stores now. Probably one of the best face wash around. Price is reasonable as long as you qualify for free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - The product should pump out a gel-like substance. The ones I received did not appear much as a gel and seemed to be watered down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the gel thickness did not see right, the product still worked good.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s the only facial cleanser that keeps my face free from blemishes on a consistent basis.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s somewhat hard for me to find it in stores.  As a result, when I ran out of one bottle, I would just use a substitute facial cleanser from the drugstore or Target.  I&#x27;ve tried Oil of Olay, Cetaphil, Neutrogena, etc. etc.  This would result in dire consequences as I inevitably would break out for the duration of the time I was using the other cleanser (as stubborn and cheap as I am, I couldn&#x27;t bring myself just to throw the other bottle out).  Thank goodness Amazon sells these guys in bulk and with the Amazon subscription, I never have to worry about finding a substitute when I&#x27;ve run out and forgotten to re-stock.</li>
            <li> This works wonders on my older childrens skin.  Both are 20+ but struggled with acne but after using this stuff their skin is really clear now.  Great product</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I found an inexpensive fast wash that controls my adult acne and oily skin problem.  What a find.  Buy it you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now and love the results.  The only thing I like more than my clear skin is the price!</li>
            <li> For a none prescription, my wife claims it keeps her skin clear of blemishes &amp; leaves skin radient. This works well on her sensitive skin. It actually evened out her coloration.</li>
            <li> This stuff practically burned my face. I do not have sensitive skin and have never reacted to anything in my life. My face got all red and splotchy around the nose and mouth and the area around my eyes puffed up overnight after just 1 use at bedtime. My face is burning like crazy and the only thing that&#x27;s helping is [[ASIN:B001ET777A Banana Boat Sooth-A-Caine Aloe Gel, With Lidocaine, 8-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)]] because it has lidocaine in it to dull the pain. Be careful if you use this... I would never recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would write a review about a product until now. This product is sooooh good that not only cleansed my face but lighten the dark spots as well. I was all set to buy another more expensive product until surfing amazon I came upon this product. I wasn&#x27;t too excited at first but I decided to give it a try because of the price and I am glad that I did. I couldn&#x27;t be more happier so, I am going to stock up and make sure that I always have  this product available because I am now a very happy woman.</li>
            <li> I have been using the pHisoderm pH Anti-Blemish Gel Facial Wash for about a week so far  and I am definitely noticing the difference.  I have less breakouts and my face is getting clearer each day!    I used to use the cleanser included in Neutrogena&#x27;s \\&quot;Advanced Solutions Complete Acne Therapy System,\\&quot; but this  item is a cheap(but very effective) replacement.    My face is very oily but this cleanser really helps me control my skin&#x27;s oil level.    However, my skin is sometimes too dry.. (especially in the mornings..)    Overall, I am very satisfied, and for $15 a pack of 4, I think it&#x27;s a steal..    I will repost this review next week to update my progess.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t received the shipment of this yet - but I am very optimistic when reading the other reviews. I suffer from extremely oily skin and adult acne. I have tried everything - clearasil, oxy, sea breeze, clean and clear, dove, olay, aveeno, neutragena, cetaphil, clinique, este lauder, shiseido, proactive. I&#x27;ve tried the clarisonic (brush) with my cleanser, I&#x27;ve tried prescription creams and pills. Some cleansers would work for awhile but then I would get my oily skin back and more breakouts. I can&#x27;t wait to try this one, I really need my miracle product.</li>
            <li> This product is really great. I noticed a difference in my skin the next morning after I used it. I think that the combination of salicylic acid and lactic acid really works for my skin. Try it you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing that keeps my face clear. I use it twice a day in the shower with a good moisturizer &amp; have no breakouts. The price is great. I&#x27;ll have to start ordering it on amazon since they quit carrying it locally.     I think it&#x27;s just the right thickness. Put one pump on the tip of two fingers and rub it between the fingers on both hands and then rub it into the face. I don&#x27;t really smell much of a fragrance, which is good for most with sensitive skin. Using one pump, twice a day, I think a bottle typically lasts me about 6 weeks.     Cleansers are a personal item and people will have varying results. Trial and error is the only way to know for sure, but I think this is so worth a shot though, as I have had so many problems with other products, but never a problem with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really frustrated with my problem with acne and I decided to buy this product because it had Salicylic acid in it which I did a little research on and found out that Salicylic acid treats your acne.  After the second day of using it (I use it twice a day when I wake up and when I&#x27;m showering) I could feel a difference.  The pimples were drying up.  The only problem for me is that this facial wash doesn&#x27;t exactly keep all the pimples away although it has cut them down by a lot.  I still get a couple pimples but this facial wash has fixed 80-90% of my pimples.  I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it does work.  I&#x27;ve noticed my face is alot clearer after using this for a while.  My nose and forehead areas especially look much better.</li>
            <li> I started using pHisoderm in 1979--and I am still using it!  I can&#x27;t find anything better, and certainly not at the price.    I had acne as a teenager, and in 1979, at age 25, I still had acne.  Of course, I tried different products, but none of them worked.  Then I stumbled upon pHisoderm, and it was THE answer for me.    These days--at age 56--I still have skin that is inclined to break out, so pHisoderm STILL works better than any other product.  I did try to change, just for variety, but nothing worked.    The reason pHisoderm is so excellent is because it gets rid of acne, and it does not dry the skin out.  It is really good for the skin.    It&#x27;s unfortunate that the company isn&#x27;t too concerned with selling the product, as they did back in the 70s when it was available in gigantic glaring green bottles, was white, and had a medicinal smell :-)  Every generation has to have a \\&quot;concept\\&quot; of what&#x27;s healthy.  Back then, it was the medicinal smell thing :-)    After that, it changed bottles, again, but was still white, and available in big sizes.    Then, the entire packaging changed, again, to what it is now -- small (dang) -- and clear -- the modern version of \\&quot;good for your skin\\&quot; concept.    So, of course, I recommend this product highly for all ages.  It cleans the skin throughly, preventing acne, gently, without drying the skin.    I just ordered myself a nice pack of 4 that will keep me going for a while.</li>
            <li> Wish I had found this product ten years ago.....Fantastic results!  I&#x27;ve used everything on the market plus ProActive to clear up acne and some worked ok (I received terrible results from the ProActive) but nothing provided the results like pHisoderm.  Even when my Dermatologist had me on antibiotics I didn&#x27;t get such positive results. After reading the reviews on this product I purchased the body wash and the facial wash and love both. I was a bit reluctant to purchase the body wash because one or two of the reviews stated it had a strong odor. I found it to be a clean smelling product and not overwhelming in my opinion. I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about the  anti-blemish Facial Wash! If you&#x27;re debating between purchasing one product over another in the pHisoderm line choose this product. Excellent results!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products for acne over my life, still have problems at 55.  This seems to work best and is also  working for my 16 year old.</li>
            <li> I was EXTREMELY SATISFIED with this order, I ordered this item around 11pm on a Thurs, and recieved the item around 10am the following Saturday! This item was shipped and delivered extremely fast for it to be standard shipping! Im soo glad I didn&#x27;t pay for expedited shipping. Now as far as the product, I love Phisoderm anti blemish gel face wash, it has helped with minimizing new acne and depleting old acne scars. This product is very gentle on my skin. I would recommend it to anyone...I was disappointed at the fact that I could no longer locate  it at Walmarts, Walgreens, or CVS&#x27; but with this fast shipping I have no problem ordering here..but since I got a 4 pack it will be probably a year before I need more! :)</li>
            <li> My face cleansing routine consists of salicylic acid face wash in the morning (applied with a slight buff) and benzoil peroxide wash in the evening. In my case, this seems to keep breakouts at bay; I&#x27;ve had good results so far.    I absolutely hated this product. Couldn&#x27;t return it and didn&#x27;t want to toss it, so I used it as a body wash for my back (not necessarily needed but couldn&#x27;t hurt, right?).    I disliked the consistency, which I found to be too runny. Every time I pumped the product into my hand it would unavoidably splash all over the place and run through my fingers (kind of like water). Waste of product. Granted, this consistency may make it easier for some people to spread; but you end up using too much product, consuming the whole bottle within a few weeks. I much prefer the viscosity of Biore Ice Cleanser (or any other such viscose cleanser), which allows me to pump gently into my hand, control the amount in each pump, and lasted me about 4 months (did I mention I use sparingly and lather substantially?)    I disliked the feeling of this cleanser on my face. Lathering my face with it felt weird, kind of \\&quot;off\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve tried to explain this to myself but cannot come up with a coherent and logical explanation. Perhaps this is just a wee bit unfair to pHisoderm, as I may have been expecting the tingly and fresh feeling of the product I used previously.    I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the results, or lack thereof. It didn&#x27;t really deliver a feeling of being \\&quot;washed\\&quot;. It didn&#x27;t help keep my face clear, and actually set me back a couple of months of treatment. Again, I prefer the Biore Ice Cleanser, with which I had the satisfaction of feeling clean and refreshed, yet not dry. It also felt comforting with the pleasant, tingly, slightly minty sensation. Heck, I don&#x27;t want to sound like an infomercial, but yeah, it&#x27;s true. Besides, Biore Ice Cleanser DID help keep my face clear.    My biggest peeve with this product was the smell. I absolutely HATED the smell of pHisoderm Anti-Blemish Gel Facial Wash. This stuff goes on your face, right there where your nose is, unavoidably reeking and creeping up your nostrils... unpleasant, every time I washed. A pleasant smell is a MUST for me. At the very least, I&#x27;ll settle for a non-offensive smell. As you read this, please bear in mind that smell is a subjective perception, thus my definition of offensive may or may not coincide with yours.    The glowing reviews prompted me to chime in with my two cents, since my experience was the complete opposite. But, since each case is different, every skin is unique and each person has their own perspective, I understand that this product may have been very satisfactory for some. Not me.</li>
            <li> No matter your age, this is a great product if you suffer from problems with acne.  I&#x27;ve tried multiple products and always come back to this one to keep my face clear without drying it out.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter is who has very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most anti-blemish products. She has had great results with this product when she has used it with [[ASIN:B000OLE7V8 Neutrogena Acne Stress Control, 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment, 2 Ounce (Pack of 3)]] After trying a wide variety of products, this combination seems to work the best to keep her acne at bay without irritating her skin.</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t as great as what others say.  Perhaps it just doesn&#x27;t work well for me but I started to get MORE tiny pimples since I started using this.  For me, Olay&#x27;s PRO X worked best.</li>
            <li> For the price, you cannot go wrong with this stuff.  It hasn&#x27;t kept my face completely clear, but compared to other products I&#x27;ve tried, it works as well as the most expensive cleansers out there.</li>
            <li> I have not been using this product twice-a-day like it recommends on the label, but once per day has been great to me.  Previously, I used soap and I would get breakouts occasionally.  Then I tried Neutrogena for Men ($7 for 4 oz!), which made me break out badly and I stopped using it after a week and went back to soap. Then I went on Amazon and read reviews about pHisoderm, which I either never saw or never paid attention to at stores.  I decided to give it a try since 4 bottles cost almost as much as that one Neutrogena bottle and what a great purchase.  It has not only prevented breakouts, but it is also clearing out the little white heads that were on my forehead (I have oily skin) and blemishes.  It&#x27;s not a harsh product either and feels rather mild.  I can see why they have been around for 40 years.</li>
            <li> Well after trying many of face washes over the past year I saw the consumer report review and thought I would give this a try. At first it seemed fine and very gentle but after a week or so I noticed it started to make my skin VERY dry.. I cut down to using it to only once a day to see if that would help and it did a bit but was still dry. Based on the reviews I stayed with it for another week or so and just increased my moisturizer..well soon after my skin started to get really itchy and I got red patches of dryness all over my face and the area around my eyes started to swell .....it had turned into a full blown reaction. I obviously stopped using it and for the first time in my life I had to go to the allergist/dermatogist  to get a  steroid shot and topical creams for my face  and now Im back to normal. Wish it wouldve worked but my $5.00 to pay for this stuff actually turned into $60 + with the doctor, shot and topicals to get my face back to normal.</li>
            <li> I like it (the \\&quot;face\\&quot; version), but I wash my face with the \\&quot;body wash\\&quot; version - it is pretty much the same product! Even if I continue to buy and use both these products, prefer the \\&quot;body wash\\&quot; version :-)</li>
            <li> This wash cleans pretty well and foams nicely. It removes oils, dirt, make-up easily and without drying effects. The smell is less than fresh. It reminds me of the linen closet in a old people&#x27;s home--is it musty or musky? I&#x27;m not sure. Anyway, I&#x27;m young (since I still have blemish problems) and don&#x27;t really like smelly like a grandma after washing my face. So I will not buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;As for the anti-blemish properties. I didn&#x27;t really see any improvements but I didn&#x27;t expect any either. This wash contains salicylic acid, which is widely used for treating light facial blemishes. If you have come across another review I wrote for another face wash, pretty much what I said is, it&#x27;s useless buying face washes that contain any of these \\&quot;active\\&quot; ingredients. This is because the face wash isn&#x27;t on your face long enough to do anything and you only rinse all those \\&quot;active\\&quot; ingredients off anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and get a nice normal face wash that you enjoy, cleans well, and doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin. I recommend you check out Aveeno or Cetaphil Gentel Skin Cleanser for super sensitive skin, and Basis Cleaner Clean face wash or Clean &amp; Clean Sensitive face wash for mildly sensitive to normal Skin. Save your money to buy nice moisturizers and serums for treating and controlling your skin issues.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 3 years and I really like it. I have tried going without it during that time and I immediately begin to see blemishes. As soon as I use this product again they go away. It is that clear cut for me. It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my face either.</li>
            <li> I bought this product due to it&#x27;s high rating however it did nothing for me. I have oily skin and my skin felt oily even right after using this product. Also, I had a big break out within a week of using this product. I stopped using it within couple weeks. I went back to what I was using before and it works great. I don&#x27;t understand how every review here is so great when this product seemed so ineffective for me and for my wife.</li>
            <li> I never had a face wash before this, so it was a very good first starter. Unfortunately, I was hoping this would help (along with my other facial products) to help clear my face. It has salicylic acid that is suppose to work with troubled skin, but if you are like me, it does jack. You need something that works with your skin, something stronger, so stick with products with Benzoyl Peroxide.  Other than that it has a light pleasant scent and if salicylic acid has worked for you in the past, then this worth a try. I got mine from CVS.  ~~~  In place of this, I am going to purchase [[ASIN:B001E5D0BQ St. Ives Swiss Formula Clear Pore Cleanser, Purifying Face Wash, 10-Ounce Pump Bottles (Pack of 3)]] next. It has tea tree oil in it, and St. Ives has never let me down. I even use their scrub and love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week now every morning and every night. It seems to have kept my face under control. My husband and I have everyday breakouts from the sweat and dirt. While we still get some breakouts I can tell a difference the more I use it. I would not use this product for bad acne. I think this is a great wash for \\&quot; normal \\&quot; skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the positive reviews, but it didn&#x27;t do much for my skin. I still get breakouts and my skin is still oily (with dry patches) after using this face wash. I like the smell of it though. I bought this in a four pack so now I have to finish using them, but probably won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Impressive! I see a greater next-day improvement in pimples with this face wash than with any other wash I&#x27;ve used and it doesn&#x27;t over-dry your face. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no pimples with consistent use.  I have pretty normal skin but have pretty bad allergies.  I have gone through several face washes that make me sneeze uncontrollably or have way too much menthol it makes my eyes water.  This product has a nice light lemony fragrance that doesn&#x27;t bother my sinuses. It can be a bit drying like some people may have mentioned but I have a great face moisturizer to counter that.  If you have very sensitive skin this may not be the product for you.  I would not describe this product as a gentle cleanser, it is pretty strong, sometimes I only use half a pump or dilute it a little with water. Especially if I have a super dry face from the winter air or when my pores are really open after a long workout. I use it about once a day. I am sad that this product has been discontinued and I am not sure what I am going to use after this is no longer available on Amazon.  If there are people who don&#x27;t want their product and want to donate it....contact me!</li>
            <li> Bought this product in a bulk deal (5 in a pack) due to all the rave reviews. The only thing I can say this product does well is remove makeup. My skin seems pretty clean after drying with a towel. As for being anti-blemish....not so much. Since using this product I have not seen any change in less blemishes on my face. I still get multiple pimples on a regular basis. So, this is not an acne product. Just a cleansing product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple years now as a body wash and rarely break out. My forehead doesn&#x27;t dry out anymore either.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and as a teenager, I tried all of the popular products- Sea Breeze, Oxy, you name it. I&#x27;ve used Phisoderm since I was 13, and I&#x27;m now 35. I had been unable to find it for a long time so I was delighted to discover that Amazon had it. My daughter and my niece now use it, and I&#x27;ve seen a dramatic difference in their skin. I love it, and it&#x27;s not irritating like some of the other products. I&#x27;m also back to using it, and have recommended it to other family members. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> This product saved my life. Ok, maybe not my life but my skin and that is incredibly important to me. This is truly a miracle product without the strong prescriptions and bad side effects that may bring you. Forget the expensive face washes and facials, phisoderm can CURE ACNE. Not long ago, I couldn&#x27;t walk out of the house without any foundation on. My skin was full of scars, acne, and blemishes. I was becoming hopeless and depressed because I couldn&#x27;t find anything that helped but at the same time I didn&#x27;t want to give up to prescriptions. My skin became so bad that I even started putting on a face mask and gave the excuse that I was \\&quot;sick\\&quot;. I changed to a healthier diet, slept more, detoxed, facials, name brand face washes...you name it, I&#x27;ve done it. And nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;After much research and reviews, I came upon this product on amazon and read the great reviews it has for this product. I thought I&#x27;d try it out but the low price and the fact that its not sold in stores made me hesitant about its effectiveness. And I was so wrong. After a month, my skin was CLEAR. Not only did it get rid of pimples, but it prevented them from forming as well. I don&#x27;t know how phisoderm can be so effective at such an extremely low cost and low popularity. If everyone with acne problems started using this, they wouldn&#x27;t have to see the dermatologist anymore. They would also save a bunch load of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot emphasize how much I love this product. It is definitely a cure for those who have acne breakouts, blemishes, and a better self-esteem. Do try this out, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a ton of zits even when I was a teenager, but when I would get them, they&#x27;d never be of the small variety.  Generally, they&#x27;d be largish and nasty.  So I&#x27;d have one huge pimple on a random part of my face once every other week or so.  This would occur while I&#x27;d be using a pimple cream or face wash twice daily.  In other words, those products didn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;d used general mainstream products, as well as products aimed and marketed specifically towards men.  Didn&#x27;t work!    So I decided to try this product.  Of course, I was skeptical because this is relatively inexpensive compared with the other mainstream products I&#x27;d used.  However, it simply works.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a year and I&#x27;ve only gotten a pimple or two, and that was whenever I stopped using it.  In my experience, you only have to use this once a day for it to be effective, so these bottles will last a long time.  I use it when I shower, either in the morning or evening and it&#x27;s a quick and easy application.    If you&#x27;ve used expensive and ineffective products in the past, try this one and you may be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This product stings my daughter&#x27;s skin and eyes.  It also didn&#x27;t work.  We have switched to the Avon brand and not only is it effective (showed improvements within 24 days), it does not sting or irriate my daughters skin or eyes.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying this for the first time, don&#x27;t buy the 4 pack.  I decided to give this a try because I was breaking out quite a bit (1 or 2 new pimples a day).  This made me break out quite severely.  My entire face broke out and my whole left cheek was extremely bad (there were 8 large pimples in a 1\\&quot; radius).  I have switched to Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash and my break outs have minimized.  Now, not only do I have 3.8 bottles of this stuff but I also have many embarrassing acne scars.</li>
            <li> Good but not my favorite.........pHisoderm pH Anti-Blemish Gel Facial Wash, pH Balanced, 6 fl oz (177 ml) (Pack of 4)....had some hormonal break outs ....did not do much in my opinion!~</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how oily your skin was in your youth, it&#x27;s less so the older you get. I used this back in high school and absolutely loved it. I bought this about a week ago In attempt to bring some sexy back to my borderline 30 yr old skin. I started using it twice a day since. Man oh man. My skin became DRY. I was flaking like a homemade biscuit. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with tugh was, but not my skin feels like it&#x27;s going to split like a couple that has fallen out of love. I went down to once day, but there have been no improvements. While it did clear up a few bigger breakouts, it cause smaller ones. I can&#x27;t do this. I stopped because I look like I have face dandruff and that&#x27;s not cute! *sigh* I guess I&#x27;ll have to throw it out.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten what a good product this is. A person could spend much more money and still not get the quality of skin care as they do from this product</li>
            <li> I like how foamy it gets and how clean it leaves my face. I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other salicylic washes, and this does the same job for me without the inflated price of other brands.</li>
            <li> When I had a severe allergic reaction to an acne medication, I didn&#x27;t want to take any meds for my face. When I read all the reviews, I thought I would try the product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for three months and my face has never been this clean. FREE OF PIMPLES! It&#x27;s such a great feeling when you don&#x27;t see acne waking up.</li>
            <li> I have both face and body wash. I used it only once... I read all the great reviews so I gave it a try... In a week I&#x27;m gonna leave another follow up review to let you guys know if it actually works for my acne or not... So far all I can say is it smells so fresh and my face and body feels super smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 years old and have used Phisoderm products since I was 18 years   old.  I got a severe sunburn on my face when I was 17. Everything I tried on my face irritated my skin.  Finally I tried the old Phisohex   product and it cleaned my skin without irritation.  Later the company had to quit making phisohex and I started using the white Phisoderm.  It   too worked for me.  A few years ago they quit selling the white Phisoderm in my area.  I tried several other products but each one burned or irritated my skin.  I then tried the Phisoderm anti-blemish gel facial wash and it&#x27;s as good as the previous phisoderm products.</li>
            <li> My order arrived in great condition, no leaks and arrived as scheduled.  This is my second purchase of pHisoderm as it works and costs a lot less than other products advertising to do the same.  It does not dry my skin.  At night I even put a dab of gel on any blemishes I have and they are greatly improved or goine by morning.  I&#x27;ll keep using pHisoderm.</li>
            <li> Works great, a little drying on its own. But should be using some sort of moisturizer anyways. Good price and good on skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my bf a few years ago, he likes using it, seem to help with his acne. But what he loves most was the price. He have been a returning customer of this product ever since I first bought it for him about 4 years ago.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin and suddenly acne prone, I knew I couldn&#x27;t use proactive or any other harsh cleanser so this was recommended.  It does not clear up existing breakouts but it prevents new ones from forming.  (To clear up my acne I used crushed aspirin) and then this to maintain clear skin.</li>
            <li> i love phisoderm. this is the only product i have used for the last several years. i am allergic to benzoil peroxide so i cant use many products. the phisoderm family are gentle yet effecfive. a must have for sensitive faces.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS. My face was breaking out. I used Proactive and my face broke out more. This product cleared my face and two days later it was clear. It does make my face a little dry but I use a moisturizer afterwards and it softens my face. I love it</li>
            <li> I use this product because of advice I received from my dermatologist. It has really helped the complexion problem I was having. I had trouble finding the product locally, but, of course, was able to find it on Amazon and at the right price.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It works for me.  I use it one to two times a week.  I wish it was still available at CVS, but I&#x27;m happy that I can buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This face wash is perfect! It makes my face feel clean, removes all the oil, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for my very oily skin, nothing zapped my zits like this did!!! In the winter it can be a little drying - only on my cheeks so I apply a little face lotion on these areas but otherwise this stuff is great. I always end up buying it here on amazon because it can be hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Great price and quick delivery of a product that we can no longer find locally.</li>
            <li> Perfect for keeping acne at bay.</li>
            <li> Just normal face wash.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference from any other acne wash I&#x27;ve ever used.  I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have used Phisoderm for many years, not easy to find in local stores. I actually use this as my body wash also</li>
            <li> This is very good if you have sensitive skin, however it does have a scent to it that may not be tolerated by people with allergies.</li>
            <li> The face wash smells nice so far, it leaked out during shipping. The seller shipped it in an envelope, a box might have been better, as well as making sure the lids where on tight, now some of the bottles are not completely full. I&#x27;m yet to try the product, but it smells nice and has a nice texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mid in my mid forties and I still have oily skin that I fight daily with every acid product out there.  This is a wonderful wash that doesn&#x27;t have its own agenda to fight all the other stuff going on. Clean but not tight. Doesn&#x27;t leave a lot for my astringent to pick up, doesn&#x27;t aggravate anything.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> This product works, I have had acne all my life. I highly recommend this product to any acne suffers.</li>
            <li> After spending literally hundreds of dollars on expensive products, I couldn&#x27;t believe how amazing this cheap product (per bottle) was! I love it! I saw improvements after a day and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week now but it has made my skin so much smoother and cleared up my breakouts. It can be drying in some areas like my cheeks though, but totally worth it! And by the way, this is my first review on amazon-because nothing has ever surpassed my expectations like this before.</li>
            <li> I love phisoderm, it makes my skin feel great and cleared up the acne quick. Ive been using it for 3years now and wont stop.</li>
            <li> I have used everything! I have had acne for 11 years and I am 20 yrs old. I have tried everything you can think of, but this is the only thing that works for me and hasnt stopped working. I highly recommend this. I have been using phisoderm for a little over a month and I have not broken out. My face feels soooo soft and my scars are all clearing up. I am so happy that i have finally found the answer to my problem.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  It doesn&#x27;t always prevent breakouts from occurring but it has worked better than the other product I did try.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s a bit liquidity/thin.  Overall, I like it though.  The pack of 4 for the price is a great deal in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with moderate-severe acne for YEARS. I have very sensitive combination skin, and I&#x27;ve tried everything from Proactiv (which made it worse) to Neutrogena (which worked for a while, but not well enough). This face wash is the one I&#x27;ve stuck with the longest, and although it isn&#x27;t a miracle cure for my problem, it has helped me the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very gentle, but still able to remove all my makeup at the end of the day, and it doesn&#x27;t over-dry my skin. At night, all I do is wash my face with this and I&#x27;m done. In the morning my face isn&#x27;t dry and peeling as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin and moderate acne as a very hopeful solution to your problem. I haven&#x27;t written or recommended any other face-washing product for acne because I haven&#x27;t found one good enough until pHisoderm.</li>
            <li> The product is fine, but it was packaged and sent in a plastic bag. Two of the bottles leaked and I lost a lot of product. Should havecbeen shipped in a box. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the great reviews.  I was also very, very attracted to the price.      I have been suffering from adult acne for a few years now.  It has been very frustrating.  I have tried just about every brand that I have seen at the grocery store.  Dove, Aveeno, Clearisil, Clean and Clear, Neutrogena, Oil of Olay, St. Ives, Proactiv, and even the Loreal line of adult acne treatments.    None of them worked.  None of them even helped.  The creams made me get dry and red and then the breakouts would be back.    I have only been washing my face with pHisoderm for a week, and my skin is already completely clear.  It is smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt and looks better than it has since I was a teenager.      How lucky are we that the best face wash also turns out to be the best value?  Hooray for that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately 20 years now (through teenage years and beyond).  Over time it has gone through some changes but, it has never failed to keep my skin clear and feeling good.  When it started to become harder to find, I attempted to change to different face washes and/or soaps (anti-blemish, all natural, moisturizing, oil control - you name it!) but I always kept coming back to pHisoderm due to horrible breakouts.  Now, I don&#x27;t even bother...I just stick to what I know works!</li>
            <li> My subject says it all folks. I figured with 70+ reviews that average strong results--I need to try it! I happened to find it at a local store. Great price! I was stoked! I have adult acne--I&#x27;m 33 and the last year my acne has been coming out like I&#x27;m a teen all over again. I&#x27;ve been using it for 7 weeks and I see no results. Just more nodules, inflammation, and random pimples. This simply does not work for my combo skin at all. :(</li>
            <li> Use this all the time</li>
            <li> I can no longer find this product in my local retail stores and I&#x27;m so glad that it&#x27;s available on Amazon.com.  I have been using this for the past 6 years or so, and it is proven to keep my skin clear of blemishes.  When i couldn&#x27;t find it locally, I tried other anti-blemish products but they broke my face out, even after using them for a month while giving my skin time to get used tho the change.  pHisoderm is gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I dont usually write reviews and I know everyone says this but I really don&#x27;t. Choose to believe me or not but I digress. This product saved me. Ive been dealing with acne for about seven years now since a little after high school began. No one in my family has acne, in fact everyone else has perfect glowing skin. So you can imagine how frustrating it is to wake up in the morning with whiteheads and pimples all over your face. My acne isn&#x27;t horrible but it is still enough to look like a pizza face. Or a chocolate chip cookie I should say because I&#x27;m African-American( I promise I will cut to the chase soon). Bottom line, buy this product! Im not going to say it totally cleared up my skin but it has reduced my acne significantly. I can leave my house without wearing makeup again. My skin glows. I use it morning and night. It gives me a gentle clean. Its great to remove makeup, I just wash twice when I do. This product in conjunction with palmers skin success fade cream as a moisturizer because my skin gets a little dry after using, has been a great beauty regime. Oh and I also use bare escentuals blemish therapy powder as a spot treatment the moment I see something coming up on my face. So glad I finally found a great skin care routine. Hang in there guys you will too.</li>
            <li> rocks. Hands down. Great for acne, makes skin smooth, sudsing power is terrific and it really gets your face clean.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since it was changed from &amp;#34;Phisohex&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;Phisoderm&amp;#34;. this is the best &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; ever!! I will continue to order.</li>
            <li> I originally rated this product very high, but based on my most recent purchase, I&#x27;m changing it to a 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;Why? Because it&#x27;s not the same product anymore. They changed the formula, and now it&#x27;s so chalky that it&#x27;s much harder to use.&lt;br /&gt;Phisoderm states that this was to make it \\&quot;less soapy\\&quot;. But that characteristic made it very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I used to like to rub a small amount into a problem area, and just let it dry. Once dry, you couldn&#x27;t even notice it there. But this new formulation becomes very flaky, and makes it look like your skin is peeling.&lt;br /&gt;So between being less usable for normal scrubbing, and drying to a flaky/chalk substance, it&#x27;s just not the same product at all, anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for many many years, since even before Phisoderm bought the product, but i&#x27;ll have to shop around for an alternative now.</li>
            <li> Been looking for this product for age&#x27;s but couldn&#x27;t find it in stores.So I found it here for a very reasonable price.I ordered 4 to keep on hand when I run out.This product is great for my age.It&#x27;s a great cleanser.I myself like it better the other product&#x27;s that I have used.This is far the best.Been using it for more that 15 years.</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser once daily to keep my skin clear.  It has been very effective at clearing up breakouts in my t-zone area.  I can only use it at night though or it will dry my skin out too much.  I just use water in the morning to wash my face.</li>
            <li> I cannot function without this product!  It&#x27;s the only cleanser that cleans my face without stripping it away.  If acne occurs (hormonal changes, I am 40) It heals quickly and I move on with a glowing youthful complextion.  Buying four at a time saves me trips to the store and is VERY economical.  I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> the product doesnt work as Anti blemish as the title states, it leaves residue or whatnot on your face like a film and unless you wash with something else there is no getting rid of it..</li>
            <li> I was using a facial wash that was discontinued.  It was very stressful trying to find a new facial wash because I tried everything and nothing was working for me.  The others made my face red and irritated and made me breakout instantly. I went to my dermatologist and he was not able to help.  Then I found this face wash on Amazon and tried it because of all the awesome reviews.  I love this facial wash it is the only thing that works.  I would recommend this to anyone that wants clear skin.  My skin looks better an clearer than before.  My pores even look smaller.  I am so happy that Amazon carries this because I could not find it in any store.  I ordered several bottles of this.  Thank you Amazon I hope this will always be available.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old daughter finds this product brilliant.  Only one that she will use.  We have to ship it from America to Ireland!!!</li>
            <li> Ive used Phisoderm for years.  I have switched a few times to ProActiv but always come back.  I haven&#x27;t had a serious break out in years (knock on wood)!  I occasionally get a small zit but they are few and far between.  I can&#x27;t find this product in stores anymore so thank god for sites like this!  I would HIGHLY recommend this to everyone!  I have normal/dry skin usually in case you were wondering!</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find but works extremely well! There is a noticeable difference after I use this. I&#x27;m glad I found it here!</li>
            <li> When I got this product in the mail, one of the bottles came open and almost the entire thing at leaked out onto all the other ones leaving me with far less product than I paid for. As far as the product goes, I tried using it but it didn&#x27;t help my acne so I discontinued use. Not sure if the cleanser is actually pH balanced or not. It doesn&#x27;t say anywhere on the product that it is. The pH balance of this product should be between 4.5 - 5.5.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 and I still struggle with blemishes and pimples especially when I stress out! I saw big improvement 3 weeks after I started using it, I wash my face everyday 1-2 a day. My only con about this product is that it drys your skin, so for my it&#x27;s perfect coz my face is oily but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to normal-dry type of skin. Other than that I love it!</li>
            <li> was thrilled to find a facial wash pack that didn&#x27;t cost a  fortune and was great on our skin. Love it and will order it again.</li>
            <li> this is a great price for a facial wash that is actually good! the four pack will last you FOREVER, doesnt dry out my skin, and i think it kept my acne at bay</li>
            <li> Love the pHisoderm gel as a facewash.  The cream cleanser is too greasy, but the gel is perfect.  Great product for people with ezcema as well.</li>
