    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This cream is perfect, not greasy but moisturizes all day.</li>
            <li>but I have been so impressed with this product</li>
            <li>The texture and smell are both very pleasant.</li>
            <li>IT IS JUST SO SO INCREDIBLE.</li>
            <li>good product!</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>but these products are great for the itching and tightness.</li>
            <li>I was really happy when I received this product since it was affordable and smelled great.</li>
            <li>For this alone, I consider it a good purchase.</li>
            <li>good skin care makes a difference.</li>
            <li>and I loved the consistancy and smell.</li>
            <li>the Lamaze Belly Rub seemed to have good reviews.  </li>
            <li>I know the price is good</li>
            <li>Good buy</li>
            <li>I liked the non-greasy feel of this product and LOVED the smell.</li>
            <li>and I got a sample of palmer&#x27;s cocoa massage lotion for stretch marks which to my surprise also felt great as it&#x27;s not greasy at all and easy to absorb.</li>
            <li>I love that the belly rub has a pleasant scent, and after applying it didn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy or turn any of my clothes colors.  </li>
            <li>NIce product.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>please let me get through this pregnancy without any stretch marks\\&quot; creams/lotions/potions, and this one was BY FAR the best.</li>
            <li>I read a bunch of great reviews for this product, and while I&#x27;m sure it does a great job at preventing stretch marks, I applied as instructed and could not stand the greasy feeling it left on my skin, even after showering to try to remove it.</li>
            <li>With my first pregnancy, I used Burt&#x27;s Bees Mama Bee Belly Butter which was great.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s oily and feel like it stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, made my belly softer</li>
            <li>Like most products, some may work for others, some may not.</li>
            <li>so most people probably won&#x27;t mind the smell.</li>
            <li>This product however is fantastic!</li>
            <li>and this was definitely my favorite.  </li>
            <li>but I still have 10 more lbs to lose.  </li>
            <li>i love, love, LOVE this product</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this belly rub.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And most importantly, I&#x27;m pleased to say at 5 months post-pregnancy that I&#x27;m stretch mark free!</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful light fragrance which prompted me to try out the product a couple more times than I would have other wise.  </li>
            <li>for the smell, I actually love it, its light and relaxing.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s when the true damage shows!</li>
            <li>It goes on easily but is not greasy.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and is easy to rub onto the skin.</li>
            <li>This product glides on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great cream that I use daily.</li>
            <li>and so far so good - no marks.</li>
            <li>Was worth purchasing!</li>
            <li>I read that it&#x27;s all genetics, but I don&#x27;t think that is entirely true....</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and fresh, I was nauseous with my 1st and the smell didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really like many fragrances</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still pregnant, so I can&#x27;t remark on how it does with stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I bought this when I was about 26 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li>Genetics, and the fact that I didn&#x27;t gain weight quickly, are probably why I don&#x27;t have any marks yet</li>
            <li>Good solid mostly organic and natural belly rub.  </li>
            <li>I rarely itched unless I forgot to put it on.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I gave it two stars rather than one for the sole reason that the fragrance was so nice.</li>
            <li>NOT how you should feel right after you already HAD a shower.  </li>
            <li>It is less greasy than Palmer&#x27;s butter which is good for me.</li>
            <li>It stained every single pregnancy shirt and dress that i own, and i still got a couple marks on my belly</li>
            <li>So, the items for sale are probably old stock, which may be fine.  </li>
            <li>I ordered another jar after I finished the first one.</li>
            <li>This is my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>NOT GREASY, RUBS IN WELL, SO SOFT AND SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>used it with my first pregnancy 2-3 times per day and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks.</li>
            <li>However, since I don&#x27;t have any marks, I am willing to keep using this product - just in case.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 6th month of pregnancy, and find this rub to be very helpful for an increasingly itchy, growing belly!  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin soft and smooth without an oily residue.</li>
            <li>The only downside was that I went through 1-2 jars per month and it seemed like I was always needing to buy more -</li>
            <li>It helped keep my belly super soft and itch-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was really hoping not get stretch marks or</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m really 50/50 on the effectiveness of this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really picky on the fragrance of a skincare I use</li>
            <li>It works very well to prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super thick (almost like vaseline, but not sticky), absorbs very well, and smells lovely.</li>
            <li>ive found with some other products its either absorbed too quickly</li>
            <li>My sister was pregnant at the same time and used no lotions, creams, ect...</li>
            <li>:) Should I get marks in the next two months or discover some after my baby is born, I will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I did get some marks above the pubic line</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend it it took away itching during pregnancy</li>
            <li>I see a couple other people mentioned it being sticky, but they didn&#x27;t give you the full scoop!  </li>
            <li>i put it on when i get done with my bath and by the time i put clothes on its absorbed enough to not stain my clothes.</li>
            <li>Its very light and fresh and if you live in a climate where dry skin is prevalent and you itch from tight skin, then this product will work wonders.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t do a whole lot to my skin at all, go with regular lotion over this.</li>
            <li>So far, not stretch marks!  </li>
            <li>Oh and most importantly, no stretch marks, I was 120 pre baby, gained 20lbs and had a 9lb baby so that has to say something for effectiveness of the cream!</li>
            <li>I only bought this because there were a full 5 stars for each of the only 10 reviews.  </li>
            <li>I used it from four months, until the end of my pregnancy and ended up with only a few, very very light stretch marks around my belly button.</li>
            <li>I went through 2 jars of it and purchased any other jars I could get my hands on for pregnant friends.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to other pregnant women out there.</li>
            <li>my nose was so sensitive, but  I took the risk and tried this anyway.</li>
            <li>So far no stretch marks or itching.</li>
            <li>So far no stretch marks at 28 weeks...and reduced itchiness in skin.</li>
            <li>This cream does everything I need it to do, there is no need for me to keep looking at other options and the price is comparative to other brands that I have found have had many flaws.</li>
            <li>But I found out quickly that it&#x27;s a waste of money anyway.</li>
            <li>Very natural, I use it on my eyes at night for extra moisturization</li>
            <li>It appears thick but rubb on translucent and light.</li>
            <li>I will update my review after I feel up to attempting this, but it&#x27;s not like I need more things to make me feel sick right now.</li>
            <li>and i cant live without it, im 3 weeks away from my due date with my second pregnancy</li>
            <li>The pomegranate frangrance is not very strong, nor does it strike me as being particularly fruity</li>

            <li> and i cant live without it, im 3 weeks away from my due date with my second pregnancy</li>
            <li> The pomegranate frangrance is not very strong, nor does it strike me as being particularly fruity</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used regular lotion, but it wasn&#x27;t long lasting enough.</li>
            <li> This Lamaze belly rub made my big belly really soft and less</li>
            <li> I put it on after my shower before going to bed, and could feel a gross, sticky wetness on my skin under my pajamas, even though I waited a bit to try to let it dry before putting them on.  </li>
            <li> I GAINED 30 LBS AND WENT BACK TO MYSELF WITHOUT A SINGLE MARK</li>
            <li> I tried ALOT of the other more expensive products (mederma, revitol, mustela, bella b, bio oil, etc)</li>
            <li> I used it perhaps once a day or every other day starting in the 2nd trimester.</li>
            <li> Sticky / sweaty-feeling all day long until nighttime again</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t EVER dry.  </li>
            <li> AND I DO NOT HAVE 1 SINGLE STRETCH MARK ANY</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I&#x27;m six and a half months into my second pregnancy</li>
            <li> I will say that it does stop the itching due to dry skin.</li>
            <li> but apparently that&#x27;s not good enough.  </li>
            <li> All in all the stretch marks are minimal.</li>
            <li> The smell is fine, but the super nasty stickiness is NOT okay.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after looking for a cream that didn&#x27;t include parabens or other chemicals.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it greasy as some other reviewers have found.  </li>
            <li> I only used this product once so far, but I knew after the first time that I hated it.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint, it is a bit sticky until it dries.</li>
            <li> Skin does feel a little sticky and heavy sometimes, so usually apply regular layer of lotion</li>
            <li> It felt like a very gross, damp stickiness - like how you feel in the summer after you&#x27;ve been sweating all day or during a workout and seriously need a shower.  </li>
            <li> Previously I had brought the Belly B Tummy Honey Butter</li>
            <li> Im not currently pregnant and don&#x27;t have kids</li>
            <li> maybe just little if I do.</li>
            <li> but other than that I have no complaints!!</li>
            <li> The smell is ok, not delightful, but the greasiness was almost unbearable and I was afraid it would leave marks on my clothes.</li>
            <li> I began to use it everyday since I was two months.</li>
            <li> I was not sure whether it was the rub that caused the itchness,but I stopped using it and shift to olive oil which I used to cook everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure who to blame - genetics or this belly</li>
            <li> I take a small glob onto my fingertips and just rub it into the skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li> then cover with small amount of belly rub morning and night.  </li>
            <li> So...it was hard for me to get sleep.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really thick and greasy when I put them on the belly and thigh.</li>
            <li> It beats other fancy and expensive creams.</li>
            <li> I can see MAYBE trying it again using a teensy amount, but I seriously doubt it will make any difference with the icky stickyness of it all.  </li>
            <li> so this is a big contributing factor that made me finish off the product hoping it will work even if I hated the greasy feeling and stain</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this was not a homerun as hoped.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my tummy began to be itching after two days</li>
            <li> Sorry,</li>
            <li> but I know I failed to apply any belly stuff in this area until I noticed a mark.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would say give it this a 2 because even if I like the scent, I hated the greasiness and stain and the effectiveness is 50/50 for me.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product glides on smoothly.  I love that it&#x27;s oily and feel like it stays on all day.  I only have to apply it once a day.  So far, not stretch marks!  I ordered another jar after I finished the first one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now. I&#x27;m still pregnant, so I can&#x27;t remark on how it does with stretch marks. I will say that it does stop the itching due to dry skin. I&#x27;ve used regular lotion, but it wasn&#x27;t long lasting enough. This stuff lasts throughout work and workouts. It smells fantastic and is easy to rub onto the skin. For this alone, I consider it a good purchase.</li>
            <li> When I was prego my nose was so sensitive, but  I took the risk and tried this anyway. I love the smell, made my belly softer and I guess improved the elasticity. NIce product.</li>
            <li> I waited to review this item until after my baby was born and some of my weight was off.... that&#x27;s when the true damage shows! I liked the non-greasy feel of this product and LOVED the smell. I used it from four months, until the end of my pregnancy and ended up with only a few, very very light stretch marks around my belly button. I rarely itched unless I forgot to put it on. My sister was pregnant at the same time and used no lotions, creams, ect... and as she describes it she looks like she was \\&quot;attacked by a bear\\&quot;. I read that it&#x27;s all genetics, but I don&#x27;t think that is entirely true.... good skin care makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this when I was about 26 weeks pregnant. This is my first pregnancy and I was really hoping not get stretch marks or maybe just little if I do. Either this belly rub does not work at all or it just didn&#x27;t work for my skin since i got a lot of stretch marks below my navel on by both of sides starting from my 35th week. I&#x27;m a skinny girl so my skin did stretch a lot especially nearing the end so maybe its just me but I&#x27;m really 50/50 on the effectiveness of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I didn&#x27;t like about this belly rub also is that its greasy that I have to wash my hand well to get it off after applying in on my belly. It also sticks to clothes. I wear a white night gown and my gown would have this yellowish stain on it where my belly is at, as if I put the belly rub on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell, I actually love it, its light and relaxing. I&#x27;m really picky on the fragrance of a skincare I use so this is a big contributing factor that made me finish off the product hoping it will work even if I hated the greasy feeling and stain it gave my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say give it this a 2 because even if I like the scent, I hated the greasiness and stain and the effectiveness is 50/50 for me. Like most products, some may work for others, some may not. Maybe it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This Lamaze belly rub made my big belly really soft and less itchy.&lt;br /&gt;As I almost don&#x27;t have visible stretch marks I&#x27;m not sure who to blame - genetics or this belly rub.&lt;br /&gt;But I definitely like the smell, I like to feel it on my skin. It&#x27;s now greasy, it doesn&#x27;t make any spots on my clothes but as I touch my belly I still can feel that skin is well moisturized.</li>
            <li> I read a bunch of great reviews for this product, and while I&#x27;m sure it does a great job at preventing stretch marks, I applied as instructed and could not stand the greasy feeling it left on my skin, even after showering to try to remove it. The smell is ok, not delightful, but the greasiness was almost unbearable and I was afraid it would leave marks on my clothes. Unfortunately, this was not a homerun as hoped.</li>
            <li> I used this for my 1st pregnancy and am ordering it for my 2nd pregnancy too. This cream is perfect, not greasy but moisturizes all day. The fragrance is light and fresh, I was nauseous with my 1st and the smell didn&#x27;t bother me. Oh and most importantly, no stretch marks, I was 120 pre baby, gained 20lbs and had a 9lb baby so that has to say something for effectiveness of the cream!</li>
            <li> I USED THIS THROUGH OUT MY ENTIRE PREGNANCY AND I DO NOT HAVE 1 SINGLE STRETCH MARK ANY WHERE. NOT MY LEGS, NOT MY BREASTS, AND DEFINITELY NOT 1 MARK ON MY BELLY. I WENT THROUGH 3 OR 4 OF THESE AND WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERY WOMAN IN THE WORLD. IT IS JUST SO SO INCREDIBLE. MUST MUST BUY. NOT GREASY, RUBS IN WELL, SO SOFT AND SMOOTH. I GAINED 30 LBS AND WENT BACK TO MYSELF WITHOUT A SINGLE MARK</li>
            <li> used it with my first pregnancy 2-3 times per day and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks. I know I am prone to them as i got stretch marks on my hips during growth spurt in my teens. Also got stretch marks on my breasts when breastfeeding as didn&#x27;t use any lotion. So I am using it again religiously w/ my second pregnancy.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews of the product, I decided to give a try to this rub. I began to use it everyday since I was two months. Unfortunately, my tummy began to be itching after two days and it&#x27;s really thick and greasy when I put them on the belly and thigh. So...it was hard for me to get sleep. I was not sure whether it was the rub that caused the itchness,but I stopped using it and shift to olive oil which I used to cook everyday.Then the itchness disappeared! After that, I had to give up this rub and I got a sample of palmer&#x27;s cocoa massage lotion for stretch marks which to my surprise also felt great as it&#x27;s not greasy at all and easy to absorb.</li>
            <li> I only used this product once so far, but I knew after the first time that I hated it.  The smell is fine, but the super nasty stickiness is NOT okay.  It doesn&#x27;t EVER dry.  I put it on after my shower before going to bed, and could feel a gross, sticky wetness on my skin under my pajamas, even though I waited a bit to try to let it dry before putting them on.  It felt like a very gross, damp stickiness - like how you feel in the summer after you&#x27;ve been sweating all day or during a workout and seriously need a shower.  NOT how you should feel right after you already HAD a shower.  And in the morning, I was STILL just as sticky!  It was discusting!  Sticky / sweaty-feeling all day long until nighttime again when I took another shower.  And I did NOT re-apply it in the morning as suggested for twice a day.  Why bother, when it never went away from last night?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only at 10 weeks, but I cannot possibly imagine using this for another 7 months or so!  No thank you!!!  I only bought this because there were a full 5 stars for each of the only 10 reviews.  Sorry, but apparently that&#x27;s not good enough.  I see a couple other people mentioned it being sticky, but they didn&#x27;t give you the full scoop!  I can see MAYBE trying it again using a teensy amount, but I seriously doubt it will make any difference with the icky stickyness of it all.  Especially if you applied it twice a day as recommended.  I will update my review after I feel up to attempting this, but it&#x27;s not like I need more things to make me feel sick right now.</li>
            <li> I bought this after looking for a cream that didn&#x27;t include parabens or other chemicals. It&#x27;s a great cream that I use daily. So far no stretch marks or itching.</li>
            <li> A friend, who just had a baby and got maybe only one stretch mark, recommended this product. It works great. I am 28 weeks and so far so good - no marks. My only complaint, it is a bit sticky until it dries. The smell is alright but I don&#x27;t really like many fragrances so most people probably won&#x27;t mind the smell. I started using this product with a combination of zinc oxide (my mother swears this is why she didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks) but I have since switched to using this and Burt&#x27;s Bees Belly butter. Genetics, and the fact that I didn&#x27;t gain weight quickly, are probably why I don&#x27;t have any marks yet but these products are great for the itching and tightness. However, since I don&#x27;t have any marks, I am willing to keep using this product - just in case. :) Should I get marks in the next two months or discover some after my baby is born, I will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I did get some marks above the pubic line but I know I failed to apply any belly stuff in this area until I noticed a mark. I tended to focus on the belly region. All in all the stretch marks are minimal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 6th month of pregnancy, and find this rub to be very helpful for an increasingly itchy, growing belly!  I don&#x27;t find it greasy as some other reviewers have found.  I take a small glob onto my fingertips and just rub it into the skin.  It hasn&#x27;t left any stains or greasy, sticky, residue.  The scent is light and pleasant.  Was worth purchasing!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I have been so impressed with this product, I felt I had to share my thoughts with potential buyers. Previously I had brought the Belly B Tummy Honey Butter but I found it grainey with an oily residue. This product however is fantastic! It leaves your skin soft and smooth without an oily residue. It appears thick but rubb on translucent and light. The pomegranate frangrance is not very strong, nor does it strike me as being particularly fruity but it is a pleasing scent. I&#x27;m in my 7th month of pregnancy and currently have no stretch marks. I use it between 1-2 times daily (recommended twice a day on container). I used it on my tummy, thighs and breasts. This cream does everything I need it to do, there is no need for me to keep looking at other options and the price is comparative to other brands that I have found have had many flaws.</li>
            <li> I love that the belly rub has a pleasant scent, and after applying it didn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy or turn any of my clothes colors.  I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> The texture and smell are both very pleasant. It goes on easily but is not greasy. It works very well to prevent stretch marks. Well worth the money.  It beats other fancy and expensive creams.</li>
            <li> I started using this product in my 4th or 5th month of pregnancy.  I tried ALOT of the other more expensive products (mederma, revitol, mustela, bella b, bio oil, etc) and this was definitely my favorite.  I used this two times a day along with palmers oil and gained 40 lbs total and 2-months post-pregnancy I do not have any stretch marks... but I still have 10 more lbs to lose.  The only downside was that I went through 1-2 jars per month and it seemed like I was always needing to buy more - but other than that I have no complaints!!</li>
            <li> i found this product by a fluke and i cant live without it, im 3 weeks away from my due date with my second pregnancy and it saves me.my belly and bust get so itchy and this soothes it and keeps it moisturized. i put it on when i get done with my bath and by the time i put clothes on its absorbed enough to not stain my clothes. ive found with some other products its either absorbed too quickly and i get itchy again or its too oily. i love, love, LOVE this product</li>
            <li> Im not currently pregnant and don&#x27;t have kids but my friend was using this product on HER baby belly and I loved the consistancy and smell. Its very light and fresh and if you live in a climate where dry skin is prevalent and you itch from tight skin, then this product will work wonders. Very natural, I use it on my eyes at night for extra moisturization and I like that it improves skin elasticity, i feel that will help with the aging process!</li>
            <li> It stained every single pregnancy shirt and dress that i own, and i still got a couple marks on my belly</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I&#x27;m six and a half months into my second pregnancy and I have the itchy tummy.  With my first pregnancy, I used Burt&#x27;s Bees Mama Bee Belly Butter which was great.  I went through 2 jars of it and purchased any other jars I could get my hands on for pregnant friends.  I noticed that you can still find it here on Amazon but I don&#x27;t think that Burt&#x27;s Bees is still producing this product.  So, the items for sale are probably old stock, which may be fine.  I don&#x27;t know but I wanted to give another product a shot and the Lamaze Belly Rub seemed to have good reviews.  It has a wonderful light fragrance which prompted me to try out the product a couple more times than I would have other wise.  I really wanted this to work but it actually made my tummy itchier after application.  Perhaps my skin was reacting adversely to one of the ingredients.  I gave it two stars rather than one for the sole reason that the fragrance was so nice.</li>
            <li> I was really happy when I received this product since it was affordable and smelled great. But I found out quickly that it&#x27;s a waste of money anyway. This belly rub does not soak into the skin. I even left my belly uncovered for an hour while watching tv and nothing. It will grease up anything you put on after applying this. I know the price is good but I rather but the mama mio belly rub...</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend it it took away itching during pregnancy an hydrated well. Good buy I  will buy again. Not greasy.</li>
            <li> good product! I love the scent of this belly rub. It is less greasy than Palmer&#x27;s butter which is good for me. I recommend this to other pregnant women out there.</li>
            <li> This did not keep stretch marks from occurring. It really didn&#x27;t do a whole lot to my skin at all, go with regular lotion over this.</li>
            <li> Good solid mostly organic and natural belly rub.  Skin does feel a little sticky and heavy sometimes, so usually apply regular layer of lotion then cover with small amount of belly rub morning and night.  So far no stretch marks at 28 weeks...and reduced itchiness in skin.</li>
            <li> I tried several different \\&quot;oh please let me get through this pregnancy without any stretch marks\\&quot; creams/lotions/potions, and this one was BY FAR the best. It&#x27;s super thick (almost like vaseline, but not sticky), absorbs very well, and smells lovely. I used it perhaps once a day or every other day starting in the 2nd trimester. It helped keep my belly super soft and itch-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And most importantly, I&#x27;m pleased to say at 5 months post-pregnancy that I&#x27;m stretch mark free!</li>
