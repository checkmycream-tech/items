            <li>Love this mascara!  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara!</li>
            <li>The formula provides a nice coverage as well without being clumpy at all.  </li>
            <li>I would love to find one that didn&#x27;t flake.  </li>
            <li>I love it a lot.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite mascara</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Love the brush, but it is a bit flaky.</li>
            <li>Love the mascara.</li>
            <li>Who could ask for anything more?</li>
            <li>Mary Kay has many products I love, though.,</li>
            <li>THE AD FOR THIS MASCARA SAID IT WAS THE LASH LOVE MASCARA</li>
            <li>IT IS THE LASH LOVE LENGHTING MASARA</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara ever.  </li>
            <li>I love Mary Kay.</li>
            <li>I love the brush, it&#x27;s easy to keep your lashes separated while applying.  </li>
            <li>This mascara worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>My wife has used this product in its newer form to great satisfaction, her&#x27;s and mine, but it&#x27;s only good if you receive the current product.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, Mary Kay didn&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
            <li>It came really fast and this is my favorite mascara right now.</li>
            <li>My absolute fav!!</li>
            <li>Mary Kay Lash Love is perfect: goes on easily and smoothly, comes off easily with simple soap and water or my eye makeup remover, doesn&#x27;t clump, makes my lashes look longer and thicker without looking fake or fiber-y, the wand is graceful and easy to use, and it seems to last forever without drying up in the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was no real discount (vs getting it from a mary k lady) but it is worth the price for sure!</li>
            <li>Great brush...nice thick formula.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using forever, but I just don&#x27;t like those big fat brushes most mascaras are using now ---</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid as much as $30.</li>
            <li>THIS SELLER SHOULD TELL THE WHOLE NAME OF THE PRODUCT WHEN ADVERTISING IT ON  AMAZON.</li>
            <li>No different than any other mascara but a good product.</li>
            <li>I love my L&#x27;oreal carbon black</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li>Lash Love has a traditional smaller wand/brush, which - for me - is easier to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a straight forward mascara - no gimmicky promises or features.</li>
            <li>This mascara dries super fast and they stay completely curled and get so long!  </li>
            <li>I just had gift card money to burn and needed a new one.</li>
            <li>Helps when I curl my outer lashes more than usual.</li>
            <li>Received a 3 year old product.  </li>
            <li>I was just looking through my old makeup drawer at all the mascaras sitting in there</li>
            <li>I have a HARD time finding mascaras that dont make my lashes droop after i curl them, Ive tried MANY expensive brands and FINALLY found this one and LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>Normally after I curl my lashes and apply mascara, I can practically watch them straighten as they dry.  </li>
            <li>It does dry out a little bit quickly (and I do not &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; the wand, as I know that dries mascara out even faster).</li>
            <li>However, the good way way way outweighs the bad here.</li>

            <li> Arrived very quickly &amp; exactly as expected!</li>
            <li> This mascara is terrible. It&#x27;s completely dried out.</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing! I love my L&#x27;oreal carbon black but this one suprised me.</li>
            <li> Received a 3 year old product.  My wife has used this product in its newer form to great satisfaction, her&#x27;s and mine, but it&#x27;s only good if you receive the current product.</li>
            <li> Love! Great brush...nice thick formula. Great control over volume.</li>
            <li> No mascaras helps with my thin, weak lashes but this mascara does wonders and gives me so much volume. Worth the money, Mary Kay didn&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara for straight lashes!  Normally after I curl my lashes and apply mascara, I can practically watch them straighten as they dry.  This mascara dries super fast and they stay completely curled and get so long!  The black is like the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; black mascaras which are quite dark with pale complexions and is not my favorite but since every brand is going this direction, it&#x27;s unavoidable.  I love the brush, it&#x27;s easy to keep your lashes separated while applying.  It does smudge when I use the &amp;#34;it&amp;#34; brand foundation under my eyes and I haven&#x27;t figured out how to avoid that.  Helps when I curl my outer lashes more than usual.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! I have such a hard time finding a mascara that is thick enough without being too clumpy. This product fits the bill perfectly!</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t leave me with raccoon eyes.  Very little flaking. This is good stuff.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay is a good product.  This mascara worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> I was using a MAC one before but made the switch once I tried this one. It&#x27;s cheaper than MAC too!&lt;br /&gt;I like the volume and length it adds to my lashes.</li>
            <li> It does make lashes look longer &amp; fuller, but flakes just as bad as all the other mascaras.  I would love to find one that didn&#x27;t flake.  I&#x27;ve paid as much as $30. for mascaras, they flake all the same.</li>
            <li> I had heard the great feedback on Mary Kay and decided to try it. This mascara is no better than Maybeline.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain. It is a good one. I love it a lot.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> My absolute fav!! I have a HARD time finding mascaras that dont make my lashes droop after i curl them, Ive tried MANY expensive brands and FINALLY found this one and LOVE IT!! There was no real discount (vs getting it from a mary k lady) but it is worth the price for sure! I just had gift card money to burn and needed a new one.</li>
            <li> No different than any other mascara but a good product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara! I like in the humidity and am one to have my mascara come off by the end of the day but with this product this does not happen!</li>
            <li> This is recomented by  eye doctors as the best mascara for your eyes.</li>
            <li> It came really fast and this is my favorite mascara right now. It goes on well without needing to put coat after coat on. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite mascara</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It does dry out a little bit quickly (and I do not &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; the wand, as I know that dries mascara out even faster). However, it makes my lashes longer &amp; appear fuller. Love the brush, but it is a bit flaky. However, the good way way way outweighs the bad here.</li>
            <li> Love the mascara. Have had it before</li>
            <li> lentghened but did not volumize...waterproof</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve tried every mascara on the market, from really expensive to inexpensive, looking for one that I&#x27;d like to purchase again and again.  And I finally found it!!  Mary Kay Lash Love is perfect: goes on easily and smoothly, comes off easily with simple soap and water or my eye makeup remover, doesn&#x27;t clump, makes my lashes look longer and thicker without looking fake or fiber-y, the wand is graceful and easy to use, and it seems to last forever without drying up in the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price?  You betcha!  Who could ask for anything more?</li>
            <li> Not the best mascara I&#x27;ve used. I do not recommend. My reason is it was clumpy when applied and made my eyes red and itchy. Not my best purchase. Mary Kay has many products I love, though.,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year and it never disappoints.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use any other mascara.</li>
            <li> THE AD FOR THIS MASCARA SAID IT WAS THE LASH LOVE MASCARA IT IS NOT IT IS THE LASH LOVE LENGHTING MASARA WHICH I AM ALLERGIC TO. THIS SELLER SHOULD TELL THE WHOLE NAME OF THE PRODUCT WHEN ADVERTISING IT ON  AMAZON. MARY KAY MAKES AROUND 5 MASCARA&#x27;S !!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara ever.  Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m older and I&#x27;m just used to the size of the brush I&#x27;d been using forever, but I just don&#x27;t like those big fat brushes most mascaras are using now --- I like that Lash Love has a traditional smaller wand/brush, which - for me - is easier to use. It&#x27;s a straight forward mascara - no gimmicky promises or features. The formula provides a nice coverage as well without being clumpy at all.  Once my lashes are curled, I do one coat and I&#x27;m good to go.  I was just looking through my old makeup drawer at all the mascaras sitting in there I&#x27;ve tried in the past and saw my boxes of &amp;#34;Lash Love&amp;#34; and thought &amp;#34;I need to review this one!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> THEE Best Mascara MK has!</li>
            <li> I love Mary Kay. Their mascara is great.</li>
