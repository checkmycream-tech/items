    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and this is an excellent, enamel preserving toothpaste.</li>
            <li>(The toothpaste tastes delicious.</li>
            <li>I was REALLY impressed with how well this stuff seems to work.  </li>
            <li>Well, that&#x27;s where we decided that Colgate is loved for a reason!</li>
            <li>especially love how much better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pleasant and foams up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I have been using Colgate products and have good dental health, the Colgate products must work.)&lt;br /&gt;- Freshen breath &amp; whitens teeth.</li>
            <li>This is a good tasting toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice, pleasant minty flavor (although I tend to like cinnamon better, but that&#x27;s just me) and it doesn&#x27;t feel grainy or sticky, like some toothpastes</li>
            <li>Use at your own risks, I guess.</li>
            <li>The flavor leaves a nice minty freshness, and it leaves his teeth feeling</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest, I have no clue how they market this as &amp;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good toothpaste, but I don&#x27;t buy into the magical claims.</li>
            <li>Of course, whitening, cavity control, etc...are very important</li>
            <li>(Most Colgate products make these claims.</li>
            <li>Many of the health and beauty products in our household are natural/organic.</li>
            <li>Also, it has a nice, pleasant texture in mouth and leaves me feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>He said use it, be happy, get something real to worry about.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tend to ignore most claims made by toothpaste companies, that their product has magical powers to whiten my teeth, or even repair them.</li>
            <li>I also have some concerns about the ingredient triclosan, which the FDA does say is safe.</li>
            <li>It sure can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>It cleans well and so far has been working great for me.</li>
            <li>Crest toothpastes can be too strong that way</li>
            <li>taste, texture and brushing performance is all fine.</li>
            <li>He likes it just fine.  </li>
            <li>I use it with an electric toothbrush and it does a fine job of polishing and cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>I wouldn’t recommend it for children or pregnant women until more research regarding triclosan comes</li>
            <li>In light of these studies, FDA is engaged in an ongoing scientific and regulatory review of this ingredient.</li>
            <li>It may actually be effective in treating early signs of gingivitis, but that possibility would hold more promise if it was FDA approved for this use.</li>
            <li>Bright, minty fresh feeling left in your mouth long after brushing, this is the best tasting toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>so I was excited to be trying this</li>
            <li>Other than that, it does have a pleasant refreshing taste, and doesn&#x27;t cost a lot.</li>
            <li>I have gum damage from an autoimmune disease, so any positive improvement the toothpaste might cause will take many months to see.</li>
            <li>After our return to Colgate Total, we have had the same stellar check ups as before (we also use ACT rinse in the morning and Listerine in the evening).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colgate has a nice consistency, great cleaning actions (especially with Sonicare), and delivers superior check-ups!</li>
            <li>So while it is being removed from many soaps, Colgate wants me to use it in my mouth.</li>
            <li>(Now this sounds good and possible.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as sweet candy flavored as Crest, and I like that.</li>
            <li>it is not bad but it is nothing to write home about either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m used to one of the active ingredients, sodium fluoride which is in most toothpastes unless you specifically search for the fluoride free kind.</li>
            <li>Clean and fresh, unlike a mouthwash,</li>
            <li>That said, the Colgate Total, including the various variants, is still one of the best toothpastes I have used.</li>
            <li>The sensitivity is completely gone, and I love how fresh and clean my teeth/gums feel after using this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It has a decent taste and rinses easily.</li>
            <li>If the product didn&#x27;t do anything else to help, it would be worth buying for this</li>
            <li>I really liked the “Smartfoam”, and hope that Colgate will start to offer it in the “Daily Repair” variety.</li>
            <li>the teeth and leaving your breath fresh.</li>
            <li>It claims to help reverse early damage for better oral health.</li>
            <li>I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed anything different with how my mouth feels.  </li>
            <li>is not currently known to be hazardous to humans.</li>
            <li>like the feeling this toothpaste gives my mouth when I use it just such a clean crisp feeling and very light mint</li>
            <li>This is a good mild tasting everyday toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t make you feel like you need to hurry up and spit it out.  </li>
            <li>It’s a white, smooth paste with a light mint taste.  </li>
            <li>Colgate makes SO many different types of toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>No weird after taste, or sensations.  </li>
            <li>This Colgate Daily Repair tastes better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually the one who goes for white teeth over healthy stuff, but this was a nice combination of the two goals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t give up A&amp;G, but I liked this enough to use it as a backup in case</li>
            <li>The two adults in residence with good dental health have used the total repair toothpaste for almost two weeks without noticeable difference from our basic fluoride variety.</li>
            <li>No icky after taste nor baking soda, your mouth is tingly fresh</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft paste that spreads and dissolves quickly.</li>
            <li>I have to say, this particular variety might convert me!  </li>
            <li>The most important part (at least for me) about any toothpaste is the taste.</li>
            <li>Hahahaha  </li>
            <li>I gave this three stars to this product for the reason that there is a lot unknown about Triclosan - the ingredient in this product that is supposed to keep your gums healthy.</li>
            <li>It also has a white colored consistency that is semi-firm and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did not leave a lasting impression so I will have to go buy my old standby Colgate toothpastes and there are many of them to choose form.</li>
            <li>week later my teeth are clean and I find that I actually like this toothpaste better than the Crest complete I had been using before.</li>
            <li>I married a girl who used Colgate, and I learned to live with that.  </li>
            <li>A couple of weeks ago, my teeth were feeling sensitive more than normal, especially to hot/cold items.  </li>
            <li>I like the flavor and how clean my mouth feels after using this Daily Repair Colgate.</li>
            <li>It’s really going to be hard to tell how effective this toothpaste really is  </li>
            <li>I honestly haven&#x27;t seen a difference between this and the Colgate Totaling with whitening that I usually purchase.  </li>
            <li>These attributes are the main things I look for in a toothpaste, and the Colgate Total Daily Repair seems to deliver them just fine, and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I thought that was an odd ingredient because there is a lot of controversy surrounding triclosan with many soap companies taking it out of their soap.</li>
            <li>Standing in the toothpaste aisle at  my local drugstore, I am always dubious of the many claims that various toothpastes make.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any pain or sensitivity, and I can be kind of hard on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The other adult has slight sensitivity issues and experienced no improvement,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Colgate Total Daily Repair Toothpaste is an inexpensive toothpaste from Colgate that claims to \\&quot;remineralize weakened enamel\\&quot; and \\&quot;helps reverse early tooth and gum damage* for better oral health\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Also I can drink my morning cup of Irish Breakfast tea right after brushing my teeth</li>
            <li>he was happy to receive it as he has been using whatever toothpaste was left behind by overnight guests and was about to run out.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Repair early teeth and gum damage.  </li>
            <li>Reverse early gum issues by helping prevent gingivitis.</li>
            <li>I gave this tube of Colgate to my adult son to try -</li>
            <li>So far, there is no link found between Triclosan and cancer; however, the FDA is looking into it.</li>
            <li>For me, I would rather use regular Colgate and rinse with a product like Listerine that kills germs very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;can do much when it comes to actually reversing damage to repair enamel</li>
            <li>I alternate using this with my regular one mainly due to not so sure</li>
            <li>I like the feel of it in my mouth when brushing, not much of a difference from the original Colgate Total.</li>
            <li>I love the idea that it strengthens weak enamel and helps fight gingivitis.</li>
            <li>Yet, it has the same active and inactive ingredients as the original Colgate Total, according to the drug facts printed on the package.</li>
            <li>Daily repair is supposed to help reverse early damage of teeth and gum by prevent gingivitis and remineralizing the enamel to strengthen teeth and prevent</li>
            <li>would use this under caution, especially if you are sensitive to mouth irritation.</li>
            <li>But my husband is far less particular than I am, and likes this one so far.</li>
            <li>I had been using Crest Complete with Scope just prior to this Colgate and after checking the ingredients, both contain sodium lauryl sulfate.</li>
            <li>Crest was the first toothpaste to be endorsed by the American Dental Association, a fact that was drilled into my brain by advertising in the 50s and 60s, and as such I couldn&#x27;t imagine using any other product.  </li>
            <li>I prefer Colgate Total toothpaste, so I generally look for that whenever I run out.  </li>
            <li>So I did a little real life checking and asked my personal doctor what he thought.</li>

            <li> But my husband is far less particular than I am, and likes this one so far.</li>
            <li> I had been using Crest Complete with Scope just prior to this Colgate and after checking the ingredients, both contain sodium lauryl sulfate.</li>
            <li> Crest was the first toothpaste to be endorsed by the American Dental Association, a fact that was drilled into my brain by advertising in the 50s and 60s, and as such I couldn&#x27;t imagine using any other product.  </li>
            <li> I prefer Colgate Total toothpaste, so I generally look for that whenever I run out.  </li>
            <li> So I did a little real life checking and asked my personal doctor what he thought.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s only been using this a short time, so it&#x27;s impossible to know whether this actually works better than other toothpastes as far as tartar control.</li>
            <li> that leaves your mouth almost dry and sugary after a short time.  </li>
            <li> The claim of being able to reverse damage seems dubious to me, though, again, that&#x27;s impossible to tell in the short term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the taste and feel is similar to other Colgate toothpaste I use.  </li>
            <li> The second listed active ingredient is triclosan.</li>
            <li> , I am simply unsure about the use of triclosan which along with sodium fluoride are the active ingredients in the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It contains the same active ingredients - sodium fluoride 0.24% for anti-cavity and triclosan 0.30% for anti-gingivitis.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the Daily Repair version of Colgate Total. Daily repair is supposed to help reverse early damage of teeth and gum by prevent gingivitis and remineralizing the enamel to strengthen teeth and prevent cavities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m used to one of the active ingredients, sodium fluoride which is in most toothpastes unless you specifically search for the fluoride free kind. The second listed active ingredient is triclosan. I thought that was an odd ingredient because there is a lot of controversy surrounding triclosan with many soap companies taking it out of their soap. Some studies have associated triclosan with adverse health and skin irritation, endocrine disruption, bacterial and compounded antibiotic resistance. So while it is being removed from many soaps, Colgate wants me to use it in my mouth. On the other hand, triclosan has been shown in some studies to help with gingivitis and cavities. Colgate Total is the only triclosan-containing toothpaste sold in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would use this under caution, especially if you are sensitive to mouth irritation. I wouldn’t recommend it for children or pregnant women until more research regarding triclosan comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The taste, texture and brushing performance is all fine.</li>
            <li> My toothpaste of choice is usually Arm &amp; Hammer, but I wasn&#x27;t disappointed in trying Colgate&#x27;s Daily Repair. I love the idea that it strengthens weak enamel and helps fight gingivitis. I&#x27;m usually the one who goes for white teeth over healthy stuff, but this was a nice combination of the two goals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t give up A&amp;G, but I liked this enough to use it as a backup in case my regular toothpaste is sold out. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> The two adults in residence with good dental health have used the total repair toothpaste for almost two weeks without noticeable difference from our basic fluoride variety. This formula is a paste and has a subtle mint flavor and a somewhat slimy texture. The other adult has slight sensitivity issues and experienced no improvement,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product description claims the toothpaste has the ability to re-mineralize teeth. I understand this is a physical impossibility. Empty promises like this tend to create skepticism and undermine confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, I am simply unsure about the use of triclosan which along with sodium fluoride are the active ingredients in the toothpaste. It may actually be effective in treating early signs of gingivitis, but that possibility would hold more promise if it was FDA approved for this use. And, since it also has no ADA Seal, I will finish up the tube and return to my usual brand.</li>
            <li> We are trying to hang on to our teeth as we age and this is an excellent, enamel preserving toothpaste. I need sensitivity toothpaste which this us not. However, I use this together wth Sensodyne and like its gum health and fluoride properties. It has a decent taste and rinses easily. If it had sensitivity ingredients it would be the only paste we&#x27;d buy.</li>
            <li> The claims made by Colgate regarding this product surprise me. Quoting those claims:&lt;br /&gt;Colgate Total Daily Repair Toothpaste helps:&lt;br /&gt;- Repair early teeth and gum damage.  (How can I measure teeth and gum damage? Maybe studies have proved this claim.)&lt;br /&gt;- Reverse early gum issues by helping prevent gingivitis. Ditto.)&lt;br /&gt;- Remineralize enamel damage to strengthen teeth. (Is it possible to remineralize with toothpaste. If so, I&#x27;m amazed.)&lt;br /&gt;- Kill bacteria that cause gingivitis. (Now this sounds good and possible. If the product didn&#x27;t do anything else to help, it would be worth buying for this reason.)&lt;br /&gt;- Protect against cavities, plaque and tartar. (Most Colgate products make these claims. Since I have been using Colgate products and have good dental health, the Colgate products must work.)&lt;br /&gt;- Freshen breath &amp; whitens teeth. (The toothpaste tastes delicious. It does whiten.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now one problem with the product: The tube was slightly damaged, not too bad. It wasn&#x27;t leaking, just crinkled up.</li>
            <li> Colgate makes SO many different types of toothpaste.  From the looks of it, this one is supposed to do EVERYTHING!  Hahahaha  It’s really going to be hard to tell how effective this toothpaste really is  until after I’ve used it for at least six-months or a year and then had a dental check-up.  It’s a white, smooth paste with a light mint taste.  The toothpaste I was using previously was also Colgate, but a “Smartfoam” type.  I really liked the “Smartfoam”, and hope that Colgate will start to offer it in the “Daily Repair” variety.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have gum disease, or bad teeth so it is hard to say if it is repairing anything.  However, the taste and feel is similar to other Colgate toothpaste I use.  No weird after taste, or sensations.  Normally when I hear of Triclosan I think of Antibacterial soap, so it was weird to think I can use it on my gums.  Use at your own risks, I guess.</li>
            <li> I grew up in a Crest household.  Crest was the first toothpaste to be endorsed by the American Dental Association, a fact that was drilled into my brain by advertising in the 50s and 60s, and as such I couldn&#x27;t imagine using any other product.  Then in the 80s I married a girl who used Colgate, and I learned to live with that.  We&#x27;ve used Colgate for years until very recently when I&#x27;ve started using Sensodyne on the recommendation of my dentist.  I gave this tube of Colgate to my adult son to try - he was happy to receive it as he has been using whatever toothpaste was left behind by overnight guests and was about to run out.  He likes it just fine.  It doesn&#x27;t make him gag and he likes the way the silver tube looks standing in his medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I gave this three stars to this product for the reason that there is a lot unknown about Triclosan - the ingredient in this product that is supposed to keep your gums healthy. Before you buy, I recommend you read the consumer update on Triclosan on the FDA site. So far, there is no link found between Triclosan and cancer; however, the FDA is looking into it. For me, I would rather use regular Colgate and rinse with a product like Listerine that kills germs very well.</li>
            <li> The most important part (at least for me) about any toothpaste is the taste. Of course, whitening, cavity control, etc...are very important but if the taste is not good then it is a no go next time. This taste is only so so-it is not bad but it is nothing to write home about either. I like the regular Colgate Total so I was excited to be trying this but I do not think that I will buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not leave a lasting impression so I will have to go buy my old standby Colgate toothpastes and there are many of them to choose form.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this toothpaste. It&#x27;s a soft paste that spreads and dissolves quickly. The flavor leaves a nice minty freshness, and it leaves his teeth feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s only been using this a short time, so it&#x27;s impossible to know whether this actually works better than other toothpastes as far as tartar control. The claim of being able to reverse damage seems dubious to me, though, again, that&#x27;s impossible to tell in the short term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally will not use this toothpaste. The sodium lauryl sulfate, propylene glycol, and saccharin are ingredients I avoid. But my husband is far less particular than I am, and likes this one so far.</li>
            <li> Many of the health and beauty products in our household are natural/organic. We even tried natural/organic toothpaste ... and our dentist noticed the difference. He commented on how there was actual plaque build-up on our teeth (which is usually taken care of between the Sonicare and the Colgate). Well, that&#x27;s where we decided that Colgate is loved for a reason! After our return to Colgate Total, we have had the same stellar check ups as before (we also use ACT rinse in the morning and Listerine in the evening).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colgate has a nice consistency, great cleaning actions (especially with Sonicare), and delivers superior check-ups! We&#x27;ll be sticking with Colgate Total for life!</li>
            <li> Colgate Total Daily Repair Toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;I like the feeling this toothpaste gives my mouth when I use it just such a clean crisp feeling and very light mint taste.&lt;br /&gt;It does not feel heavy or gritty when using it. I alternate using this with my regular one mainly due to not so sure&lt;br /&gt;about all the ingredients in this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure about all the claims with this one but then again I do not believe any toothpaste&lt;br /&gt;can do much when it comes to actually reversing damage to repair enamel but I do think it does well with&lt;br /&gt;cleaning the teeth and leaving your breath fresh.</li>
            <li> This is very similar to the Colgate Total Whitening toothpaste that we have been using for years. It contains the same active ingredients - sodium fluoride 0.24% for anti-cavity and triclosan 0.30% for anti-gingivitis. It also has a white colored consistency that is semi-firm and smooth. I like the feel of it in my mouth when brushing, not much of a difference from the original Colgate Total. It&#x27;s pleasant and foams up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I have no clue how they market this as &amp;#34;Daily Repair&amp;#34;. It claims to help reverse early damage for better oral health. Yet, it has the same active and inactive ingredients as the original Colgate Total, according to the drug facts printed on the package. That said, the Colgate Total, including the various variants, is still one of the best toothpastes I have used. It has the clinically proven ingredients to help maintain oral health. Also, it has a nice, pleasant texture in mouth and leaves me feeling fresh and clean. These attributes are the main things I look for in a toothpaste, and the Colgate Total Daily Repair seems to deliver them just fine, and at a very reasonable price. I like it.</li>
            <li> I did a little research on this toothpaste before choosing it or using it. It contains triclosan and I know that can be beneficial in some studies treating gingivitis and gum damage, but I have heard third hand negative stuff as well. So I did a little real life checking and asked my personal doctor what he thought. He said use it, be happy, get something real to worry about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week later my teeth are clean and I find that I actually like this toothpaste better than the Crest complete I had been using before. This Colgate Daily Repair tastes better. I have gum damage from an autoimmune disease, so any positive improvement the toothpaste might cause will take many months to see. What I can say is that my gums are not irritated by this and I think my teeth look cleaner and my gum line looks brighter than a week ago. That could also be wishful thinking.</li>
            <li> Colgate Total Daily Repair Toothpaste is an inexpensive toothpaste from Colgate that claims to \\&quot;remineralize weakened enamel\\&quot; and \\&quot;helps reverse early tooth and gum damage* for better oral health\\&quot;. I tend to ignore most claims made by toothpaste companies, that their product has magical powers to whiten my teeth, or even repair them. I also have some concerns about the ingredient triclosan, which the FDA does say is safe. Other than that, it does have a pleasant refreshing taste, and doesn&#x27;t cost a lot. It&#x27;s a good toothpaste, but I don&#x27;t buy into the magical claims.</li>
            <li> Bright, minty fresh feeling left in your mouth long after brushing, this is the best tasting toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used.  No icky after taste nor baking soda, your mouth is tingly fresh and it&#x27;s lasts.  Clean and fresh, unlike a mouthwash, that leaves your mouth almost dry and sugary after a short time.  I am a coffee, diet coke and wine drinker so I am hoping that this helps stop eroding my enamel as it calms.  It sure can&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I prefer Colgate Total toothpaste, so I generally look for that whenever I run out.  Since this popped up, I figured that I would give it a shot.  I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed anything different with how my mouth feels.  I haven&#x27;t received the numbing sensations that others have.  I honestly haven&#x27;t seen a difference between this and the Colgate Totaling with whitening that I usually purchase.  The only difference for me is about $.80 a tube.  I can generally get a 2pack for a little under $6, where this is about $6.80 or so (depending upon where you purchase it).</li>
            <li> I had been using Crest Complete with Scope just prior to this Colgate and after checking the ingredients, both contain sodium lauryl sulfate. I also checked a few other versions of toothpaste I&#x27;ve used recently and found they too contained sodium lauryl sulfate. So it seems sodium lauryl sulfate is in a lot of toothpastes with the &amp;#34;complete&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;total&amp;#34; name. So it&#x27;s not just this one version of Colgate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally prefer Colgate over Crest. The only reason I had been using Crest prior to this Colgate toothpaste is because my husband prefers Crest. I like the flavor and how clean my mouth feels after using this Daily Repair Colgate. It&#x27;s not as sweet candy flavored as Crest, and I like that. Also I can drink my morning cup of Irish Breakfast tea right after brushing my teeth and I don&#x27;t get an aftertaste that makes everything taste bad. It cleans well and so far has been working great for me.</li>
            <li> This is a good mild tasting everyday toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t make you feel like you need to hurry up and spit it out.  Crest toothpastes can be too strong that way and I appreciate that this Colgate variety is a little milder.  I&#x27;ll update over time if it fails to perform as claimed.  I use it with an electric toothbrush and it does a fine job of polishing and cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a good tasting toothpaste.  As to the claim that this toothpaste  repairs teeth, I am not convinced.  Standing in the toothpaste aisle at  my local drugstore, I am always dubious of the many claims that various toothpastes make.  After learning that this toothpaste contains Triclosan, I did some research and found there is no conclusive evidence at this time. The following  information is from the FDA website:  &amp;#34;Triclosan is not currently known to be hazardous to humans. But several scientific studies have come out since the last time FDA reviewed this ingredient that merit further review. Animal studies have shown that triclosan alters hormone regulation. However, data showing effects in animals don’t always predict effects in humans. Other studies in bacteria have raised the possibility that triclosan contributes to making bacteria resistant to antibiotics.  In light of these studies, FDA is engaged in an ongoing scientific and regulatory review of this ingredient. FDA does not have sufficient safety evidence to recommend changing consumer use of products that contain triclosan at this time.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So, I have to say, I tend to be a Crest fan, but I thought I&#x27;d give this toothpaste a try.  I have to say, this particular variety might convert me!  I was REALLY impressed with how well this stuff seems to work.  A couple of weeks ago, my teeth were feeling sensitive more than normal, especially to hot/cold items.  But I started using this toothpaste, and I have to say... WOW!  The sensitivity is completely gone, and I love how fresh and clean my teeth/gums feel after using this stuff.  It has a nice, pleasant minty flavor (although I tend to like cinnamon better, but that&#x27;s just me) and it doesn&#x27;t feel grainy or sticky, like some toothpastes can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially love how much better my teeth feel overall.  I haven&#x27;t had any pain or sensitivity, and I can be kind of hard on my teeth.  I&#x27;m definitely going to stick to this variety, I think this one finally converted me from being a hardcore Crest user.</li>
