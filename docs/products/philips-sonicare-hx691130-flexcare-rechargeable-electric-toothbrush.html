            <li>6 months after purchasing this, I am still quite happy with this.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is great.  </li>
            <li>Be prepared for bits of toothpaste to fly on your sink/mirror even when brushing with it in your mouth.</li>
            <li>great on battery life as well.</li>
            <li>This was definitely a good buy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a good toothbrush and def.</li>
            <li>LOVE this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good product, it&#x27;s powerful than manual toothbrush</li>
            <li>This is an amazing toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not elderly or infirm and consider myself intelligent, but I just want the thing to clean my teeth without my having to get a PHD in their product.  </li>
            <li>&quot; kind but after visiting my dentist and realizing more care was needed I splurged for this one.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to my friend for sure.</li>
            <li>What more could I ask for.</li>
            <li>love Sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the product and all of the options it gives for different types of cleaning and massage.</li>
            <li>I read the instructions and it appears that it has an &amp;#34;automatic&amp;#34; 24 day &amp;#34;upswing&amp;#34; whereby it gets more forceful.  </li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product.</li>
            <li>Truthfully this review will be a bit sparse.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel awesome and the clean feeling lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>Excellent toothbrush, I just wish heads were less expenive.</li>
            <li>Because there are reviewers on here that have gone into much greater detail and are pretty spot on when it comes to this</li>
            <li>When you are finished brushing your teeth have a clean feel.</li>
            <li>My gums are already feeling better, probably because I was brushing with too much pressure when brushing manually.</li>
            <li>I like this so much more than my older, bulkier Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Not only do my teeth look great, but my gums are much improved.  </li>
            <li>I have owned the older sonicare and this 1 is even better.  </li>
            <li>I like the new style with the brush that clips on the top instead of the dome screw on fitting from the older model.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This gives a very satisfactory feeling of having really cleaned your teeth and mouth, and results in a long-lasting clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>My gums are super sensitive and my dentist recommended that I use a Sonicare brush.</li>
            <li>A huge upgrade from the prior model.</li>
            <li>Cleans very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2.)Go watch a youtube video on how to brush, I had been brushing like I would with a normal toothbrush but realized I didn&#x27;t need to put forth that much effort and should \\&quot;let the toothbrush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about the usefulness of the different settings, but the travel case and the charger which can become smaller are great.  </li>
            <li>The biggest benefit of this particular model is the sensitive mode.</li>
            <li>I was actually in shock at first just because I had no idea what it would be like.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums and I&#x27;ve already noticed an improvement.</li>
            <li>I got the sensitive brush heads and brush with Sensodyne Pronamel.</li>
            <li>They work so much better than standard toothbrushes and the small head reaches and massages into parts of your mouth that would otherwise be neglected.</li>
            <li>I like the various settings, the timer reminder to switch to different sections of the mouth, the message feature and long battery life.&lt;br /&gt;Pricey toothbrush but worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However this is my first \\&quot;Adult\\&quot; toothbrush and will try to cover what I hadn&#x27;t seen in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> The charge holds for a long time, and I have definitely traveled for over a week without my charger and been fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> PLUS there are two other settings and God only knows what they&#x27;re for or how to get to them.  </li>

            <li> have never really had an electric toothbrush before.</li>
            <li> I also like heo charge stand that came with the toothbrush--smaller and takes up less counter space.</li>
            <li> Defintely an upgraded product from previous versions of Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I feel like I just got my teeth cleaned at the dentist without all the harsh scraping they do there.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure why.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked at the high price of ALL electric toothbrushes, so I won&#x27;t bash it for that.  </li>
            <li> And if you touch your teeth on the hard part of the toothbrush while its on you will def not be doing that again anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The e-series heads are cheaper and get less disgusting than the older, bulkier ones.  </li>

            <li> Excellent toothbrush, I just wish heads were less expenive.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It cleans my teeth and protects my gums. I wish I had this when I was younger!</li>
            <li> This worked as expected; however, I cannot remember if the settings are supposed to reset itself each time its placed on the charger.</li>
            <li> I wish the replacement heads were cheaper, but this thing is great! It lasts for the 2 weeks they say it does without charge! Couldnt be happier!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product, it&#x27;s powerful than manual toothbrush and it&#x27;s easier to use. I would recommend it to my friend for sure.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been looking to purchase a Sonicare toothbrush, but we don&#x27;t have an unswitched electric outlet in our bathroom. Then I found this product. The battery holds a charge for almost a month of use, and only takes a few hours to charge. What more could I ask for.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush to use. Worth the money. Cleans teeth like never before. Would definitely recommend for people to buy. Excellent</li>
            <li> I like this so much more than my older, bulkier Sonicare.  I&#x27;m not sure about the usefulness of the different settings, but the travel case and the charger which can become smaller are great.  The e-series heads are cheaper and get less disgusting than the older, bulkier ones.  6 months after purchasing this, I am still quite happy with this.  The charge holds for a long time, and I have definitely traveled for over a week without my charger and been fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Sonicare toothbrushes.

            <li> Not only do my teeth look great, but my gums are much improved.  This was definitely a good buy.  I can feel the difference since I started using the sonicare.</li>
            <li> I decided to upgrade my electric toothbrush at my dentist&#x27;s urging.  He recommended this model.  I&#x27;m shocked at the high price of ALL electric toothbrushes, so I won&#x27;t bash it for that.  But I&#x27;ll be damned if I can figure it out.  I read the instructions and it appears that it has an &amp;#34;automatic&amp;#34; 24 day &amp;#34;upswing&amp;#34; whereby it gets more forceful.  But you can bypass that and just go for the gusto.  However, it beeps every minute and I&#x27;m not sure why.  It goes from &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;Massage&amp;#34; without my doing anything.  PLUS there are two other settings and God only knows what they&#x27;re for or how to get to them.  I&#x27;m not elderly or infirm and consider myself intelligent, but I just want the thing to clean my teeth without my having to get a PHD in their product.  Does it work? Who knows?</li>
            <li> This is an amazing toothbrush. My teeth feel awesome and the clean feeling lasts all day long. I have sensitive gums and I&#x27;ve already noticed an improvement. I feel like I just got my teeth cleaned at the dentist without all the harsh scraping they do there. LOVE this toothbrush! Well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product. I have owned the older sonicare and this 1 is even better.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered the newest of the Sonicare electric toothbrush...it is a terrific brush...easier to maneuver around the mouth. I also like heo charge stand that came with the toothbrush--smaller and takes up less counter space.Defintely an upgraded product from previous versions of Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well. Battery life is great.  A huge upgrade from the prior model. The power takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Truthfully this review will be a bit sparse. Why you ask? Because there are reviewers on here that have gone into much greater detail and are pretty spot on when it comes to this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However this is my first \\&quot;Adult\\&quot; toothbrush and will try to cover what I hadn&#x27;t seen in other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never really had an electric toothbrush before. Always used the \\&quot;manual\\&quot; kind but after visiting my dentist and realizing more care was needed I splurged for this one. Not too lowend but at the same time im not wasting extra money I could be using for rent on my mouth. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.)First off it&#x27;s basically like brushing with a vibrator in your mouth. I was actually in shock at first just because I had no idea what it would be like. I made the mistake of also turning it on with toothpaste before it was in my mouth. Be prepared for bits of toothpaste to fly on your sink/mirror even when brushing with it in your mouth. And if you touch your teeth on the hard part of the toothbrush while its on you will def not be doing that again anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.)Go watch a youtube video on how to brush, I had been brushing like I would with a normal toothbrush but realized I didn&#x27;t need to put forth that much effort and should \\&quot;let the toothbrush do the work for me\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.)If you have sensetive gums or suffer from canker sores, my heart goes out to your suffering b/c I know the feeling. I recommend getting some sensodyne(sp?)toothpaste while using the toothbrush and use the sensetive setting as well. It takes some getting used to b/c you will be brushing longer typically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a good toothbrush and def. great on battery life as well. Would def. recommend.</li>
            <li> My gums are super sensitive and my dentist recommended that I use a Sonicare brush. The biggest benefit of this particular model is the sensitive mode. My gums are already feeling better, probably because I was brushing with too much pressure when brushing manually. I got the sensitive brush heads and brush with Sensodyne Pronamel. I&#x27;m very happy with the results I&#x27;m seeing.</li>
