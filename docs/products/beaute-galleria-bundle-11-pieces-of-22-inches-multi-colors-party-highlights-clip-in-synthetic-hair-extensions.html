            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the clips to hold them in, and ended up using small rubber bands to put them on, which I wasn&#x27;t too concerned with considering the price.</li>

            <li>they&#x27;re fun and funky colors and are a nice long length.</li>

            <li> Bought them for my daughter to play so wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but they are nicer than I thought for fake hair.</li>
            <li> The hair is long and soft, and doesn&#x27;t feel plasticky or fake.</li>
            <li> , I wear them one at a time just behind my ear for a pop of color.</li>
            <li> They melt with the curling iron and they tangle like crazy in your hair.</li>
            <li> I used these for a Halloween costume, and was shocked at the quality!</li>

            <li> Looks great.  Tangles easily and can&#x27;t be brushed out.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. :) They&#x27;re easy to put in and I can trim them to the right size as needed. Quick delivery and came just as advertised.</li>
            <li> Good product for my daughter who loves it.</li>

            <li> Fun for playing around.  Not serious hair.  LOL...  Good plastic fake hair quality.  I knew it would be cheap.  Good clips, holds in well.</li>
            <li> ITS PERFECT! i love this so much, it came early to my house and was the perfect length for my hair. I would totally get them again! i love them so much! they came in a really nice package and super clean!</li>
            <li> I bought these for a costume (I was dressing as Wyldstyle from The Lego Movie for a party).  They were the right colors, easy to use and work into the hairstyle.</li>
            <li> got these for my 13 year old sister, she loves them! they&#x27;re fun and funky colors and are a nice long length. They are very cheap and don&#x27;t look like real hair but who cares, they&#x27;re just for fun anyway.</li>

            <li> These were perfect for my sister&#x27;s Halloween costume!!!</li>
            <li> You can probably wear this only once. It gets tangled pretty easily. But not bad. My girls thought it was fun.</li>
            <li> Wore them to a George Clinton / PFunk show! They were perfect! Easy to use, stayed put! I did not try curling them so i cant speak to that.</li>
            <li> Wow! I used these for a Halloween costume, and was shocked at the quality! The hair is long and soft, and doesn&#x27;t feel plasticky or fake. The colors were bright and vibrant. I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with the clips to hold them in, and ended up using small rubber bands to put them on, which I wasn&#x27;t too concerned with considering the price. If you want to wear these multiple times, it might be worth spending more money to get ones with nicer clips.</li>
            <li> These are great colors and good quality synthetic hair pieces. A fun pop of color for my hair without all the chemicals. The clips work well, and with careful low temp curling iron I am able to style them.</li>
            <li> Eh color are weird but kids like em :p</li>
            <li> These are very bright and true to color in the picture. They are easy to put in your hair and easy to take out of your hair. They melt with the curling iron and they tangle like crazy in your hair. I had to toss the ones I used, because I wasn&#x27;t able to comb them out. They&#x27;re longer than you think and you may want to trim them. All in all a good product for a one time use.</li>
            <li> My six year old loves this fun colorful hair. It&#x27;s perfect for playing around the house. Can&#x27;t let her play with them, because they do knot up quick. So I have to put them on her,</li>
            <li> I really like the colors, I wear them one at a time just behind my ear for a pop of color. The only problem is that they get tangled in my hair almost every time, because of their cheap clips, but they were otherwise a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my halloween costume and they worked perfectly. I plan to buy them again for my costume for &amp;#34;halfway to halloween&amp;#34; celebration that my local downtown area puts together every year. I would have reused them from my last purchase, but I feel asleep with them in and they were ruined by the time I finally pulled them all out of my hair</li>
            <li> My main reason for not loving these is that (and this is my oversight, not a reflection of the product) the hair isn&#x27;t able to be curled or styled in any way. If you don&#x27;t have super-straight hair, these will look very out of place on you. Also, the hairs seem to tangle and come out of the comb piece very easily. Unfortunately, since my hair is wavy/curly, I will not be able to use these.</li>
            <li> I never imagined my granddaughter would love these extensions so much. I got them as an extra first gift for her birthday. It took us a while to figure out how to attach them (the little combs snap-bend to secure in her hair). Now she wears them constantly, changing colors to match her outfits. She is having so much fun I will get her a new set when these wear out.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough, these are great, soft, vibrant colors and easy to attach.</li>
            <li> very easy to use.... snap clips are attached to the hair and make it easier to place</li>
            <li> Best thing ever! I had to buy an extra for my daughter and one as a gift. I cut mine to my hair length and it looks very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.</li>
