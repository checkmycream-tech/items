    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>SO, in conclusion, my opinion is that Blackberry smells the best and lasts the longest, coconut lasts well</li>
            <li>Lavanila vanilla coconut and the vanilla lavender scents are awesome.</li>
            <li>The product works incredibly well!</li>
            <li>Although the smell is wonderful, it leaves your armpits feeling &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and timely delivery!</li>
            <li>You will love it!!!</li>
            <li>Smells great, but didn&#x27;t work great at all!</li>
            <li>Smells good though!</li>
            <li>Great scent and great product.</li>
            <li>It smells great to me and lasts well.  </li>
            <li>It is great for exercising and around the town.</li>
            <li>Great alternative, however, to aluminum-based brands.</li>
            <li>Great packaging too.</li>
            <li>The Lavanila doesn&#x27;t burn, I don&#x27;t get bumps, the scents are great</li>
            <li>This product smells great.</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>but as a breastfeeding mom I am just happy</li>
            <li>If it smelled like vanilla and cocoanut I would have been happy.</li>
            <li>This is pricey but it smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my clothes</li>
            <li>If you want to go truly healthy check out Primal Pit Paste!!</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>Love this scent!!</li>
            <li>Very nice experience.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome healthy deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I used to be able to wear Tom&#x27;s deodorants successfully, but something happened with my body chemistry after two pregnancies and Tom&#x27;s didn&#x27;t control my stink anymore!</li>
            <li>After using for a month, I can still say this is a good product.</li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful, light, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>This one, however, was not as good.  </li>
            <li>It smell so good</li>
            <li>So I decided to splurge on a good deodorant.</li>
            <li>it does still smell very fresh &amp; wonderful though.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this deodorant!!!</li>
            <li>But all in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It is healthy , light and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Grapefruit is my favorite scent!</li>
            <li>Love this deodorant!  </li>
            <li>The healthy deodorant as well as this pleasant scent vanilla-coconut.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited with this deodorant!</li>
            <li>It also smells kind of powdery.</li>
            <li>And it stays nice UNTIL you sweat.</li>
            <li>Smells nice</li>
            <li>This was really works the best.</li>
            <li>All day would be nice, too.</li>
            <li>The pleasant smell of the product fades very quickly and doesn&#x27;t deodorize.</li>
            <li>This is best used when your day is not being exposed to high heat or overheated.  </li>
            <li>The first two days of using Lavanila were fine, and although the product wasn&#x27;t very good at deodorizing, I loved the coconut vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many deodorants and this one absolutely has worked the best for me!</li>
            <li>The crystal made my pits peel, obviously super attractive.</li>
            <li>The coconut smells very strongly (to me) like baby powder</li>
            <li>Best natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>This is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s challenging to find a product that doesn&#x27;t have adverse ingredients and is effective.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best ever!!!  </li>
            <li>I have been searching for the best natural deodorant, and I&#x27;ve found it.  </li>
            <li>As far as odor control, it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I have to reapply once during the day, but that is fine!</li>
            <li>My favorite scent is Blackberry.  </li>
            <li>so I am  most often turning to coconut.  </li>
            <li>I am trying to make sure all of my products are healthy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, I was hoping for the coconut vanilla scent</li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve tried many deodorants that are not antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>and I was also able to keep it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I love this line of deodorants.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 5 or 6 brands and this is the first one I&#x27;ve liked!</li>
            <li>I would have given it 5 stars if you were able to use this anytime regardless of time or weather.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>The container is top quality as well.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t even wear the Coconut one more</li>
            <li>the passion fruit is ok.</li>
            <li>but I wish it worked better</li>
            <li>I love the smell too -</li>
            <li>Plus the vanilla coconut scent sounded interesting.</li>
            <li>It has more of a powdery smell to it.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>My favorite product of Lavanila.</li>
            <li>Everybody has a lil damp under their pits, it&#x27;s accepted in society to stay healthy and allow the body to perspire - smell</li>
            <li>Very unique, refreshing, and makes me feel like I am on a tropical island.</li>
            <li>It smells really, really good, it actually provides effective protection, and it does what a deodorant is supposed to do!  </li>
            <li>This product smells nice and feels cool when you put it on.</li>
            <li>(Sweating helps gets toxins out of the body) but it does smell AMAZING and keep me fresh feeling with healthy ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate products that are more natural than processed, yet I also want to smell great in a non-perfumy way.</li>
            <li>Thanks LaVanila for an awesome natural product!!!</li>
            <li>but it is easily removed with water.</li>
            <li>and my skin was fine.</li>
            <li>Fine for a stay at home mom</li>
            <li>Lemon smells great but doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>but it is nice to be able to put something on &amp; not have it clash with my body chemistry to the point of smelling more putrid than just regular ole b.o.</li>
            <li>There are no parabens, sulfates, aluminum, or propylene glycol and that&#x27;s important for your health.  </li>
            <li>Smells good enough to eat!  :-)  </li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for good natural alternatives and this one is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Prompt shipping and the rest of the transaction were good - product scent left more to be desired.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wear off by noon, and the smell is soft, and powdery so it won&#x27;t offend your co-workers or your loved ones.  </li>
            <li>which may sound funny but that is my trend with most deodorants.</li>
            <li>Worth the find!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I originally read about this company.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re supposed to be all-natural, animal friendly etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I love this line, I love the natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel as though I&#x27;m clogging my poors with garbage; it&#x27;s super light feeling when applied, even liberally.</li>
            <li>Lemon smells good but does not last at all!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, does not stain clothes, and keeps me fresh, even on the hottest days.</li>
            <li>Of course it doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as the unhealthy stuff, but this is truly the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>the smell is nice, I do not think it is as strong as regular deodorant - I am using it together with &amp;#34;certain&amp;#34; and it seems to work like that.</li>
            <li>I very much appreciate that Lavanila gives me appropriate coverage so that when I&#x27;m at work teaching my first graders, I never worry about being stinky; I always smell approachable.</li>
            <li>This goes on smooth and creamy, smells great, and keeps me dry at my fast paced job.</li>
            <li>For me, it is better than all of the mercury filled toxic under arm deodorant&#x27;s on the market that clog your pores and not let your body perspire naturally</li>
            <li>Super pricey, though.</li>
            <li>It really reads and it&#x27;s obnoxiously strong.</li>
            <li>This deodorant has a very nice smell and works much better than other natural deodorants.</li>
            <li>I tried the Thai Deodorant Stone and it is working much better so far.</li>
            <li>This is the 3rd natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried and by far the best.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is natural and doesn&#x27;t stop the body from sweating with chemicals..</li>
            <li>The scent is non-existent, i.e. it smells really nice when you open the box and spray it around</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try if you have dealt with underarm irritation from drug store deodorants.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fresh as a coconut-vanilla daisy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a powdery old perfume type smell.  </li>
            <li>I have tried numerous aluminum free deodorants over the past couple of months to find the best one for me.</li>
            <li>As far as natural deodorants go this one is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, but it&#x27;s only effective as a deodorant for low stress winter days.</li>
            <li>While this smells nice, it does not work the same as the Pure Vanilla fragranced one.</li>
            <li>3rd time buying and love it just as much!!</li>
            <li>As far as lasting power goes it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>irritated my armpits, but thats not why i gave it a 3, this particular scent was kind of gross smelling.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell, BUT don&#x27;t expect the deodorant to last longer than a couple of hours (and</li>
            <li>This is the first deodorant that does the job.</li>
            <li>and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t even work if I&#x27;m doing absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>I love the regular Lavanila &amp; the Lavender scent.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve tried coconut/vanilla and vanilla), the application is smooth and not messy.</li>
            <li>so let me clarify that is why I tried this product in the first place.</li>
            <li>I am an avid runner and do crossfit 4 days a week</li>
            <li>so I really put this deoderant to the test!</li>
            <li>I had been wanting to try the coconut (I love coconut everything) for a while &amp; finally found it here on Prime, got it...</li>
            <li>I love all of LaVanila&#x27;s products, this one didn&#x27;t fall short.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m unsure if there is enough of a difference in the ingredients , but the Pure Vanilla worked much better at concealing any odor .</li>
            <li>I originally tried the regular vanilla scent, but I find that the vanilla coconut works much better/longer to prevent odor and has a fresher/less sweet scent.</li>
            <li>I was leary about buying this until I saw some of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>but I can tell you I am not paid but have use this for 2 weeks and can say that as someone with sensitive skin, this product not only smells amazing, CURED my underarm irritation and really works as a deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sensitive to smell and would love it if it smelled like vanilla or coconut.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so worth it to finally have a product that keeps me smelling clean without the harm.</li>
            <li>Scent came across as strong when I smelled directly from the bottle, but once used, it was far from strong and worked well for moderate activity.</li>
            <li>~smell is fresh &amp; pleasing, but i am not usually come morning.</li>
            <li>I REALLY wanted to embrace Lavanila (vanilla coconut) and would&#x27;ve committed to the expense, had it worked.</li>
            <li>For this price, I expected a lot better.</li>
            <li>This one didn&#x27;t run the whole  marathon.  </li>
            <li>Even then, I would really have to pile it on.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Lavanila, for stepping up and helping me out.</li>
            <li>Downside is it shows on skin, although it is not too powdery or white if you limit application to a couple of light strokes.</li>
            <li>I also wish that it were available in a smaller travel size.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t smell much like coconut....</li>
            <li>But it really just smells like baby powder to</li>
            <li>its lightly scented, yes, but overall does not work well.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say it works under these circumstances, but nothing really does for me</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not awful, just not what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because I wanted to try something more natural with the hopes it would actually work against body odor and sweating.</li>
            <li>La Vanila works all day long, all day strong.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t keep the odor at bay as well and almost seemed more &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; to apply than the other two.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will be able to use any other brand.</li>
            <li>It helps with wetness, but with older not as much.</li>
            <li>I have a drawer full of half-used deodorant sticks that simply haven&#x27;t made the cut, including ones that were made for men!  </li>
            <li>but once you spray it on your body, the original vanilla scent completely disappears and you&#x27;re left with a mild, barely detectable soapy smell.</li>
            <li>However, while it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful aluminum, it does contain corn starch as a main ingredient</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s one of the main reason I decided to purchase this item.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing worse than doing a mid-afternoon pit check to find your previously pleasant \\&quot;lemongrass and mountain</li>
            <li>Hence the 4 stars on the high price.</li>
            <li>The wife asked me to buy a few more, so she must like it.</li>
            <li>Love this deodorant for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>However, I would not choose this if your goal is to use for heavy exercise or work out days if you tend to have more body odor at that time.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>It is very white when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>The scent is long-lasting, and I&#x27;ve had no problem wearing it during the middle of a hot, humid summer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not typically a smelly sweater , but with the Coconut , I stink after 1 hour!</li>
            <li>I decided that I wasn&#x27;t going to put aluminum and parabens in my body anymore, so I&#x27;m doing the natural deodorant thing.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying to switch from a clinical strength aluminum deodorant to a natural one, this probably won&#x27;t work for you, either.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this and wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it since it offers no refunds or returns.</li>
            <li>ordered back in December and still doesn&#x27;t seem like I have gone through much of the deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural deodorant that works for a couple of years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had luck with natural deodorants before, but this one does the trick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been so self conscious about it.</li>
            <li>The Holy Grail of natural deodorants.</li>
            <li>smelled old I threw it out</li>
            <li>I have been told it smells like an old man</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s a naturally based product.</li>
            <li>I have had no adverse skin reactions while using this for a month now, and I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Odor protection is good, but feeling is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using this for about a week and, like many other reviewers, I found this deodorant only works if I don&#x27;t actually sweat...or move at all...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a natural deodorant that would work and not break my sensitive skin out.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it if you are a heavy sweater or for exercise, but it works pretty well if you don&#x27;t sweat much or are just lounging.</li>
            <li>I was so skeptical at first of a deodorant that was natural, but this product really keeps me fresh.  </li>
            <li>Major BO fest.  </li>
            <li>For one stick that barely lasted  a month!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different natural deodorants, and I&#x27;ve always had the same complaint, that a lot of natural deodorants just don&#x27;t provide effective enough odor protection.  </li>
            <li>The only natural deodorant that works!</li>
            <li>I completely recommend this over the other highly recommended but lower priced deodorant on Amazon!</li>
            <li>The only negative for me is that the vanilla-coconut fragrance is fairly strong when this is first applied -- which can fight with other fragrances, if you wear them -- but this generally subsides after a while.</li>
            <li>I went back to my old deodorant to see if that too would cause a rash, but as suspected, it did not.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found an all natural, cruelty-free deodorant that WORKS.  </li>
            <li>I have tried EVERY natural deoderant and this is the only one that works all day.</li>
            <li>The only natural deodorant that comes close to the effectiveness of this one is Kiss</li>
            <li>the only natural deodorant that works on me..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural deodorant that actually works.</li>
            <li>I am big on organic and natural products and I have tried multiple natural deodorants in the past without success.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey for the size, but considering that it actually works, and that it doesn&#x27;t contain the harmful chemicals of other deodorants, I&#x27;d be willing to purchase this again and again.  </li>
            <li>I think though, with aluminum deodorants only being a few bucks, but worth it to not put aluminum into your system.</li>
            <li>I suppose it depends how much you sweat, but I think I&#x27;m fairly average.</li>
            <li>It is a white stick but doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy white residue at all, especially if you bother to rub it in right after application.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last as long as my old antiperspirant</li>
            <li>Even though it may be expensive in comparison to most ordinary deodorants, it is worth the money to have peace of mind about the way you feel and smell.  </li>
            <li>For better or worse, the smell does not last long, and neither does its effectiveness to prevent underarm odor.</li>
            <li>It does leave residue on my black clothes if a drag them across it right after application</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> SO, in conclusion, my opinion is that Blackberry smells the best and lasts the longest, coconut lasts well</li>
            <li> Lavanila vanilla coconut and the vanilla lavender scents are awesome.</li>
            <li> The product works incredibly well!</li>
            <li> Although the smell is wonderful, it leaves your armpits feeling &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and timely delivery!</li>
            <li> You will love it!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great, but didn&#x27;t work great at all!</li>
            <li> Smells good though!</li>
            <li> Great scent and great product.</li>
            <li> It smells great to me and lasts well.  </li>
            <li> It is great for exercising and around the town.</li>
            <li> Great alternative, however, to aluminum-based brands.</li>
            <li> Great packaging too.</li>
            <li> The Lavanila doesn&#x27;t burn, I don&#x27;t get bumps, the scents are great</li>
            <li> This product smells great.</li>
            <li> Smells great.</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> but as a breastfeeding mom I am just happy</li>
            <li> If it smelled like vanilla and cocoanut I would have been happy.</li>
            <li> This is pricey but it smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my clothes</li>
            <li> If you want to go truly healthy check out Primal Pit Paste!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> Love this scent!!</li>
            <li> Very nice experience.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome healthy deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I used to be able to wear Tom&#x27;s deodorants successfully, but something happened with my body chemistry after two pregnancies and Tom&#x27;s didn&#x27;t control my stink anymore!</li>
            <li> After using for a month, I can still say this is a good product.</li>
            <li> The scent is wonderful, light, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> This one, however, was not as good.  </li>
            <li> It smell so good</li>
            <li> So I decided to splurge on a good deodorant.</li>
            <li> it does still smell very fresh &amp; wonderful though.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this deodorant!!!</li>
            <li> But all in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It is healthy , light and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Grapefruit is my favorite scent!</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant!  </li>
            <li> The healthy deodorant as well as this pleasant scent vanilla-coconut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited with this deodorant!</li>
            <li> It also smells kind of powdery.</li>
            <li> And it stays nice UNTIL you sweat.</li>
            <li> Smells nice</li>
            <li> This was really works the best.</li>
            <li> All day would be nice, too.</li>
            <li> The pleasant smell of the product fades very quickly and doesn&#x27;t deodorize.</li>
            <li> This is best used when your day is not being exposed to high heat or overheated.  </li>
            <li> The first two days of using Lavanila were fine, and although the product wasn&#x27;t very good at deodorizing, I loved the coconut vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many deodorants and this one absolutely has worked the best for me!</li>
            <li> The crystal made my pits peel, obviously super attractive.</li>
            <li> The coconut smells very strongly (to me) like baby powder</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s challenging to find a product that doesn&#x27;t have adverse ingredients and is effective.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best ever!!!  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for the best natural deodorant, and I&#x27;ve found it.  </li>
            <li> As far as odor control, it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I have to reapply once during the day, but that is fine!</li>
            <li> My favorite scent is Blackberry.  </li>
            <li> so I am  most often turning to coconut.  </li>
            <li> I am trying to make sure all of my products are healthy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, I was hoping for the coconut vanilla scent</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried many deodorants that are not antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> and I was also able to keep it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I love this line of deodorants.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 5 or 6 brands and this is the first one I&#x27;ve liked!</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars if you were able to use this anytime regardless of time or weather.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> The container is top quality as well.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t even wear the Coconut one more</li>
            <li> the passion fruit is ok.</li>
            <li> but I wish it worked better</li>
            <li> I love the smell too -</li>
            <li> Plus the vanilla coconut scent sounded interesting.</li>
            <li> It has more of a powdery smell to it.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> My favorite product of Lavanila.</li>
            <li> Everybody has a lil damp under their pits, it&#x27;s accepted in society to stay healthy and allow the body to perspire - smell</li>
            <li> Very unique, refreshing, and makes me feel like I am on a tropical island.</li>
            <li> It smells really, really good, it actually provides effective protection, and it does what a deodorant is supposed to do!  </li>
            <li> This product smells nice and feels cool when you put it on.</li>
            <li> (Sweating helps gets toxins out of the body) but it does smell AMAZING and keep me fresh feeling with healthy ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate products that are more natural than processed, yet I also want to smell great in a non-perfumy way.</li>
            <li> Thanks LaVanila for an awesome natural product!!!</li>
            <li> but it is easily removed with water.</li>
            <li> and my skin was fine.</li>
            <li> Fine for a stay at home mom</li>
            <li> Lemon smells great but doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> but it is nice to be able to put something on &amp; not have it clash with my body chemistry to the point of smelling more putrid than just regular ole b.o.</li>
            <li> There are no parabens, sulfates, aluminum, or propylene glycol and that&#x27;s important for your health.  </li>
            <li> Smells good enough to eat!  :-)  </li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for good natural alternatives and this one is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Prompt shipping and the rest of the transaction were good - product scent left more to be desired.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wear off by noon, and the smell is soft, and powdery so it won&#x27;t offend your co-workers or your loved ones.  </li>
            <li> which may sound funny but that is my trend with most deodorants.</li>
            <li> Worth the find!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when I originally read about this company.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re supposed to be all-natural, animal friendly etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I love this line, I love the natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel as though I&#x27;m clogging my poors with garbage; it&#x27;s super light feeling when applied, even liberally.</li>
            <li> Lemon smells good but does not last at all!</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, does not stain clothes, and keeps me fresh, even on the hottest days.</li>
            <li> Of course it doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as the unhealthy stuff, but this is truly the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> the smell is nice, I do not think it is as strong as regular deodorant - I am using it together with &amp;#34;certain&amp;#34; and it seems to work like that.</li>
            <li> I very much appreciate that Lavanila gives me appropriate coverage so that when I&#x27;m at work teaching my first graders, I never worry about being stinky; I always smell approachable.</li>
            <li> This goes on smooth and creamy, smells great, and keeps me dry at my fast paced job.</li>
            <li> For me, it is better than all of the mercury filled toxic under arm deodorant&#x27;s on the market that clog your pores and not let your body perspire naturally</li>
            <li> Super pricey, though.</li>
            <li> It really reads and it&#x27;s obnoxiously strong.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has a very nice smell and works much better than other natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> I tried the Thai Deodorant Stone and it is working much better so far.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried and by far the best.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is natural and doesn&#x27;t stop the body from sweating with chemicals..</li>
            <li> The scent is non-existent, i.e. it smells really nice when you open the box and spray it around</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try if you have dealt with underarm irritation from drug store deodorants.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fresh as a coconut-vanilla daisy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a powdery old perfume type smell.  </li>
            <li> I have tried numerous aluminum free deodorants over the past couple of months to find the best one for me.</li>
            <li> As far as natural deodorants go this one is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, but it&#x27;s only effective as a deodorant for low stress winter days.</li>
            <li> While this smells nice, it does not work the same as the Pure Vanilla fragranced one.</li>
            <li> 3rd time buying and love it just as much!!</li>
            <li> As far as lasting power goes it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> irritated my armpits, but thats not why i gave it a 3, this particular scent was kind of gross smelling.</li>
            <li> and I love the smell, BUT don&#x27;t expect the deodorant to last longer than a couple of hours (and</li>
            <li> This is the first deodorant that does the job.</li>
            <li> and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t even work if I&#x27;m doing absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li> I love the regular Lavanila &amp; the Lavender scent.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve tried coconut/vanilla and vanilla), the application is smooth and not messy.</li>
            <li> so let me clarify that is why I tried this product in the first place.</li>
            <li> I am an avid runner and do crossfit 4 days a week</li>
            <li> so I really put this deoderant to the test!</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to try the coconut (I love coconut everything) for a while &amp; finally found it here on Prime, got it...</li>
            <li> I love all of LaVanila&#x27;s products, this one didn&#x27;t fall short.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure if there is enough of a difference in the ingredients , but the Pure Vanilla worked much better at concealing any odor .</li>
            <li> I originally tried the regular vanilla scent, but I find that the vanilla coconut works much better/longer to prevent odor and has a fresher/less sweet scent.</li>
            <li> I was leary about buying this until I saw some of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> but I can tell you I am not paid but have use this for 2 weeks and can say that as someone with sensitive skin, this product not only smells amazing, CURED my underarm irritation and really works as a deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sensitive to smell and would love it if it smelled like vanilla or coconut.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so worth it to finally have a product that keeps me smelling clean without the harm.</li>
            <li> Scent came across as strong when I smelled directly from the bottle, but once used, it was far from strong and worked well for moderate activity.</li>
            <li> ~smell is fresh &amp; pleasing, but i am not usually come morning.</li>
            <li> I REALLY wanted to embrace Lavanila (vanilla coconut) and would&#x27;ve committed to the expense, had it worked.</li>
            <li> For this price, I expected a lot better.</li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t run the whole  marathon.  </li>
            <li> Even then, I would really have to pile it on.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Lavanila, for stepping up and helping me out.</li>
            <li> Downside is it shows on skin, although it is not too powdery or white if you limit application to a couple of light strokes.</li>
            <li> I also wish that it were available in a smaller travel size.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell much like coconut....</li>
            <li> But it really just smells like baby powder to</li>
            <li> its lightly scented, yes, but overall does not work well.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say it works under these circumstances, but nothing really does for me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not awful, just not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because I wanted to try something more natural with the hopes it would actually work against body odor and sweating.</li>
            <li> La Vanila works all day long, all day strong.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t keep the odor at bay as well and almost seemed more &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; to apply than the other two.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will be able to use any other brand.</li>
            <li> It helps with wetness, but with older not as much.</li>
            <li> I have a drawer full of half-used deodorant sticks that simply haven&#x27;t made the cut, including ones that were made for men!  </li>
            <li> but once you spray it on your body, the original vanilla scent completely disappears and you&#x27;re left with a mild, barely detectable soapy smell.</li>
            <li> However, while it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful aluminum, it does contain corn starch as a main ingredient</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s one of the main reason I decided to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing worse than doing a mid-afternoon pit check to find your previously pleasant \\&quot;lemongrass and mountain</li>
            <li> Hence the 4 stars on the high price.</li>
            <li> The wife asked me to buy a few more, so she must like it.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> However, I would not choose this if your goal is to use for heavy exercise or work out days if you tend to have more body odor at that time.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> It is very white when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> The scent is long-lasting, and I&#x27;ve had no problem wearing it during the middle of a hot, humid summer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not typically a smelly sweater , but with the Coconut , I stink after 1 hour!</li>
            <li> I decided that I wasn&#x27;t going to put aluminum and parabens in my body anymore, so I&#x27;m doing the natural deodorant thing.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to switch from a clinical strength aluminum deodorant to a natural one, this probably won&#x27;t work for you, either.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this and wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it since it offers no refunds or returns.</li>
            <li> ordered back in December and still doesn&#x27;t seem like I have gone through much of the deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural deodorant that works for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had luck with natural deodorants before, but this one does the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so self conscious about it.</li>
            <li> The Holy Grail of natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> smelled old I threw it out</li>
            <li> I have been told it smells like an old man</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s a naturally based product.</li>
            <li> I have had no adverse skin reactions while using this for a month now, and I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Odor protection is good, but feeling is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using this for about a week and, like many other reviewers, I found this deodorant only works if I don&#x27;t actually sweat...or move at all...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a natural deodorant that would work and not break my sensitive skin out.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it if you are a heavy sweater or for exercise, but it works pretty well if you don&#x27;t sweat much or are just lounging.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical at first of a deodorant that was natural, but this product really keeps me fresh.  </li>
            <li> Major BO fest.  </li>
            <li> For one stick that barely lasted  a month!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different natural deodorants, and I&#x27;ve always had the same complaint, that a lot of natural deodorants just don&#x27;t provide effective enough odor protection.  </li>
            <li> The only natural deodorant that works!</li>
            <li> I completely recommend this over the other highly recommended but lower priced deodorant on Amazon!</li>
            <li> The only negative for me is that the vanilla-coconut fragrance is fairly strong when this is first applied -- which can fight with other fragrances, if you wear them -- but this generally subsides after a while.</li>
            <li> I went back to my old deodorant to see if that too would cause a rash, but as suspected, it did not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found an all natural, cruelty-free deodorant that WORKS.  </li>
            <li> I have tried EVERY natural deoderant and this is the only one that works all day.</li>
            <li> The only natural deodorant that comes close to the effectiveness of this one is Kiss</li>
            <li> the only natural deodorant that works on me..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural deodorant that actually works.</li>
            <li> I am big on organic and natural products and I have tried multiple natural deodorants in the past without success.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey for the size, but considering that it actually works, and that it doesn&#x27;t contain the harmful chemicals of other deodorants, I&#x27;d be willing to purchase this again and again.  </li>
            <li> I think though, with aluminum deodorants only being a few bucks, but worth it to not put aluminum into your system.</li>
            <li> I suppose it depends how much you sweat, but I think I&#x27;m fairly average.</li>
            <li> It is a white stick but doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy white residue at all, especially if you bother to rub it in right after application.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as my old antiperspirant</li>
            <li> Even though it may be expensive in comparison to most ordinary deodorants, it is worth the money to have peace of mind about the way you feel and smell.  </li>
            <li> For better or worse, the smell does not last long, and neither does its effectiveness to prevent underarm odor.</li>
            <li> It does leave residue on my black clothes if a drag them across it right after application</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other natural deodorant brands and this one is the only one that last all day</li>
            <li> On one hand you have a natural product, on the other it&#x27;s scent is not quite vanilla-coconut</li>
            <li> especially if you are going to work out) because it does not last long</li>
            <li> Does not last as long as store brand deodorants.</li>
            <li> that it &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; for the better part of the day without extra dangerous ingredients.</li>
            <li> The only ones that don&#x27;t dry out are the travel size versions.</li>
            <li> Several days I&#x27;ve had to constantly reapply every other hour, and even then it still doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Most smelled awful and didn&#x27;t keep me feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> guess I&#x27;m used to more artificial smells.  </li>
            <li> I not only stink, I feel wet and clammy,</li>
            <li> i have not worn deodorant for so long because of that</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this deodorant, but between the smell (does not smell like vanilla and coconut, more like spoiled baby powder) and the terrible rash I developed under both arms after using this for a week</li>
            <li> One other comment, the deodorant seems to last a long time too...</li>
            <li> Dries after one use and starts feeling like dry paper after therefore can not be used again.</li>
            <li> I tried rubbing it on my skin harden to get it to work through the dry surface</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s super expensive for as long as it lasts.</li>
            <li> Conventional antiperspirants/deodorants react strangely with my body chemistry to create strange scents.</li>
            <li> I am a kindergarten teacher and only work for a half of the day.</li>
            <li> Once the white is rubbed around, I have found that I can even wear a black sleeveless without it marking.</li>
            <li> I wanted to stop using antiperspirant every day (because of the aluminum, as well as the parabens and other nasty stuff in most products) and decided to give this a try, based on the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> It smelled like moldy, wet socks under my arms.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not what I expected and isn&#x27;t even like the perfume.</li>
            <li> I was really wanting to stop using antiperspirant because of the unhealthy ingredients.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d found a decent product but on the third day of use, I developed a bad rash under my arms where I&#x27;d applied the deodorant.</li>
            <li> I previously tried Tom&#x27;s (didn&#x27;t prevent odor) and Crystal (took forever to dry and didn&#x27;t like the smell) before trying Lavanila.  </li>
            <li> It smells a little strange, but</li>
            <li> Sorry to all those I&#x27;ve offended with my stink, these past few weeks! :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents.</li>
            <li> some of the other scents do not.</li>
            <li> I live in a foreign, humid tropical climate where blocking sweat with anti-persperants every day is considered just unhealthy.  </li>
            <li> This brand typically needs reapplying for me during the summer (I&#x27;m now using Crystal in the summertime)</li>
            <li> and it leaves an odd cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m disappointed because I really like the scent and wanted something other then the traditional deodorant to use with less chemicals in it, but this hasn&#x27;t worked for me.</li>
            <li> Not a good substitute for actual deodorant.</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant, or at least the smell of it, but, unfortunately, I seem to be allergic to it as I have extreme redness under each arm now.</li>
            <li> So I went to the gym today, wearing this in Vanilla Cocoanut (cocoanut is my fave scent) and did a moderate workout--not my hardest but hard enough that other deodorants have failed (looking at you, Tom&#x27;s and Jason!).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure but it may be a chemical burn due to the heat here in California or an allergic reaction</li>
            <li> - I think it smells a little fresher.</li>
            <li> Will test for heavy exercise activity.</li>
            <li> so it is not free of GMOs.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of off and on use,(I don&#x27;t use deodorant everyday....</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this stuff – in a dryer climate, it should just about work the same as any other cruddy, toxic anti-persperant out there.  </li>
            <li> All of the others smell like a weird musty citronella candle and didn&#x27;t work at all or went on lumpy, gritty, and messy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ll have to go back to Dove or Degree or anything that works!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I find that I need to reapply past 10-12 hrs</li>
            <li> I am blown away because it also works better than the horrible chemical deodorants for battling sweat and odor.</li>
            <li> I usually lasts 8 hours.</li>
            <li> I had previously given this product 4 stars but had to take it down to 1 star due to the horrible rash I developed after use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hardly a bargain.</li>
            <li> , yes, it works (though I still have to try it on a hard workout or playing tennis in the sun) but the scent is not as advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it made this coating hard to get used to during the day under a t-shirt or dress-</li>
            <li> I like that there are no harsh or bad ingredients</li>
            <li> and I have never liked baby powder scented deodorants.  </li>
            <li> Not effective.</li>
            <li> I like how it is cooling when applied, but it is not effective throughout the day.</li>
            <li> mint\\&quot; scent has soured...</li>
            <li> cause i can do some serious sweating.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing was the product being damaged during shipping &amp; handling.</li>
            <li> I have known that traditional deodorants I&#x27;ve used were bad for your health (cancer risks, aluminum, chemicals, etc)</li>
            <li> I have tried at least six different brands of deodorants, in an effort to avoid antiperspirants, and they have all disappointed me - this one included.</li>
            <li> I hate giving negative reviews, especially to a company that shares my values/attitudes towards animals and the environment</li>
            <li> Alas, I will be returning to using Dove again...</li>
            <li> usually only wear it to work)I developed a horrible rash on each armpit &#x3D;(.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very disappointed that I can&#x27;t use it, especially after paying $14 for a small tube!</li>
            <li> How weird is that.</li>
            <li> but this is just too disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is very expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an underarm rash before, so I was horrified, as it itched and burned badly.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this deodorant.</li>
            <li> It does the job, however since you aren&#x27;t putting nasty chemicals on your body you will still sweat and need to reapply.</li>
            <li> Holy crap!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Trader Joe&#x27;s (the worst), a roll on mineral, Tom&#x27;s, and Schmidt&#x27;s (burns and gave me bumps).</li>
            <li> and it gave me a horrible rash.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great scent and great product. Best natural deodorant. However, it&#x27;s super expensive for as long as it lasts. A shame.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying non-aluminum deodorants without any luck. Tom&#x27;s didn&#x27;t work; the crystal didn&#x27;t work...I REALLY wanted to embrace Lavanila (vanilla coconut) and would&#x27;ve committed to the expense, had it worked. However, I end up smelling like an old----(whatever-you fill in the blank!)after a very short period of time. I am a kindergarten teacher and only work for a half of the day. Today, I had to come home and shower at noon. I not only stink, I feel wet and clammy, all of the time. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ll have to go back to Dove or Degree or anything that works! Sorry to all those I&#x27;ve offended with my stink, these past few weeks! :)</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Lavanila deodorants.  This review is about the scent not the product.  I have four different scents:  lavender, coconut, blackberry, and lemon.  The coconut smells very strongly (to me) like baby powder and I have never liked baby powder scented deodorants.  What I can say about it is that this is the Lavanila deodorant I use in the mornings when I&#x27;m exercising - the scent lasts throughout the workout and I do not smell like BO at the end.  My favorite scent is Blackberry.  It smells great to me and lasts well.  Lemon smells good but does not last at all! Major BO fest.  Lavender doesn&#x27;t last well either.  SO, in conclusion, my opinion is that Blackberry smells the best and lasts the longest, coconut lasts well but I don&#x27;t like the smell.  Lemon smells great but doesn&#x27;t last.  Lavender doesn&#x27;t last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update 12/23/13*  I have gotten used to the coconut scent and actually like it now.  Blackberry seems not to work as well as coconut so I am  most often turning to coconut.  I do not give 5 stars because it does not help sweating whatsoever and also does not help the smell with stress sweat at functions I attend once or twice a week.  It is great for exercising and around the town.</li>
            <li> irritated my armpits, but thats not why i gave it a 3, this particular scent was kind of gross smelling.</li>
            <li> I love this line, I love the natural ingredients and I love the smell, BUT don&#x27;t expect the deodorant to last longer than a couple of hours (and especially if you are going to work out) because it does not last long and you will have to reapply and reapply...</li>
            <li> I am trying to make sure all of my products are healthy so I just switched to this deodorant. It does the job, however since you aren&#x27;t putting nasty chemicals on your body you will still sweat and need to reapply.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, but it&#x27;s only effective as a deodorant for low stress winter days. I have to switch to an antiperspirant, with all the yucky chemicals, on days when I actually sweat.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work and smelled funky. Not a good substitute for actual deodorant.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this deodorant, but between the smell (does not smell like vanilla and coconut, more like spoiled baby powder) and the terrible rash I developed under both arms after using this for a week, I had to stop using it and will never purchase again. For this price, I expected a lot better.</li>
            <li> I decided that I wasn&#x27;t going to put aluminum and parabens in my body anymore, so I&#x27;m doing the natural deodorant thing. This one didn&#x27;t run the whole  marathon.  I&#x27;d have to re-apply it several times a day to keep the stinkies away.   Even then, I would really have to pile it on. I&#x27;d put it on before I went to bed and then I&#x27;d be a bit odoriferous by morning.   Then we get to the price- 18.00 Dollars!  For one stick that barely lasted  a month!  Holy crap!    I tried the Thai Deodorant Stone and it is working much better so far. Way cheaper and it keeps me odor-free all-day and all-night!</li>
            <li> I really like this deodorant, or at least the smell of it, but, unfortunately, I seem to be allergic to it as I have extreme redness under each arm now. I&#x27;m not sure but it may be a chemical burn due to the heat here in California or an allergic reaction but I&#x27;m disappointed because I really like the scent and wanted something other then the traditional deodorant to use with less chemicals in it, but this hasn&#x27;t worked for me. Alas, I will be returning to using Dove again...</li>
            <li> I had previously given this product 4 stars but had to take it down to 1 star due to the horrible rash I developed after use. The first two days of using Lavanila were fine, and although the product wasn&#x27;t very good at deodorizing, I loved the coconut vanilla scent. I thought I&#x27;d found a decent product but on the third day of use, I developed a bad rash under my arms where I&#x27;d applied the deodorant. I&#x27;ve never had an underarm rash before, so I was horrified, as it itched and burned badly. I stopped using the product and within a day or two, the rash cleared up and my skin was fine. I went back to my old deodorant to see if that too would cause a rash, but as suspected, it did not. So, the Lavanila was definitely the culprit and I&#x27;m very disappointed that I can&#x27;t use it, especially after paying $14 for a small tube!</li>
            <li> The wife asked me to buy a few more, so she must like it.</li>
            <li> Worth the find!  Came as described.  Must unscrew cap to open bottle for use.  Scent came across as strong when I smelled directly from the bottle, but once used, it was far from strong and worked well for moderate activity. Will test for heavy exercise activity. As of now, would purchase again in same or different scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a personal trainer, so I am always in the gym. I sweat a lot, and if I workout between clients, I feel like I stink the rest of the day. This is the first deodorant that does the job. I have tried the vanilla scent and the vanilla coconut scent. I prefer the vanilla coconut - I think it smells a little fresher.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried and by far the best. It also smells kind of powdery. Not overly vanilla at all. Sometimes I find that I need to reapply past 10-12 hrs but it&#x27;s so worth it to finally have a product that keeps me smelling clean without the harm. Update: After using for a month, I can still say this is a good product. However, while it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful aluminum, it does contain corn starch as a main ingredient so it is not free of GMOs. If you want to go truly healthy check out Primal Pit Paste!!</li>
            <li> OVER PRICED!!! Sephora sells it for $14!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, I was hoping for the coconut vanilla scent but all I smell is baby powder.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried many deodorants that are not antiperspirants. I appreciate products that are more natural than processed, yet I also want to smell great in a non-perfumy way. Lavanila vanilla coconut and the vanilla lavender scents are awesome. The scents remind me of summer days on the beach. I don&#x27;t feel as though I&#x27;m clogging my poors with garbage; it&#x27;s super light feeling when applied, even liberally. I very much appreciate that Lavanila gives me appropriate coverage so that when I&#x27;m at work teaching my first graders, I never worry about being stinky; I always smell approachable. I used to be able to wear Tom&#x27;s deodorants successfully, but something happened with my body chemistry after two pregnancies and Tom&#x27;s didn&#x27;t control my stink anymore! Thanks, Lavanila, for stepping up and helping me out. Totally worth the price. One stick lasts me four months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using this for about a week and, like many other reviewers, I found this deodorant only works if I don&#x27;t actually sweat...or move at all...and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t even work if I&#x27;m doing absolutely nothing! Several days I&#x27;ve had to constantly reapply every other hour, and even then it still doesn&#x27;t work. The pleasant smell of the product fades very quickly and doesn&#x27;t deodorize. AND it&#x27;s NOT eligible for a refund so I&#x27;m just out $15. If you&#x27;re trying to switch from a clinical strength aluminum deodorant to a natural one, this probably won&#x27;t work for you, either.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this deodorant. The biggest turn off for me is the smell. It smells nothing close to either vanilla or coconut. I would describe the smell as an overpowering mix of tanning lotion and tangy baby powder smell--heavy and nauseating. For better or worse, the smell does not last long, and neither does its effectiveness to prevent underarm odor.</li>
            <li> The product works incredibly well! The only bad thing was the product being damaged during shipping &amp; handling. Basically it was broken when I opened the container, fortunately as soon I contacted the seller I was refunded the amount I paid for  it and I was also able to keep it. All in all I recommend LAVANILA  The healthy deodorant as well as this pleasant scent vanilla-coconut.</li>
            <li> I was leary about buying this until I saw some of the positive reviews. I put this on after my shower and went to bed. No sweating took place. I turned over in bed and almost threw up! It smelled like moldy, wet socks under my arms. I had to get up and wash off again and put on my regular deodorant. I do not recommend this and wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it since it offers no refunds or returns. Stay away!!!</li>
            <li> Not effective. I like how it is cooling when applied, but it is not effective throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this deodorant. A girl on YouTube raves about it so I bought it. It smells like wintergreen mint... How weird is that. It doesn&#x27;t smell like vanilla or coconut. It really reads and it&#x27;s obnoxiously strong. I&#x27;m not sensitive to smell and would love it if it smelled like vanilla or coconut. It&#x27;s at the point of making me suck and the smell is making me gag.</li>
            <li> I am big on organic and natural products and I have tried multiple natural deodorants in the past without success.  Most smelled awful and didn&#x27;t keep me feeling clean.  I love that this product is natural and doesn&#x27;t stop the body from sweating with chemicals..(Sweating helps gets toxins out of the body) but it does smell AMAZING and keep me fresh feeling with healthy ingredients.  The Vanilla Coconut scent is heavenly!  Smells good enough to eat!  :-)  One other comment, the deodorant seems to last a long time too...ordered back in December and still doesn&#x27;t seem like I have gone through much of the deodorant.  Thanks LaVanila for an awesome natural product!!!</li>
            <li> This deodorant has a very nice smell and works much better than other natural deodorants. A bit pricey, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I like that there are no harsh or bad ingredients but I think I still get smelly. Fine for a stay at home mom but if I went to work I would use something else</li>
            <li> I love this line of deodorants. The scent is wonderful, light, not too overpowering. Conventional antiperspirants/deodorants react strangely with my body chemistry to create strange scents. I have been searching for good natural alternatives and this one is one of my favorites. It doesn&#x27;t combine with sweat and start to smell horrid like some. It is a white stick but doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy white residue at all, especially if you bother to rub it in right after application. It does leave residue on my black clothes if a drag them across it right after application but it is easily removed with water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural deodorant that works for a couple of years. I&#x27;ve tried 5 or 6 brands and this is the first one I&#x27;ve liked! All of the others smell like a weird musty citronella candle and didn&#x27;t work at all or went on lumpy, gritty, and messy. This goes on smooth and creamy, smells great, and keeps me dry at my fast paced job. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents. I heard about this brand months ago but put off trying it because of the price. I completely recommend this over the other highly recommended but lower priced deodorant on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant for everyday use.  It is healthy , light and smells wonderful.  However, I would not choose this if your goal is to use for heavy exercise or work out days if you tend to have more body odor at that time.  This is best used when your day is not being exposed to high heat or overheated.  I would have given it 5 stars if you were able to use this anytime regardless of time or weather.</li>
            <li> It only lasts a couple hours before you have to reapply it. Smells good though! Would probably not buy again.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I originally read about this company. They&#x27;re supposed to be all-natural, animal friendly etc. and that&#x27;s one of the main reason I decided to purchase this item. Let&#x27;s face it--at $58 for 1.7oz it&#x27;s hardly a bargain. The scent is non-existent, i.e. it smells really nice when you open the box and spray it around but once you spray it on your body, the original vanilla scent completely disappears and you&#x27;re left with a mild, barely detectable soapy smell. I hate giving negative reviews, especially to a company that shares my values/attitudes towards animals and the environment but this is just too disappointing. Sigh.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical at first of a deodorant that was natural, but this product really keeps me fresh.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Very unique, refreshing, and makes me feel like I am on a tropical island. Downside is it shows on skin, although it is not too powdery or white if you limit application to a couple of light strokes. Will get on darker clothes too. Does not last as long as store brand deodorants. Great alternative, however, to aluminum-based brands. Great packaging too. If they tweaked the formula a bit, they could totally take on bigger brands.</li>
            <li> This product smells nice and feels cool when you put it on. The container is top quality as well. Very nice experience. And it stays nice UNTIL you sweat. There is no odor protection whatsoever. I have tried at least six different brands of deodorants, in an effort to avoid antiperspirants, and they have all disappointed me - this one included.</li>
            <li> I love the regular Lavanila &amp; the Lavender scent.  This one, however, was not as good.  It didn&#x27;t keep the odor at bay as well and almost seemed more &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; to apply than the other two.  This brand typically needs reapplying for me during the summer (I&#x27;m now using Crystal in the summertime) but I can&#x27;t even wear the Coconut one more than a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prompt shipping and the rest of the transaction were good - product scent left more to be desired.</li>
            <li> 3rd time buying and love it just as much!! Grapefruit is my favorite scent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different natural deodorants, and I&#x27;ve always had the same complaint, that a lot of natural deodorants just don&#x27;t provide effective enough odor protection.  But this one was different.  It smells really, really good, it actually provides effective protection, and it does what a deodorant is supposed to do!  It is a bit pricey for the size, but considering that it actually works, and that it doesn&#x27;t contain the harmful chemicals of other deodorants, I&#x27;d be willing to purchase this again and again.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this stuff works for BO. some of the other scents do not. the coconut works well. the passion fruit is ok. the grapefruit makes me stink like cat pee.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant!  I&#x27;ve finally found an all natural, cruelty-free deodorant that WORKS.  Sometimes I have to reapply once during the day, but that is fine!</li>
            <li> Smells nice but I wish it worked better</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous aluminum free deodorants over the past couple of months to find the best one for me. This was really works the best. I&#x27;ve tried Trader Joe&#x27;s (the worst), a roll on mineral, Tom&#x27;s, and Schmidt&#x27;s (burns and gave me bumps). The Lavanila doesn&#x27;t burn, I don&#x27;t get bumps, the scents are great (I&#x27;ve tried coconut/vanilla and vanilla), the application is smooth and not messy. It wipes on like a regular stick deodorant. It is very white when you first put it on. So you need to rub your armpits together until the white goes away if you plan on wearing a sleeveless shirt. Once the white is rubbed around, I have found that I can even wear a black sleeveless without it marking. My search is over and I am sticking with this one. It is very expensive I think though, with aluminum deodorants only being a few bucks, but worth it to not put aluminum into your system. Hence the 4 stars on the high price. I&#x27;d like to see a men&#x27;s version with a manly smell, for the guys.</li>
            <li> The only deodorant I use.</li>
            <li> Although the smell is wonderful, it leaves your armpits feeling &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;. Odor protection is good, but feeling is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had luck with natural deodorants before, but this one does the trick. I wanted to stop using antiperspirant every day (because of the aluminum, as well as the parabens and other nasty stuff in most products) and decided to give this a try, based on the positive reviews. It goes on smoothly, does not stain clothes, and keeps me fresh, even on the hottest days. Of course, it doesn&#x27;t stop perspiration, and it isn&#x27;t designed to; but it does prevent odor. The only negative for me is that the vanilla-coconut fragrance is fairly strong when this is first applied -- which can fight with other fragrances, if you wear them -- but this generally subsides after a while. I also wish that it were available in a smaller travel size. But all in all, I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Finally a deodorant that works!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found.  I previously tried Tom&#x27;s (didn&#x27;t prevent odor) and Crystal (took forever to dry and didn&#x27;t like the smell) before trying Lavanila.  I originally tried the regular vanilla scent, but I find that the vanilla coconut works much better/longer to prevent odor and has a fresher/less sweet scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many deodorants and this one absolutely has worked the best for me! It&#x27;s challenging to find a product that doesn&#x27;t have adverse ingredients and is effective.</li>
            <li> Of course it doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as the unhealthy stuff, but this is truly the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found. I love the smell too - I could smell it all day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the fence with this deodorant. On one hand you have a natural product, on the other it&#x27;s scent is not quite vanilla-coconut and it leaves an odd cooling sensation. I have another LAVANILLA deodorant in vanilla-lavender and it does not have the cooling sensation. I can see how some people might like that and perhaps in the summer it would be an added bonus. I suppose the 2-star rating is based on the scent though. It&#x27;s just not what I expected and isn&#x27;t even like the perfume. As far as lasting power goes it&#x27;s pretty good. I wouldn&#x27;t use it if you are a heavy sweater or for exercise, but it works pretty well if you don&#x27;t sweat much or are just lounging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited with this deodorant! It smell so good and it last all day. I don&#x27;t think I will be able to use any other brand. Love it!!</li>
            <li> While this smells nice, it does not work the same as the Pure Vanilla fragranced one. I&#x27;m unsure if there is enough of a difference in the ingredients , but the Pure Vanilla worked much better at concealing any odor . I&#x27;m not typically a smelly sweater , but with the Coconut , I stink after 1 hour!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and timely delivery! Thank you!</li>
            <li> the smell is nice, I do not think it is as strong as regular deodorant - I am using it together with &amp;#34;certain&amp;#34; and it seems to work like that.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best ever!!!  You will love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have dealt with underarm irritation since I&#x27;ve been shaving...for almost 20 years! I&#x27;ve been so self conscious about it. But that&#x27;s not why I tried Lavanila. I bought it because I wanted to try something more natural with the hopes it would actually work against body odor and sweating. I have known that traditional deodorants I&#x27;ve used were bad for your health (cancer risks, aluminum, chemicals, etc) so let me clarify that is why I tried this product in the first place. Plus the vanilla coconut scent sounded interesting. Never in my wildest dreams did I ever consider that the red bumps under my arms from shaving were caused by the deodorant I used but I&#x27;m telling you now that since I&#x27;ve used this product I have had ZERO red bumps or irritation post shaving. I am blown away because it also works better than the horrible chemical deodorants for battling sweat and odor. I think this type of product, like all, work differently for everyone (thus the mixed reviews) but I can tell you I am not paid but have use this for 2 weeks and can say that as someone with sensitive skin, this product not only smells amazing, CURED my underarm irritation and really works as a deodorant.  It&#x27;s worth a try if you have dealt with underarm irritation from drug store deodorants.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this deodorant!!! I have tried EVERY natural deoderant and this is the only one that works all day. I am an avid runner and do crossfit 4 days a week so I really put this deoderant to the test!</li>
            <li> This product smells great. But you will need to reapply it. It helps with wetness, but with older not as much. I suppose it depends how much you sweat, but I think I&#x27;m fairly average. For me, it is better than all of the mercury filled toxic under arm deodorant&#x27;s on the market that clog your pores and not let your body perspire naturally</li>
            <li> This product does work but it doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut at all. It has more of a powdery smell to it.</li>
            <li> The Holy Grail of natural deodorants. I&#x27;ve used everything. Tom&#x27;s made me smell like a pungent skunk by lunch. The crystal made my pits peel, obviously super attractive. The only natural deodorant that comes close to the effectiveness of this one is Kiss My Face, which I have to reapply mid-day. La Vanila works all day long, all day strong. Smells great.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to try the coconut (I love coconut everything) for a while &amp; finally found it here on Prime, got it... it doesn&#x27;t smell much like coconut.... it does still smell very fresh &amp; wonderful though. I love all of LaVanila&#x27;s products, this one didn&#x27;t fall short.</li>
            <li> As far as natural deodorants go this one is pretty good. It smells a little strange, but okay. I usually lasts 8 hours.</li>
            <li> The only natural deodorant that works! I&#x27;ve tried several other natural deodorant brands and this one is the only one that last all day and I workout 5 days a week! Get it NOW!!</li>
            <li> smelled old I threw it out</li>
            <li> does not smell at all how i anticipated vanilla coconut to smell, guess I&#x27;m used to more artificial smells.  I have been told it smells like an old man lol but as a breastfeeding mom I am just happy that it &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; for the better part of the day without extra dangerous ingredients.</li>
            <li> My favorite product of Lavanila. Super pricey, though. Consider lowering the cost.</li>
            <li> Dries after one use and starts feeling like dry paper after therefore can not be used again. I tried rubbing it on my skin harden to get it to work through the dry surface and it gave me a horrible rash. I thought maybe the cap is defective and ordered another one but same thing happened! The only ones that don&#x27;t dry out are the travel size versions.</li>
            <li> Did not work for odor.</li>
            <li> the only natural deodorant that works on me..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural deodorant that actually works. All day would be nice, too. So I went to the gym today, wearing this in Vanilla Cocoanut (cocoanut is my fave scent) and did a moderate workout--not my hardest but hard enough that other deodorants have failed (looking at you, Tom&#x27;s and Jason!).&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant actually seemed to work. No sweat smell but I DID smell the deodorant. If it smelled like vanilla and cocoanut I would have been happy. But it really just smells like baby powder to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After showering post gym, I reapplied it and it&#x27;s still working, hours later, but again--the baby powder smell. Yuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try another scent, something stronger like grapefruit or lemon to see if it makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yes, it works (though I still have to try it on a hard workout or playing tennis in the sun) but the scent is not as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Why can&#x27;t they make unscented??</li>
            <li> its lightly scented, yes, but overall does not work well.  By the end of the day I end up smelling like B.O.  I prefer to use Toms, which lasts longer and keeps me smelling NOT like B.O.</li>
            <li> which may sound funny but that is my trend with most deodorants. i have not worn deodorant for so long because of that so it made this coating hard to get used to during the day under a t-shirt or dress- now i use it just before bed cause i can do some serious sweating. can&#x27;t say it works under these circumstances, but nothing really does for me so no big surprise- but it is nice to be able to put something on &amp; not have it clash with my body chemistry to the point of smelling more putrid than just regular ole b.o. ~smell is fresh &amp; pleasing, but i am not usually come morning. given the expensiveness of the product i will probably save my money in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this scent!! I was really wanting to stop using antiperspirant because of the unhealthy ingredients. So I decided to splurge on a good deodorant. This is pricey but it smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my clothes and I like that it&#x27;s a naturally based product. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as my old antiperspirant but I did start using it during the hottest time of the year.</li>
            <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t require a lot and it lasts all day. I can get six weeks out of it no problem. My only problem is the price. It&#x27;s just too much.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for the best natural deodorant, and I&#x27;ve found it.  I have a drawer full of half-used deodorant sticks that simply haven&#x27;t made the cut, including ones that were made for men!  There&#x27;s nothing worse than doing a mid-afternoon pit check to find your previously pleasant \\&quot;lemongrass and mountain mint\\&quot; scent has soured...Shudder!  I have found The One with Lavanila.  Even though it may be expensive in comparison to most ordinary deodorants, it is worth the money to have peace of mind about the way you feel and smell.  There are no parabens, sulfates, aluminum, or propylene glycol and that&#x27;s important for your health.  The scent is long-lasting, and I&#x27;ve had no problem wearing it during the middle of a hot, humid summer.  It doesn&#x27;t wear off by noon, and the smell is soft, and powdery so it won&#x27;t offend your co-workers or your loved ones.  I have had no adverse skin reactions while using this for a month now, and I have sensitive skin.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome healthy deodorant.  I live in a foreign, humid tropical climate where blocking sweat with anti-persperants every day is considered just unhealthy.  Everybody has a lil damp under their pits, it&#x27;s accepted in society to stay healthy and allow the body to perspire - smell is the enemy, not dampness.  America isn&#x27;t quite on-board with this concept, but this puts us one step closer! I swear I stay dryer than traditional non-aluminum deodorants with this brand.  I still sweat though, but I never Ever smell a thing with this stuff.  I&#x27;m fresh as a coconut-vanilla daisy.  Highly recommend this stuff – in a dryer climate, it should just about work the same as any other cruddy, toxic anti-persperant out there.  But you&#x27;ll always smell delish!</li>
            <li> Smells great, but didn&#x27;t work great at all! I applied in the morning and reapplied in the afternoon. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a natural deodorant that would work and not break my sensitive skin out.  I thought I had found it.  My friend raved about it.  It doesn&#x27;t have a coconut scent at all.  It&#x27;s more of a powdery old perfume type smell.  It&#x27;s not awful, just not what I expected.  After two weeks of off and on use,(I don&#x27;t use deodorant everyday....usually only wear it to work)I developed a horrible rash on each armpit &#x3D;(.  I wasn&#x27;t slathering it on either.  As soon as I stopped using it, the rash started to resolve.  As far as odor control, it worked wonderfully.</li>
