    <ol>
            <li> I love this product, because it is a great size for carrying in your bag big or small. I would recommend it to friends and co workers.</li>
            <li> Received product in just about 4 days. Everything included. Will definately be using you for future purchases. I love that I received my item so quick!</li>
            <li> I love my herbalife shaker! I&#x27;m glad I purchase it and I am totally satisfied!</li>
            <li> It has already been 5 days. I can not track it (I don&#x27;t know why).  It just says \\&quot;transit\\&quot;. All my other herbalife things have come except for this.  WIll write another review when it comes.  *** It came.  I was supposed to get: 1 HERBALIFE SHAKER CUP,1 HERBALIFE TAPE MEASURE,1 HERBALIFE SCOOPER SPOON,1 SMALLTABLET BOX  I only got a shaker cup. I did not get a tape measure, scooper spoon, or a tablet box. will sue.</li>
            <li> great cup for the use, cant figure out the stirrer inside though...</li>
            <li> WOW REALLY?!?!?!? THESE CUPS ARE $$ 2.97 $$ on the WEBSITE!!! I love love love these cups. I get one everytime I order... ON THE WEBSITE, They are almost triple here... $8?!?!?! SERIOUSLY??!?!?!?! How much profit do you people need to make???</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the product. I use it for my Herbalife formula 1 shakes that I mix without fruit and vegetables. This is just a shaker cup so remember that. The quality and performance of the cup was above my expectations. I received my product within a couple of days of ordering it. :-)  I highly recommend both the product and the seller. Thank you. I hope this review is helpful.</li>
            <li> THESE ARE ONLY 4 DOLLARS AT THE HERBALIFE CAFÉS... THEY ARE CHARGING ALMOST DOUBLE... DONT GET ME WRONG, THEY ARE GREAT CUPS, I OWN 9... BUT THEY ARE 4$</li>
            <li> The cap doesn&#x27;t even screw on correctly so you end up with shake or whatever you decide to put in all over you. Don&#x27;t buy! Clearly very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The bottle is sturdy and I expect it to last a long while. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone wanting to have their shake on the go. The closure to the top seals very good once closed.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! I Take It EVERYWHERE! When I&#x27;m In A Rush In The Morning To Get To Class Or Work .. Its Always There &amp; Helpful, It&#x27;s My New BestFriend !!! :))))</li>
            <li> Shake Shaker arrived on time, no problems.</li>
            <li> It dose not work for the protein drinks, only works well for the tea. Looks cheap. The shaker cup with the metal ball available at target works much better.</li>
            <li> I got this cup at a Herbalife club and it was only $3!!!! This is waaayyy too expensive. Look for other resources.</li>
            <li> Love my shaker bottle. Perfect for on the go</li>
            <li> Use it daily. No problems.</li>
            <li> I love Herbalife products!</li>
            <li> cup is all that and some it doesnt leak or anything its just what i needed for my shakes easy on the go</li>
            <li> i would recommend anyone to buy this product, But its leaks when you mixing the product. It is easy to wash good for traveling.</li>
            <li> Are you serious???  $5 hahaha I give them away for being a client...your upcharging like crazy</li>
            <li> The cup I order came in handy. Don&#x27;t have to search through my cabinets for a measuring cup. My kids even use it for everything. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please with this item! When I&#x27;m in a hurry I can add my shake contents grab it and go! This allows me to stay on track with the HL plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LadyMidd</li>
            <li> It seals completely and does a great job.  You can either put ice in it and strain it through the cup or do like I do and just shake it up with cold water.  I would highly recomend this shaker.</li>
            <li> Nice shaker for all supplements</li>
            <li> I just put the water, or milk, in the shacker and the mix and shake it. It&#x27;s easier to clean then my blender and doesn&#x27;t require any electricity. The measuring numbers on the side could be a little more visible but it works great.</li>
            <li> I ordered this so I didn&#x27;t have to pull out my blender all of the time and, gasp, clean it. This works great, and although I still use the blender from time to time to make it more of a shake texture, it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Made of thin delicate plastic, doesn&#x27;t help mix items at all. Got the Blender Bottle instead and I am much happier.</li>
            <li> does not mix the powder very well, so my drinks were always chunky.</li>
            <li> The shakes taste like butt. I would not recommend them to any one. I do like that you do not have to be in the pyramid scheme to try it though through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works great as a cup. Doesn&#x27;t do well as a shaker though. Big clumps of powder that won&#x27;t blend and the cap comes loose of not holding it secure while shaking.</li>
            <li> Top doesn&#x27;t snap on well...made a few messes in my kitchen</li>
            <li> amazing!!!! love this blends everything quickly</li>
            <li> The shaker is very quick and easy! I use it everyday when I don&#x27;t have time for blending my shakes!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for the speedy send out of this item, I was able to start my healthy regiment right away. The cup mixes the formula with ease. Keep up the good work........</li>
            <li> Great for on the go! Love the herbalife products! I can make my shakes at home and take em. Or make the shakes while I&#x27;m working or driving around</li>
            <li> I use this cup everyday looks the same exact. Only thing is it doesn&#x27;t like to close properly I must push it down in order for it to close.</li>
            <li> It works like a charm.  I love it.  I highly recomend this one as well.  Great value.  I use it everyday.</li>
