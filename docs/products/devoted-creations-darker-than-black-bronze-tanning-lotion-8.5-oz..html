    <ol>
            <li>Gave me the color that I wanted and smells great too..</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t smell that great after tanning..</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t smell too good after you tan..</li>
            <li>I am a fair skinned guy who never tans in the sun&lt;br /&gt;unless</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells good and rubs in good.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, too, which is always nice to find in a tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>just make sure you rub it in good..</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this lotion! :)</li>
            <li>So ive tried plenty of bronzers before and this by far has to be one of the best.</li>
            <li>All in all a great first time lotion.</li>
            <li>it shipped fast, wish was great.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>but Ive used WAY better..</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>i absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>the more you use it.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with others that didn&#x27;t have the bronzer.</li>
            <li>This lotion also smells nice and the bottle is pretty cool itself.</li>
            <li>Great for the skin and gets you dark quick!</li>
            <li>If you want a nice bronze tan that looks natural with a glow, then I recommend this lotion for you.</li>
            <li>the only thing is make sure you wash your hands after tanning cause the palms of my hands had a orange tint to them, but after a wash my hands it was fine.</li>
            <li>I work at a Tanning Bed Company and this is by far my Favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>I do recommend washing your hands right after as&lt;br /&gt;in between my fingers</li>
            <li>Had I known that it would have tanned me super fast</li>
            <li>not as effective as white to black but does have a much better scent</li>
            <li>I think it mostly depends on how long you tan, what lotion you use, where you tan, and what level bed you tan in.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tan super easily when I first start out each year, but I saw color within the first few times I started using this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty dark and my skin is very smooth.</li>
            <li>And said it works really well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get much darker with this one.</li>
            <li>what decent bronzer doesn&#x27;t..</li>
            <li>You get a really golden/brown color from tanning with this lotion and it seems to build lasting color</li>
            <li>I really like this tanning product, I have used the black and white tanning lotion, which is similar.</li>

            <li> Streaks really bad!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this lotion! :)</li>
            <li> I really like this tanning product, I have used the black and white tanning lotion, which is similar. Gave me the color that I wanted and smells great too.. just make sure you rub it in good..</li>
            <li> not as effective as white to black but does have a much better scent</li>
            <li> the salon i tan has this, but wanted double for it. And said it works really well. So decided to order it here. it shipped fast, wish was great. I started using it, and by the third time i noticed I was definitely getting darker. the only thing is make sure you wash your hands after tanning cause the palms of my hands had a orange tint to them, but after a wash my hands it was fine. it doesn&#x27;t smell that great after tanning..so shower a few hours afterward. But if you want to get dark/darker I would get this. love it.</li>
            <li> This lotion didn&#x27;t make me any darker than any ordinary tanning lotion and it left me all streaky on my arms and in between my fingers i look like i have Vitiligo and it doesn&#x27;t smell too good after you tan..Ive used worse which is why i gave it a 3 but Ive used WAY better.. don&#x27;t waste your time..</li>
            <li> I have not tanned at a tanning salon in 4 years! I just went and signed up last week to start again&lt;br /&gt;since I have a lot of outdoor activities to do this summer. I am a fair skinned guy who never tans in the sun&lt;br /&gt;unless I already have a tan beforehand. (hence why Im tanning) I went and laid in a level 4 bed for 5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;and after a couple of hours I started to see a little color change. The next day I went for 6 min and then day 3 I went for 7 min.&lt;br /&gt;After that 3rd tanning session I am pretty dark and my skin is very smooth. I do recommend washing your hands right after as&lt;br /&gt;in between my fingers are a little discolored. (brown streaks) This lotion also smells nice and the bottle is pretty cool itself. I ordered off of amazon because the salon wanted almost 70 bucks for theirs. It came within 3 days as told. Had I known that it would have tanned me super fast I would have ordered it along time ago. If you want a nice bronze tan that looks natural with a glow, then I recommend this lotion for you. Choosing tanning lotions is a picky process for me especially since my skin is so fair.&lt;br /&gt;I am already wanting another Devoted Creations lotion. Hope this helps you. Keep in mind that everyone is different and lotions can do different things to everyone. I think it mostly depends on how long you tan, what lotion you use, where you tan, and what level bed you tan in. All in all a great first time lotion.</li>
            <li> I like this tanning lotion, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to get me as dark as the SMOKE lotion I used before this one.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good and rubs in good.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion.  I don&#x27;t tan super easily when I first start out each year, but I saw color within the first few times I started using this lotion.  I also have eczema, so I have to be very careful in regard to what lotions I use because I might have a reaction.  I haven&#x27;t had any sort of reaction to this lotion, just color.  It has a pleasant smell, too, which is always nice to find in a tanning lotion.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this stuff. gets you dark without the streaks. It is a miracle lotion. I even put it on when I lay out by the pool sometimes. Works just the same to me.</li>
            <li> So ive tried plenty of bronzers before and this by far has to be one of the best. You get a really golden/brown color from tanning with this lotion and it seems to build lasting color the more you use it. Yes it does streak but what decent bronzer doesn&#x27;t..</li>
            <li> I work at a Tanning Bed Company and this is by far my Favorite lotion. Great for the skin and gets you dark quick!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. Been using since last year. If I miss a few days of tanning and then use this when I go back my tan comes back instantly.</li>
            <li> Great product. I am about to order my next bottle.</li>
            <li> Stink! Stains clothes. And washes off instantly.</li>
            <li> Works ok. I&#x27;ve had better luck with others that didn&#x27;t have the bronzer. I didn&#x27;t get much darker with this one.</li>
