            <li>I already notice some changes for the better!</li>

            <li>The taster of this product is good and it mixes really easy with water.</li>
            <li>AND, as far as I know, this is best value for the amount of tocotrienols you get in a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the taste isn&#x27;t too strong and you can add it to any beverage without it being overpowering A+ in my book!</li>
            <li>Fine baby hairs started popping up all over my head!</li>

            <li>Eric is a great guy, always answering every question in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>That is until I found Botanical Craft Palm Fruit, and fell in love with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For many years I&#x27;ve taken some form of this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed better skin, skin tone and no signs of aging.</li>
            <li>I tend to stick with what works so after so many years still taking this speaks volumes.</li>
            <li>Love this product, and the difference I&#x27;ve seen in my hair and skin.  </li>
            <li>I started to use Palm Fruit more than 6 months</li>
            <li>I have better luck this way, over a liquid.</li>
            <li>and I am way more resistant to burning in the sun.  </li>
            <li>I believe my hair and skin feel softer, but I need more time to decide on that.  </li>
            <li>and I had great success with his original Toco-8.</li>
            <li>As for my skin, I used to go in the sun and burn within 30 minutes (I&#x27;m pretty fair)</li>
            <li>it (like I do) with a good vitamin, fish oil, lecithin, good fat, and your joint support stuff, and you&#x27;ll feel like it only helps the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe in whole food nutrition, and how much more superior it is to synthetic versions.  </li>
            <li>I have used both Palm Fruit and the old Toco-8 products and have been happy with the quality and results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed the Palm Fruit for 2 full months now, and plan to continue to use this supplement.  </li>
            <li>It tastes fine but sticks to my teeth sometimes.</li>
            <li>I have been using Palm Fruit for over six months now and have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>and once available</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty much satisfied with that.  </li>
            <li>I am fimiliar with the owner of the company and the past products he has been a part of and they have always been of the best quality&lt;br</li>
            <li>The old Toco-8 and a rival brands gel capsule based product just weren&#x27;t as effective as this.&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li>The science is there, to prove the ingredients, its quick easy, tastes GREAT, mixes VERY well into anything and the difference is noticeable, since have turned a few people onto the product and feedback is directly in line with mine, people love it, and more people need to know about it!</li>
            <li>The main things I am hoping to gain from this product is that I believe it will help men keep a good supply of testosterone by the effects it has on, I believe it is the leydig cells, also I am hoping to see new hair growth, and I also expect it to clean my veins and arteries of plaque and keep them clean.  </li>
            <li>Since using Palm Fruit by Botanical craft, Ive noticed HUGE changes in my skin health, better energy, and honestly feel like it has boosted my cardio a little too!&lt;br /&gt;Being am athlete</li>
            <li>This is a great product that you will not only see the difference in how your skin and hair looks , I have had some new hair growth</li>
            <li>It tastes amazing since I am on a low carb diet.</li>
            <li>It is living up to what it said it would do, from healthier skin, better hair(I&#x27;m not greying as fast as I did) to better cardio results and my next test will be testing my cholesterol</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re golden.</li>
            <li>I am specially satisfied with professional approach and customer care from BC team (Mr. Potratz).</li>
            <li>This supplement (palm fruit extract) is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Taking Palm fruit I have noticed everything from a new found brightness in the white part of my eyes, thicker more full hair, improved blood work now wether that is from the palm fruit or my better diet habits</li>
            <li>I find that it actually dissolves quite nicely with  just a straight spoonful of it and chasing with water.</li>
            <li>Straight forward and always giving advise that helps!</li>
            <li>This is most definitely NOT some &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; supplement.</li>
            <li>With all the supplements out there that do nothing  but empty your wallet its nice to find one that delivers on it promises</li>
            <li>First visible results on hair growth appeared after 3 months.</li>
            <li>I am going to make sure I always have this on hand and would recommend this to anyone especially if you are losing any hair.</li>
            <li>I thought for sure when I walked inside and showered I would feel the burn, but amazingly enough, I didn&#x27;t burn!</li>
            <li>Now we just need liver juice 2.0 ;)</li>
            <li>The effects of BCPF are evident in all the positive changes in my body since I began taking it.</li>
            <li>After a lot of research on how to boost health in natural ways and discover the importance of nutrients in the body, I came across this unique product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if everyone will experience this type of reaction, but it really makes me wonder how else this amazing fruit is benefiting my body in ways I cannot see!</li>
            <li>I found a lot less hair shedding in the shower and myself having to clip my nails more frequently..even the pinky that was smashed in between two light posts seemed to heal rather quickly after it was blacked out and nearly fell off during the accident.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I believe that this product is not only a good solid eel made product</li>
            <li>I will be testing my cholesterol to see the positive effects the tocotrienols have on my heart!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product, as I am a firm believer in “whole food” vitamins, as opposed to synthetics.</li>
            <li>I will certainly continue to use Palm Fruit, and recommend BC to others.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I also think with long term use it can play a significant role in better overall health</li>
            <li>This is a very revitalizing product.</li>
            <li>The palm fruit, along with another product, Biosil, have really helped me with my hair thinning issues.</li>
            <li>The product blends really well with the apple sauce.</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t just sell supplements to make money, he genuinely wants to make people healthier.  </li>
            <li>Fast forward</li>
            <li>I also like to add raw cinnamon, since cinnamon has many health benefits too!</li>
            <li>The immediate effects is a boost in libido, immune system, and there are plenty of science verified positive effects in the body specially the antioxidant activity in internal organs.</li>
            <li>This is THE REAL THING: RAW, NATURAL, and POTENT!</li>
            <li>The taste is great and it gives me a little mental boost.</li>
            <li>After being a loyal consumer of the previous line-up and knowing this company&#x27;s legacy, I was extremely excited to try out this new product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I switched over from some other product that was more expensive and never worked.</li>
            <li>I have only been taking it for a couple months now and my hair and skin are looking extra healthy.</li>
            <li>This will increase your blood flow and reduce  the risk of high blood pressure and lower your risks of a heart attacking.</li>
            <li>If you believe in a healthy life style this should be part of your everyday diet.</li>
            <li>My hair has started growing back and does not look as thin anymore, my skin is looking better and I have had more energy.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m even beginning to see new hair growth on the crown of my head.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed new hair growth yet, but it is still too early to expect that.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps my next blood test will show some positive changes.</li>
            <li>I used to use the old Toco-8</li>
            <li>I know that subjective bit of information doesn&#x27;t help, but this is something you can&#x27;t really tell the benefits of unless you can check your blood daily.  </li>
            <li>I am in no way, shape, or form old. .</li>
            <li>BC Palm Fruit is now a vital staple in my regime.</li>
            <li>Upon my request, they considerably reduced shipment fee to Cyprus.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had this type of resistance to the sun since I was a child of about 10 years old vacationing in Florida without sunscreen.</li>
            <li>After reading several of his writings he really knows what he is talking about.  </li>
            <li>I originally used the products for the artery cleansing antioxidants, but not long after beginning use a co-worker asked if I had been using Rogaine or other hair regrowth product.  </li>
            <li>I mix it with my fruit smoothies, protein shakes, or even mix it in a shot glass with water and down it for a quick boost.</li>
            <li>I started by using Toco-8 and was in love with this product when I heard that the company had closed down</li>
            <li>After several months of taking this product, I noticed new hair growth.</li>
            <li>I have also used Coconut Oil to cook with primarily for the last few years as well, and supplement with cinnamon, Vitamin D and K2.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no other way to describe that.  </li>
            <li>I also understand it is very helpful keeping your skin healthy from the inside, which should mean less wrinkles healthier looking skin.   </li>
            <li>and I just take this product for general health reasons.  </li>
            <li>First I will say that any product that involves Eric Potratz is going to be top of the line and cutting edge.</li>
            <li>nothing major but its a start and only on my 3rd bottle</li>
            <li>My hair grows much quicker - I even have to get my roots touched up every month and a half vs before at 2-3 months.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now. I already notice some changes for the better! I&#x27;m happy I switched over from some other product that was more expensive and never worked. That company was much more difficult to deal with too. Botanical Craft had excellent customer service with employees that a</li>
            <li> I have used both Palm Fruit and the old Toco-8 products and have been happy with the quality and results.  I originally used the products for the artery cleansing antioxidants, but not long after beginning use a co-worker asked if I had been using Rogaine or other hair regrowth product.  I would recommend Palm Fruit for anyone looking to increase their intake of antioxidants and regrow hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for keeping a balanced lipid profile and lower BP - in my opinion, based on my results.  I stopped using this product for a year and both indicators climbed.  2 months after restarting I&#x27;m dead-center in the range of values for good health.</li>
            <li> Good quality stuff.  I used to use the old Toco-8 and this is a very similar product from the same people (long story behind that).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s probably the best and most concentrated Tocotrienol product on the market today and at this kind of price point, undoubtedly the one you should get if you wish to try it.&lt;br /&gt;I just plain feel healthier on it.  There&#x27;s no other way to describe that.  I know that subjective bit of information doesn&#x27;t help, but this is something you can&#x27;t really tell the benefits of unless you can check your blood daily.  Strangely, I have noticed the hair thickening effect of this stuff (not just on the head).  So that does tell me it&#x27;s doing something and I&#x27;m pretty much satisfied with that.  The old Toco-8 and a rival brands gel capsule based product just weren&#x27;t as effective as this.&lt;br /&gt;Take it (like I do) with a good vitamin, fish oil, lecithin, good fat, and your joint support stuff, and you&#x27;ll feel like it only helps the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If heart health and hair are on your list of concerns (I know it is on mine), you can&#x27;t really do much better than taking this.</li>
            <li> Have been a fan of the company before when they made Primordial performance products. This has the same quality I expected from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily I take one or two scoops with water. The taste is great and it gives me a little mental boost.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for close to 6 months now.  I started taking because my receding hairline needed attention.  I find that it actually dissolves quite nicely with  just a straight spoonful of it and chasing with water. nothing too spectacular tasting but not too chalky or cakey either.  I didn&#x27;t start noticing any effects on hair and nails until around month 3..I found a lot less hair shedding in the shower and myself having to clip my nails more frequently..even the pinky that was smashed in between two light posts seemed to heal rather quickly after it was blacked out and nearly fell off during the accident.  Buy with confidence!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on Palm fruit since May 2015. I&#x27;ve not missed a day and at times I&#x27;ve taken it twice a day. The results have really impressed me. It is living up to what it said it would do, from healthier skin, better hair(I&#x27;m not greying as fast as I did) to better cardio results and my next test will be testing my cholesterol which was 230 5 months ago, I get tested next month. Eric is a great guy, always answering every question in a very timely manner. I&#x27;ve dealt with Eric when he worked for a supplement company a few years back. Straight forward and always giving advise that helps!</li>
            <li> Best value there is for the amount of tocotrienols you get in each serving. I bought the monthly subscription and I&#x27;ve been taking this for four months now. I do Paintless Dent Repair, and I&#x27;m out in the sun a lot walking around on car lots. I haven&#x27;t gotten a sunburn once since starting this product. It is great for skin, hair, and anti-aging, it is great for your heart, your brain, your liver, and your immune system. I think I&#x27;m even beginning to see new hair growth on the crown of my head. I just wish this product was around 25 years ago...If it had been, I might not be half bald.</li>
            <li> I started by using Toco-8 and was in love with this product when I heard that the company had closed down I was devastated. I did a lot of research to find a similar product and just didn&#x27;t feel like any other products were on par with Toco-8. That is until I found Botanical Craft Palm Fruit, and fell in love with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you a little information about myself, I am 30 years old and have always been scared to age. I am in no way, shape, or form old. . I train everyday, 7 days a week, doing 30 minutes cardio before breakfast every morning and weights at night. I follow a strict diet and sleep 8 hours a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s 6 months now that I have added Botanical Craft Palm Fruit in my diet every morning after my cardio session, and definitely can feel a difference. My hair, skin, and complexion has improved drastically!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a boost in their everyday lives!</li>
            <li> After being a loyal consumer of the previous line-up and knowing this company&#x27;s legacy, I was extremely excited to try out this new product. This is most definitely NOT some &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; supplement. This is THE REAL THING: RAW, NATURAL, and POTENT! BC Palm Fruit is now a vital staple in my regime. The effects of BCPF are evident in all the positive changes in my body since I began taking it. My skin is smoother, my hair is thicker, and my stamina has gone up. I mix it with my fruit smoothies, protein shakes, or even mix it in a shot glass with water and down it for a quick boost. Pair this with some fish oil and you&#x27;re golden. Eric is a mad genius formulator. BC, thank you for a superior product! -Sgt. Johnny Garcia, USMC</li>
            <li> 1) Why did you choose Palm Fruit? I am fimiliar with the owner of the company and the past products he has been a part of and they have always been of the best quality&lt;br /&gt;2) What effects have you noticed? Taking Palm fruit I have noticed everything from a new found brightness in the white part of my eyes, thicker more full hair, improved blood work now wether that is from the palm fruit or my better diet habits I could not definitively say but I am sure it was a part of it !&lt;br /&gt;3) What other products do you use with Palm Fruit? I also use a green vege powder , antioxidant blend multi vit and min , protein powder&lt;br /&gt;Overall I believe that this product is not only a good solid eel made product but I also think with long term use it can play a significant role in better overall health&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the good work Eric</li>
            <li> For many years I&#x27;ve taken some form of this product. This product started out called Toco-8  and once available I began using Botanical Craft&#x27;s Palm Fruit Extract since the developer of the product is very reputable and I had great success with his original Toco-8. I&#x27;ve noticed better skin, skin tone and no signs of aging. Also it seems my immunity has improved quite a bit since I haven&#x27;t missed a day of work in 5 years. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t speak on the hairline benefits as I&#x27;ve always shaved my head and I just take this product for general health reasons.  I usually will take this straight with just water. I have also used Coconut Oil to cook with primarily for the last few years as well, and supplement with cinnamon, Vitamin D and K2. I tend to stick with what works so after so many years still taking this speaks volumes.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that you will not only see the difference in how your skin and hair looks , I have had some new hair growth nothing major but its a start and only on my 3rd bottle but you will also feel the results as it has help with my blood pressure and overall lipid profile. With all the supplements out there that do nothing  but empty your wallet its nice to find one that delivers on it promises</li>
            <li> Love this product, and the difference I&#x27;ve seen in my hair and skin.  My hair grows much quicker - I even have to get my roots touched up every month and a half vs before at 2-3 months.  As for my skin, I used to go in the sun and burn within 30 minutes (I&#x27;m pretty fair) but now I can be outside with no issue. Only objection I&#x27;ve had is that I had a hard time finding things I could mix it with (I don&#x27;t eat yogurt or smoothies) so I just dump a scoop in my mouth and drink it down with water. It tastes fine but sticks to my teeth sometimes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed the Palm Fruit for 2 full months now, and plan to continue to use this supplement.  I believe in whole food nutrition, and how much more superior it is to synthetic versions.  There&#x27;s a great deal of good research on the tocotrienols for good health as well as caratenoids.  Plus, the powder tastes great and it&#x27;s a simple addition to my nutrition regimen.</li>
            <li> First I will say that any product that involves Eric Potratz is going to be top of the line and cutting edge. This product is fantastic.  started using this product because it has been proven to reduce the build up in the arteries. This will increase your blood flow and reduce  the risk of high blood pressure and lower your risks of a heart attacking. If you believe in a healthy life style this should be part of your everyday diet. BUY IT!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very revitalizing product. I&#x27;ve been taking it for a months now as directed from my dietitian and it has made a world of difference in my health. the taste isn&#x27;t too strong and you can add it to any beverage without it being overpowering A+ in my book! well done Palm Fruit.</li>
            <li> Since using Palm Fruit by Botanical craft, Ive noticed HUGE changes in my skin health, better energy, and honestly feel like it has boosted my cardio a little too!&lt;br /&gt;Being am athlete I feel something like this is absolutely essential to well being and performance. The science is there, to prove the ingredients, its quick easy, tastes GREAT, mixes VERY well into anything and the difference is noticeable, since have turned a few people onto the product and feedback is directly in line with mine, people love it, and more people need to know about it!</li>
            <li> I started to use Palm Fruit more than 6 months and I am very satisfied with product and service from Botanical Craft. First visible results on hair growth appeared after 3 months. I am specially satisfied with professional approach and customer care from BC team (Mr. Potratz). Upon my request, they considerably reduced shipment fee to Cyprus. I will certainly continue to use Palm Fruit, and recommend BC to others.&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Zoran Ratkovic</li>
            <li> I have been using Botanical Craft palm fruit for about a year and a half. (I was using a product called Toco 8 before this.) I am very pleased with this product, as I am a firm believer in “whole food” vitamins, as opposed to synthetics. I originally starting taking this product to help with my LDL cholesterol. After several months of taking this product, I noticed new hair growth. Fine baby hairs started popping up all over my head! The palm fruit, along with another product, Biosil, have really helped me with my hair thinning issues. I recommend taking the palm fruit with apple sauce. The product blends really well with the apple sauce. I have better luck this way, over a liquid. I also like to add raw cinnamon, since cinnamon has many health benefits too! I believe in this product and will continue taking it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Palm Fruit for over six months now and have noticed a huge difference. My hair has started growing back and does not look as thin anymore, my skin is looking better and I have had more energy. The taster of this product is good and it mixes really easy with water. I am going to make sure I always have this on hand and would recommend this to anyone especially if you are losing any hair.</li>
            <li> I chose Palm Fruit simply because the creator, Eric Potratz, has done tons of research on toctrienols.  He doesn&#x27;t just sell supplements to make money, he genuinely wants to make people healthier.  AND, as far as I know, this is best value for the amount of tocotrienols you get in a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed a slight darkening of my skin and I am way more resistant to burning in the sun.  I believe my hair and skin feel softer, but I need more time to decide on that.  I will be testing my cholesterol to see the positive effects the tocotrienols have on my heart!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually eat the powder by itself in a small amount of water.  It tastes amazing since I am on a low carb diet.</li>
            <li> This supplement (palm fruit extract) is well worth the money. I have only been taking it for a couple months now and my hair and skin are looking extra healthy. I live in California where its sunny everyday in the summer and my skin would usually burn after an hour or two of sun without sunscreen. I had read some reviews about its protective qualities within the skin, so I decided I would try for myself to see if it had affected my resistance to sunburn. I had my shirt off while I was outside gardening from noon until 7 pm. I thought for sure when I walked inside and showered I would feel the burn, but amazingly enough, I didn&#x27;t burn! I haven&#x27;t had this type of resistance to the sun since I was a child of about 10 years old vacationing in Florida without sunscreen. I&#x27;m not sure if everyone will experience this type of reaction, but it really makes me wonder how else this amazing fruit is benefiting my body in ways I cannot see!</li>
            <li> After a lot of research on how to boost health in natural ways and discover the importance of nutrients in the body, I came across this unique product. The immediate effects is a boost in libido, immune system, and there are plenty of science verified positive effects in the body specially the antioxidant activity in internal organs. Along with Palm Fruit I use a plant derived multi vitamin supplement, liquid colloidal trace minerals, amino acids and essential fatty acids.</li>
            <li> Years ago I began using products created by Eric Potratz. This was when I discovered Toco8 to help prevent hairloss, a side effect of prohormones i was using at the time. I am a guy with long hair. Needless to say Toco8 worked wonderfully, no hair shedding and my skin was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this same time frame I began dating my now wife and she could not get over how well my skin looked. I had her start taking Toco8 and she began to start seeing results with how her skin looked but Toco8 was taken off the market at that point. Fast forward a couple years I learn that Eric is back with Palm Fruit so I of course start taking it again with the same results as before. Palm fruit is the only supplement I take anymore. Now we just need liver juice 2.0 ;)</li>
            <li> I truly believe in all the research behind Palm Fruit, and I also trust the guy behind this product, namely Eric Potratz.  After reading several of his writings he really knows what he is talking about.  The main things I am hoping to gain from this product is that I believe it will help men keep a good supply of testosterone by the effects it has on, I believe it is the leydig cells, also I am hoping to see new hair growth, and I also expect it to clean my veins and arteries of plaque and keep them clean.  I also understand it is very helpful keeping your skin healthy from the inside, which should mean less wrinkles healthier looking skin.   It is a great antioxidant.  I haven&#x27;t noticed new hair growth yet, but it is still too early to expect that.  I can&#x27;t 100% say I physically notice that it is doing these things for me but like I said, I believe the research and am going to keep taking it.  Perhaps my next blood test will show some positive changes.</li>
