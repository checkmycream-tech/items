            <li> Beautiful!! A bit heavy, but not too bad. Used several bobby pins to keep it in place. By end of the night it was falling out.</li>
            <li> Wore it for my wedding, everyone loved it. Got many compliments, and it matched my attire perfectly.</li>
            <li> amazingly beautiful. Not too big but still noticeable. It is exactly what i needed for my wedding veil.</li>
            <li> Fiancee loved it. A little bigger and heavier than expected, but seems like a very sturdy piece. She loved the design.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful and very well made clip. I&#x27;m getting married and am going to wear my hair up. I had been looking for the right clip, but they&#x27;re just wasn&#x27;t one to be found. The prices were also a lot more than this one. I almost cried with excitement when it arrived. It was packaged very nice, too. It is so much prettier than the pictures. My dress has pearls and rhinestones on the side and this matches perfectly. I can&#x27;t wait to get my hair done and get to wear my beautiful hair comb! My wedding now has that special final touch I wanted!</li>
            <li> Because of the price, assumed it would look cheap, but looks as nice as the $50 in the bridal shops.  It has some weight to it as well.</li>
            <li> Very nice, wore in a wedding as a bridesmaid.</li>
            <li> My first surprise is that I received this package on a Sunday! I guess I definitely do live in a city that never sleeps. Now for my review of  this beautiful hair comb. As soon as I got the package open I loved it. At a closer look and taking the time to inspect it closer, I loved it even more! Everything jewel and pearl was in place. It was the perfect mix of classy sophistication with a bit of sparkling edge. I will be wearing this comb for my upcoming wedding. I&#x27;m so excited and satisfied with my purchase and might I add that price was even better!</li>
            <li> Wife LOVED this on her wedding day. She typically wears more high-end jewelry but she adored this.</li>
            <li> Looked just like the picture has it. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I used this for my wedding! It is beautiful...</li>
            <li> Very nice and arrived very quickly. Very pretty in person, I wish I had more occasions to wear it. It was purchased for my wedding.</li>
            <li> Exactly what is shown</li>
            <li> Beautiful!!! My wife used it for the weeding photo shot pictures</li>
            <li> very nice piece, used it in my wedding and it was wonderful</li>
            <li> Love this!  I ended up using this for my Veil I handmade, and it turned out gorgeous!  Definitely worth it.  Couldn&#x27;t have been happier with how my veil turned out because of it.</li>
            <li> Good product wished it was a little bigger but good quality</li>
            <li> Gorgeous!!! Will go beautifully with my wedding dress.</li>
            <li> I used this to pair with a birdcage veil that I also purchased on Amazon. It looks even prettier in person and gave my veil that extra touch of elegance (I had a simple courthouse wedding). It was perfect!</li>
            <li> This piece is absolutely amazing! It&#x27;s shiny and elegant which is what every bride should have on her big day. However, the product I received had a pearl missing. Luckily it had just come off in the bag, and I was able to super glue it back into place. Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely stunning ! Great for the price , can&#x27;t touch one like this at a bridal shoppe for less than 60 dollars !! I can&#x27;t wait to wear it for my wedding day !</li>
            <li> This comb was beautiful!! Great buy ,  i seen smaller combs at David&#x27;s bridal for more than triple the price excellent buy for price n shipping was a little late but that&#x27;s why I gave it four stars</li>
