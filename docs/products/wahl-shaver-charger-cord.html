            <li> chord has a kink in it. wire damged</li>
            <li> My well-used Wahl shaver charger frayed at both ends. I wanted an OEM replacement. This is exactly what I needed and expected. It came ahead of time and at a good value. No problems -- and Housewares really does care about the outcome of your interaction with them. Go with Housewares @ Amazon for your needs. They will do you good.</li>

            <li> thought i was going to have to purchase an whole new clipper because i lost the adapter cord &amp; couldn&#x27;t find one to fit. Then I thought &amp;#34;Try Amazon, they have everything&amp;#34;.  To my satisfaction, they did and at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> The charger lost the ability to make contact with the shaver.The connection surface must have worn out.(red light would not stay on)&lt;br /&gt;Nice to know there are affordable parts available.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s friend gave him the Wahl shaver and he purchased the charger cord , and shaver works great ! my son says he love it !</li>
            <li> The charger arrived in a timely fashion and operated well. No complaints !</li>

            <li> I got this charger pretty quick and it works as it should. The one that came with the shaver got messed up at the end so i had to replace it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!!</li>
            <li> My husband had thrown the one out that we got with the Shaver, so had to purchase this one.  Fits great, was made for it and works just like the original one.</li>

            <li> This product met my qualifications and did what I needed it to do in replacement of the cord I lost.</li>
            <li> I ordered a cord for my model number. This cord does not fit the model they said it does.</li>
            <li> Works as good as it should.  At least it&#x27;s available when the original breaks or quits working.  Hopefully it will keep working.</li>
            <li> Fair product...  Wear&#x27;s a little to easily  at the point where the wire meets the plug in at the the razor end  But charges quickly and gives good power when corded shaving. (second one).</li>
            <li> It was perfect,  thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd charger, I pack mine w the shaver in a shaving kit. By doing this it cause a short. It wld b nice to be able to pack the cord instead of having to leave it laying around.</li>
