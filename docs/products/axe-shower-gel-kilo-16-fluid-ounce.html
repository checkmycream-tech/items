            <li>I was incredibly happy to find it available from Amazon.</li>
            <li>My husband continues to tease me about all the liquid scented soaps I buy, so I set out to find him his own man soap.  </li>

            <li>There are many better ones.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite body wash.</li>
            <li>I love axe shower gel, couldn&#x27;t pass up on the price.  </li>
            <li>I like much more than their competitors.</li>
            <li>Liked it so much that I ordered more here and tried the shower gel too.  </li>
            <li>this is one of their better smelling product and the right strength for me not to over powering will buy more</li>

            <li>I am really hooked.  </li>
            <li>Not noticeably, like rotten fish sitting in the summer sun for three days straight.</li>
            <li>As to the shower gel itself, it cleans as well as most other shower gels I have used, so it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>One of the bottles half of it had leaked in the bag when it arrived at the house so not such a good deal</li>
            <li>I usually have several in my shower to fit my mood :)</li>
            <li>For the complete package......makes scents to me.......</li>
            <li>short, if you are new to Axe, pass on this one.  </li>
            <li>but I just love the smell too bad its not the real deal</li>

            <li> but I just love the smell too bad its not the real deal</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t offensive, and it isn&#x27;t terribly long lasting.</li>
            <li> Add just a pinch of flat vegetable juice laced with potting soil.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s generally more expensive than other brands</li>
            <li> It is somewhat of a cross between a musk (Dark Temptation or Anarchy) and a citrus (Twist).  </li>
            <li> In the case of the Kilo, it&#x27;s short half life is a blessing.</li>
            <li> Mix in some wet, moldy, rotting leaves.</li>
            <li> In others, a little goes a long ways, but not with Kilo.  </li>
            <li> My wife bought me a bottle of this shortly before Valentines Day, and I still am not sure what message she was sending me.</li>
            <li> In contrast, other Axe shower gels are super-concentrated and thick and luxurious with extra goodies in them.  </li>
            <li> It is not a very strong smell, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also has no special exfoliating scrubs, moisturizing beads, or even any sparkles in</li>
            <li> But for the rest of us firmly rooted in reality, this stuff just smells bad.</li>
            <li> and it is difficult to find in stores now.  </li>
            <li> This stuff stinks.</li>
            <li> This stuff stinks in a sneaky, ninja sort of fashion.</li>
            <li> It is one of the weakest Axe shower gels I have used, so it is very expensive to use.  </li>

            <li> This product creates a nice lather making it easy and not having to use much product. Smells amazing and the girls don&#x27;t mind at all.</li>
            <li> Works well. Smells great!</li>
            <li> axe shower gel, Kilo.  this is the only one my son will use.  it smells great</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents. Axe will probably discountinue it now!</li>
            <li> The only AXE shower gel that I use.  The only AXE scent I like and it is difficult to find in stores now.  I was incredibly happy to find it available from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The body wash smells just like the body spray. It lingers on your skin for awhile after you finish your shower. This is most likely my favorite Axe body wash.</li>
            <li> My husband continues to tease me about all the liquid scented soaps I buy, so I set out to find him his own man soap.  Gotta tell ya, he loves it!  Now he prefers this over bar soap.</li>
            <li> I personally love this scent,  I think it&#x27;s the greatest for  guys and I&#x27;m in my 40sâ€¦&lt;br /&gt;Hehe</li>
            <li> This is obviously a personal opinion, since everyone is different.  But I like the smell a lot, and so does my wife.  I discovered the Kilo line by accident when I bought the Kilo body spray on clearance at Target to try it out.  Liked it so much that I ordered more here and tried the shower gel too.  As to the shower gel itself, it cleans as well as most other shower gels I have used, so it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> My husband has searched everywhere at the stores for the Axe Shower Gel in Kilo. He was so HAPPY to find it on Amazon at a great price &amp; will order again!!</li>
            <li> Axe shower gel is good stuff but the fragrance &amp;#34;kilo&amp;#34; is not one of my favorites.  It gets you cleaner than when you started, but I think the scent is a personal choice and I will choose another one next time.</li>
            <li> Goes great with the kilo body spray. For the complete package......makes scents to me.......</li>
            <li> Over priced but that&#x27;s what you get for buying stuff you can get at Walgreens online lol ðŸ˜‚</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried/used just about every Axe shower gel.  I am really hooked.  I usually have several in my shower to fit my mood :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe Kilo had a good smell.  It is somewhat of a cross between a musk (Dark Temptation or Anarchy) and a citrus (Twist).  It is not a very strong smell, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My big gripe with this is that it is quite runny/diluted.  I was surprised how easily it poured/ran out of the bottle.  In contrast, other Axe shower gels are super-concentrated and thick and luxurious with extra goodies in them.  In others, a little goes a long ways, but not with Kilo.  It is one of the weakest Axe shower gels I have used, so it is very expensive to use.  I would say, I use it 3X the amount of others.  It also has no special exfoliating scrubs, moisturizing beads, or even any sparkles in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you are new to Axe, pass on this one.  There are many better ones.  If you are a seasoned Axe user, this is maybe worth 1 bottle just so you can try it and for variety.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body wash. I wish it was sold in stores so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay up the wazoo for shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> stuff is diluted, they stopped selling this stuff in stores but I just love the smell too bad its not the real deal</li>
            <li> I love axe shower gel, couldn&#x27;t pass up on the price.  I only buy it with coupons or when it&#x27;s on sale.  While it&#x27;s generally more expensive than other brands the sents they have I like much more than their competitors.</li>
            <li> One of the bottles half of it had leaked in the bag when it arrived at the house so not such a good deal</li>
            <li> Got this for my son and he loves it. The only thing I would like is to have a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> this is one of their better smelling product and the right strength for me not to over powering will buy more</li>
            <li> My wife bought me a bottle of this shortly before Valentines Day, and I still am not sure what message she was sending me. Normally the Axe products are okay. The scent isn&#x27;t offensive, and it isn&#x27;t terribly long lasting. In the case of the Kilo, it&#x27;s short half life is a blessing. This stuff stinks. Not noticeably, like rotten fish sitting in the summer sun for three days straight. This stuff stinks in a sneaky, ninja sort of fashion. Imagine the smell of rubber that is heated just to the threshold of melting. Mix in some wet, moldy, rotting leaves. Add just a pinch of flat vegetable juice laced with potting soil. That is sort of what Kilo smells like. For the man that is seeking out &amp;#34;earthy undertones with a hint of playful manliness&amp;#34; I suppose this is just the ticket. But for the rest of us firmly rooted in reality, this stuff just smells bad.</li>
