            <li>and I&#x27;m sure you will be extemely satisfied.</li>
            <li>This stuff is ok for me.  </li>
            <li>I have used many &amp;#34; anti-aging creams&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I use this as my nighttime moisturizer and I love the Avani line.  </li>
            <li>As you know, in most cases you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so much better.</li>
            <li>I think I will just stick with the L&#x27;Oreal age perfect lotion in the future.</li>

            <li>This Avani Dead Sea Timeless Skin Cream is awesome!!!</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It is very rich and feels a bit heavy when you first apply it, but it rapidly absorbs into the skin and makes an awesome primer-type surface to apply make-up over.  </li>
            <li>this is our first time using this type of cream and we love it.</li>
            <li>You will see significant changes.</li>
            <li>I use to use Image C until I saw a significant change on my friends face.</li>
            <li>Something special for someone special.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t notice it being any better than other moisturizers I use.  </li>
            <li>So nice for someone to actually do better than expected!</li>
            <li>worth every penny</li>
            <li>I was using the regular Avani Day Cream and liked it.</li>
            <li>Helps maintain healthy soft skin.</li>
            <li>In combination with the other products, my skin is beginning to look bright.</li>
            <li>even right after I’ve applied the Avani.  </li>
            <li>After trying sampler and seeing in the store the Price was right.</li>
            <li>really, nothing special.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s  non greasy, soaks in the skin making it feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Somehow my 30 year old sister in law used it more often, and she loves it so much that she wants it for christmas.</li>
            <li>i will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>This product is the real deal.</li>
            <li>The price is so much cheaper on Amazon than any spa or cosmetic store.</li>
            <li>The whole line of Avani is reasonably priced, as well</li>
            <li>But did not cost too much</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;s really remember buying this cream</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother and looks refreshed.</li>
            <li>much thinner, silkier and smoother.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this cream and think it works as well as more expensive creams.  </li>
            <li>I have not really used it long enough to see any great results</li>
            <li>I highly recommend  it.</li>
            <li>, this cream sells for a lot of money, but has a very strong cheap perfume smell..... reminded me of some very typical cheap lotion I have smelled when I was a little kid in a third world country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i  would rather have a lighter cream that glides on,  other women may enjoy it</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, eczema prone skin</li>
            <li>At first it feels alittle heavier on skin over lighter creams but find it puts the moisture back in my skin that it needs in my fifty&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The small amount the give you in a jar makes me wish I had ordered more.</li>
            <li>I have tried many anti aging creams, just to conquer my dry skin,if for any other reason.&lt;br /&gt;This is not one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>but if it had been bad I would remember it, the big thing with rubbing stuff on your skin is to make sure there are no Parabens of any kind as they can be cancer causing.</li>
            <li>-- I have much nicer body creams than this facial</li>
            <li>This cream feels really heavy and thus doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re just wasting your money purchasing anything for your face if you don&#x27;t use a broad spectrum sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I bought this last week and have used it 3 times so far.</li>
            <li>You do not need much and I would suggest putting it on with your face a bit wet.</li>
            <li>, however she didn&#x27;t know how much I paid for this, perhaps that information would have changed her overall opinion of the product because I thought it was more on the expensive side.</li>
            <li>It smells a little too perfumy at first, but then that goes away once it dries.</li>
            <li>But this jar appeared not to be full and it was hard, like putty.  </li>
            <li>It is highly questionable that this product is suitable for facial skin.</li>
            <li>I’m 31 and have used L’Oreal for mature very dry skin cream for 2 years now</li>

            <li> However, do note, it (the product) can dry out on you if you do not use it regularly.</li>
            <li> I would recommend trying it especially if you have chronic dry skin on your face.</li>
            <li> It didn’t do nothing to quench the thirst of my dry skin</li>
            <li> it still felt dry</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin was dry</li>
            <li> Last a long time only takes very little to do my face and neck</li>
            <li> I am hypothyroid and have very dry skin</li>
            <li> and try so of the  other Avani products.</li>
            <li> It did come with other Avani products that I used, but didn&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> cream that does not seem to hydrate well.&lt;br /&gt;In conjunction with my other cream when used together</li>
            <li> The cream is much to heavy and gives the face a dry appearance.  </li>
            <li> You could not smooth it on your face.  </li>
            <li> Once it was on, it didn&#x27;t feel so heavy in my face, but</li>
            <li> I am still using the Avani Dead Sea Cream on my feet, ankles, and elbows-</li>
            <li> I will never buy anything from Avani Dead Sea ever again.</li>
            <li> So if you got dry skin – pass this product by – not a good choice.  </li>
            <li> The Avani products are unbelievable.</li>
            <li> The cream is a bit thick  and heavy.</li>
            <li> if this, Is it is really thick.  </li>
            <li> i felt the cream was too thick  </li>
            <li> This lotion is too thick and it smells like soap.</li>
            <li> This was not good moisturizer for my skin type.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty awful texture.</li>
            <li> I woke up in the morning with the thin film of cream on my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I threw the box and paper work away.  </li>
            <li> The mall product was VERY expensive.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like it, and I hate the smell.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> excellent very good product this is our first time using this type of cream and we love it.Very good price.</li>
            <li> I have just received the product today. As of yet I have not used it, but have nothing but good about it</li>
            <li> This product is the real deal. Give it a try and I&#x27;m sure you will be extemely satisfied. Something special for someone special.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Tightening was great</li>
            <li> The price is so much cheaper on Amazon than any spa or cosmetic store. Always check before purchasing elsewhere! The Avani products are unbelievable. You will see significant changes. I use to use Image C until I saw a significant change on my friends face. I&lt;br /&gt;switched immediately.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin cream I have ever used!  My skin is smoother, softer, and the lines on my neck have all but disappeared!  It is very rich and feels a bit heavy when you first apply it, but it rapidly absorbs into the skin and makes an awesome primer-type surface to apply make-up over.  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This was not good moisturizer for my skin type. I would not buy it again. It left a film that would peel after use, which indicates that my skin could not absorb the product.</li>
            <li> I have ordered and used this cream before and loved it.  But this jar appeared not to be full and it was hard, like putty.  You could not smooth it on your face.  I&#x27;m sorry I threw the box and paper work away.  It should have been returned to the merchant...at their expense!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cream and think it works as well as more expensive creams.  It goes on smoothly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> In combination with the other products, my skin is beginning to look bright. The whole line of Avani is reasonably priced, as well</li>
            <li> This stuff is ok for me.  I honestly didn&#x27;t notice it being any better than other moisturizers I use.  The downside if this, Is it is really thick.  It&#x27;s like putting jergens hand lotion on your face.  Once it was on, it didn&#x27;t feel so heavy in my face, but really, nothing special.</li>
            <li> I’m 31 and have used L’Oreal for mature very dry skin cream for 2 years now but after reading very good reviews here on Amazon I’ve decided to try Avani  for a change.  The scent is actually very pleasant and not too strong which is great but the product just sits on your skin it doesn’t penetrate it!  I woke up in the morning with the thin film of cream on my skin and I’ve used a pea-sized amount!!!!!  It didn’t do nothing to quench the thirst of my dry skin it still felt dry even right after I’ve applied the Avani.  So today I went to the store and got my never failing L’Oreal cream.  So if you got dry skin – pass this product by – not a good choice.  I don’t know if it helps for wrinkles because I have no wrinkles and that cream is not intended to fix your UV damaged skin.</li>
            <li> i felt the cream was too thick  i  would rather have a lighter cream that glides on,  other women may enjoy it</li>
            <li> Love the Avani Line of products as it works so well with my skin! At first it feels alittle heavier on skin over lighter creams but find it puts the moisture back in my skin that it needs in my fifty&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> a gift for my Aunt who is in her upper 50&#x27;s. She said she liked it very much, however she didn&#x27;t know how much I paid for this, perhaps that information would have changed her overall opinion of the product because I thought it was more on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> this product is great for aging skin. It goes on nicely and make you skin feel incredible. worth every penny</li>
            <li> This is and excellent cream. I have used many &amp;#34; anti-aging creams&amp;#34; be this one beats then all.  If you try it you will be most happy. and try so of the  other Avani products.</li>
            <li> I use this as my nighttime moisturizer and I love the Avani line.  However, do note, it (the product) can dry out on you if you do not use it regularly.</li>
            <li> I only recently was introduced to Avani products and have bought several items.  They are all wonderful and a great buy for the money.  I can actually see a difference in my skin after using this just a short time.  Love Avani!</li>
            <li> As you know, in most cases you get what you pay for.  This product line performs and you will notice a difference with daily use. Don&#x27;t forget....any skin program is null and void if you don&#x27;t use sunscreen 365 days a year. You&#x27;re just wasting your money purchasing anything for your face if you don&#x27;t use a broad spectrum sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I was using the regular Avani Day Cream and liked it. Again I could see a difference in my skin in that it appeared smoother, cleaner and clearer. I also use the Avani Bar for cleansing. I have areas that need repair and just started using this product. So far so good. Avani has good products.</li>
            <li> Best face cream. Light and very effective. Helps maintain healthy soft skin. Skin feels noticeably improved even after one wk of use.  So nice for someone to actually do better than expected!</li>
            <li> It sits on your skin, does not penetrate to re-build anything, and causes build-up. Made my skin break out. Awful. It is highly questionable that this product is suitable for facial skin.</li>
            <li> I love it! it&#x27;s  non greasy, soaks in the skin making it feel smooth and soft. I highly recommend  it.</li>
            <li> I love Avani and will always use it! I have never found anything better yet! At this price I will always have it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff ! It makes my face feel so much better. I am hypothyroid and have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I bought this last week and have used it 3 times so far. I got it because I thought it would be similar to a &amp;#34;dead Sea&amp;#34; product that I tried at the mall. The mall product was VERY expensive. I guess you get what you pay for. This lotion is too thick and it smells like soap. I think I will just stick with the L&#x27;Oreal age perfect lotion in the future.</li>
            <li> The cream is much to heavy and gives the face a dry appearance.  But did not cost too much so I&#x27;m still using it at night.</li>
            <li> This Avani Dead Sea Timeless Skin Cream is awesome!!! I&#x27;ve bought it at Sam&#x27;s Club for way more $$$. It did come with other Avani products that I used, but didn&#x27;t need. I&#x27;m so happy with this cream! My face says, &amp;#34;Thank you&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love it goes on great and does a its job. No greasy residue excellent highly recommend it. Also love the smell .</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mother in law.  Somehow my 30 year old sister in law used it more often, and she loves it so much that she wants it for christmas.</li>
            <li> I like this product but it does not go on very smoothly. The cream is a bit thick  and heavy. You do not need much and I would suggest putting it on with your face a bit wet. I have dry skin and it does a good job in keeping my face from drying out but it is a tad bit heavier than I would like or am used too. I use it at night and the moisturizer during the day. Both are about the same consistency. I have not really used it long enough to see any great results but I have noticed a softness coming to my skin that I had not achieved before. I would recommend trying it especially if you have chronic dry skin on your face.</li>
            <li> Love it. Feels great. Bought one for my sis and friend as well and mailed it to them as a surprise. They love it too.</li>
            <li> The product is great. I received it timely and the price was good. For both professionals and home use this product  does a great job of improving aging skin to retain a youthful look and feel.</li>
            <li> I have tried many anti aging creams, just to conquer my dry skin,if for any other reason.&lt;br /&gt;This is not one of my favorites.  It is a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; cream that does not seem to hydrate well.&lt;br /&gt;In conjunction with my other cream when used together, there  is improvement, but why do I need to put on two creams to achieve the results I am looking for?</li>
            <li> Quality product-great for moisturizing your face at any time of the day.  I use this during the day and night.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;s really remember buying this cream but if it had been bad I would remember it, the big thing with rubbing stuff on your skin is to make sure there are no Parabens of any kind as they can be cancer causing.</li>
            <li> Good product. My skin is much smoother and looks refreshed. To soon to tell if it makes me lok younger.</li>
            <li> My skin was dry now it looks great! Especially great to use when you have done a facial peel. Makes your skin look great after the treatment.</li>
            <li> This is an Anti-Aging CREAM- it&#x27;s not thin and it takes a few minutes to dry. It smells a little too perfumy at first, but then that goes away once it dries. I have very sensitive, eczema prone skin and since I&#x27;ve purchased this product I stopped using on my face and switched to vanicream- much thinner, silkier and smoother. I am still using the Avani Dead Sea Cream on my feet, ankles, and elbows- and it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Has a great smell and goes on nice and smooth. Last a long time only takes very little to do my face and neck i will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I use this at night after cleaning with the purifying soap. After trying sampler and seeing in the store the Price was right.</li>
            <li> I like the way it make my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Liked the lotion but the fragrance scent was a bit strong.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel. I am 57. The small amount the give you in a jar makes me wish I had ordered more.</li>
            <li> This cream feels really heavy and thus doesn&#x27;t absorb quickly. It&#x27;s a pretty awful texture. I have stopped using it. I don&#x27;t even want to put it on my body -- I have much nicer body creams than this facial cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, this cream sells for a lot of money, but has a very strong cheap perfume smell..... reminded me of some very typical cheap lotion I have smelled when I was a little kid in a third world country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like it, and I hate the smell. I will never buy anything from Avani Dead Sea ever again.</li>
