            <li>Don&#x27;t see another product as good, or one to replace Natureluxe.</li>
            <li>so I am stocking up on it until I find something I like just as good.</li>
            <li>I read about this and couldn&#x27;t believe it when I saw how good this covers.</li>
            <li>It smeels and feels good too.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>So happy Amazon still has it available.</li>
            <li>Glad amazon dealer still has it for a fair price.</li>
            <li>Smelled nice though.</li>
            <li>If you INSIST on using a strong fragrance, indicate so on the label!</li>
            <li>It really does make your skin look great.  </li>
            <li>I love cover girl products but didn&#x27;t try this one til it was on clearance.</li>
            <li>When I got the sample of the NatureLuxe foundation, I got online and found as many tutorials as I could.</li>
            <li>I definitely felt confident about my skin, which is the best thing a make-up can do.    </li>
            <li>Love it and the service.  </li>
            <li>I am 44 and look great thanks to this product.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know much more than that</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used top of the line brands.</li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;m done spending top dollor for them.</li>
            <li>However, I am glad I found it, and am upset that it is no longer being made.  </li>
            <li>This was okay.  </li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use a lot of this product but it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It was super easy.</li>
            <li>Goes on super smooth.</li>
            <li>This make-up matched my skin perfectly and went on silky smooth (a feature I find difficult to find in most makeup we seniors can wear).</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised at how good it felt on my face, and how fast it was to put on.</li>
            <li>Gives me a beautiful complexion, no shine, or heavy mask feeling.</li>
            <li>It was a little heavier than the L&#x27;Oreal, but great for a longer day into evening.  </li>
            <li>Such a nice product.</li>
            <li>It never looks heavy either, but the coverage for my dry skin is perfect.  </li>
            <li>The foundation felt soft and did a great job evening out my skin tone (except for the fact that I looked a little bronzed).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love and will continue tuo use as long as they will sell somewhere.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine this lasting as long as my powder does, which makes it more likely to be a special-event, going-out kind of makeup.     </li>
            <li>WHO puts so much (horrid) fragrance in a product to be worn on your face???  </li>
            <li>I really like this makeup.  </li>
            <li>This is the nicest liquid foundation I&#x27;ve ever used -- truly goes on like silk, covers nicely without being heavy.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised, I buy pretty expensive foundation and make up and was very surprised that this really works great!</li>
            <li>This product is becoming very hard to find -- used to be available in stores but now has to be found online, which I think is a shame.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin, and even though I follow a great regimen, liquids always seemed too dense and difficult.</li>
            <li>I also live in the desert</li>
            <li>I could not wash it off fast enough.  </li>
            <li>I can no longer find it in drugstores near me</li>
            <li>It is really soft and airy, does not feel like I am wearing cake on my face.</li>
            <li>People are so surprised when I say I wear Covergirl.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really work for me as I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>and you can barely tell it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li>I really like the coverage that I usually can only find with high end brands.</li>

            <li> but Covergirl&#x27;s is easier to apply and is less expensive.</li>
            <li> This foundation needs to come back :(</li>
            <li> It has been discontinued I think and is very hard to find</li>
            <li> It gives your skin that natural look and doesn&#x27;t make your face look to exaggerated with make up!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of foundations and have not been afraid to pay and try expensive ones .  </li>
            <li> Too bad target stopped selling it.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t that ugly line between my neck and face.</li>
            <li> On a scale of 1-5 with 5 being the worst of Rosacea,  I am probably a 3.  </li>

            <li> This product is becoming very hard to find -- used to be available in stores but now has to be found online, which I think is a shame.  This is the nicest liquid foundation I&#x27;ve ever used -- truly goes on like silk, covers nicely without being heavy.  Don&#x27;t see another product as good, or one to replace Natureluxe.</li>
            <li> This is great foundation for the price.  It really does make your skin look great.  I was surprised, I buy pretty expensive foundation and make up and was very surprised that this really works great!</li>
            <li> It is the SMELL... the putrid smell.  I was gagging.  WHO puts so much (horrid) fragrance in a product to be worn on your face???  I could not wash it off fast enough.  Cosmetic companies take note:  We do NOT want fragrance in make up products... if we want to smell, we will use perfume or cologne.  If you INSIST on using a strong fragrance, indicate so on the label!</li>
            <li> Such a nice product. I love cover girl products but didn&#x27;t try this one til it was on clearance. I loved it ! Gives me a beautiful complexion, no shine, or heavy mask feeling. Of course when I went to repurchase in stores it was gone. Glad amazon dealer still has it for a fair price. I should deplete their inventorying my shade.</li>
            <li> I have always been scared of liquid foundation. I have oily skin, and even though I follow a great regimen, liquids always seemed too dense and difficult. Also, working in retail, I tend to see people often who are wearing caked on, heavy makeup. That is not me- I use powder because it takes two seconds and you can barely tell it&#x27;s there. When I got the sample of the NatureLuxe foundation, I got online and found as many tutorials as I could. I used a brush instead of a sponge, I buffed the color out into my hairline, and I let it set. It was super easy. I was actually surprised at how good it felt on my face, and how fast it was to put on. Unfortunately, I chose a color that ended up being a little dark, so I will have to go shopping for another color, but I think I liked it enough to purchase it again.     The foundation felt soft and did a great job evening out my skin tone (except for the fact that I looked a little bronzed). By the end of the day, I felt like the foundation and my oily skin were starting to clash. As a first-timer, I didn&#x27;t think about things like blotting, or re-powdering throughout the day. Next time, I will do those things and see what happens. I definitely felt confident about my skin, which is the best thing a make-up can do.    I docked the foundation a star because of the end-of-the-day extreme need to wash my face, and also because the package is very small. I can&#x27;t imagine this lasting as long as my powder does, which makes it more likely to be a special-event, going-out kind of makeup.     **I am a BzzAgent, and I received this product at no cost in order to review it.</li>
            <li> Love this foundation, so sad it&#x27;s been discontinued by the manufacturer.. So happy Amazon still has it available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for three years now. I can no longer find it in drugstores near me so I order it through Amazon. I really like the coverage that I usually can only find with high end brands. It does not cover everything, you&#x27;ll still need a concealer for that. And it doesn&#x27;t look or feel caked on.</li>
            <li> Covergirl shouldn&#x27;t have discontinued this product!</li>
            <li> I bought a bunch of these at once because they no longer sell this product anymore. Not sure why but I bought I bunch so I will never have to miss it again. I don&#x27;t use a lot of this product but it is fantastic. This is the only foundation I will use. It is really soft and airy, does not feel like I am wearing cake on my face. Feels like there is nothing there. Would definitely recommend this product. Hopefully it will be in stores again...</li>
            <li> Love it and the service.  I seldom received complements on my skin till I started wearing this.  I am 44 and look great thanks to this product.  I have tried lots of foundations and have not been afraid to pay and try expensive ones .  People are so surprised when I say I wear Covergirl.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love is foundation!! It gives your skin that natural look and doesn&#x27;t make your face look to exaggerated with make up!!! Best foundation out there!!!</li>
            <li> I started using Covergirl Natureluxe Silk Foundation about 8 years ago.  I have Rosacea and have found that my flareups have diminished since using this foundation. On a scale of 1-5 with 5 being the worst of Rosacea,  I am probably a 3.  I had used a product by Rosacea Care but Covergirl&#x27;s is easier to apply and is less expensive. This product is not only non-irrating to my face but conceals my minor redness.  A few drops go along way.</li>
            <li> This product was also discontinued.  It was a little heavier than the L&#x27;Oreal, but great for a longer day into evening.  Also there was Sunscreen built into this product.  Never should have been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I really like this makeup.  It has been discontinued I think and is very hard to find so I am stocking up on it until I find something I like just as good.</li>
            <li> I love this product! but only as a concealer. My face is too oily to use this as a total foundation. I also live in the desert so I sweat a lot that could be a problem as well. but if you have oily skin I recommend not using this as a foundation</li>
            <li> This foundation needs to come back :(</li>
            <li> Wife loves this stuff. Great buy for the price. Don&#x27;t know much more than that but if she likes, I recommend it. She doesn&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup but likes this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used top of the line brands. From Dior to Laura Mercier. Well I&#x27;m done spending top dollor for them. I read about this and couldn&#x27;t believe it when I saw how good this covers. It smeels and feels good too. I had to gamble on my Color and I won. There isn&#x27;t that ugly line between my neck and face. Goes on super smooth. Doesn&#x27;t last all day but long enough to get me through my day. Too bad target stopped selling it. Had to order me a second one from here. I&#x27;m in love and will continue tuo use as long as they will sell somewhere.</li>
            <li> I forgot to review this because when I purchased it, I did so in spring, and now that I have a tan, will have to wait until next winter to begin using it.  However, I am glad I found it, and am upset that it is no longer being made.  It is a wonderful foundation for a great price, and if I had thought ahead, I would have purchased a darker color!</li>
            <li> This was okay.  It didn&#x27;t really work for me as I have very dry skin.  It showed brush marks after it was applied.  Smelled nice though.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup-- I am blonde and over age 60. This make-up matched my skin perfectly and went on silky smooth (a feature I find difficult to find in most makeup we seniors can wear). It never looks heavy either, but the coverage for my dry skin is perfect.  I bought 3 tubs in this shade because I can&#x27;t find this product anywhere. Looks like it&#x27;s been discontinued. SHAME on you COVER GIRL!! This was the best makeup I&#x27;ve had in years!  Maybe it&#x27;s time to change companies?</li>
