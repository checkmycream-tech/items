            <li>Very nice coverage</li>
            <li>Favorite makeup, great price!</li>
            <li>The best way to use it (for me) is to blend it with another paler shade that has more coverage.</li>
            <li>good:</li>
            <li>(still haven&#x27;t found anything good about it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When its applied it gives a look of a good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Remember, I started out this review by saying I have fair skin.  </li>
            <li>i have a fair skin</li>
            <li>This product is so good.</li>
            <li>so this is good as they moisturize and serves as some sort of primer/ foundation and sun protection</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a protective moisturizer that is supposed to be good for the skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;t great, I love it, very happy, also very quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>it is amazing how it works</li>
            <li>If you are looking for light coverage with sunscreen, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I love tinted moisturizers and this is a really good one.</li>
            <li>Nice to put on just one thing; not moisturizer and cover-up.</li>
            <li>Nice color and coverage.</li>
            <li>I think this product is better for people with not so fair skin.  </li>
            <li>Goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>I have always had good luck with Aveeno products, and this is no exception. :-)</li>
            <li>It is light and still gives good coverage.</li>
            <li>It should be applied very lightly, message into your skin</li>
            <li>Buying it again! :)</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I think I am alergic to one or more ingrediants or maybe just the SPF...</li>
            <li>Love this tinted moisturizer...</li>
            <li>Which kind of defeats the purpose of using tinted moisturizer, which should be a light makeup.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>If you like makeup/moisturizer/sunscreen in one tube you will love this.</li>
            <li>It works okay.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Again, it just sits on top of it.  </li>
            <li>I also Love the pump because it keeps the bacteria out.</li>
            <li>Once I determined what product I was going to use, I also decided that I wasn&#x27;t going to spend more than $20 on the product unless it came with Justin Timberlake applying it to my face.  </li>
            <li>You have no way of twisting off the top to get the remaining part of the product out when the pump stops working.&lt;br /&gt;3  </li>
            <li>Love this product, gives your face a radiant glow, let&#x27;s your skin show through while giving it some color.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I love how moisturizing this makes me feel -- a lot of tinted moisturizers feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin you may not like this as it shines and glows and may look more oily.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of cheaper drug store tinted moisturizers and BB creams that do a better job than this one.</li>
            <li>I love this tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>nice and smooth</li>
            <li>It does make my skin look more even.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing this item again :)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My skin does look better when I use this every day.</li>
            <li>Seems pretty good</li>
            <li>My 50-year old fair skin needs a nice even look to it and after tons of research, I decided my solution was a tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It will cover minor imperfections while providing a nice amount of moisture and a beautiful glow to your skin.  </li>
            <li>Great for mature skin.</li>
            <li>Also, it gives you a good sense of how much product you should apply and where.  </li>
            <li>Easy on, evens out skin tone without looking &#x27;cakey&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I strongly encourage you to read the application instructions and do a \\&quot;test</li>
            <li>Be aware it is for warm toned skin.</li>
            <li>purchased the light to medium shade</li>
            <li>I bought the light to medium tint</li>
            <li>I bought this at a fantastic price on amazon, i wouldn&#x27;t try it in the drugstore cause of price.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer/cover-up, but sheer.</li>
            <li>The front of product box I received indicates it is light to medium tint.  </li>
            <li>Provides a light, even color correcting coverage while moisturizing your skin.</li>
            <li>I was wearing it a few days ago with nothing else on my skin at all, and twice she raved about how great my skin looked!</li>
            <li>gives me a good natural color</li>
            <li>It blends in really well and many people think I don&#x27;t wear makeup.</li>
            <li>I love Aveeno products but this one doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>I love the slight tint so that I do not have to wear makeup and the lotion makes my skin feel good.</li>
            <li>really love it and wear it in place of foundation, my skin normally breaks out pretty easily</li>
            <li>The dispenser says \\&quot;oil free - noncomedogenic.\\&quot; I have to say for an oil free product it feels very oily and sat on my skin, making it greasy.</li>
            <li>And the price is better than many similar products out there.</li>
            <li>a really great product and can be blended with different lotions if it is too dark for your own skin color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, the first thing I learned about this type of product is that you have to start with clean skin.  </li>
            <li>It looks natural like this, it doesn&#x27;t look right with an all over application on my face, but i have very light skin.</li>
            <li>It smells like sunscreen thats just the one thing i didnt like but its great for everyday use</li>
            <li>Great product for everyday use.</li>
            <li>It evened out my skin tone, absorbed well, and wasn&#x27;t greasy on my face at all.</li>
            <li>The product sold in the stores seemed more whitish so I was surprised with the color.</li>
            <li>and it seemed more natural than a foundation.  </li>
            <li>My face looks fresh and healthy and I am 67 years old.</li>
            <li>Guess Laura Mercier gets a little more of my business, until I can find a more affordable alternative that works.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I HAD to rave about right after using</li>
            <li>I could no longer find this at my local drug store and it was exciting to be able to get this from amazon.  </li>
            <li>It is thicker and has more color than other tinted moisturizers, which is a good thing, I don&#x27;t need to use as much, and it will last longer.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I love Aveeno&#x27;s daily moisturizing body wash.</li>
            <li>With a tinted moisturizer, I expect something balmy, that moisturizes well, and provides light coverage.</li>
            <li>The light-to-medium shade definitely leans more toward medium with this product, like applying a peachy foundation to the skin.</li>
            <li>I used it exactly twice</li>
            <li>Maybe I needed a lighter shade but this was the only shade available at my drugstore, and I normally wear light foundation.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin but can break out easily, my face did not break out and actually feels better even after I remove it at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>That said I think it&#x27;ll work okay blended with another foundation to customize the color, or to a plain moisturizer to make a quick &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>A little \\&quot;illumination\\&quot; with an age product is nice -</li>
            <li>It has just a little coverage, which is all I need, and a nice finish (not too shiny, greasy, or sparkly).  </li>
            <li>Yes, this sounds nuts but comparing your natural skin to the product you are relying on to cover up your natural skin&#x27;s imperfections is huge.  </li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have to rub it in too much to get it spread evenly.</li>
            <li>Bottle lasts forever - two light squirts is enough.</li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t like much makeup on me, so he notices glitter, shimmery makeup.</li>
            <li>It firms my skin, but i only apply lightly on my cheeks, forehead , nose and chin.</li>
            <li>Thanks Aveeno.</li>
            <li>Comes off very orange on me and it has glitter in the product...</li>
            <li>- Very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i dont like to put so much stuff on my face</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, I have naturally oily skin, so I couldn&#x27;t imagine this working well for those with normal to dry skin unless you apply a separate moisturizer first.</li>
            <li>In fact, one full pump dispenses way too much and there is no way to get it back in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>anad I think it has helped my skin keep from looking older.  </li>
            <li>one thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product was the packaging and this is where I am going to stress that this is the main reason why I give it ONE STAR:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I sent it right back.</li>
            <li>Only used a few times and am satisfied!</li>
            <li>, I have the light to medium, and if I apply too much it does look a little orange.</li>
            <li>Once I was comfortable with the results, I went with the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I must admit that I can&#x27;t live without this.  </li>
            <li>I actually apply another moisturizer first, hey,</li>
            <li>I first applied this product, I only applied it one side of my face.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty obvious</li>
            <li>I use this daily to cover the veins and brown spots (fewer these days, thanks to cosmetic treatments!), so I&#x27;m not so self conscious about my hands and forearms.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but my review is specifically about this product and lack of clear information when I ordered it.</li>
            <li>This product provides a natural looking glow.</li>
            <li>Mine had expired nearly one year ago.  </li>
            <li>There is NOTHING natural about the way it looks, and it doesn&#x27;t even rub into your skin.  </li>
            <li>The price has gone up considerably since I started to use it</li>
            <li>I have bought this product before from different retailers and it has a very pleasant/pretty fragrance</li>
            <li>If my skin is not sun-kissed, even the lightest color that is available still seems heavy on my face.  </li>
            <li>As an African American female, the tint is too light for my skin.  </li>
            <li>One, I&#x27;d like some coverage -- nothing too heavy but not too light either.</li>
            <li>Stays on all day and looks natural.</li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive skin, or rosacea issues, you might want to try something else.</li>
            <li>, I like the natural look and this does all that for me.</li>
            <li>The pros of this item is that it actually gives a tinted color to your skin, and I actually enjoy the smell unlike some other people.</li>
            <li>i like the glow it gives my face, and hours later, it blends and looks very natural, and soft!</li>
            <li>but I expect something more subtle from Aveeno.</li>
            <li>, I got the light to medium shade, so I can only imagine how dark the medium must look.</li>
            <li>I am a light complexion African American female and the product works for what it is intended for, keep in mind that it is not foundation, it is a moisturizer and it is only tinted, so it only requires 1 pump.  </li>
            <li>My skin is getting older and I really like this combo of moisturizer and a little color.  </li>
            <li>just think in this day and age and the fact that Aveeno wants us to see them as offering us NATURAL products insteadof some chemical crazy formula, they would come up with better packaging.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely far away from sheer.</li>
            <li>Sadly for me it doesn&#x27;t work on its own</li>
            <li>Looking for an inexpensive tinted moisturizer for casual everyday wear (I&#x27;m a longtime fan of Laura Mercier, the best, but pricey), decided to give Aveeno a try as I like other Aveeno products.</li>
            <li>, it comes in a small tub, I know exactly how much I have left, why can&#x27;t the tinted moisturizer do the same?  </li>
            <li>It moisturized well, and did not dry out my skin.    </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love Aveeno products but this one doesn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> I love the slight tint so that I do not have to wear makeup and the lotion makes my skin feel good.</li>
            <li> really love it and wear it in place of foundation, my skin normally breaks out pretty easily</li>
            <li> The dispenser says \\&quot;oil free - noncomedogenic.\\&quot; I have to say for an oil free product it feels very oily and sat on my skin, making it greasy.</li>
            <li> And the price is better than many similar products out there.</li>
            <li> a really great product and can be blended with different lotions if it is too dark for your own skin color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, the first thing I learned about this type of product is that you have to start with clean skin.  </li>
            <li> It looks natural like this, it doesn&#x27;t look right with an all over application on my face, but i have very light skin.</li>
            <li> It smells like sunscreen thats just the one thing i didnt like but its great for everyday use</li>
            <li> Great product for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It evened out my skin tone, absorbed well, and wasn&#x27;t greasy on my face at all.</li>
            <li> The product sold in the stores seemed more whitish so I was surprised with the color.</li>
            <li> and it seemed more natural than a foundation.  </li>
            <li> My face looks fresh and healthy and I am 67 years old.</li>
            <li> Guess Laura Mercier gets a little more of my business, until I can find a more affordable alternative that works.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I HAD to rave about right after using</li>
            <li> I could no longer find this at my local drug store and it was exciting to be able to get this from amazon.  </li>
            <li> It is thicker and has more color than other tinted moisturizers, which is a good thing, I don&#x27;t need to use as much, and it will last longer.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I love Aveeno&#x27;s daily moisturizing body wash.</li>
            <li> With a tinted moisturizer, I expect something balmy, that moisturizes well, and provides light coverage.</li>
            <li> The light-to-medium shade definitely leans more toward medium with this product, like applying a peachy foundation to the skin.</li>
            <li> I used it exactly twice</li>
            <li> Maybe I needed a lighter shade but this was the only shade available at my drugstore, and I normally wear light foundation.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin but can break out easily, my face did not break out and actually feels better even after I remove it at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> That said I think it&#x27;ll work okay blended with another foundation to customize the color, or to a plain moisturizer to make a quick &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> A little \\&quot;illumination\\&quot; with an age product is nice -</li>
            <li> It has just a little coverage, which is all I need, and a nice finish (not too shiny, greasy, or sparkly).  </li>
            <li> Yes, this sounds nuts but comparing your natural skin to the product you are relying on to cover up your natural skin&#x27;s imperfections is huge.  </li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to rub it in too much to get it spread evenly.</li>
            <li> Bottle lasts forever - two light squirts is enough.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like much makeup on me, so he notices glitter, shimmery makeup.</li>
            <li> It firms my skin, but i only apply lightly on my cheeks, forehead , nose and chin.</li>
            <li> Thanks Aveeno.</li>
            <li> Comes off very orange on me and it has glitter in the product...</li>
            <li> - Very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i dont like to put so much stuff on my face</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, I have naturally oily skin, so I couldn&#x27;t imagine this working well for those with normal to dry skin unless you apply a separate moisturizer first.</li>
            <li> In fact, one full pump dispenses way too much and there is no way to get it back in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> anad I think it has helped my skin keep from looking older.  </li>
            <li> one thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product was the packaging and this is where I am going to stress that this is the main reason why I give it ONE STAR:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sent it right back.</li>
            <li> Only used a few times and am satisfied!</li>
            <li> , I have the light to medium, and if I apply too much it does look a little orange.</li>
            <li> Once I was comfortable with the results, I went with the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I must admit that I can&#x27;t live without this.  </li>
            <li> I actually apply another moisturizer first, hey,</li>
            <li> I first applied this product, I only applied it one side of my face.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty obvious</li>
            <li> I use this daily to cover the veins and brown spots (fewer these days, thanks to cosmetic treatments!), so I&#x27;m not so self conscious about my hands and forearms.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my review is specifically about this product and lack of clear information when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> This product provides a natural looking glow.</li>
            <li> Mine had expired nearly one year ago.  </li>
            <li> There is NOTHING natural about the way it looks, and it doesn&#x27;t even rub into your skin.  </li>
            <li> The price has gone up considerably since I started to use it</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before from different retailers and it has a very pleasant/pretty fragrance</li>
            <li> If my skin is not sun-kissed, even the lightest color that is available still seems heavy on my face.  </li>
            <li> As an African American female, the tint is too light for my skin.  </li>
            <li> One, I&#x27;d like some coverage -- nothing too heavy but not too light either.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day and looks natural.</li>
            <li> So if you have sensitive skin, or rosacea issues, you might want to try something else.</li>
            <li> , I like the natural look and this does all that for me.</li>
            <li> The pros of this item is that it actually gives a tinted color to your skin, and I actually enjoy the smell unlike some other people.</li>
            <li> i like the glow it gives my face, and hours later, it blends and looks very natural, and soft!</li>
            <li> but I expect something more subtle from Aveeno.</li>
            <li> , I got the light to medium shade, so I can only imagine how dark the medium must look.</li>
            <li> I am a light complexion African American female and the product works for what it is intended for, keep in mind that it is not foundation, it is a moisturizer and it is only tinted, so it only requires 1 pump.  </li>
            <li> My skin is getting older and I really like this combo of moisturizer and a little color.  </li>
            <li> just think in this day and age and the fact that Aveeno wants us to see them as offering us NATURAL products insteadof some chemical crazy formula, they would come up with better packaging.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely far away from sheer.</li>
            <li> Sadly for me it doesn&#x27;t work on its own</li>
            <li> Looking for an inexpensive tinted moisturizer for casual everyday wear (I&#x27;m a longtime fan of Laura Mercier, the best, but pricey), decided to give Aveeno a try as I like other Aveeno products.</li>
            <li> , it comes in a small tub, I know exactly how much I have left, why can&#x27;t the tinted moisturizer do the same?  </li>
            <li> It moisturized well, and did not dry out my skin.    </li>
            <li> My skin looks so much nicer than with plain moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It might work if I use a little under my normal makeup</li>
            <li> but it is not meant to cover any deep discoloration or other major skin issues like foundation</li>
            <li> Aveeneo comes through with the answer with this long lasting moisture and color blended together.  </li>
            <li> However, if I am going to be outside for a long time, I use a heavier sunscreen underneath.</li>
            <li> There were a few semi-dark blemishes on my chin and after putting the moisturizer on, the blemishes were nearly blended in with the rest of my skin tone!  </li>
            <li> It can be used alone for a &#x27;&#x27;natural&#x27;&#x27; day or under foundation to add a little help.</li>
            <li> I will never use foundation again, it lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li> I bought the entire line because I believe that products are created and tested to work well with each other.</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s because I have dry skin, or maybe it&#x27;s because of the product...</li>
            <li> Instead, this made my face feel dry, as if I didn&#x27;t use moisturizer at all.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I could have used a medium to dark tint (if they have such a product).  </li>
            <li> The bad is that it leaves so many streaky marks....</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different tinted moisturizers and I like this one.  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely NOT what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> no thanks.</li>
            <li> This one that I purchased on Amazon does not have the same smell, it actually smells pretty bad.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Too pasty, tough to spread, visible on the skin - and don&#x27;t get it anywhere near your hairline or eyebrows as this stuff really shows up on hair, and is tough to get out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The size of this is 1.7 ounces, I am not sure how big the one in the stores is they charge 19.99(maybe 2.5ounces) for but at 5.99</li>
            <li> makes my skin smother and also gives it a glow that I can&#x27;t find with other brands.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical as this was my first tinted moisturizer I bought, but it has 30 SPF</li>
            <li> Lately I have tried several different tinted moisturizers because I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s now, and I need to get extra serious about sunscreen and moisture.    </li>
            <li> About a half a squirt is all you need.</li>
            <li> Also, I can rinse out the little tub and RECYCLE it along with the box it comes</li>
            <li> It is a little bit on the shiny side compared to my Mary Kay tinted moisturizer, but I do like it and the price.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little yellowish in tone.</li>
            <li> Very dark.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My eyebrows end up looking a bit coated, etc., so after I add this I have to go subtract trouble spots.</li>
            <li> It is not too heavy and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
            <li> It does give my pale skin some coverage, but it is a touch too unsubstantial and way too orange for my liking.</li>
            <li> Has a fake orange look to it even if you only use a little bit.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just a disgusting non-human color that sits on the top of your skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming or anything</li>
            <li> Way to go kèep a small bottle in my purse for touch up during the day</li>
            <li> She has never complimented my skin before, and I haven&#x27;t gotten a compliment from anyone on my skin in at least 2 years.</li>
            <li> I took 1 star away because it gives me a thick feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> Because I hate making returns, I simply started mixing in a little of the re-texturizing cream and the problem is solved.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as heavy as base or makeup, this product nevertheless evens out skin tone and provides sunscreen protection.</li>
            <li> It settled right into my pores, making me look just awful.  </li>
            <li> This product is very thick and almost orange in color with the consistency of a foundation.</li>
            <li> and I noticed a dramatic change in my complexion.</li>
            <li> but.... its too dark to my skin tone :( have to mix it with a lighter foundation</li>
            <li> I have tried this again and again hoping I&#x27;m just doing something wrong</li>
            <li> I see brown orange random patches and streaks all over my face.</li>
            <li> and I am unable to use it at all...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like a sheen or &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; thing it would look fake.</li>
            <li> am sorry I bought</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was afraid it&#x27;d leave a chalky consistency on my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate it.</li>
            <li> The worst aspect of this product is it made me break out.</li>
            <li> It also -- and for me this is worst of all -- does not blend or soak in too well on my skin.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just received this today and immediately went to &amp;#34;try it on&amp;#34;.  I will never go without this product.  My skin looks so much nicer than with plain moisturizer.  I actually can walk out of the house and not feel incomplete without makeup.</li>
            <li> I love tinted moisturizers and this is a really good one.</li>
            <li> Really like it. Nice to put on just one thing; not moisturizer and cover-up. I will keep using it. Buying it again! :)</li>
            <li> Very dark. Has a fake orange look to it even if you only use a little bit. Be careful.</li>
            <li> I could no longer find this at my local drug store and it was exciting to be able to get this from amazon.  I love the slight tint so that I do not have to wear makeup and the lotion makes my skin feel good.</li>
            <li> Seems pretty good and it&#x27;s a great way to protect your face and cover it up.</li>
            <li> The pros of this item is that it actually gives a tinted color to your skin, and I actually enjoy the smell unlike some other people. The bad is that it leaves so many streaky marks....maybe it&#x27;s because I have dry skin, or maybe it&#x27;s because of the product...I have no idea. I have tried this again and again hoping I&#x27;m just doing something wrong, I&#x27;ve even put CG moisturizer under it and once I get in my car and look at the bring out every blemish mirror on my car&#x27;s sun blocker thing....I see brown orange random patches and streaks all over my face. I absolutely hate it. That is enough to not ever buy this product again....and I bought it for $15? What a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time you lick your finger and rub the patches on, you might as well have not even put any on.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Be aware it is for warm toned skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon because it was $19.99 in my local CVS and I wanted to try it. I have been using the regular Aveeno tinted moisturizer for over a year but wanted to try the Aging one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love it and wear it in place of foundation, my skin normally breaks out pretty easily but it has no issue with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it for 5.99, I see they upped the price a bit now. The size of this is 1.7 ounces, I am not sure how big the one in the stores is they charge 19.99(maybe 2.5ounces) for but at 5.99, I could not beat the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;t great, I love it, very happy, also very quick delivery.  Thank you..</li>
            <li> I think I am alergic to one or more ingrediants or maybe just the SPF... My eyes water and I am unable to use it at all...</li>
            <li> This is the first product I HAD to rave about right after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the light to medium shade and I noticed a dramatic change in my complexion. It evened out my skin tone, absorbed well, and wasn&#x27;t greasy on my face at all. There were a few semi-dark blemishes on my chin and after putting the moisturizer on, the blemishes were nearly blended in with the rest of my skin tone!  Aveeno--please make a spot concealer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid it&#x27;d leave a chalky consistency on my face but it went on evenly and I didn&#x27;t have to rub it in too much to get it spread evenly. Love this tinted moisturizer...I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Nice and works great!</li>
            <li> Moisturizer, sunscreen, and coverage in one. Easy on, evens out skin tone without looking &#x27;cakey&#x27;. Bottle lasts forever - two light squirts is enough.</li>
            <li> Nice color and coverage. The product sold in the stores seemed more whitish so I was surprised with the color. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Not this product. I bought the light to medium tint and it was orange on my face. Maybe I needed a lighter shade but this was the only shade available at my drugstore, and I normally wear light foundation. The worst aspect of this product is it made me break out. The dispenser says \\&quot;oil free - noncomedogenic.\\&quot; I have to say for an oil free product it feels very oily and sat on my skin, making it greasy. I bought this product because I love Aveeno&#x27;s daily moisturizing body wash. It is wonderful and not greasy, and I thought this product would be too. Nope, and I&#x27;m out 20 bucks.</li>
            <li> Looking for an inexpensive tinted moisturizer for casual everyday wear (I&#x27;m a longtime fan of Laura Mercier, the best, but pricey), decided to give Aveeno a try as I like other Aveeno products. All I can say is, yuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good: (still haven&#x27;t found anything good about it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Too yellow. Have to coat my face with bronzer to get the yellow out (I&#x27;m fair-haired and fair-skinned, with blue eyes). Which kind of defeats the purpose of using tinted moisturizer, which should be a light makeup.&lt;br /&gt;2) Too shiny, makes my face look like a mirror. A little \\&quot;illumination\\&quot; with an age product is nice - but it&#x27;s like they mixed it with Mazola corn oil. I put it on, and then soak two oil-absorbing tissues trying to get the shine off.&lt;br /&gt;3) Too pasty, tough to spread, visible on the skin - and don&#x27;t get it anywhere near your hairline or eyebrows as this stuff really shows up on hair, and is tough to get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, into the trash it goes. Guess Laura Mercier gets a little more of my business, until I can find a more affordable alternative that works.</li>
            <li> My skin is getting older and I really like this combo of moisturizer and a little color.  It blends in really well and many people think I don&#x27;t wear makeup. I have used it for years anad I think it has helped my skin keep from looking older.  Aveeneo comes through with the answer with this long lasting moisture and color blended together.  Hope it never get discontinued!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would like a sheen or &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; thing it would look fake. My husband doesn&#x27;t like much makeup on me, so he notices glitter, shimmery makeup. This product provides a natural looking glow.</li>
            <li> If you like makeup/moisturizer/sunscreen in one tube you will love this. And the price is better than many similar products out there.</li>
            <li> I use this daily to cover the veins and brown spots (fewer these days, thanks to cosmetic treatments!), so I&#x27;m not so self conscious about my hands and forearms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a no-brainer!  Protect from further sun damage, and improve one&#x27;s appearance!</li>
            <li> I have olive skin and I use this instead of makeup to shade parts of my face and make them stand out better.&lt;br /&gt;Its a really great product and can be blended with different lotions if it is too dark for your own skin color.</li>
            <li> When its applied it gives a look of a good even suntan.easy to apply.one of the best out.will continue to use.</li>
            <li> It works okay. The shade isn&#x27;t great with my skin tone, but it isn&#x27;t foundation. Probably won&#x27;t buy it acain.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different tinted moisturizers and I like this one.  It has just a little coverage, which is all I need, and a nice finish (not too shiny, greasy, or sparkly).  A little goes a long way.  In fact, one full pump dispenses way too much and there is no way to get it back in the bottle.  About a half a squirt is all you need.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a fantastic price on amazon, i wouldn&#x27;t try it in the drugstore cause of price. It firms my skin, but i only apply lightly on my cheeks, forehead , nose and chin. It looks natural like this, it doesn&#x27;t look right with an all over application on my face, but i have very light skin. i like the glow it gives my face, and hours later, it blends and looks very natural, and soft!</li>
            <li> Check the expiration date.  Mine had expired nearly one year ago.  I sent it right back.</li>
            <li> Lotion and makeup in 1. It smells like sunscreen thats just the one thing i didnt like but its great for everyday use</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It can be used alone for a &#x27;&#x27;natural&#x27;&#x27; day or under foundation to add a little help. It makes me look glow, but not sweaty. Price on amazon is great. In stores its $20</li>
            <li> This is absolutely NOT what I was looking for.  I used to use Burt&#x27;s Bees tinted moisturizer, but they don&#x27;t make it anymore.  It went ON like a moisturizer, but it had some color and some coverage.  This stuff is just a disgusting non-human color that sits on the top of your skin.  There is NOTHING natural about the way it looks, and it doesn&#x27;t even rub into your skin.  Again, it just sits on top of it.  I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Favorite makeup, great price!</li>
            <li> I must admit that I can&#x27;t live without this.  makes my skin smother and also gives it a glow that I can&#x27;t find with other brands.  I also Love the pump because it keeps the bacteria out. No joke, I tell all my friends about this product even though I have acress to discount on industry makeup.  The price has gone up considerably since I started to use it and I can see why.  Thanks Aveeno.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before from different retailers and it has a very pleasant/pretty fragrance, that&#x27;s one of the reasons I choose to buy it.  This one that I purchased on Amazon does not have the same smell, it actually smells pretty bad. I will never buy this product from this site again</li>
            <li> Only used a few times and am satisfied!</li>
            <li> I took 1 star away because it gives me a thick feeling on my face. It is definitely far away from sheer.</li>
            <li> My 50-year old fair skin needs a nice even look to it and after tons of research, I decided my solution was a tinted moisturizer.  Once I determined what product I was going to use, I also decided that I wasn&#x27;t going to spend more than $20 on the product unless it came with Justin Timberlake applying it to my face.  I realize I was asking a lot of a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the first thing I learned about this type of product is that you have to start with clean skin.  I actually apply another moisturizer first, hey, I &#x27;m 50 ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first applied this product, I only applied it one side of my face.  Yes, this sounds nuts but comparing your natural skin to the product you are relying on to cover up your natural skin&#x27;s imperfections is huge.  Also, it gives you a good sense of how much product you should apply and where.  Once I was comfortable with the results, I went with the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, I started out this review by saying I have fair skin.  I think this product is better for people with not so fair skin.  If my skin is not sun-kissed, even the lightest color that is available still seems heavy on my face.  However, I will say, that if I was going out at night, it served as well as a foundation and it seemed more natural than a foundation.  Also, don&#x27;t forget your neck.  If you it put on your face, you need to put it on your neck, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product was the packaging and this is where I am going to stress that this is the main reason why I give it ONE STAR:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  You have no way of knowing when you are getting to the end of the product.&lt;br /&gt;2.  You have no way of twisting off the top to get the remaining part of the product out when the pump stops working.&lt;br /&gt;3  You can&#x27;t recycle the bottle because you can&#x27;t wash out the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;4.  1-3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just think in this day and age and the fact that Aveeno wants us to see them as offering us NATURAL products insteadof some chemical crazy formula, they would come up with better packaging.  I like their night time cream, it comes in a small tub, I know exactly how much I have left, why can&#x27;t the tinted moisturizer do the same?  Also, I can rinse out the little tub and RECYCLE it along with the box it comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aveeno makes excellent products for the price.  Just proceed with caution.  I strongly encourage you to read the application instructions and do a \\&quot;test side\\&quot; as I mentioned earlier.</li>
            <li> Did,t absorb.  Dissapointed</li>
            <li> I like it but.... its too dark to my skin tone :( have to mix it with a lighter foundation</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely. Great moisturizer/cover-up, but sheer. Watch the color shades. I could&#x27;ve gone the next shade lighter.</li>
            <li> Love this product, gives your face a radiant glow, let&#x27;s your skin show through while giving it some color.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup but this has just enough toner to even my skin out a bit and has a sunscreen. I&#x27;ve used this for several years!!!</li>
            <li> It is a little bit on the shiny side compared to my Mary Kay tinted moisturizer, but I do like it and the price.</li>
            <li> I bought the entire line because I believe that products are created and tested to work well with each other. I used the daily cleanser and then put some of this on my face. It does NOT feel like a moisturizer, but rather a foundation. But to clarify, it doesn&#x27;t provide the coverage of a foundation; Simply the feel, texture, and thickness was that of a foundation. With a tinted moisturizer, I expect something balmy, that moisturizes well, and provides light coverage. Instead, this made my face feel dry, as if I didn&#x27;t use moisturizer at all. Because I hate making returns, I simply started mixing in a little of the re-texturizing cream and the problem is solved. What&#x27;s more, I have naturally oily skin, so I couldn&#x27;t imagine this working well for those with normal to dry skin unless you apply a separate moisturizer first.</li>
            <li> Comes off very orange on me and it has glitter in the product... no thanks.</li>
            <li> Very nice coverage it is amazing how it works i have a fair skin</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with this product - This product is wonderful - Very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;I love it - Was very happy with Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> The front of product box I received indicates it is light to medium tint.  You don&#x27;t see that anywhere on the picture of the product on Amazon or in the description.  As an African American female, the tint is too light for my skin.  I could have used a medium to dark tint (if they have such a product).  It might work if I use a little under my normal makeup but I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered it at all had I seen the tint color information in the description.  Aveeno is still a wonderful brand but my review is specifically about this product and lack of clear information when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I love how moisturizing this makes me feel -- a lot of tinted moisturizers feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s a little yellowish in tone.</li>
            <li> This product is so good. My face looks fresh and healthy and I am 67 years old. No caking in lines of my face.&lt;br /&gt; A truly great find.</li>
            <li> Too shiny on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because someone recommended it to me.&lt;br /&gt;I guess what works for some does not work for others...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as this was my first tinted moisturizer I bought, but it has 30 SPF so I gave it a try.  My face feels and looks like it \\&quot;glows\\&quot; with health and vitality.  I will never use foundation again, it lasts all day long.  I have dry skin but can break out easily, my face did not break out and actually feels better even after I remove it at the end of the day.  If you have oily skin you may not like this as it shines and glows and may look more oily.  I have never had that to my skin and it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> I love Aveeno products but this one doesn&#x27;t do much for me. I was hoping for a number of things, and I found this didn&#x27;t deliver too well on any of them. One, I&#x27;d like some coverage -- nothing too heavy but not too light either. It does give my pale skin some coverage, but it is a touch too unsubstantial and way too orange for my liking. The light-to-medium shade definitely leans more toward medium with this product, like applying a peachy foundation to the skin. The best way to use it (for me) is to blend it with another paler shade that has more coverage. This warms it up a bit and there&#x27;s the 30 SPF bonus to go along with it. I also am not too fond of the scent. It&#x27;s not overwhelming or anything but I expect something more subtle from Aveeno. It also -- and for me this is worst of all -- does not blend or soak in too well on my skin. I&#x27;ll apply it alone and it&#x27;s pretty obvious I&#x27;m wearing some tinted moisturizer. I have to blend and blot a lot to make it not look like I&#x27;m veering into orange territory. My eyebrows end up looking a bit coated, etc., so after I add this I have to go subtract trouble spots. That said I think it&#x27;ll work okay blended with another foundation to customize the color, or to a plain moisturizer to make a quick &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; look. Sadly for me it doesn&#x27;t work on its own so well. There are a lot of cheaper drug store tinted moisturizers and BB creams that do a better job than this one.</li>
            <li> i dont like to put so much stuff on my face so this is good as they moisturize and serves as some sort of primer/ foundation and sun protection</li>
            <li> I love this tinted moisturizer. It is not too heavy and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. Stays on all day and looks natural. Great for mature skin.</li>
            <li> I am a light complexion African American female and the product works for what it is intended for, keep in mind that it is not foundation, it is a moisturizer and it is only tinted, so it only requires 1 pump.  It will cover minor imperfections while providing a nice amount of moisture and a beautiful glow to your skin.  Aveeno did a great job with this product but it is not meant to cover any deep discoloration or other major skin issues like foundation will. It should be applied very lightly, message into your skin and you will find that this product is great.</li>
            <li> Great product for everyday use. Provides a light, even color correcting coverage while moisturizing your skin.</li>
            <li> nice and smooth but I just wish the color would melt into my skin as well...when I wash my hands after applying, it washes off.  It does make my skin look more even.</li>
            <li> It is light and still gives good coverage. It also has sunscreen. The price was lower than in the stores. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Lately I have tried several different tinted moisturizers because I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s now, and I need to get extra serious about sunscreen and moisture.    This is the only one that I&#x27;ve gotten a compliment while wearing it. And not just from anyone, but from the woman who waxes my eyebrows (she has also done facials on me). I was wearing it a few days ago with nothing else on my skin at all, and twice she raved about how great my skin looked! She has never complimented my skin before, and I haven&#x27;t gotten a compliment from anyone on my skin in at least 2 years. This is the one I&#x27;ll continue to use!    I have noticed though that I need to use it sparingly, I have the light to medium, and if I apply too much it does look a little orange. It is thicker and has more color than other tinted moisturizers, which is a good thing, I don&#x27;t need to use as much, and it will last longer. It moisturized well, and did not dry out my skin.    I have always had good luck with Aveeno products, and this is no exception. :-)</li>
            <li> This product is very thick and almost orange in color with the consistency of a foundation. It settled right into my pores, making me look just awful.  I did not get the medium, I got the light to medium shade, so I can only imagine how dark the medium must look. I used it exactly twice and it immediately caused my rosacea to flare up on my nose. So if you have sensitive skin, or rosacea issues, you might want to try something else. Also, I did not find out what they used for SPF protection and this contains oxybenzone. Do your research, this is not a product you want on your face.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s a protective moisturizer that is supposed to be good for the skin and oh boy, it covers great! For it not being a foundation, it does the job of one. I will be purchasing this item again :)</li>
            <li> I love it. Its all I need it moisturize and gives me a nature glow. I am 60 now and being a redhead the spf is a plus. Way to go kèep a small bottle in my purse for touch up during the day</li>
            <li> gives me a good natural color</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and I don&#x27;t like wearing makeup, I like the natural look and this does all that for me. The only thing i don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t give you options on color.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for light coverage with sunscreen, this is a great product. Not nearly as heavy as base or makeup, this product nevertheless evens out skin tone and provides sunscreen protection. My skin does look better when I use this every day. However, if I am going to be outside for a long time, I use a heavier sunscreen underneath.</li>
