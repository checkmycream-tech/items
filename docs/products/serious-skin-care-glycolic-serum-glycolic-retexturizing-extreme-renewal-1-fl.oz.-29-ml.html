            <li> Product works ok, I did not have significant improvement in overall skin texture or appearance.</li>
            <li> I like the product but do not like the packaging. Prefer just a squeeze bottle and no pump.</li>
            <li> The products have done wonders for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Morning Magic is just as the name MAGIC to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serious skincare Glycolic retexuring make my skin feel so fresh and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;KUDOS to both products.</li>
            <li> When used with the glycolic cream it makes the skin much firmer and supple.  Gives a younger and clean skin look.</li>
            <li> Great quality and service. Received it in timely manor. Will buy again from this vendor. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Seems to do what it claims, retexturizes and smoothes out the skin, light tingling sensation upon first few applications. Too intense for me to use every day, I used it every other morning under a moisturizer. Slightly sticky, not too bad..</li>
            <li> I love the way this serum glides on the skin. It dries quickly, too.  I use it twice a day usually, but especially at night under the A Defiance Retinol Night Cream.  My skin feels really soft in the morning. It has a pleasant smell as well, and I am sensitive to fragrances. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything for me.  I was looking for something to calm my skin and make it glow.  I am now using an acne cream.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I had heard that serums are better for the skin. The skin seems to really like this serum.  It drinks it up and looks firmer.</li>
            <li> I actually use this stuff to control my hormone related adult acne. It is a great exfoliator, and it does a nice job of keeping my skin smooth and clear. I ran out, and I noticed the difference within a few days. My skin started breaking out and was more oily. Great product!</li>
            <li> Works great at exfoliating skin &amp; lightening spots etc. I use this all winer along with the glycolic cream to counteract the damage the sun &amp; hormones do to my skin in the summer. In a few weeks my skin is always smooth &amp; clear.</li>
            <li> Love all the SSC products! If you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t use everyday. Great for acne prone, older skin.</li>
            <li> The product shipped on time and I like it -  though have not noticed a distinct change in my skin I know that it will over usage. It is a good product.</li>
            <li> As I get older my skin is harder to keep looking good,  but this product works.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Thank you again the shipper so prompt. So very happy I can continue to use a product with out financing it!&lt;br /&gt;Works gently with super results and I am 57&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> I used to use Peter Thomas Roth and I find this serum to be just as effective and a much more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have bought this serum twice now, I like it so much.  My skin tolerates using it both in the am and pm. I like that it makes my skin look great and is still affordable.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum. I am using the retinol serum now, but I will probably switch back to this in the summer. It really brightens the skin and fades discoloration. Also, my skin has been sensitive to all other glycolic acids I have used before, but not with this one. I was impressed! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very speedy delivery.  Only been using for a few days so haven&#x27;t seen any results yet.  Feels nice though!</li>
            <li> Smells weird but seems to work well. Its not oily and leaves skin soft. I use it at night before bed, my sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t mind it at all.</li>
            <li> i have been using Serious Skin Care for years and was so happy to see such a extensive collection at great prices on Amazon!! this one is a great resurfacing facial treat for your skin. its gentle but so effective. it helps cell turn over, evening out skin tone, improving the feel and over all look of your face!! it will make you glow!! and it has a great measured dosing applicator so you know exactly how much to use. it will make your pretty face glow!!</li>
            <li> I received my order very quickly and love the product.  I am 52 years old and have always taken good care of my skin but my skin seemed to had reached a plateau.  I did research online and decided to add glycolic to my regimen.  I decided on Serious Skin Care because it was affordable, and WOW WOW WOW!  I have been using the glycolic line for about 2 weeks and I am already seeing the difference in my skin.  My face is so much brighter, my pores are almost invisible, and my skin stay&#x27;s moisturized all day long.  Since I started using the Serious Skin Care glycolic line, I have had several people comment on how beautiful my skin looks.  I highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li> Love the application, the feel,I even love the bottle.  My skin feels smoother........cant wait till I use it long enough to give better feed back.</li>
