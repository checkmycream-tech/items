            <li>This product is nice...</li>
            <li>Its ok smell wise.</li>
            <li>that was great and smelled just like the ocean, but its still pretty good.</li>
            <li>Feeling more confident in purchasing the cologne with Amazon, the $22 price tag was very reasonable and this item arrived in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>it could have been one of the best Nautica colognes out there and quite possibly the rest of the scent community.</li>
            <li>Women love it and that was all the motivation that I needed to wear it.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better smelling colognes I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this and the price</li>
            <li>awesome considering Texas notorious long 100 degree day stretchs in the summer.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product to those who can afford it.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone who always use more than they should...</li>
            <li>First off, it came fairly quick, the bottle was intact, and it came in the original box.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh scent is not over-powering and could be worn by men at any age.</li>
            <li>We love the fresh water scent and it last for 6+ hours.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t the exact scent</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>This was my second kind of Nautica cologne, I already owned Nautica Blue.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t waste your money or buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li>First let me say on first spray it comes off powerful but it quickly fades so it cause for a heavy spray</li>
            <li>A little too soft in scent for my fiance&#x27;s taste, but it is nice.</li>
            <li>We live in Dallas, Tx</li>
            <li>Just have to put a little more on to get a scent that lasts very long.</li>

            <li> Like the other Nautica colognes I&#x27;ve tried, it follows a pattern of above average-quality scents that go away quicker than you&#x27;d like.</li>

            <li> Oceans Nautica had the potential to be a homerun but ends up just short of the warning track. That does not mean its a bad scent oh no way Jose!!! Had it just been bumped up on the silage and longevity... it could have been one of the best Nautica colognes out there and quite possibly the rest of the scent community. But sadly it does fall short.</li>
            <li> After sampling this fragrance in a magazine, I decided to get this as a gift for my husband.  The department store price was ridiculous -- so I checked out Amazon and eBay.  Feeling more confident in purchasing the cologne with Amazon, the $22 price tag was very reasonable and this item arrived in perfect condition.  It&#x27;s fresh scent is not over-powering and could be worn by men at any age.</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift. He loved it. Awesome, clean scent.</li>
            <li> This product is nice... A little too soft in scent for my fiance&#x27;s taste, but it is nice. Just have to put a little more on to get a scent that lasts very long.</li>
            <li> This was my second kind of Nautica cologne, I already owned Nautica Blue. I like the scent. It wasn&#x27;t the exact scent I smelled a few years ago that was great and smelled just like the ocean, but its still pretty good. Women love it and that was all the motivation that I needed to wear it.</li>
            <li> One of the best smells one could ever find. I highly recommend this for anyone who always use more than they should... its a smell that is hard to over do.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my guy. First off, it came fairly quick, the bottle was intact, and it came in the original box. We love the fresh water scent and it last for 6+ hours. I smelled it on him after a long day of sweating. We live in Dallas, Tx so thats awesome considering Texas notorious long 100 degree day stretchs in the summer. This is a good pick for those who&#x27;s body chemistry favors aquatic fragrances. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Smells like it is out of date, and you can&#x27;t refund it... don&#x27;t waste your money or buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> I like this nautical , it&#x27;s light and the size is perfect for me , seller sent it Fady shopping and I will order again</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on review, but its not that great. Its ok smell wise. It leaves foam on your cloth.</li>
            <li> The ladies love this cologne!</li>
            <li> This is one of the better smelling colognes I&#x27;ve owned. Like the other Nautica colognes I&#x27;ve tried, it follows a pattern of above average-quality scents that go away quicker than you&#x27;d like. Overall, I&#x27;m a fan of Nautica scents for both genders.</li>
            <li> My son loves the smell of this cologne and so do I....</li>
            <li> Bad smell does not smell like the ocean  mabey lake Ontario when it caught on fire. Very dissatisfied. Dont buy.</li>
            <li> great price and product.</li>
            <li> First let me say on first spray it comes off powerful but it quickly fades so it cause for a heavy spray down but it will mellow out 10-20 minutes and let me tell you ppl always compliment me on my smell. a female co worker said this \\&quot;Its a drive by of sex n freshness\\&quot; lol.. go buy it $20 bucks and its a great addition to the group</li>
            <li> This has been my new cologne of choice for the past 2 years now.  My girl goes crazy everytime she catches a wiff.  I strongly recommend this product to those who can afford it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this and the price</li>
