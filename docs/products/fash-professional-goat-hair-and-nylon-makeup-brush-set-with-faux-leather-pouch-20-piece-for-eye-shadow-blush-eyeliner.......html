            <li>I have been using different kinds of Brush, but this the perfect brush set.</li>
            <li>so i guesss they are ok</li>

            <li>The girls were excited when they opened them and love the product.  </li>
            <li>As for the Brushes; I am so happy with my right choice buying them, they&#x27;re soft enough on my skin and work wonderfully for the job to be done.</li>
            <li>and if it does, its an easy fix.</li>
            <li>just fine.  </li>
            <li>I love the feel of the brushes against my skin .. nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the nice collection in a neat roll.</li>
            <li>these are worth more than i paid for..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too cheap</li>
            <li>If you wanna be cheap, go to Fredmeyer and get some there.</li>
            <li>When I tried to clean one of the eye shadow brushes the bristles sort of went awry,but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>This is a super nice brush set, super soft, I love the biggest brush for powder</li>
            <li>After one use the brush hairs started falling out and even if i clean them, it leaves some makeup on it.</li>
            <li>, I really dont know anything about the brushes and the quality about them, but as far as my wife is so happy about them for me its a winner.</li>
            <li>So when i recieved this in the mail i was super excited..</li>
            <li>and she just love it so much..</li>
            <li>, it is super soft and does an amazing job contouring.</li>
            <li>the shadow brushes arent very stiff but they do hold color pigments pretty good, but the way they are made.. not so good.</li>
            <li>Overall a good purchase and definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>It has all your necessary brushes to apply your makeup on nicely.  </li>
            <li>Kit contains all the sizes she wanted and they are all in a fun pouch for ease of carrying in purse.</li>
            <li>They are definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how great the quality was, given the very low price I paid for them!!!!</li>
            <li>Ordered these brushes because the price was right</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft, yet easy to apply makeup.</li>
            <li>I do wish the kits contained more small brushes, for eyeliner, lip liner, shadow and brows in place of all the larger brushes, which I won&#x27;t use nearly as often, but all in all, this was a GREAT bargain!!</li>
            <li>the case is pretty nifty</li>
            <li>I like the eye shadow brushes pretty well, although the hairs are splayed on some of them and they shed quite a lot.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t have a funny smell.</li>
            <li>I really do adore these brush ad would repurchase again!</li>
            <li>It didnt apply the makeup right, and the powder really wouldnt stick on to these brushes.</li>
            <li>Other than that a nice set</li>
            <li>and I saw a positive review on YouTube.</li>
            <li>I love my pink brushes and pouch.</li>
            <li>but now i am very upset...</li>
            <li>They are very flimsy and bristles fall out and on your face.</li>
            <li>this product really met every expectation i wanted in using make-up brushes....</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had too much of a problem with the brushes shedding  and the make up stays on the brush</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.  </li>
            <li>The package came to my house in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>So thank you so much.</li>
            <li>and I must say that I absolutely adore them.</li>
            <li>They are of a decent quality, they tend to shed a bit,</li>
            <li>Sure they shed a little, but what brushes don&#x27;t?  </li>
            <li>I am very upset because the hair of the brushes are coming out, i cant even use it on my clients, i thougth it was professional brushes as it says</li>
            <li>They actually work pretty well.</li>
            <li>Thought the smell has died down, when I first got this set, the smell of the pouch filled the entire room.</li>
            <li>thanks for the low price</li>
            <li>First of all I&#x27;d like to appreciate the seller help and fast response to my problem; they sent me a wrong item at first and when I contacted them they apologized and sent the brushes right away.</li>
            <li>Not sure I would purchase again, but they are fine for traveling.</li>
            <li>I use them now on a daily basis, mainly to do my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only givingt 3 stars because the foundation brush &amp; a few of teh eyebrushes were ok, everything else was simply trash.</li>
            <li>Anyone who already owns any quality (&#x27;spensive) brushes would be disappointed, I&#x27;m sure, but they are fine in limited use for me.</li>

            <li> I use these brushes everyday and they barely shed, very soft, and pick up and blend color well.</li>
            <li> is a fake, because it pretty much turned into rubber when i let it sit on my glass vanity mirror &amp; started stripping away.</li>
            <li> The face brushes are nice, although they shed like crazy, too, and take forever to dry when they are washed.</li>
            <li> Long story short, they shed, with every brush stroke</li>
            <li> The metal is a bit loose from the wooden stick</li>
            <li> My only complaint is how much the pink pouch smells.  </li>
            <li> The brushes were not soft at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased these sets of brush not to long ago</li>
            <li> The Fash brushes are not particularly soft, and they tend to shed (which is to be expected with goat hair brushes).</li>
            <li> Actually, I brought them to use on my cruise in a few days.</li>
            <li> I wish the case it comes in was not pepto pink though.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not much of a make up person</li>
            <li> The brushes were not what I expected.</li>
            <li> just minimal.</li>
            <li> Really bad cheap material!!!!.....hard on our face</li>
            <li> I am not a huge fan of these brushes.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s ok,but I wish I had known the brush would  hold the makeup,but it doesn&#x27;t....</li>
            <li> theyre not good quality &amp; the so called leather case</li>
            <li> Worse brushes I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tested the brushes because I don&#x27;t want to get them dirty.</li>
            <li> crap</li>

            <li> I love my pink brushes and pouch. I haven&#x27;t tested the brushes because I don&#x27;t want to get them dirty. Actually, I brought them to use on my cruise in a few days. I love the feel of the brushes against my skin .. nice and soft.</li>
            <li> So when i recieved this in the mail i was super excited..but when i started to use the brushes the hairs on them started to shed everywhere and one brush actually broke off (the white stem brooke off from the pink)i do still use them and it comes with alot of brushes that i probaly dont know how to use or ever will use.</li>
            <li> I previously left a review for this product. I absolutely love the brushes. The only thing I would change would have been to insert a card of some type that explains what each brush is for.</li>
            <li> I am very upset because the hair of the brushes are coming out, i cant even use it on my clients, i thougth it was professional brushes as it says.. I wish i can return the item and or they can give me my mobey back i paid for a product wich was supposed to be sold for $80 but it said i was saving that money, so thats why i ordered but now i am very upset... If i could rate it back i will not even give one star..</li>
            <li> this set is OK. the case is pretty nifty but ive had better. the brushes are not the best, but some are good. the stippling brush does NOT hold up to liquid foundation at ALL. it wont even spread it. the facwe brushes are ok and the foundation brush does pretty good. the shadow brushes arent very stiff but they do hold color pigments pretty good, but the way they are made.. not so good. the do shed and the handles are falling off already.</li>
            <li> well I bought this thinking I had a deal,but it wasn&#x27;t...I mean it&#x27;s ok,but I wish I had known the brush would  hold the makeup,but it doesn&#x27;t....just wish I would have did more research on it,,,,,</li>
            <li> My lady needed some new brushes and this fit the need great for her. Thanks for the nice collection in a neat roll.</li>
            <li> This is a super nice brush set, super soft, I love the biggest brush for powder and I really love the angled contour brush, it is super soft and does an amazing job contouring. This is a great set at a really great price!</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money! The brushes shed a lot! theyre not good quality &amp; the so called leather case is a fake, because it pretty much turned into rubber when i let it sit on my glass vanity mirror &amp; started stripping away. I&#x27;m only givingt 3 stars because the foundation brush &amp; a few of teh eyebrushes were ok, everything else was simply trash.</li>
            <li> I augmented my higher-end brushes with these recently. The Fash brushes are not particularly soft, and they tend to shed (which is to be expected with goat hair brushes). They are a good value and I would recommend for beginners.</li>
            <li> They are okay, If you are wanting sturdy brushes these are not for you. They are very flimsy and bristles fall out and on your face. I would not buy these brushes or the brand FASH brushes!</li>
            <li> Ordered the brush set yesterday,recieved them today (!!!!). They actually work pretty well. I used most of them today.When I tried to clean one of the eye shadow brushes the bristles sort of went awry,but that&#x27;s fine. Overall a good purchase and definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Starter brushes for my daughter.. I wish the case it comes in was not pepto pink though. Other than that a nice set I think</li>
            <li> this product really met every expectation i wanted in using make-up brushes.... very pleased indeed. will recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> Loved it!! The onli thing i did not like is that not every brush has a plastic protector. Still it works really good for me!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes were recommended by a make up artist.  I&#x27;m very pleased with them.  Sure they shed a little, but what brushes don&#x27;t?  I like them.</li>
            <li> The items shipped to my house the correct time which is based on the confirm ordered. I have been using different kinds of Brush, but this the perfect brush set. It has everything I need for my make-up. Good product.</li>
            <li> I  recieved these brushes about 2 weeks ago.  I haven&#x27;t had too much of a problem with the brushes shedding  and the make up stays on the brush just fine.  I use them now on a daily basis, mainly to do my eyes.  My only complaint is how much the pink pouch smells.  Thought the smell has died down, when I first got this set, the smell of the pouch filled the entire room.</li>
            <li> its a great kit with the stuff being high quality. i&#x27;m not much of a make up person so i guesss they are ok</li>
            <li> I purchased 4 of this product for my daughters and their families.  The girls were excited when they opened them and love the product.  It has all your necessary brushes to apply your makeup on nicely.  The savings were incredible.  Thanks so much.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I brought them for my daughter, who dose makeup.  Se love them and the fact that there were all the brushes she need</li>
            <li> No resultaron ser de la calidad esperada. Las hebras de las brochas se desprenden desde el primer uso y quedan pegadas en la cara, ademas la calidad del estuche en el que vienen no es de muy buena calidad, LAS COSTURAS SE VEN HORRIBLES. No me parece que sean profesionales.</li>
            <li> Long story short, they shed, with every brush stroke You are better off buying brushes from walmart or even the $ store.</li>
            <li> The package came to my house in a very timely manner. Great price but the brush roll has a funny smell and the brushes shed. I am not a huge fan of these brushes.</li>
            <li> Ordered these brushes because the price was right and I saw a positive review on YouTube. I like the eye shadow brushes pretty well, although the hairs are splayed on some of them and they shed quite a lot. The face brushes are nice, although they shed like crazy, too, and take forever to dry when they are washed. Not sure I would purchase again, but they are fine for traveling. Anyone who already owns any quality (&#x27;spensive) brushes would be disappointed, I&#x27;m sure, but they are fine in limited use for me.</li>
            <li> Received the brushes on time,lovely colour brush set all the brushes was there,brushes work well in applying the make up</li>
            <li> First of all I&#x27;d like to appreciate the seller help and fast response to my problem; they sent me a wrong item at first and when I contacted them they apologized and sent the brushes right away. So thank you so much. As for the Brushes; I am so happy with my right choice buying them, they&#x27;re soft enough on my skin and work wonderfully for the job to be done. I have every thing I need in this set. The big Fan brush is awesome I love it the most.</li>
            <li> these brushes are sucky. After one use the brush hairs started falling out and even if i clean them, it leaves some makeup on it. crap</li>
            <li> i was always told that target had the best brushes...well that just went out the window..these are worth more than i paid for..thanks for the low price so i can have some quality brushes. I threw away every brush that i ahve used and will start over with these</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They don&#x27;t shed at all. They don&#x27;t have a funny smell. The metal is a bit loose from the wooden stick but it doesn&#x27;t bother me since they haven&#x27;t fallen out and if it does, its an easy fix. Works very good. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> These are ok they don&#x27;t work the material it&#x27;s too cheap&lt;br /&gt;The Kirkland is way better  do if your going to use these font buy but if your going to put them as a display like me get them</li>
            <li> This was just what my daughter was looking for for Xmas.  Kit contains all the sizes she wanted and they are all in a fun pouch for ease of carrying in purse.</li>
            <li> Bristles fall out all over your face. Worse brushes I have ever bought. Just buy the nice MAC brushes and you&#x27;ll pay for them once then probably never have to buy brushes again. If you wanna be cheap, go to Fredmeyer and get some there. Stay away from this rubbish.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these brushes, I love the case they come in. I use them every day, there&#x27;s everything I need in one pouch. They&#x27;re very soft, yet easy to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> The brushes were not soft at all. Everytime I applied my blush my face would start to itch beacuse of the brush. It didnt apply the makeup right, and the powder really wouldnt stick on to these brushes. The brushes were not what I expected.I do not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. They are definitely worth the price. I use these brushes everyday and they barely shed, very soft, and pick up and blend color well. They are a great value and I would definitely repurchase these again!</li>
            <li> Really bad cheap material!!!!.....hard on our face👎👎👎 I do not recommend this and wish I would of return them and get my money back!!!!</li>
            <li> this is really great the price is amazing too,perfect gift what I love is just perfect set all I give 5 stars for this item i give to my friend as a gift and she just love it so much..</li>
            <li> The product is amazing! Im really happy with everything including the packing and the shipment! The best thing? The shipment arrived on time!&lt;br /&gt;I love what i got and if you have the oportunity to purchase anything, take it!</li>
            <li> I was surprised how great the quality was, given the very low price I paid for them!!!! I do wish the kits contained more small brushes, for eyeliner, lip liner, shadow and brows in place of all the larger brushes, which I won&#x27;t use nearly as often, but all in all, this was a GREAT bargain!!</li>
            <li> The brushes shed when you wash them and when you use them. I don&#x27;t reccomend these products at all if you want good brushes buy from[...]</li>
            <li> I purchased these sets of brush not to long ago and I must say that I absolutely adore them. They are of a decent quality, they tend to shed a bit, just minimal. I like how they apply eyeahadows and blush and bronzer when applied with the face brushes is amazing. I really do adore these brush ad would repurchase again!</li>
            <li> She was just so happy about this brush set I had to order it, I really dont know anything about the brushes and the quality about them, but as far as my wife is so happy about them for me its a winner. She says they are great btw</li>
