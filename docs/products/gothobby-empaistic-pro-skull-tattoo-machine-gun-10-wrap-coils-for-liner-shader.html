            <li>It runs so good that I had 2 order another to replace the ones that I have.</li>
            <li>these are not just collection machines they run good all you need to do is change springs</li>
            <li>This thing works as good as my 300 dollar machines</li>
            <li>he liked the weight and said it runs great..</li>
            <li>thought it  was a good liner ..</li>
            <li>LOL:)</li>
            <li>,i might buy a skull spring screw,but i like the one that commes on them ,it breaks up the look of the machine,and it nice looking oval top on it where you can get a good grip on it to tune the machine lol</li>
            <li>product is good, works fine!</li>
            <li>product is good, works fine!</li>

            <li>Nice weight to this machine.</li>
            <li>so you can use a lite grip and it balances out good,but i buy the matching skull grips for looks,it a nice show piece</li>

            <li>the tube literally stops at the top of the tube vise and won&#x27;t go through to allow for adjustment of the tube length in relation to the needle..</li>
            <li>otherwise i wouldn&#x27;t have been able to do anything with this machine...</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a cool looking machine.</li>

            <li> so I&#x27;m disappointed because I really liked the one in the picture.</li>
            <li> suppose to be a shadder but lacks power not what i expected</li>
            <li> SO IT IS HARDER TO USE</li>
            <li> Got what was expected</li>
            <li> BECAUSE A LOT OF THE OTHER TATTOO GUNS ON AMAZON DON&#x27;T EVEN HAVE THE 2 HOLES TO HOOK UP THE MACHINE WITH THE 2 METAL PRONGS</li>
            <li> quieter than the other guns we have.</li>
            <li> bought the other one from fl.</li>
            <li> It was poorly assembled and a screw vibrated loose from a coil instantly, A bit heavier than I expected, I may replace the coils</li>
            <li> my husband says he loves the way it looks, but it&#x27;s very heavy in his hand, making it harder to tattoo with.</li>
            <li> the machine is a little heavy</li>
            <li> really heavy also.</li>
            <li> but customers really get a bad vibe whenever i use it on them.</li>
            <li> but my contact screw is ordinary</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll see what I mean.</li>
            <li> It keeps getting stuck so no good</li>
            <li> but I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> crazy</li>
            <li> Scary!</li>

            <li> Set it up, right out of the package. It was poorly assembled and a screw vibrated loose from a coil instantly, A bit heavier than I expected, I may replace the coils, I suppose I did buy it for the frame but I was a little disappointed. Take it apart, tune it. It&#x27;s a cool looking machine.</li>
            <li> Works ok just mess up alot</li>
            <li> because this machine puts out good work I love it. I love da skulls on the gun and I think I did good by picking amazon to shop for my tattoo gun.</li>

            <li> Great quality and packaging my only complaint is that my contact screw doesn&#x27;t have a grenade. When I ordered this machine I figured I would get one matching the one pictured but my contact screw is ordinary so I&#x27;m disappointed because I really liked the one in the picture.</li>
            <li> suppose to be a shadder but lacks power not what i expected</li>
            <li> While I will tell you that the machine itself runs like a dream and has already become my new favorite machine, the problem im having is that my tubes won&#x27;t go all the way through the tube vise... the tube literally stops at the top of the tube vise and won&#x27;t go through to allow for adjustment of the tube length in relation to the needle.. its as though the the hole one the top wasn&#x27;t drilled at the same size which doesn&#x27;t make sense... and the machine i got is not the one in the picture here... it has a front facing thumb nut not the side facing thumb nut... i really don&#x27;t know what to do... luckily my tubes are adjustable otherwise i wouldn&#x27;t have been able to do anything with this machine...</li>
            <li> If i wanted to buy this machine for the frame then I would be okay. All it needs are new coils and springs and it&#x27;s ready. The one I recieved was okay,but try to adjust it and you&#x27;ll see what I mean. Otherwise,  decent product.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a present to tattoo artist friend of mine. He loved it! Its so affordable and actually works! It arrived right on time and in great condition.</li>
            <li> Our tattoo artist of 19 years was astounded at the quality of this machine for the price we paid. Nice weight to this machine. Would definitely recommend to the professionals.</li>
            <li> bought this for a friend and he had it within a week. He says it runs smooth and that he is very happy with it</li>
            <li> product is good, works fine! It was what I expect.Thanks I would recomended! product is good, works fine! It was what I expect.Thanks I would recomended!</li>
            <li> Just got it way before the estimate delivery. Date exactly what the product is no more no less and very well wrapped thank you I love it</li>
            <li> Ok for a cheap machine most would think you get what you pay for but with this machine (i have it set for shading only) my shading has improve tremendously.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping super pleased with my order</li>
            <li> Came with a stripped coil screw fell out after 15 minuits Will replace coils and springs to try and make it work on the bright side amazon fully rufunded my purchase and let me keep it</li>
            <li> I ordered this machine in Oct 12 2013 and its still going strong like the day I got it. I do tattoo almost 7 days a week some times 3 a day it they not small ones so 5 stares is not enough for this machine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing tattoos for a couple years &amp; this gun is excellent! It runs so good that I had 2 order another to replace the ones that I have.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST TATTOO GUN FOR IT&#x27;S PRICE RANGE ON AMAZON I STRONGLY SUGGEST TO EVERYONE TO BUY THIS ONE BECAUSE A LOT OF THE OTHER TATTOO GUNS ON AMAZON DON&#x27;T EVEN HAVE THE 2 HOLES TO HOOK UP THE MACHINE WITH THE 2 METAL PRONGS SO IT IS HARDER TO USE AND YOU HAVE TO PULL A MACGUYVER OR A I.Q FROM JAMES BOND JUST TO USE THE TATTOO GUN LOL:)</li>
            <li> Thing runs like Forrest Gump</li>
            <li> Love this, prompt service,great price,great desighn</li>

            <li> This gun is a bit heavy but very well built and handles great if you have big hands this is a great gun</li>
            <li> these are not just collection machines they run good all you need to do is change springs and you are tattooing.i bought the other one from fl. and it runs like a high end machine,but mainly i like them for looks,and a collection of skulls,i might buy a skull spring screw,but i like the one that commes on them ,it breaks up the look of the machine,and it nice looking oval top on it where you can get a good grip on it to tune the machine lol crazy rick  ps the machine is a little heavy so you can use a lite grip and it balances out good,but i buy the matching skull grips for looks,it a nice show piece if you like skulls.if you like skulls go to face book and put in I LOVE SKULLS and have fun.........</li>
            <li> Got what was expected</li>
            <li> Poor quality...started falling apart after first use...will never purchase from this company again!</li>
            <li> Nice, really works good.</li>
            <li> It keeps getting stuck so no good</li>
            <li> great machine. pulls lines smooth, and packs color well. really heavy also. i recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> This thing works as good as my 300 dollar machines</li>
            <li> Bought this for my brother who is learning .. he liked the weight and said it runs great.. thought it  was a good liner ..</li>
            <li> This was cheap and it was missing parts of the gun. I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> After a little tuning i got it to work, and let me tell you it is by far the best machine i have! Lines are way more crisp and follow thru very nicely. By ordering this you would have done yourself a huge favor. Only problem i have is that i can not rate it 10 stars!!</li>
            <li> Must buy it lines n convert into shader with easy hookup..... Did my first tattoo with it....</li>
            <li> Got this machine and it runs great but customers really get a bad vibe whenever i use it on them. So i guess im losing $</li>
            <li> This exact machine literally blew up in my face! Scary! Investing in quality machines from now on, lesson learned. You get what you pay for I guess!</li>
            <li> Looks awesome! Has sharp edges on the skulls cuts my hand while in use... took a lot of adjustment to get it set up properly.</li>
