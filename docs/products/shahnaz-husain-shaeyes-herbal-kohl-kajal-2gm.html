            <li>I like this as it does not smudge and perfect for the waterline.</li>
            <li>It does darken my eyelashes wonderfully, but since it rubs off my eyelashes</li>

            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, and comes off very easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>There much better products on the market</li>
            <li>but maybe it works better that way.</li>
            <li>I bought this product about a month ago, and I am really pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>Lo and behold,.. Amazon had it:)</li>

            <li>I will be buying more...</li>
            <li>Love love this stuff...</li>
            <li>in.&lt;br /&gt;Bought one for my grand daughter...</li>
            <li>I love this eye liner (or eye-emphasizer.)</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find this kohl style kajal on Amazon and bought one right away.  </li>
            <li>This one is okay but does not go on as smoothly.  </li>
            <li>This is wonderful for the wet line of your eyes.</li>
            <li>doesnt smear is very dark black and easy to apply packaged good and quick delivery..its very nice soft to draw perfect eye brows and great eyeliner as well</li>
            <li>For those that can take a heavier application, this would be a fantastic product, but it does smear easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great black, glides on really easily... but also smudges very easily...</li>
            <li>This kohl eyeliner is very intensely rich in color, it is easy to apply and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It goes on really smooth and lines my waterline well.</li>
            <li>Overall it is good but not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love this the case is attractive with a little mirror for easy application viewing  WILL ORDER AGAIN</li>
            <li>Just note that if you use a really rich eye cream, or a face oil, or have oily skin, it might slide off a bit.</li>
            <li>Considering these facts i was so excited to buy this product</li>
            <li>It took some time (about 2.5 weeks) to arrive but I am loving it so far.  </li>
            <li>sweet almond)</li>
            <li>and i put it on right away.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is very creamy and easy to manipulate and it is very moisturizing to the lash line.</li>
            <li>Beautiful thick smoke</li>
            <li>I love this product, but....... it seems to smear onto the upper lid easily.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe powdering the upper lid would help, but you can not use this with cr√®me eye-shadows, or facial moisturizer on eyes, when you moisturize your face.&lt;br /&gt;  The twist applicator is fabulous, and easy to use without having to find a brush to put it on with, and stores easy in your purse.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>thats pretty fast because its coming from india.</li>
            <li>The only problem I noticed is that it tends to smudge easily.  </li>
            <li>It works as a smooth eyeliner and doesn&#x27;t smudge much creating a clean and dark line.</li>
            <li>This product goes on smoothly, but it is in very flimsy packaging similar to lipstick</li>
            <li>, the price is reasonable</li>
            <li>and she really like this one&lt;br</li>
            <li>i will be ordering more in the near future.</li>
            <li>No refunds are offered to this product if ordered from the amazon seller, and the website that I did order from charges a restocking fee and customer pays to ship back, and given the low price of the item and that I got free shipping when I ordered, it will actually cost me more to return it.</li>
            <li>but, I&#x27;d rather spend a few dollars more for a product</li>
            <li>packaging.&lt;br /&gt;The herbal formulation will have sensitive eyes watering, so be careful to apply very lightly on the eye lids only.  </li>
            <li>Not a fan AT ALL, was excited to try this product especially after seeing similar eye kajals used in Sex and the City.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately it got too hot and melted a side which turned white</li>
            <li>I like the smooth black case it come</li>
            <li>If you put it on heavy it will smear throughout the day, but luckly it is easy to correct with a swipe of the finger.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Biotique which has natural ingredients and does not irritate my sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>I was short on mine and was worried where i will get a new one.</li>
            <li>Initially i thought it is because the Kajal is new  </li>
            <li>For others with the same purchasing intentions as me, here is the complete list of ingredients that are on the back of the packaging: Petrolatum, Ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, Copernicia cerifera (carnuba) wax, Mineral oil, Phyllanthus emblica fruit extract, Terminalia bellirica fruit extract, Terminalia chebula fruit extract, Beeswax, Prunus amygdalus dulcis (</li>
            <li>I am very surprised that no other reviewers have mentioned that this product contains petrolatum, mineral oil, proplyparaben, and a black dye.</li>

            <li> not sure why this eyeliner really helped, but it did.</li>
            <li> After coming to US, I looked for one for a long time and couldn&#x27;t find one.  </li>
            <li> i received the item 3 weeks earlier than the given expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> I found that it stays on well all day if you dry your waterline before using it.</li>
            <li> I usually apply it over eyeshadow as well, but if you apply it over too much eyeshadow, it will not go on as dark for some reason.  </li>
            <li> this has a bit of a creamy texture glides on easily, very light to dramatic depending how lite or thick you apply.</li>
            <li> To make it last, I usually use primer and then face powder.  </li>
            <li> I was ordering it because I wanted something herbal due to sensitivity that I have with my eyes, in addition to the desire to have a product with no chemicals or preservatives.</li>
            <li> I was tired of expensive eye liners becoming non-existent at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The color is really dark black, but you can easly adjust the darkness by using a qtip to smear and blend.</li>
            <li> oil, Glyceryl stearate, Camphor, Propylparaben, D&amp;C Black No. 2 (CI 77266).</li>
            <li> I just received this kajal yesterday and after having it on for literally less than 4 hours, it had run about 1/2 an inch under my eyes.</li>
            <li> So, I am getting a lot less smearing with this product than others I have used since I am not rubbing my eyes anymore.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail and the kohl was all in a melted mess.  </li>
            <li> They need to add a sharpener with the lid , so you can make a point when it wears down, and become a round mound.</li>
            <li> so I am a little nervous to use it now.</li>
            <li> I found that if you use a little powder eyeshadow along the edge of the line made with this product, it will stay in place all day.</li>
            <li> used it for dance shows and photo shoots in which I needed heavy stage makeup to counter the stage lights.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure how you are supposed to sharpen this item once the point is worn down.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a Kajal that would give a thick and dark line to my lower eyes</li>
            <li> not a cute look.</li>
            <li> I was expecting an INTENSELY dark, deep black and was gravely disappointed.</li>
            <li> It gives a thick and dark line in lower eye; I personally don&#x27;t like to use it on the lid since t fails to achieve a thin line.</li>
            <li> it is a lot less expensive than a monthly prescription of Optivar.</li>
            <li> It may come with a little mirror on the lid, but this is rendered useless when the item is shipped.</li>
            <li> but it was not, plus as others have said it contains mineral oil which is irritating to some people and can clog pores around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> i was very disappointed  because i had really high expectations.</li>
            <li> The product smudges like no other and the staying power is terrible.</li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> Particularly bad if you are prone to blepharitis, which I am.</li>
            <li> I have really bad allergies and one symptom is really bad itchy eyes.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>

            <li> I like this as it does not smudge and perfect for the waterline. I can even use it on my eye lid. This product has exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Not a fan AT ALL, was excited to try this product especially after seeing similar eye kajals used in Sex and the City. I was expecting an INTENSELY dark, deep black and was gravely disappointed. The product smudges like no other and the staying power is terrible. There much better products on the market, the price is reasonable yes but, I&#x27;d rather spend a few dollars more for a product I know will last.</li>
            <li> This kohl eyeliner is very intensely rich in color, it is easy to apply and goes on smoothly. The tip helps create smaller lines. The only problem I noticed is that it tends to smudge easily.  To make it last, I usually use primer and then face powder.  I usually apply it over eyeshadow as well, but if you apply it over too much eyeshadow, it will not go on as dark for some reason.  I have not tried it without eyeshadow but maybe it works better that way.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a month ago, and I am really pleased with it. It goes on really smooth and lines my waterline well. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes, and comes off very easily with soap and water. I even fell asleep one time with it, and my eyes weren&#x27;t irritated when i woke up. Just note that if you use a really rich eye cream, or a face oil, or have oily skin, it might slide off a bit. I found that it stays on well all day if you dry your waterline before using it. It does darken my eyelashes wonderfully, but since it rubs off my eyelashes I don&#x27;t use it for that. When you apply it, the base and middle of your eyelashes gets pigmented, and so i just put mascara on the tips of my eyelashes to finish it off, and it works great. This eyeliner is one of the best I&#x27;ve used, I am really happy with my purchase and will be coming back to order another when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> I come from Indian subcontinent, a place where kohl kajal is very popular among ladies.  After coming to US, I looked for one for a long time and couldn&#x27;t find one.  So I had to make the eye pencils work.  I was delighted to find this kohl style kajal on Amazon and bought one right away.  It took some time (about 2.5 weeks) to arrive but I am loving it so far.  It gives a thick and dark line in lower eye; I personally don&#x27;t like to use it on the lid since t fails to achieve a thin line.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a month back and I received it last week as it came from India. Shehenaaz huasain is like a goddess of herbal beauty products in India. This herbal kohl is a wonderful product from her collection.  It works as a smooth eyeliner and doesn&#x27;t smudge much creating a clean and dark line. It has products those are really good for eyes. Buy and enjoy the benefits!!!</li>
            <li> Love this item. It came in the same packaging and same product as i had bought from back home (Pakistan). I was short on mine and was worried where i will get a new one. Lo and behold,.. Amazon had it:)</li>
            <li> I love this product, but....... it seems to smear onto the upper lid easily.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe powdering the upper lid would help, but you can not use this with cr√®me eye-shadows, or facial moisturizer on eyes, when you moisturize your face.&lt;br /&gt;  The twist applicator is fabulous, and easy to use without having to find a brush to put it on with, and stores easy in your purse.&lt;br /&gt;  They need to add a sharpener with the lid , so you can make a point when it wears down, and become a round mound.</li>
            <li> Beautiful thick smoke line!&lt;br /&gt;I used it for dance shows and photo shoots in which I needed heavy stage makeup to counter the stage lights.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it got too hot and melted a side which turned white so I am a little nervous to use it now.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Biotique which has natural ingredients and does not irritate my sensitive eyes.  This one is okay but does not go on as smoothly.  I had hoped it would be longer lasting but it was not, plus as others have said it contains mineral oil which is irritating to some people and can clog pores around the eyes.  Particularly bad if you are prone to blepharitis, which I am. Overall it is good but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I bought this from another website which gives the same information here on Amazon. I was ordering it because I wanted something herbal due to sensitivity that I have with my eyes, in addition to the desire to have a product with no chemicals or preservatives. I am very surprised that no other reviewers have mentioned that this product contains petrolatum, mineral oil, proplyparaben, and a black dye. No refunds are offered to this product if ordered from the amazon seller, and the website that I did order from charges a restocking fee and customer pays to ship back, and given the low price of the item and that I got free shipping when I ordered, it will actually cost me more to return it. I cannot use mineral oil on my skin without breakouts popping up all over, so I definitely dont want it on my face. I wish that I had known the entire list of ingredients before I ordered. For others with the same purchasing intentions as me, here is the complete list of ingredients that are on the back of the packaging: Petrolatum, Ricinus communis (castor) seed oil, Copernicia cerifera (carnuba) wax, Mineral oil, Phyllanthus emblica fruit extract, Terminalia bellirica fruit extract, Terminalia chebula fruit extract, Beeswax, Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, Glyceryl stearate, Camphor, Propylparaben, D&amp;C Black No. 2 (CI 77266).</li>
            <li> I have used many kajals before and i don&#x27;t find it good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smudge or spread and doesn&#x27;t irritate your eyes. It&#x27;s a herbal Kajal so no chemicals and preservatives are used. So technically you see there are no demerits and the Shahnaz Husain brand name adds to its value.Considering these facts i was so excited to buy this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it didn&#x27;t do any good for me. I was looking for a Kajal that would give a thick and dark line to my lower eyes but it doesn&#x27;t. Initially i thought it is because the Kajal is new  and after sometime it would thicken. But during the entire period of my usage, i never had to change my opinion even once...Because it NEVER ThICKENS...So in a way,it is not serving the purpose as a Kajal...And for 7 dollars...i would say u are just wasting your money.</li>
            <li> I just received this kajal yesterday and after having it on for literally less than 4 hours, it had run about 1/2 an inch under my eyes. I promptly threw this product in the garbage. So disappointing. The Lakme Kajal is MUCH better!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is great for the waterline and lashline. If you put it on heavy it will smear throughout the day, but luckly it is easy to correct with a swipe of the finger. I have really bad allergies and one symptom is really bad itchy eyes. This causes a problem for me when wearing mascara or eyeliner, so I am used to checking my eyes through out the day for smears. The great thing about this product, since I started wearing it, my eyes do not itch any more...not sure why this eyeliner really helped, but it did. So, I am getting a lot less smearing with this product than others I have used since I am not rubbing my eyes anymore. Actually, I am now applying this to my eyes at night before bed, after I wash my face because of the benefits I am getting regarding my itchy eyes.I also wear with my make-up during the day. I have not use my eye drops, even once, since I started using this product...and I know I was not allergic to my prior eye make-up. I will be buying more...it is a lot less expensive than a monthly prescription of Optivar. The color is really dark black, but you can easly adjust the darkness by using a qtip to smear and blend. I like the fact that it is very creamy and easy to manipulate and it is very moisturizing to the lash line. I found that if you use a little powder eyeshadow along the edge of the line made with this product, it will stay in place all day. Love love this stuff...</li>
            <li> It does smear after a short while.  Not sure how you are supposed to sharpen this item once the point is worn down.</li>
            <li> doesnt smear is very dark black and easy to apply packaged good and quick delivery..its very nice soft to draw perfect eye brows and great eyeliner as well</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail and the kohl was all in a melted mess.  Very disappointing.  I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, she had used another brand and she really like this one&lt;br /&gt;She has started recommending this to her friends</li>
            <li> this has a bit of a creamy texture glides on easily, very light to dramatic depending how lite or thick you apply. Love this the case is attractive with a little mirror for easy application viewing  WILL ORDER AGAIN</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for the wet line of your eyes. I like the smooth black case it come&#x27;s in.&lt;br /&gt;Bought one for my grand daughter...I&#x27;ll purchase it again.</li>
            <li> i just received this item today and i put it on right away. after 30 min passed, it started to leak. i had a purple eye!! not a cute look. i was very disappointed  because i had really high expectations. PS: i received the item 3 weeks earlier than the given expected delivery date. it was going to take about 2 mo. for me to receive it and i got it in 3 weeks. thats pretty fast because its coming from india.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly, but it is in very flimsy packaging similar to lipstick packaging.&lt;br /&gt;The herbal formulation will have sensitive eyes watering, so be careful to apply very lightly on the eye lids only.  For those that can take a heavier application, this would be a fantastic product, but it does smear easily.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item for shipping though.&lt;br /&gt;The product inside it&#x27;s plastic packaging was so smashed up, I had to remove the kohl entirely in order to make use of the product.  It may come with a little mirror on the lid, but this is rendered useless when the item is shipped.</li>
            <li> I was tired of expensive eye liners becoming non-existent at the end of the day. I looked up ideas online and found some helpful ones but, quite by accident, I came upon this product. I love this eye liner (or eye-emphasizer.) It works the same way a lipstick does - it rolls up. But it doesn&#x27;t lose its point, which was one thing I was concerned about. Order two! You can use one in the morning and carry another with you. This is an excellent product that I will absolutely re-order when I run through what I have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great black, glides on really easily... but also smudges very easily... not for those with oily skin or for those that inadvertently rub their eyes...</li>
            <li> i really liked the shahnaz husain herbal kohl. i would recommend to a friend. i will be ordering more in the near future.</li>
