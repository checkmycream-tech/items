            <li>I recommend to anyone on the go or stay at home kind of girl.</li>
            <li>Love that this great product is available on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>I sweat very easily like literally when I get out of the tub</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product it is amazing.</li>
            <li>but I did discover that the gel works so much better than the roll on solids.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>For me it seems to keep you drier, and scent is softer and more obscure.  </li>
            <li>I love lavender, so</li>
            <li>Deodorant is one thing you want to make sure to not run out of.</li>
            <li>She scratched the overwrapping and was in love...</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>She says that it lasts a very long time, and it smells very good!</li>
            <li>The price is right and I am stocked with my favorite deodorant!</li>
            <li>Not too strong.</li>
            <li>I love this brand, this is my favorite scent--slightly girly and floral, but muted so it&#x27;s great for everyday wear--</li>
            <li>Packaging was great, fast shipping, I&#x27;ll absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li>Keeps you dry and feeling great all day.  </li>
            <li>CALIDAD Y SUPER ACORDE CON EL TAMAÑO  </li>
            <li>I thought this was actually the liquid kind (or pseudo liquid?)</li>
            <li>Nice for an every day deoderant and plenty to have for later.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t keep you fresh.</li>
            <li>its worth it</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised that this one works just as well and love the smell of the lavender.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite scent so far.  </li>
            <li>Lon lasting, clean fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>its a good buy and its really really really really long lasting.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>This kind may leave a slight residue since it&#x27;s the solid variety.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this product, I love the money we save buying it in small lots instead of going to the store for a stick of deodorant and end up spending $100, before we leave.</li>
            <li>, it feels smooth instead of dry or overly wet.  </li>
            <li>I love secret deodrant gel and thought i would try this .</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I thought this was actually the liquid kind (or pseudo liquid?), so it&#x27;s mostly my fault here for ordering wrong type. Very pleasant scent, and has been a go-to deoderant for me for years! This kind may leave a slight residue since it&#x27;s the solid variety. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble so far!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product it is amazing. The smell is really really good. its a good buy and its really really really really long lasting.</li>
            <li> It smells great, stays on all day. It been 3 months and I am now on my second deodorant;they last a long time.</li>
            <li> This smells soooo good but I did discover that the gel works so much better than the roll on solids.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and lasts all day long. Great price too! What more can you ask for? Will be purchasing again in the future.</li>
            <li> Great price for a three pack and it smells really good too.  Nice for an every day deoderant and plenty to have for later.</li>
            <li> Not something I&#x27;ll buy again. Doesn&#x27;t hold sweat. Doesn&#x27;t keep you fresh. Don&#x27;t recommend buying this. Not worth it. Don&#x27;t know what else to say</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male and I&#x27;ve always appreciated the secret brand, usually the powder scent, over any deodorant made for a man.  For me it seems to keep you drier, and scent is softer and more obscure.  I gave these a try and they work just as good as I anticipated.  They smell great, it feels smooth instead of dry or overly wet.  Would definitely purchase again, maybe in another scent just to give them a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve we always used Secret.  Worked for me.  I love lavender, so when I saw this, it was perfect.  Works good and smells wonderful.  Good deal too.  I have an extra to put in the rv and another on hand.</li>
            <li> Deodorant is one thing you want to make sure to not run out of. Love that this great product is available on subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and it was perfect! On the outside box, there is a scratch &amp; sniff of the scent(lavendar) and it smells DELICIOUS! This is a winner for that hard to get person! She scratched the overwrapping and was in love...Not only that ,but she immediately scooped up the contents and difiantly mutters MINE!!  Thats a winner...Yay! PS.Happy days are here again...  AF.</li>
            <li> I love secret deodrant gel and thought i would try this . It is awful . The first one i opened the roller broke so was unable to use</li>
            <li> After one use of this product i noticed that my underarms were starting to get red, WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! the only scent from secret that did not give me an awful reaction is the vanilla...its time to go back to that one.</li>
            <li> i used to it its perfect i recommended to everyone so go for it to buy these stuff its worth it</li>
            <li> What a buy! No more going to the store! The price is right and I am stocked with my favorite deodorant!</li>

            <li> I normally order the clear gel Secret Scent but I was pleasantly surprised that this one works just as well and love the smell of the lavender.</li>
            <li> The scent is not overbearing.  It is my favorite scent so far.  Good price.  I will continue to buy this product</li>
            <li> This deodorant works great, and although the scent is nothing like lavender, it still smells very nice. Not too strong. It&#x27;s also nice to get the 4-pack, and have a supply for awhile.</li>
            <li> it was good&lt;br /&gt;I liked the smell as well&lt;br /&gt;the price is so cheap&lt;br /&gt;cheaper than i expected !!&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>

            <li> I prefer to buy toiletries in bulk on Amazon as it saves $$$! I love this brand, this is my favorite scent--slightly girly and floral, but muted so it&#x27;s great for everyday wear--I figured why not. Packaging was great, fast shipping, I&#x27;ll absolutely purchase again.</li>
