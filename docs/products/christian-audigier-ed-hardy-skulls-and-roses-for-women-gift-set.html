            <li> Very happy with item will order more in the future and very fast shipping</li>
            <li> Very good price for one of my favorite fragrances. Includes regular and purse size perfumes, body lotion and shower gel. I only wear 2 perfumes and this is one.</li>
            <li> I really like this better then I thought I would ! But then again I like all the Ed Hardy Parfums for Ladies &amp; Men !</li>
            <li> Got here on time. Happy with product</li>
            <li> Smells awesome! My boyfriend told me about it, and so glad I ordered it and would soooo recommend it girls!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume! It arrived earlier than expected and I was pleasantly surprised at how large the lotion and body wash is.</li>
            <li> I like this fragrance because it has a sweet clean fragrance. I don&#x27;t like flowery smells as personally I prefer an almost candy like scent.</li>
            <li> came fast great gift set great price, got for my wife she love skulls and roses.The gift set is better than buying one bottle alone.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister as a gift for the holidays.  She enjoys it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice warm sugary scent. I was surprised on how fruity it was. Now not like BAM I&#x27;m in your face fruity but a nice toned down sugar scent. The strawberry in this perfume is lovely and smells amazing on my skin. I really like the travel size one just because it is easy to tote around. The lotion in this set is outstanding it is a nice thick souffle that moisturizes the skin fast and effectively. Now back to the scent..... This is going to be a great summer/spring scent, I&#x27;ll have to try it in the winter to see if the fragrance changes :)&lt;br /&gt;I still gave this 5 stars even though there was no tracking but oh well it got here and it was in perfect condition!! I like scents like nicki minaj, Britney spears fantasy and midnight fantasy. If that helps you decide if this scent is for you :) Enjoy!!!</li>
            <li> smells good...girlfriend loved it. brand new scent she didnt know about. a great christmas gift for someone who has every ed hardy scent</li>

            <li> Came 3 days after i ordered it. Good new condition. The scent seems to be different in different people, on me it smells fresh like cool water but with a hint of citrus..</li>
            <li> Product is wonderful smells great my wife loves it giving three stars because shipping was one of the slowest I have experienced with ordering anything from amazon.</li>
            <li> I ordered this last year and I&#x27;m still using it. I love the smell of it and it doesn&#x27;t get overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;A great perk of this fragrance is the neato skull bottle it comes in; I love being able to display it in my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel spritzer is also great to have, though the cap is kinda loose so it&#x27;s difficult to actually bring it on-the-go without worrying about losing the skull cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the lotion and body wash sparingly for fear of running out, but that&#x27;s just a personal quirk.</li>
