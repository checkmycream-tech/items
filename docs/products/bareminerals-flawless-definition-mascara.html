            <li>Nice try!  </li>
            <li>I love bareminerals flawless definition mascara.</li>
            <li>It is a good mascara for the price range but can be clumpy at times.  </li>

            <li>Easy to apply and looks great.  </li>
            <li>This mascara is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Even my smallest and finest lashes are nicely defined and separated.</li>
            <li>but this is in a class of its own.</li>
            <li>If I am going to spend this much on mascara, I want it to be perfect.  </li>
            <li>It was nice that</li>
            <li>The result he got with his method are like the results you will get with this kind of brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It stays on nice, too, no smudging at all.  </li>
            <li>The brush is perfect and is easy to apply, and leaves your eye lashes looking beautiful and natural.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, I was given a group of mascara sample and this one was so amazing I had to buy it.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this mascara!  </li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals Flawless Definition just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me.  </li>
            <li>Bare Minerals is the very best.</li>
            <li>I buy this product consistently from Sephora and I was so happy I found it a couple bucks cheaper here.  </li>
            <li>Great mascara for fine, full lashes.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly</li>
            <li>I was impressed by the mascara&#x27;s staying power and the fact that it barely flaked at all, even after I&#x27;d been wearing it for many hours.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t able to use it...</li>
            <li>Much better than ones I bought at MAC.  </li>
            <li>I love this Mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>Glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many mascaras, including Lancome, Estee lauder, Dior, Jane Iredale, etc.  </li>
            <li>I have used this mascara for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using the Flawless Definition for several months now.</li>
            <li>clumping, and that the tube lasted more than a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>I LOVE bareMinerals and the mascara is no exception.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have time to return it and get more before my vacation so ended up trying to use it til it&#x27;s gone.  </li>
            <li>i was told about this mascara by others but didn&#x27;t want to pay more than drug store prices.  </li>
            <li>I love bareminerals.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this mascara, but it just isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>Upside is I love the applicator.</li>
            <li>but this mascara provides better definition</li>
            <li>I have TONS of drugstore mascaras, but I have never been completely satisfied with any</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to search anymore!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this mascara as it doesn&#x27;t clump and smear.</li>
            <li>I love it more than the dior 100 percent.</li>
            <li>Nice and clean not clumpy</li>
            <li>Lengthens pretty good as well.</li>
            <li>I cant speak for everyone here though, Maybe for people with sensitive eyes this mascara will work great, but for me it doesnt matter if its BareMinerals or L&#x27;Oreal in this case.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easily separated and doesn&#x27;t flake throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes longer, DOESN&#x27;T CLUMP them together, and washes off easily.  </li>
            <li>it removes easily with a bit of oil.  </li>
            <li>This was so easy because I just can&#x27;t seem to get to the mall.</li>
            <li>Easy on, easy off.</li>
            <li>It stays on all day and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t believe how brilliant and bright my big brown eyes looked with this modest mascara highlighting the edges.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best mascara I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Just as good or better than when purchased from Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara, tried their high volumizer mascara and had to switch back to the flawless.</li>
            <li>but the return went smooth</li>
            <li>but this feels light on my lashes.</li>
            <li>glad i did because it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>but I received a free sample at a store</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to find a mascara that actually does NOT lump or clump or just leave globs of product on the lashes.  </li>
            <li>This is great and my second order.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good mascara, natural or not.</li>
            <li>The brush is super fine and the mascara goes on well without clumping.  </li>
            <li>The mascara arrived but it was not in its original box.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t magically make your eyelashes look like a model&#x27;s, but it makes them look more defined in a natural way.  </li>
            <li>AND if that&#x27;s not enough with the natural ingredients its actually good for your lashes!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and looks good all day long.</li>
            <li>in just the right amount!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned over the course of many years that not all mascaras are suitable for all types of eyelashes and that a brand or variety that works well for one woman doesn&#x27;t necessarily for others.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clump, really stays on well love it.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a nice, natural looking, clump-free mascara...</li>
            <li>For all that, it cleans off pretty easily</li>
            <li>My eyes are happy and don&#x27;t hurt bc of all those chemicals in the other brands.</li>
            <li>This is my second favorite mascara to wear (I like the volume one just slightly better).</li>
            <li>Doesnt clump, isn&#x27;t overly wet, gives good coverage and feels light and airy.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used--and that includes more expensive brands like Smashbox and Mary Kay.  </li>
            <li>The mascaras that have worked best for me over the last 30+ years have been Lancôme Definicils and whatever they&#x27;re calling their volumizing mascara at the moment (the name is always changing) but given that I&#x27;ve recently developed an ethical aversion to L&#x27;Oréal products, I&#x27;d like to find a replacement.</li>
            <li>Definitely my new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>I have tried several Lancome mascaras, L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Voluminous and Voluminous Naturale, Cover Girl&#x27;s Lash Exact, and I have finally found my Holy Grail with BareMierals Flawless Definition mascara.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;And of course, gotta love the natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>, it does exactly what my cheaper Telescopic Clean Definition does.</li>
            <li>This mascara separates and defines beautifully, even the little lashes, and it does!</li>
            <li>Mascara seemed fine the first 4 days but became very clumpy after that!</li>
            <li>You get your money&#x27;s worth with this mascara.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I rarely wear mascara</li>
            <li>/&gt;It wasn&#x27;t until I accidentally ordered this mascara, with a more modest brush (and trust me</li>
            <li>I did not feel this product is worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>I just love how natural my eyelashes look.</li>
            <li>After trying SO MANY mascaras, this is my new absolute fave!</li>
            <li>The coverage is just as good as the other brands too.</li>
            <li>I looked high and low for a good replacement.</li>
            <li>right where I want it...</li>
            <li>I was using the Bare Escentuals brushless, which i love, but can&#x27;t find it anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I always use Bare Escentuals, but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still as fresh as when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product, which is a great value at a relatively low price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t flake off, easy to remove, and makes my lashes look defined and long.</li>
            <li>(the better to smear with when one tries to clean up with a cotton swab).</li>
            <li>My eyes have gotten more sensitive as I get older and this covers well without causing any irritation at all.</li>
            <li>My next favorite at this point is from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, of all places.  </li>
            <li>And for some reason, the waterproof goes on better than the regular formula.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of this type of mascara.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of mascaras but this makes my eyes really pop!</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>The mascara works pretty well</li>
            <li>But the last time I bought it, I noticed that it flakes a lot more than it did.</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t admit it, but I&#x27;ve even added new mascara on top of old in the morning when I didn&#x27;t wash it off at night.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a very nice mascara, but it&#x27;s not spectacular as I once thought it was.</li>
            <li>The brush is key it separates the lashes nicely without clumping, gives a nice curl and looks very natural not too heavy</li>
            <li>I love that it makes my scarce lashes look long and semi-lush, and keeps them soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just make sure the first coat is dry, so it doesn&#x27;t clump too much.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought this mascara a few years ago, I was thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find products with good EWG.org ratings (this has 3 out of 10)</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>You can definitely tell the difference between this and cheap brands.  </li>
            <li>The formula goes on smooth without clumping, and coats every lash without multiple coats.</li>
            <li>This came in a kit with powders, and I really didn&#x27;t expect much of it at all.  </li>
            <li>the volumizing mascara just volumizes too much for me.  </li>
            <li>I really hesitate using it.  </li>
            <li>My lashes look much longer and fuller with this mascara...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s for your woman who realize it&#x27;s time to grow up and show off what god really gave you.</li>
            <li>The mascara I got is really chunky.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of the expensive brands as well as a few of the grocery store brands and this is the best one I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this mascara the first week, but after that it became clumpy and hard to apply as if it were old.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re never brittle, as with most other mascaras.</li>
            <li>Separated my lashes better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>(a big problem with my most recent purchase, the L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous Naturale.</li>
            <li>The mascara itself is extremely wet; granted, this is pretty much true of any new tube of mascara</li>
            <li>My lashes look long and clean.  </li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look amazing and hardly ever flakes off or smears.</li>
            <li>and lately I have been using the popular one that leaves \\&quot;tubes\\</li>
            <li>This is a good mascara - not great.</li>
            <li>I am particular with eye makeup as I have sensitive eyes and wear contacts - this fits the bill!</li>
            <li>Compared to the Big Tease and volumizing mascara, it goes on just right and never clumps.  </li>
            <li>i think the shelf life of this mascara was past its due date, i have used this mascara for 3 years and have never had it clump like this one did...not happy</li>
            <li>Without its box, I have no idea if this is a new or used mascara.  </li>
            <li>There is one where a guy shows a NEW WAY TO APPLY MASCARA by using a metal tooth eyelash comb and brushing a bit of your mascara on it, then combing it into your lashes.</li>
            <li>The one thing that could be improved is volume, but then again, this product doesn&#x27;t tout itself as being a major volumizer, so I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>However, if you want a natural looking eye, I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li>It must have been very OLD.  </li>
            <li>It appears very natural, which is what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Very natural looking.</li>
            <li>It just seems like it is old and therefore not up to par!</li>
            <li>It already seemed dried out, and flaked really easily.</li>
            <li>The packaging I received from this company looked exactly the same as what I am familiar with when I buy it from Sephora, but the product inside was dried out.  </li>
            <li>I bought it just for swimming and was very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>My eyes are burning and It also doesn&#x27;t last much longer than the eye liner.</li>
            <li>I use the mascara with my old Benefit mascara brush and that takes care of a lot of that problem.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive eyes and this product</li>
            <li>mascara isn&#x27;t for you young Club-going girls.</li>
            <li>Maybe the one I recieved was old (hopefully not used??).</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>decided to make a switch to natural beauty products and decided to go with this one after reading reviews.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>It definitely makes my eyes look much prettier.</li>
            <li>This mascara is equipped with a very small, narrow, triangular-shaped wand that is ideal for applying the product to individual lashes.</li>
            <li>I can easily get this same quality from a store-bought brand for half</li>
            <li>Though it is a little pricier than normal mascaras, it&#x27;s well worth it</li>
            <li>I have almost weirdly long (especially the \\&quot;lowers\\&quot;), quite thick, but not very dark eyelashes and on this basis, my eyes are my one feature that I really play up--they kind of dominate my face.</li>
            <li>The main problem is finding stuff that actually works and looks well without spending a fortune.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is a little liquid-y upon application, but dries relatively quick without clumping.</li>
            <li>This mascara is great for sensitive eyes and it comes off in the shower with facial soap (it won&#x27;t run if your eyes get a little wet, though it might flake a little if you sleep in it).</li>
            <li>Clumps on the wand a little more than I expected it would.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you Bare Escentuals!</li>
            <li>My Aunt recommended the bare minerals mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of all Bare Escentuals products, and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Something is happening to the quality of Bare Minerals, it just is not what it used to be.</li>
            <li>I try to use only natural or organic makeup, especially for my eyes.</li>
            <li>I was given a sample size of this by Sephora (I think a birthday gift) and was eager to try it because mascara is the component of my limited makeup arsenal that I take most seriously.</li>
            <li>Full, thick, separated lashes.  </li>
            <li>And no, I did not put much on for it to weigh my lashes down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not worth the cost to return it, and it&#x27;s not a bad product, but it&#x27;s just not worth the price.</li>

            <li> The spacing between the bristles is perfect, so it coats each lash without clumping.  </li>
            <li> (i have a Eyeshadow from them and it works great!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> Very happy and will buy again.</li>
            <li> and this mascara is perfect.  </li>
            <li> so this is perfect for me.  </li>

            <li> it works wonderfully!</li>

            <li> (covers and separates my lashes very good</li>
            <li> Good quality and excellent to use.</li>
            <li> This mascara goes on beautifully.  </li>
            <li> and it still works great.</li>
            <li> This product is great.</li>
            <li> It works great..</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product!!</li>
            <li> When I took out the brush, it looked unimpressive, but it does what it says, it coats and defines the lashes very nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice try!  </li>
            <li> I love bareminerals flawless definition mascara.</li>
            <li> It is a good mascara for the price range but can be clumpy at times.  </li>
            <li> , I cussed it good)</li>
            <li> Looks good day or night and lasts until washed off.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than the others!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite mascara!  </li>
            <li> Soooooo glad I did!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara!</li>
            <li> LOVE the brush!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and looks great.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Even my smallest and finest lashes are nicely defined and separated.</li>
            <li> but this is in a class of its own.</li>
            <li> If I am going to spend this much on mascara, I want it to be perfect.  </li>
            <li> It was nice that</li>
            <li> The result he got with his method are like the results you will get with this kind of brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stays on nice, too, no smudging at all.  </li>
            <li> The brush is perfect and is easy to apply, and leaves your eye lashes looking beautiful and natural.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, I was given a group of mascara sample and this one was so amazing I had to buy it.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this mascara!  </li>
            <li> Bare Escentuals Flawless Definition just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me.  </li>
            <li> Bare Minerals is the very best.</li>
            <li> I buy this product consistently from Sephora and I was so happy I found it a couple bucks cheaper here.  </li>
            <li> Great mascara for fine, full lashes.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly</li>
            <li> I was impressed by the mascara&#x27;s staying power and the fact that it barely flaked at all, even after I&#x27;d been wearing it for many hours.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t able to use it...</li>
            <li> Much better than ones I bought at MAC.  </li>
            <li> I love this Mascara.  </li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> Glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many mascaras, including Lancome, Estee lauder, Dior, Jane Iredale, etc.  </li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using the Flawless Definition for several months now.</li>
            <li> clumping, and that the tube lasted more than a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I LOVE bareMinerals and the mascara is no exception.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have time to return it and get more before my vacation so ended up trying to use it til it&#x27;s gone.  </li>
            <li> i was told about this mascara by others but didn&#x27;t want to pay more than drug store prices.  </li>
            <li> I love bareminerals.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this mascara, but it just isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> Upside is I love the applicator.</li>
            <li> but this mascara provides better definition</li>
            <li> I have TONS of drugstore mascaras, but I have never been completely satisfied with any</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to search anymore!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this mascara as it doesn&#x27;t clump and smear.</li>
            <li> I love it more than the dior 100 percent.</li>
            <li> Nice and clean not clumpy</li>
            <li> Lengthens pretty good as well.</li>
            <li> I cant speak for everyone here though, Maybe for people with sensitive eyes this mascara will work great, but for me it doesnt matter if its BareMinerals or L&#x27;Oreal in this case.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily separated and doesn&#x27;t flake throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes longer, DOESN&#x27;T CLUMP them together, and washes off easily.  </li>
            <li> it removes easily with a bit of oil.  </li>
            <li> This was so easy because I just can&#x27;t seem to get to the mall.</li>
            <li> Easy on, easy off.</li>
            <li> It stays on all day and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t believe how brilliant and bright my big brown eyes looked with this modest mascara highlighting the edges.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best mascara I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Just as good or better than when purchased from Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, tried their high volumizer mascara and had to switch back to the flawless.</li>
            <li> but the return went smooth</li>
            <li> but this feels light on my lashes.</li>
            <li> glad i did because it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> but I received a free sample at a store</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to find a mascara that actually does NOT lump or clump or just leave globs of product on the lashes.  </li>
            <li> This is great and my second order.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good mascara, natural or not.</li>
            <li> The brush is super fine and the mascara goes on well without clumping.  </li>
            <li> The mascara arrived but it was not in its original box.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t magically make your eyelashes look like a model&#x27;s, but it makes them look more defined in a natural way.  </li>
            <li> AND if that&#x27;s not enough with the natural ingredients its actually good for your lashes!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and looks good all day long.</li>
            <li> in just the right amount!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned over the course of many years that not all mascaras are suitable for all types of eyelashes and that a brand or variety that works well for one woman doesn&#x27;t necessarily for others.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump, really stays on well love it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a nice, natural looking, clump-free mascara...</li>
            <li> For all that, it cleans off pretty easily</li>
            <li> My eyes are happy and don&#x27;t hurt bc of all those chemicals in the other brands.</li>
            <li> This is my second favorite mascara to wear (I like the volume one just slightly better).</li>
            <li> Doesnt clump, isn&#x27;t overly wet, gives good coverage and feels light and airy.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used--and that includes more expensive brands like Smashbox and Mary Kay.  </li>
            <li> The mascaras that have worked best for me over the last 30+ years have been Lancôme Definicils and whatever they&#x27;re calling their volumizing mascara at the moment (the name is always changing) but given that I&#x27;ve recently developed an ethical aversion to L&#x27;Oréal products, I&#x27;d like to find a replacement.</li>
            <li> Definitely my new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> I have tried several Lancome mascaras, L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Voluminous and Voluminous Naturale, Cover Girl&#x27;s Lash Exact, and I have finally found my Holy Grail with BareMierals Flawless Definition mascara.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;And of course, gotta love the natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> , it does exactly what my cheaper Telescopic Clean Definition does.</li>
            <li> This mascara separates and defines beautifully, even the little lashes, and it does!</li>
            <li> Mascara seemed fine the first 4 days but became very clumpy after that!</li>
            <li> You get your money&#x27;s worth with this mascara.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I rarely wear mascara</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t until I accidentally ordered this mascara, with a more modest brush (and trust me</li>
            <li> I did not feel this product is worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li> I just love how natural my eyelashes look.</li>
            <li> After trying SO MANY mascaras, this is my new absolute fave!</li>
            <li> The coverage is just as good as the other brands too.</li>
            <li> I looked high and low for a good replacement.</li>
            <li> right where I want it...</li>
            <li> I was using the Bare Escentuals brushless, which i love, but can&#x27;t find it anywhere.  </li>
            <li> I always use Bare Escentuals, but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still as fresh as when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product, which is a great value at a relatively low price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t flake off, easy to remove, and makes my lashes look defined and long.</li>
            <li> (the better to smear with when one tries to clean up with a cotton swab).</li>
            <li> My eyes have gotten more sensitive as I get older and this covers well without causing any irritation at all.</li>
            <li> My next favorite at this point is from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, of all places.  </li>
            <li> And for some reason, the waterproof goes on better than the regular formula.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of this type of mascara.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of mascaras but this makes my eyes really pop!</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> The mascara works pretty well</li>
            <li> But the last time I bought it, I noticed that it flakes a lot more than it did.</li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t admit it, but I&#x27;ve even added new mascara on top of old in the morning when I didn&#x27;t wash it off at night.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a very nice mascara, but it&#x27;s not spectacular as I once thought it was.</li>
            <li> The brush is key it separates the lashes nicely without clumping, gives a nice curl and looks very natural not too heavy</li>
            <li> I love that it makes my scarce lashes look long and semi-lush, and keeps them soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just make sure the first coat is dry, so it doesn&#x27;t clump too much.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this mascara a few years ago, I was thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find products with good EWG.org ratings (this has 3 out of 10)</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> You can definitely tell the difference between this and cheap brands.  </li>
            <li> The formula goes on smooth without clumping, and coats every lash without multiple coats.</li>
            <li> This came in a kit with powders, and I really didn&#x27;t expect much of it at all.  </li>
            <li> the volumizing mascara just volumizes too much for me.  </li>
            <li> I really hesitate using it.  </li>
            <li> My lashes look much longer and fuller with this mascara...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for your woman who realize it&#x27;s time to grow up and show off what god really gave you.</li>
            <li> The mascara I got is really chunky.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the expensive brands as well as a few of the grocery store brands and this is the best one I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this mascara the first week, but after that it became clumpy and hard to apply as if it were old.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They&#x27;re never brittle, as with most other mascaras.</li>
            <li> Separated my lashes better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> (a big problem with my most recent purchase, the L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous Naturale.</li>
            <li> The mascara itself is extremely wet; granted, this is pretty much true of any new tube of mascara</li>
            <li> My lashes look long and clean.  </li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look amazing and hardly ever flakes off or smears.</li>
            <li> and lately I have been using the popular one that leaves \\&quot;tubes\\</li>
            <li> This is a good mascara - not great.</li>
            <li> I am particular with eye makeup as I have sensitive eyes and wear contacts - this fits the bill!</li>
            <li> Compared to the Big Tease and volumizing mascara, it goes on just right and never clumps.  </li>
            <li> i think the shelf life of this mascara was past its due date, i have used this mascara for 3 years and have never had it clump like this one did...not happy</li>
            <li> Without its box, I have no idea if this is a new or used mascara.  </li>
            <li> There is one where a guy shows a NEW WAY TO APPLY MASCARA by using a metal tooth eyelash comb and brushing a bit of your mascara on it, then combing it into your lashes.</li>
            <li> The one thing that could be improved is volume, but then again, this product doesn&#x27;t tout itself as being a major volumizer, so I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> However, if you want a natural looking eye, I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> It must have been very OLD.  </li>
            <li> It appears very natural, which is what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> It just seems like it is old and therefore not up to par!</li>
            <li> It already seemed dried out, and flaked really easily.</li>
            <li> The packaging I received from this company looked exactly the same as what I am familiar with when I buy it from Sephora, but the product inside was dried out.  </li>
            <li> I bought it just for swimming and was very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> My eyes are burning and It also doesn&#x27;t last much longer than the eye liner.</li>
            <li> I use the mascara with my old Benefit mascara brush and that takes care of a lot of that problem.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive eyes and this product</li>
            <li> mascara isn&#x27;t for you young Club-going girls.</li>
            <li> Maybe the one I recieved was old (hopefully not used??).</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> decided to make a switch to natural beauty products and decided to go with this one after reading reviews.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> It definitely makes my eyes look much prettier.</li>
            <li> This mascara is equipped with a very small, narrow, triangular-shaped wand that is ideal for applying the product to individual lashes.</li>
            <li> I can easily get this same quality from a store-bought brand for half</li>
            <li> Though it is a little pricier than normal mascaras, it&#x27;s well worth it</li>
            <li> I have almost weirdly long (especially the \\&quot;lowers\\&quot;), quite thick, but not very dark eyelashes and on this basis, my eyes are my one feature that I really play up--they kind of dominate my face.</li>
            <li> The main problem is finding stuff that actually works and looks well without spending a fortune.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a little liquid-y upon application, but dries relatively quick without clumping.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great for sensitive eyes and it comes off in the shower with facial soap (it won&#x27;t run if your eyes get a little wet, though it might flake a little if you sleep in it).</li>
            <li> Clumps on the wand a little more than I expected it would.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you Bare Escentuals!</li>
            <li> My Aunt recommended the bare minerals mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of all Bare Escentuals products, and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Something is happening to the quality of Bare Minerals, it just is not what it used to be.</li>
            <li> I try to use only natural or organic makeup, especially for my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample size of this by Sephora (I think a birthday gift) and was eager to try it because mascara is the component of my limited makeup arsenal that I take most seriously.</li>
            <li> Full, thick, separated lashes.  </li>
            <li> And no, I did not put much on for it to weigh my lashes down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the cost to return it, and it&#x27;s not a bad product, but it&#x27;s just not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Hard to clean off with tissue due to nylon wand.</li>
            <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t go on too thick or heavy, and any small clumps that occur are easily smoothed out with a gentle brush of the fingertips.  </li>
            <li> I finally cracked it open the other day.  </li>
            <li> Which means I&#x27;m still young enough to have wild, crazy, club eyes, but old enough to have business, Monday eyes.</li>
            <li> The item I received was used or old dried out stock.  </li>
            <li> it feels &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; but my lashes are looking long and luscious.  </li>
            <li> and if you wiggle the wand at the base of your lashes also provides good volume.</li>
            <li> plus it doesn&#x27;t flake or take too long to dry after I apply it.  </li>
            <li> It never ceases to amaze me how differently a product that covers so little area can perform on different people.  </li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look SO long!</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers, I have sensitivity to a lot of eye cosmetics, so not only do I have to find something I like, but also</li>
            <li> Also flakes off by the&lt;br /&gt;end of a dry day.  </li>
            <li> I have average eyelashes that have blonde tips (which make my eyelashes look even shorter!), and from my experience any thickening mascara just clumps my eye lashes.  </li>
            <li> They look natural but thick, long, and luscious.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very prone to smearing and very slow to dry</li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t cause any sensitivity like some other brands have done.  </li>
            <li> I like to know that I am not putting chemicals and unknown substances on my face.</li>
            <li> Bareminerals mascara is as expected.  </li>
            <li> I had such trouble with store-bought mascara bothering my eyes</li>
            <li> Same prob everyday though.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re after a huge dramatic eye with tons of thick mascara, this one is not for you.</li>
            <li> I found the brush for the Big Tease to be a little odd and</li>
            <li> It perks up ALL the lashes-either big or small.</li>
            <li> I put very minimal layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So i probably wont purchase it no more, cause i can have the same results for half the price.</li>
            <li> It is not worth the aggravation buying it here from this supplier.</li>
            <li> And dont get me wrong, i really like products from BareMineral/ BareEscentuals</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.  </li>
            <li> This mascara definitely does what it says it will do, it goes on thick, which I like because I use it also on my lower lashes and some products</li>
            <li> Negatives: Weighed down my lashed when I applied so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wearable but I&#x27;d rather not deal with the mess.</li>
            <li> I had to curl it when it dried which was a mess some days.</li>
            <li> mascara was dried up</li>
            <li> Jane Iredale (in the gold tube) comes close, but actually goes on too thin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really messy stuff.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had trouble with clumping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought a bareminerals that has been so messy and chunky before...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve watched quite a few mascara tutorials on youtube.</li>
            <li> and I have very little problems with clumps.  </li>
            <li> Also, by the end of the day I had the raccoon look from excessive mascara.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, I won&#x27;t be purchasing new products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , my lashes have become a lot healthier and seem to hardly ever break.  </li>
            <li> I must have gotten an old tube of the mascara because it flaked off my eyes really bad.</li>
            <li> I was using a different natural mascara that came with a terrible brush and was clumpy.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I just got a bad batch, but it seems different than it used to.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly average mascara with an expensive price tag.</li>
            <li> I know that&#x27;s not good for my lashes, so</li>
            <li> Tired this one.</li>
            <li> and that it&#x27;s even inferior to the two Sephora house brands I was given to try (no great shakes either of them).</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it creates the fattest lashes around, but what was really important to me was that there was none of that annoying (and ugly!)</li>
            <li> and this is the one time that it has been lumpy and just overall BAD!  </li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say that this isn&#x27;t going to be it</li>
            <li> the box was bent like someone had carelessly stuffed the product in.</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered  the wrong mascara.</li>
            <li> although the mascara didnt do so crazy well for that price.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> But after reading the ingredients I got fearful of damage on my body.</li>
            <li> My horrible knockoff came in a plastic bag with no packaging.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> mascara was dried up and I wasn&#x27;t able to use it...but the return went smooth</li>
            <li> This mascara is great for sensitive eyes and it comes off in the shower with facial soap (it won&#x27;t run if your eyes get a little wet, though it might flake a little if you sleep in it).</li>
            <li> This mascara is amazing.  Much better than ones I bought at MAC.  I love this Mascara.  It really does work.</li>
            <li> I was using Lancombe until I learned that they do animal testing.   I looked high and low for a good replacement. My Aunt recommended the bare minerals mascara. Since I already use the foundation, I gave it a try.  WOW!!! This is great stuff! It&#x27;s easy to apply and looks good all day long. Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> No clumps! I was using a different natural mascara that came with a terrible brush and was clumpy. You get your money&#x27;s worth with this mascara. The brush is perfect and is easy to apply, and leaves your eye lashes looking beautiful and natural. This product lasted for a year for me and I just bought another one.</li>
            <li> Clumps on the wand a little more than I expected it would. Hard to clean off with tissue due to nylon wand. Still like.</li>
            <li> I love this.  No flaking, clumping or bleeding.  I was using the Bare Escentuals brushless, which i love, but can&#x27;t find it anywhere.  Tired this one. Glad I did.  You can definitely tell the difference between this and cheap brands.  All are not created equal.  Not in mascara anyway.</li>
            <li> This mascara is equipped with a very small, narrow, triangular-shaped wand that is ideal for applying the product to individual lashes. Not only does this mascara add definition, but it also adds length as well. I was impressed by the mascara&#x27;s staying power and the fact that it barely flaked at all, even after I&#x27;d been wearing it for many hours. The one thing that could be improved is volume, but then again, this product doesn&#x27;t tout itself as being a major volumizer, so I really can&#x27;t complain. I definitely recommend this product, which is a great value at a relatively low price.</li>
            <li> I try to use only natural or organic makeup, especially for my eyes. The main problem is finding stuff that actually works and looks well without spending a fortune. This mascara is wonderful. I&#x27;ve had it for a while now and it still works great. The formula goes on smooth without clumping, and coats every lash without multiple coats. It&#x27;s easily separated and doesn&#x27;t flake throughout the day. This stuff definitely has stay power to it! I would recommend this to anyone wanting a good mascara, natural or not.</li>
            <li> This came in a kit with powders, and I really didn&#x27;t expect much of it at all.  I&#x27;ve tried so many mascaras, including Lancome, Estee lauder, Dior, Jane Iredale, etc.  This is so much better than the others!  It makes my lashes longer, DOESN&#x27;T CLUMP them together, and washes off easily.  I can put on a second coat and they still won&#x27;t stick together. I like the \\&quot;fanned out\\&quot; look.  I shouldn&#x27;t admit it, but I&#x27;ve even added new mascara on top of old in the morning when I didn&#x27;t wash it off at night.  It looks great!  I know that&#x27;s not good for my lashes, so I don&#x27;t make a habit of it.  Dior DiorShow has come close, but can get clumpy. Jane Iredale (in the gold tube) comes close, but actually goes on too thin.  This is is the best all around.  My next favorite at this point is from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, of all places.  Palladio herbal waterproof.  I bought it just for swimming and was very pleasantly surprised.  And for some reason, the waterproof goes on better than the regular formula.</li>
            <li> I have used this mascara for years and love it.  The item I received was used or old dried out stock.  I returned it immediately.  Just go to Ulta 3 or Sephora. It is not worth the aggravation buying it here from this supplier.</li>
            <li> It seems like every mascara I try leaves me with lashes clumped and stuck together. Not this mascara, though. Even my smallest and finest lashes are nicely defined and separated. I also often have problems with even waterproof mascara coming off on my upper cheeks, but no problem with this one.  If you&#x27;re after a huge dramatic eye with tons of thick mascara, this one is not for you. However, if you want a natural looking eye, I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of all Bare Escentuals products, and this is no exception.  Easy to apply and looks great.  No flaking, either!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara! I&#x27;ve tried over a 100 different brands and types of mascara. This is THE best! I love that it makes my scarce lashes look long and semi-lush, and keeps them soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re never brittle, as with most other mascaras. It&#x27;s fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Bare Escentuals!</li>
            <li> Hands down the best mascara I have ever owned. Well worth the price. I will never use another product!</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of this type of mascara.  I always use Bare Escentuals, but this is my favorite.  Compared to the Big Tease and volumizing mascara, it goes on just right and never clumps.  I found the brush for the Big Tease to be a little odd and the volumizing mascara just volumizes too much for me.  Also, by the end of the day I had the raccoon look from excessive mascara.  As I said, the Flawless Definition is perfect.  The brush is super fine and the mascara goes on well without clumping.  I&#x27;ve not had the problems with raccoon eyes and I&#x27;ve been using the Flawless Definition for several months now.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample size of this by Sephora (I think a birthday gift) and was eager to try it because mascara is the component of my limited makeup arsenal that I take most seriously. I finally cracked it open the other day.  I have almost weirdly long (especially the \\&quot;lowers\\&quot;), quite thick, but not very dark eyelashes and on this basis, my eyes are my one feature that I really play up--they kind of dominate my face. I&#x27;ve learned over the course of many years that not all mascaras are suitable for all types of eyelashes and that a brand or variety that works well for one woman doesn&#x27;t necessarily for others. It never ceases to amaze me how differently a product that covers so little area can perform on different people.  Bare Escentuals Flawless Definition just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me.  For one thing, this mascara utilizes a spiral non-brush (nylon?) applicator and while the mascara applies well and lashes get covered, there&#x27;s no separation at all--rather, my lashes look like clumped, coated sticks. The mascara itself is extremely wet; granted, this is pretty much true of any new tube of mascara but this is in a class of its own. It&#x27;s very prone to smearing and very slow to dry (the better to smear with when one tries to clean up with a cotton swab). It&#x27;s really messy stuff. To its credit, come day&#x27;s end it removes easily with a bit of oil.  I guess we all have different expectations about how mascara should perform and how our lashes should look. Personally, I like my lashes to look like...hair. Flawless Definition makes them look as though they&#x27;ve been enameled--NOT a flattering look for me. The mascaras that have worked best for me over the last 30+ years have been Lancôme Definicils and whatever they&#x27;re calling their volumizing mascara at the moment (the name is always changing) but given that I&#x27;ve recently developed an ethical aversion to L&#x27;Oréal products, I&#x27;d like to find a replacement. Sorry to say that this isn&#x27;t going to be it and that it&#x27;s even inferior to the two Sephora house brands I was given to try (no great shakes either of them). I guess I&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
            <li> Nice and clean not clumpy</li>
            <li> This product is great. I rarely wear mascara but this feels light on my lashes. It also doesn&#x27;t flake off. Though it is a little pricier than normal mascaras, it&#x27;s well worth it</li>
            <li> The mascara arrived but it was not in its original box.  Without its box, I have no idea if this is a new or used mascara.  I really hesitate using it.  I will NEVER buy mascara from this seller again.  I will go back to purchasing mascara from the Ulta stores.</li>
            <li> After trying SO MANY mascaras, this is my new absolute fave! I wouldn&#x27;t say it creates the fattest lashes around, but what was really important to me was that there was none of that annoying (and ugly!) clumping, and that the tube lasted more than a couple of weeks. My lashes look long and clean.  Plus, I&#x27;ve had this same tube for going on two months and it&#x27;s still as fresh as when I first bought it.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE bareMinerals and the mascara is no exception. I like to know that I am not putting chemicals and unknown substances on my face.</li>
            <li> Just as good or better than when purchased from Bare Escentuals. Best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, tried their high volumizer mascara and had to switch back to the flawless. Coats my eye lashes perfectly.</li>
            <li> The only mascara that does not turn my eyes red.  After working 12 hours it is still on my lashed and NOT my lower eye lid.  Love it</li>
            <li> I need a discreet mascara for work - not something that says \\&quot;I&#x27;m going out clubbing later.\\&quot;  I have tried various mascaras that feature \\&quot;definition\\&quot; - coloring and separating without bulk or length.  I have tried several Lancome mascaras, L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Voluminous and Voluminous Naturale, Cover Girl&#x27;s Lash Exact, and I have finally found my Holy Grail with BareMierals Flawless Definition mascara.  This mascara separates and defines beautifully, even the little lashes, and it does! not! flake! (a big problem with my most recent purchase, the L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous Naturale. Avoid, avoid.). It doesn&#x27;t smudge, and it doesn&#x27;t wear off.  For all that, it cleans off pretty easily (I use a makeup remover towelette) compared to the others.  I am a convert.</li>
            <li> Not the best I have used.  My eyes are burning and It also doesn&#x27;t last much longer than the eye liner.</li>
            <li> If I am going to spend this much on mascara, I want it to be perfect.  I use this all the time, have for several years and this is the one time that it has been lumpy and just overall BAD!  I didn&#x27;t have time to return it and get more before my vacation so ended up trying to use it til it&#x27;s gone.  It just seems like it is old and therefore not up to par!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s defines without clumping.  it feels &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; but my lashes are looking long and luscious.  i was told about this mascara by others but didn&#x27;t want to pay more than drug store prices.  glad i did because it&#x27;s worth it.  love it!!!</li>
            <li> I must have gotten an old tube of the mascara because it flaked off my eyes really bad. I&#x27;m just going to get another tube and go at it again. Bare Minerals is the very best.</li>
            <li> This mascara has been my best friend since I bought it! It works great..It perks up ALL the lashes-either big or small. A great buy!</li>
            <li> I always use this item. I love bareminerals. This was so easy because I just can&#x27;t seem to get to the mall. It was nice that&lt;br /&gt;it came to me. Wish I thought of this before</li>
            <li> Mascara seemed fine the first 4 days but became very clumpy after that! I understand this happens after a month or so but 4 days?!?! I will not buy from this place again!</li>
            <li> This is my second favorite mascara to wear (I like the volume one just slightly better). It makes my lashes look amazing and hardly ever flakes off or smears.</li>
            <li> Bareminerals mascara is as expected.  It is a good mascara for the price range but can be clumpy at times.  I use the mascara with my old Benefit mascara brush and that takes care of a lot of that problem.</li>
            <li> This is a knockoff!  I buy this product consistently from Sephora and I was so happy I found it a couple bucks cheaper here.  I should have known.  What I received was not the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; thing.  My horrible knockoff came in a plastic bag with no packaging.  The font wasn&#x27;t even the same and the word &amp;#34;Definition&amp;#34; is nowhere to be found on the tube.  Nice try!  I called and reported this one to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this mascara!  The packaging I received from this company looked exactly the same as what I am familiar with when I buy it from Sephora, but the product inside was dried out.  It must have been very OLD.  Will definitely buy this mascara again, but not from HERE!!!</li>
            <li> I received this mascara in a gift set last summer and it does wonders for my lashes.  The bristles on the brush allow me to put mascara right where I want it...in just the right amount!  It goes on very smoothly and I have very little problems with clumps.  My lashes look much longer and fuller with this mascara...plus it doesn&#x27;t flake or take too long to dry after I apply it.  I have really sensitive eyes and this product never once irritated them.  I also feel like after using this product for several months, my lashes have become a lot healthier and seem to hardly ever break.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product looked like it was opened and the box was bent like someone had carelessly stuffed the product in. There was no type of plastic covering over it .</li>
            <li> This it the best mascara in the world! I have tried a lot of mascaras but this makes my eyes really pop!</li>
            <li> Love it. Separated my lashes better than any other mascara I&#x27;ve used. Lengthens pretty good as well. Don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered  the wrong mascara. I&#x27;m twenty-six. Which means I&#x27;m still young enough to have wild, crazy, club eyes, but old enough to have business, Monday eyes. Well, I&#x27;ve been in club-eyes all these years.&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t until I accidentally ordered this mascara, with a more modest brush (and trust me, I cussed it good) I realized it&#x27;s time to be a lady.&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe how brilliant and bright my big brown eyes looked with this modest mascara highlighting the edges. There were no clumps, no bulky--over the top--lashes. I looked like a woman, and I&#x27;d never been so proud.&lt;br /&gt;This mascara isn&#x27;t for you young Club-going girls. It&#x27;s for your woman who realize it&#x27;s time to grow up and show off what god really gave you.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this mascara, but it just isn&#x27;t that great. This is a fairly average mascara with an expensive price tag. I wanted to re-order another mascara, but recent reviews said the formula seemed to have changed. I thought  I&#x27;d try this mascara too. It&#x27;s not worth the cost to return it, and it&#x27;s not a bad product, but it&#x27;s just not worth the price. I can easily get this same quality from a store-bought brand for half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something is happening to the quality of Bare Minerals, it just is not what it used to be. Too bad, I won&#x27;t be purchasing new products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Recommended For Me. prisrob 10-21-13</li>
            <li> I have not received it in the mail yet but I received a free sample at a store and I like the pointed brush it allows me to do the lashes individually I really like this product!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it. Thought it was a different one I had before. I need one for increased length not definition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to find a mascara that actually does NOT lump or clump or just leave globs of product on the lashes.  This is great and my second order.</li>
            <li> Yes, its great!  the price was excellent!</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite mascara!  I have average eyelashes that have blonde tips (which make my eyelashes look even shorter!), and from my experience any thickening mascara just clumps my eye lashes.  The brush has thicker bristles that taper off towards the end.  The spacing between the bristles is perfect, so it coats each lash without clumping.  It doesn&#x27;t magically make your eyelashes look like a model&#x27;s, but it makes them look more defined in a natural way.  If you want to step it up then you can put on 2 coats just make sure the first coat is dry, so it doesn&#x27;t clump too much.</li>
            <li> This product gave me eyelashes I did not know I even had. They look natural but thick, long, and luscious.  Looks good day or night and lasts until washed off.</li>
            <li> This is a good mascara - not great. Downside is it does flake. Upside is I love the applicator. I would not purchase again though.</li>
            <li> i think the shelf life of this mascara was past its due date, i have used this mascara for 3 years and have never had it clump like this one did...not happy</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clump, really stays on well love it.</li>
            <li> Got caught in a rainstorm and ended up looking like a raccoon.&lt;br /&gt;Product is definitely not water resistant.  Also flakes off by the&lt;br /&gt;end of a dry day.  I think I will go back to my former (and less&lt;br /&gt;expensive brand).  I did not feel this product is worth the price.</li>
            <li> The mascara works pretty well (covers and separates my lashes very good just like it supposed to do). The reason i gave the mascara only 4 stars its because of the price and i have to admit, it does exactly what my cheaper Telescopic Clean Definition does. So i probably wont purchase it no more, cause i can have the same results for half the price. I cant speak for everyone here though, Maybe for people with sensitive eyes this mascara will work great, but for me it doesnt matter if its BareMinerals or L&#x27;Oreal in this case. To me its all about the price. And dont get me wrong, i really like products from BareMineral/ BareEscentuals (i have a Eyeshadow from them and it works great!) although the mascara didnt do so crazy well for that price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed! It&#x27;s hard to find products with good EWG.org ratings (this has 3 out of 10) that are also fun/easy to use. I haven&#x27;t had trouble with clumping. Easy on, easy off.</li>
            <li> I love bareminerals flawless definition mascara. It&#x27;s the only mascara I&#x27;ll use. The mascara I got is really chunky. I&#x27;ve never bought a bareminerals that has been so messy and chunky before... It&#x27;s wearable but I&#x27;d rather not deal with the mess.</li>
            <li> Negatives: Weighed down my lashed when I applied so I had to curl it when it dried which was a mess some days. And no, I did not put much on for it to weigh my lashes down. I put very minimal layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive: makes eyelashes longer.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite mascara.  My eyes have gotten more sensitive as I get older and this covers well without causing any irritation at all.</li>
            <li> Good quality and excellent to use.</li>
            <li> Great mascara for fine, full lashes. Yes, it is a little liquid-y upon application, but dries relatively quick without clumping.</li>
            <li> Darn:/  I was hoping for a nice, natural looking, clump-free mascara... I did not find it here. It already seemed dried out, and flaked really easily. It came in the box it was shipped in, no packaging or even safety seal. Maybe the one I recieved was old (hopefully not used??). For me, the lengthening mascara made by Almay definitely has this one beat.</li>
            <li> Doesnt clump, isn&#x27;t overly wet, gives good coverage and feels light and airy. I am particular with eye makeup as I have sensitive eyes and wear contacts - this fits the bill! No flaking, smudging or anything to cause me aggravation - yay!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best mascaras I&#x27;ve ever used--and that includes more expensive brands like Smashbox and Mary Kay.  This mascara doesn&#x27;t go on too thick or heavy, and any small clumps that occur are easily smoothed out with a gentle brush of the fingertips.  It appears very natural, which is what I was looking for.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my contact lenses either.  Definitely my new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> I had such trouble with store-bought mascara bothering my eyes so I decided to try this product. Soooooo glad I did! My eyes are happy and don&#x27;t hurt bc of all those chemicals in the other brands. It stays on all day and washes off easily. The coverage is just as good as the other brands too. Very happy and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this mascara the first week, but after that it became clumpy and hard to apply as if it were old.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and this mascara is perfect.  No problems.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to over do mascara so this is perfect for me.  Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> My go-to mascara. Used to use Diorshow but this mascara provides better definition and if you wiggle the wand at the base of your lashes also provides good volume.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara! I have TONS of drugstore mascaras, but I have never been completely satisfied with any I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to make a switch to natural beauty products and decided to go with this one after reading reviews. I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to search anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the brush! It gets EVERY eyelash! It makes my lashes look SO long! I&#x27;ve watched quite a few mascara tutorials on youtube. There is one where a guy shows a NEW WAY TO APPLY MASCARA by using a metal tooth eyelash comb and brushing a bit of your mascara on it, then combing it into your lashes. The result he got with his method are like the results you will get with this kind of brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course, gotta love the natural ingredients! This mascara is a keeper!</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers, I have sensitivity to a lot of eye cosmetics, so not only do I have to find something I like, but also something I can wear.  This mascara is both.  When I took out the brush, it looked unimpressive, but it does what it says, it coats and defines the lashes very nicely. It stays on nice, too, no smudging at all.  I agree with another reviewer, not a lot of volume.  If you like bushy lashes, you might want to try one that does that.  I will, definitely, buy this mascara again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have sensitive eyes and I can wear this without my eyes swelling.  Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This mascara definitely does what it says it will do, it goes on thick, which I like because I use it also on my lower lashes and some products don&#x27;t have the oomph to adhere to those scanty lower lashes</li>
            <li> This mascara goes on beautifully.  Full, thick, separated lashes.  However, it leaves you looking like a raccoon by the end of the day.  It seems to melt off and build up under the eyes.  Not worth the price.  Tried several days hoping it was just a fluke.  Same prob everyday though.  :(</li>
            <li> Love this mascara as it doesn&#x27;t clump and smear. It also lasts a long time and doesn&#x27;t cause any sensitivity like some other brands have done.  Great product!</li>
            <li> It came on time! This is my fave mascara it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> The first time I bought this mascara a few years ago, I was thrilled with it. But the last time I bought it, I noticed that it flakes a lot more than it did. Not sure if I just got a bad batch, but it seems different than it used to. It&#x27;s still a very nice mascara, but it&#x27;s not spectacular as I once thought it was.</li>
            <li> I always used diorshow for years. But after reading the ingredients I got fearful of damage on my body. I researched mascaras and found this one. I love it more than the dior 100 percent.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I like to try different mascaras and lately I have been using the popular one that leaves \\&quot;tubes\\&quot; on your lashes. I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 days now and I prefer this one over the more expensive ones that I&#x27;ve tried. The brush is key it separates the lashes nicely without clumping, gives a nice curl and looks very natural not too heavy AND if that&#x27;s not enough with the natural ingredients its actually good for your lashes!! Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just love how natural my eyelashes look. They are separated, there&#x27;s no clumps and my lashes appear longer. It definitely makes my eyes look much prettier.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, I was given a group of mascara sample and this one was so amazing I had to buy it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t flake off, easy to remove, and makes my lashes look defined and long. I&#x27;ve tried most of the expensive brands as well as a few of the grocery store brands and this is the best one I&#x27;ve found. Not to mention, there&#x27;s a lot of mascara in the tube!!</li>
