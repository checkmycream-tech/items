            <li>The material its like nothing I have ever tried to apply makeup, I am not a proffesional, but I have used a fair amount of blenders.</li>
            <li>Good size and shape.  </li>
            <li>and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>

            <li>This is a good quality makeup sponge.  </li>
            <li>All in all, the DS is good for blending and I would recommend it to anyone searching for an alternative to the BB.</li>

            <li>I have a quick makeup change between songs and this sponge works perfectly for it!  </li>

            <li>I wasn&#x27;t to sure about buying it but am so happy I did</li>
            <li>I found that it blended nicely and gave good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that it blended nicely and gave good coverage.</li>
            <li>and she more than made up for it!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I sure know my girl loves it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use makeup every day, but it surely helps on the days that I do!</li>
            <li>Feels smooth !!</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased this!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this tool and couldnt wait to use it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light and coverage is great.</li>
            <li>This is so amazing.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing beauty tool.</li>
            <li>And what&#x27;s great is that it&#x27;s latex free and hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>It is amazing the difference this has made in the application of liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice but no any case to keep it.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I haven&#x27;t used makeup sponges in probably about a decade but as a product tester, I was intrigued.</li>
            <li>I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>My review is my honest opinions on this product.</li>
            <li>It glided nicely and gave me even coverage.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review.</li>
            <li>Have had it a week now and am loving this sponge.</li>
            <li>Nice Product...</li>
            <li>So when I was given this Dream Sponge Make Up Blender at a discount in exchange for my honest review</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start by saying I was able to score this at an amazing discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  </li>
            <li>Cleanup is a breeze - I use the BB bar soap (tried the Zote bar and wasn&#x27;t thrilled), but at $15 a pop, probably not the most cost effective.  </li>
            <li>This brand offers one of the best.</li>
            <li>Wonderfully soft and allows for flawless application.</li>
            <li>A nice unique sponge!</li>
            <li>really liked using this sponge because it gave me sheer coverage that I could build on and best of all</li>
            <li>Great dupe for the beauty blender, a little bit wider, and not as sponge like but very good to use if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money on the beauty blender.  </li>
            <li>I love putting foundation on with this.</li>
            <li>So, the more and more I use it, the more and more I like it.</li>
            <li>I love this sponge.</li>
            <li>smooth.&lt;br /&gt;It is awesome for big areas like the checks</li>
            <li>but it ends up way more thicker than I like</li>
            <li>When this company put out a promotion and I was able to purchase it discounted and test it, I couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
            <li>I was able to apply my foundation with this sponge and get an even look all over my face.</li>
            <li>I love this blender!Love the way the makeup goes on with it.no streaks</li>
            <li>Nice size, fits well in your hand and applies the makeup smoothly, even that fussy mineral stuff.</li>
            <li>I have seen so many make up gurus use these</li>
            <li>This sponge is ok, I guess.</li>
            <li>while I love the sponge - that&#x27;s a lot to be throwing away every month when a brush or cheaper sponge gets me by.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup sponge.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more, I would like to have one for my liquids and one for powders and blush.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this sponge.</li>
            <li>Provides an inexpensive way to make sure makeup is distributed evenly over face.</li>

            <li>Great sponge that really blends the make-up.  </li>
            <li>It works so much better than my foundation brush.</li>
            <li>Easier to apply my foundation and looks better.</li>
            <li>I have tried many of these sponges.</li>
            <li>I love the cute tear drop shape which also make it easier to use it for all nook and cranny of your face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very much enjoying this sponge.</li>

            <li>I love this makeup sponge</li>
            <li>I love this beauty blender.</li>
            <li>but I love it</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my foundation look airbrushed when applied.</li>
            <li>Fits nicely in my hand and blends smoothly.</li>
            <li>RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION</li>
            <li>One of my favorite tools in my beauty arsenal is a beauty</li>
            <li>love this sponge.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also got a better density to it than most of the sponges you can find in drug store.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if you can deal with the density of the sponge, you will be satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love this .</li>

            <li>I also love that it is washable and reusable, so better for the environment.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product and my make-up looked great.</li>
            <li>Much better then a makeup brush.</li>
            <li>Many of my friends use them and they swear by them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this one it doesn&#x27;t let makeup go clumpsy.</li>
            <li>Love how smooth concealer blends!</li>
            <li>Will purchase more.</li>
            <li>so it blends faster but not too much and it leaves a very nice finish in the face not like the hair brush that sometimes look streaky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just as great as the high dollars ones but even softer</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean too.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a soft, dense sponge that provides great uniform foundation application.</li>
            <li>Seller Holly Jae was great and delivery was super fast.</li>
            <li>I tried the target brands and some other &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; sponges but this is the best.</li>

            <li>/&gt;This is an easy investment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27; easy t use and allows you smoothen</li>
            <li>I have had experience with the Beauty Blender, which is by far more superior.</li>
            <li>If I did not compare it to the Beauty Blender, I probably would have rated it higher but it does a fairly nice job blending.</li>
            <li>Really works so much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, as you can use the more pointed end for around the nose and eyes, and the more rounded end for the cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li>Great product, is super soft!</li>
            <li>My fingers did the trick just fine.</li>
            <li>it works fine.</li>
            <li>Perfect and way less than the ones at Sephora</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to apply my foundation pretty evenly for the most part.</li>
            <li>It blends so much more flawlessly than sponges I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick!</li>
            <li>But this sponge really does blend the makeup better!  </li>
            <li>Foundation goes on smoothly and quickly!  </li>
            <li>I like it best a little damp.</li>
            <li>Perfect little Sponge  for applying my makeup..</li>

            <li>Blended well, easy to clean</li>
            <li>It is also latex free, so there are no worries for those of you who have latex</li>
            <li>Makes the foundation go on smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>The foundations goes on aa smooth aapoasible.</li>
            <li>receive this product for free or discount for reviewing purposes</li>
            <li>This has been my honest opinion and all statements are solely my own personal opinion about this sponge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for getting into those little nooks and crannies like the corners of your nose, and the flat end is great for blending out wider surfaces like the cheeks and</li>
            <li>It soaks up water fairly quickly and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s quick &amp; easy clean.</li>
            <li>This sponge is super soft and feels good while applying make up to my skin.</li>
            <li>At first I was in love with this sponge.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know it wasn&#x27;t the original</li>
            <li>Never had the original so cannot compare.</li>
            <li>Never used the Original Beauty Blender</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re one to set your under eye with powder, the small side fits perfect.</li>
            <li>This is the first time using one of these, and I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>.it looks so smooth.easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It really does a MUCH better job of applying makeup than brushes or cheap square</li>
            <li>I like to clean it after every use</li>
            <li>I like the sponge and brushes but, certain things do better than others.  </li>
            <li>And the pointed tip fits perfectly in the hard to reach areas around the nose and eyes.</li>
            <li>Not bad by any means, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>Great sponge after you wet it.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a good makeup sponge, but I dont feel its still up to compete with the blender, but its a good close third</li>
            <li>I very much love this product and will absolutely buy it again once this one needs a replacement.</li>
            <li>The sponge makes for a smooth even layer of makeup making it look more natural.</li>
            <li>This arrived so quickly</li>
            <li>I like to wear a super lightweight foundation and add a thicker concealer under eyes and to blemished areas.</li>
            <li>It works better than a brush or using my fingers, and I can definitely tell you it is a million times better than the make-up wedge</li>
            <li>4 stars is as high of a rating I can give it because I simply can&#x27;t be in love with a sponge.</li>
            <li>I think it blends pretty well and makes my foundation go on smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this new sponge.</li>
            <li>sponge is very dense, and swells up easily under water.</li>
            <li>I received compliments the first day I used it that my skin looked good - was I doing something different.</li>
            <li>However it is very soft and I love the shape.</li>
            <li>This cute little sponge is so adorable!</li>
            <li>It is super soft and has been really easy to clean.</li>
            <li>sponge is very high-quality and seems like it will last for a good while.</li>
            <li>Once I&#x27;m done using it, I rinse it in warm water, add a dab of facial cleanser, squish around, rinse it well then squeeze all the excess water out and voila!</li>
            <li>this is definitley worth the price.</li>
            <li>This product is very much worth the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth 10 bucks.</li>
            <li>i use from my chiropractor pretty cool.</li>
            <li>This is an aweome product worth every penny</li>
            <li>Soft and lovely.  </li>
            <li>Very handy little sponge.</li>
            <li>Compared to the regular sponge, I thought this would offer something more special.  </li>
            <li>and I started using it right away.</li>
            <li>the right look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sponge is super soft and cleans well and dries quickly!</li>
            <li>I love it, no other way I would put my makeup on.</li>
            <li>I have used more expensive blenders and this one by far works the best for a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li>In terms of contouring, I think sponges in general wipe off more than blend</li>
            <li>Soft , easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is the first beauty blender sponge I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>I will probably only be able to use it for another week.</li>
            <li>The Dream Sponge works so much better than the sponges from local store.  </li>
            <li>It help to make up to look more naturally and not thick.  </li>
            <li>I will purchase again, thanks!</li>
            <li>Blends very well!</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try this &amp;#34;Dream Sponge&amp;#34; (DS) first.  </li>
            <li>So soft and smooth.....</li>
            <li>I can tell you FIRST hand-</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with a makeup sponge of this type.  </li>
            <li>well it is my first time using a beauty blender</li>
            <li>Really blends foundation well!</li>
            <li>To go back and cover areas that need more attention, I used the tip of the sponge in a pressing motion holding the sponge at a 90-degree angle.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m pretty sure my technique is universal.</li>
            <li>Size increases nicely and the sponge doesn&#x27;t hold too much product when wet.  </li>
            <li>This sponge worked exceptionally well,  I always have trouble getting my foundation applied evenly around my nose and eye area, with the pointy tip of the sponge</li>
            <li>Had a little issue with shipping, but seller was very quick to respond and settle the issue very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is not a bad product, it is simply very different than what I am used to, this is a more stiff sponge, so the application does go even, however I found hard to blend, it was earsier to dab the product in, so a bit more time consuming, but good results.</li>
            <li>Gives more of an airbrushed and smooth appearance, no more streaks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a dense sponge that I really like the feel of.</li>
            <li>I really like how even my foundation looks when using the Dream Sponge.</li>
            <li>Considering how smooth my makeup looks, that is not something that would make me ever switch back to the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It blends really, really well.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s still very dense and almost rubbery feeling, especially compared to aforementioned popular sponge.</li>
            <li>and I really have to squeeze, and squeeze again, to keep this from dripping when I press it on my face to apply foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;She&#x27;s really into her makeup, and tools to get</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loves this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like the finish it gives me when i use my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>I get a much smoother application and blend effect.</li>
            <li>This really does feel like a dream against my skin.</li>
            <li>Better use it wet.  </li>
            <li>And absorbs too much product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Beauty Blends and the Real Techniques Complexion</li>
            <li>The liquid foundations I&#x27;d stick to beauty blender or Real Techniques.</li>
            <li>even more so when wet.  </li>
            <li>Very well-designed.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m prepped and ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s much faster than a foundation brush.</li>
            <li>I mean really give that thing a good soak.</li>
            <li>first impressions were that it was very soft but dense.</li>
            <li>I really like this sponge, although the price is higher than others I feel like the value and quality are worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li>It fits in my hand better than any other sponge I have tried.</li>
            <li>I was able to easily blend in the contouring without leaving harsh lines or obvious edges.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really getting into contouring and have been trying out a new cream contour and bronze set.</li>
            <li>These are simple to use, wet with warm water, squeeze out excess and then use to stiple on foundation.</li>
            <li>It applies foundation well, blends concealer fine, and really, does the job just as well as any other sponge of this kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted to try a makeup sponge like this but couldn&#x27;t justify the high price tag of the ones I see in the high end shops.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Love this little sponge.</li>
            <li>so I have to use a little more than I normally would if using the brush.</li>
            <li>I use a sponge for blending and applying my foundation, and normally I use disposables.</li>
            <li>But going green is a goal of mine, which means fewer disposables and more reusables like this Dream Sponge Makeup Blender.</li>
            <li>Once you play with it long enough you realize how many uses it has.</li>
            <li>I normally use a brush to apply my liquid foundation</li>
            <li>While I prefer the texture of this sponge to the BB sponge, this one seems to absorb more of the foundation/cream you are applying which wastes a lot of product.</li>
            <li>, it was more dense (heavy)</li>
            <li>The Beauty Blender is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>I watched several tutorials and feel like it didn&#x27;t do any better of a job than my flat top stippling brush that I usually use.  </li>
            <li>While it is definitely not an exact dupe for the Beauty Blender, it works well to blend make-up evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>It looks brand new again.</li>
            <li>I am new to using a make up blending sponge.</li>
            <li>feels very soft on my skin.</li>
            <li>Very soft and dense.</li>
            <li>Very natural look.  </li>
            <li>it is very soft to the skin.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d say use a brush first and only use a sponge to blur the edges.  </li>
            <li>so cute and this are very well made an dense yet soft on the face, Softer than similar makeup sponges I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>This is NOT a dupe for a similar looking makeup sponge that costs twice as much.</li>
            <li>Would be ok for someone not so meticulous maybe, but I am not thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m here to compare this directly to the Beauty Blender (BB).  </li>
            <li>These surprised me.  </li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin, there are no worries using this because it is non-allergenic.</li>
            <li>Its better than the other sponges i&#x27;ve purchased from other sellers.</li>
            <li>The fact that you wet the sponge first, does also allow you to conserve the amount of makeup you are using yet still get complete coverage results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my second time buying this applicator, and I highly recommend it to all women out there.</li>
            <li>Does one wet it first?</li>
            <li>so I had to use 3 times what I would normally use &amp; still did not get the same coverage.</li>
            <li>I will say that upon first wash, the DS did not have pink dye running from it like the BB did.  </li>
            <li>First, I wet the sponge.</li>
            <li>I have heard that the make up does not go on evenly unless you wet the sponge first.</li>
            <li>No other reason.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a little more from it from reading the other reviews.  </li>
            <li>Then I  spread the foundation all over my face and neck, squeeze the egg between your thumb and fingers and sweeping it back and forth and up and down on its sides (45-degree angle) using quick even strokes.</li>
            <li>It absolutely DID shrink down to the normal size after washing (be aware it doubles in size when wet) but if yours doesnt shrink, you did not get all of the suds out properly.</li>
            <li>It actually works the same as the high end beauty</li>
            <li>The sponge is highly durable and I anticipate that it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the hape of it, not like some other odd shaped ones ive used.</li>
            <li>worth 3 stars but not more.</li>
            <li>for sure does what it is meant too and well but is a lot smaller then expected for 10 dollars i expected it to be a little larger</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s firmer than I expected which could just be because it&#x27;s new but using the pointed end helps when applying foundation around the eyes and nose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about half the cost and looks like the real deal according to the picture</li>
            <li>I tried it both wet and dry and didn&#x27;t see too much of a difference in terms of ease of application.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually like using the DS or the BB wet because I feel like it dilutes my foundation a bit (so long full coverage!).  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time and brand new, as expected!</li>

            <li> Good size and shape.  </li>

            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this tool and couldnt wait to use it!</li>

            <li> This is so amazing.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing beauty tool.</li>
            <li> And what&#x27;s great is that it&#x27;s latex free and hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> It is amazing the difference this has made in the application of liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice but no any case to keep it.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I haven&#x27;t used makeup sponges in probably about a decade but as a product tester, I was intrigued.</li>
            <li> I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> My review is my honest opinions on this product.</li>
            <li> It glided nicely and gave me even coverage.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Have had it a week now and am loving this sponge.</li>
            <li> Nice Product...</li>
            <li> So when I was given this Dream Sponge Make Up Blender at a discount in exchange for my honest review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I was able to score this at an amazing discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  </li>
            <li> Cleanup is a breeze - I use the BB bar soap (tried the Zote bar and wasn&#x27;t thrilled), but at $15 a pop, probably not the most cost effective.  </li>
            <li> This brand offers one of the best.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully soft and allows for flawless application.</li>
            <li> A nice unique sponge!</li>
            <li> really liked using this sponge because it gave me sheer coverage that I could build on and best of all</li>
            <li> Great dupe for the beauty blender, a little bit wider, and not as sponge like but very good to use if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money on the beauty blender.  </li>
            <li> I love putting foundation on with this.</li>
            <li> So, the more and more I use it, the more and more I like it.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge.</li>
            <li> smooth.&lt;br /&gt;It is awesome for big areas like the checks</li>
            <li> but it ends up way more thicker than I like</li>
            <li> When this company put out a promotion and I was able to purchase it discounted and test it, I couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
            <li> I was able to apply my foundation with this sponge and get an even look all over my face.</li>
            <li> I love this blender!Love the way the makeup goes on with it.no streaks</li>
            <li> Nice size, fits well in your hand and applies the makeup smoothly, even that fussy mineral stuff.</li>
            <li> I have seen so many make up gurus use these</li>
            <li> This sponge is ok, I guess.</li>
            <li> while I love the sponge - that&#x27;s a lot to be throwing away every month when a brush or cheaper sponge gets me by.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup sponge.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more, I would like to have one for my liquids and one for powders and blush.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge.</li>

            <li> Great sponge that really blends the make-up.  </li>
            <li> It works so much better than my foundation brush.</li>
            <li> Easier to apply my foundation and looks better.</li>
            <li> I have tried many of these sponges.</li>

            <li> One of my favorite tools in my beauty arsenal is a beauty</li>
            <li> love this sponge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also got a better density to it than most of the sponges you can find in drug store.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if you can deal with the density of the sponge, you will be satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this .</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a soft, dense sponge that provides great uniform foundation application.</li>
            <li> Seller Holly Jae was great and delivery was super fast.</li>

            <li> I have had experience with the Beauty Blender, which is by far more superior.</li>
            <li> If I did not compare it to the Beauty Blender, I probably would have rated it higher but it does a fairly nice job blending.</li>
            <li> Really works so much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, as you can use the more pointed end for around the nose and eyes, and the more rounded end for the cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li> Great product, is super soft!</li>
            <li> My fingers did the trick just fine.</li>
            <li> it works fine.</li>
            <li> Perfect and way less than the ones at Sephora</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to apply my foundation pretty evenly for the most part.</li>
            <li> It blends so much more flawlessly than sponges I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick!</li>
            <li> But this sponge really does blend the makeup better!  </li>
            <li> Foundation goes on smoothly and quickly!  </li>

            <li> receive this product for free or discount for reviewing purposes</li>
            <li> This has been my honest opinion and all statements are solely my own personal opinion about this sponge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for getting into those little nooks and crannies like the corners of your nose, and the flat end is great for blending out wider surfaces like the cheeks and</li>
            <li> It soaks up water fairly quickly and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s quick &amp; easy clean.</li>
            <li> This sponge is super soft and feels good while applying make up to my skin.</li>
            <li> At first I was in love with this sponge.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know it wasn&#x27;t the original</li>
            <li> Never had the original so cannot compare.</li>
            <li> Never used the Original Beauty Blender</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re one to set your under eye with powder, the small side fits perfect.</li>
            <li> This is the first time using one of these, and I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> .it looks so smooth.easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It really does a MUCH better job of applying makeup than brushes or cheap square</li>
            <li> I like to clean it after every use</li>
            <li> I like the sponge and brushes but, certain things do better than others.  </li>
            <li> And the pointed tip fits perfectly in the hard to reach areas around the nose and eyes.</li>
            <li> Not bad by any means, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> Great sponge after you wet it.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a good makeup sponge, but I dont feel its still up to compete with the blender, but its a good close third</li>
            <li> I very much love this product and will absolutely buy it again once this one needs a replacement.</li>
            <li> The sponge makes for a smooth even layer of makeup making it look more natural.</li>
            <li> This arrived so quickly</li>
            <li> I like to wear a super lightweight foundation and add a thicker concealer under eyes and to blemished areas.</li>
            <li> It works better than a brush or using my fingers, and I can definitely tell you it is a million times better than the make-up wedge</li>
            <li> 4 stars is as high of a rating I can give it because I simply can&#x27;t be in love with a sponge.</li>
            <li> I think it blends pretty well and makes my foundation go on smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this new sponge.</li>
            <li> sponge is very dense, and swells up easily under water.</li>
            <li> I received compliments the first day I used it that my skin looked good - was I doing something different.</li>
            <li> However it is very soft and I love the shape.</li>
            <li> This cute little sponge is so adorable!</li>
            <li> It is super soft and has been really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> sponge is very high-quality and seems like it will last for a good while.</li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;m done using it, I rinse it in warm water, add a dab of facial cleanser, squish around, rinse it well then squeeze all the excess water out and voila!</li>
            <li> this is definitley worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product is very much worth the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> i use from my chiropractor pretty cool.</li>
            <li> This is an aweome product worth every penny</li>
            <li> Soft and lovely.  </li>
            <li> Very handy little sponge.</li>
            <li> Compared to the regular sponge, I thought this would offer something more special.  </li>
            <li> and I started using it right away.</li>
            <li> the right look.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sponge is super soft and cleans well and dries quickly!</li>
            <li> I love it, no other way I would put my makeup on.</li>
            <li> I have used more expensive blenders and this one by far works the best for a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> In terms of contouring, I think sponges in general wipe off more than blend</li>
            <li> Soft , easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is the first beauty blender sponge I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I will probably only be able to use it for another week.</li>
            <li> The Dream Sponge works so much better than the sponges from local store.  </li>
            <li> It help to make up to look more naturally and not thick.  </li>
            <li> I will purchase again, thanks!</li>
            <li> Blends very well!</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this &amp;#34;Dream Sponge&amp;#34; (DS) first.  </li>
            <li> So soft and smooth.....</li>
            <li> I can tell you FIRST hand-</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a makeup sponge of this type.  </li>
            <li> well it is my first time using a beauty blender</li>
            <li> Really blends foundation well!</li>
            <li> To go back and cover areas that need more attention, I used the tip of the sponge in a pressing motion holding the sponge at a 90-degree angle.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m pretty sure my technique is universal.</li>
            <li> Size increases nicely and the sponge doesn&#x27;t hold too much product when wet.  </li>
            <li> This sponge worked exceptionally well,  I always have trouble getting my foundation applied evenly around my nose and eye area, with the pointy tip of the sponge</li>
            <li> Had a little issue with shipping, but seller was very quick to respond and settle the issue very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is not a bad product, it is simply very different than what I am used to, this is a more stiff sponge, so the application does go even, however I found hard to blend, it was earsier to dab the product in, so a bit more time consuming, but good results.</li>
            <li> Gives more of an airbrushed and smooth appearance, no more streaks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dense sponge that I really like the feel of.</li>
            <li> I really like how even my foundation looks when using the Dream Sponge.</li>
            <li> Considering how smooth my makeup looks, that is not something that would make me ever switch back to the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It blends really, really well.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s still very dense and almost rubbery feeling, especially compared to aforementioned popular sponge.</li>
            <li> and I really have to squeeze, and squeeze again, to keep this from dripping when I press it on my face to apply foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;She&#x27;s really into her makeup, and tools to get</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves this product.  </li>
            <li> I really like the finish it gives me when i use my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I get a much smoother application and blend effect.</li>
            <li> This really does feel like a dream against my skin.</li>
            <li> Better use it wet.  </li>
            <li> And absorbs too much product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Beauty Blends and the Real Techniques Complexion</li>
            <li> The liquid foundations I&#x27;d stick to beauty blender or Real Techniques.</li>
            <li> even more so when wet.  </li>
            <li> Very well-designed.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m prepped and ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s much faster than a foundation brush.</li>
            <li> I mean really give that thing a good soak.</li>
            <li> first impressions were that it was very soft but dense.</li>
            <li> I really like this sponge, although the price is higher than others I feel like the value and quality are worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li> It fits in my hand better than any other sponge I have tried.</li>
            <li> I was able to easily blend in the contouring without leaving harsh lines or obvious edges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really getting into contouring and have been trying out a new cream contour and bronze set.</li>
            <li> These are simple to use, wet with warm water, squeeze out excess and then use to stiple on foundation.</li>
            <li> It applies foundation well, blends concealer fine, and really, does the job just as well as any other sponge of this kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try a makeup sponge like this but couldn&#x27;t justify the high price tag of the ones I see in the high end shops.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love this little sponge.</li>
            <li> so I have to use a little more than I normally would if using the brush.</li>
            <li> I use a sponge for blending and applying my foundation, and normally I use disposables.</li>
            <li> But going green is a goal of mine, which means fewer disposables and more reusables like this Dream Sponge Makeup Blender.</li>
            <li> Once you play with it long enough you realize how many uses it has.</li>
            <li> I normally use a brush to apply my liquid foundation</li>
            <li> While I prefer the texture of this sponge to the BB sponge, this one seems to absorb more of the foundation/cream you are applying which wastes a lot of product.</li>
            <li> , it was more dense (heavy)</li>
            <li> The Beauty Blender is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I watched several tutorials and feel like it didn&#x27;t do any better of a job than my flat top stippling brush that I usually use.  </li>
            <li> While it is definitely not an exact dupe for the Beauty Blender, it works well to blend make-up evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> It looks brand new again.</li>
            <li> I am new to using a make up blending sponge.</li>
            <li> feels very soft on my skin.</li>
            <li> Very soft and dense.</li>
            <li> Very natural look.  </li>
            <li> it is very soft to the skin.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d say use a brush first and only use a sponge to blur the edges.  </li>
            <li> so cute and this are very well made an dense yet soft on the face, Softer than similar makeup sponges I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a dupe for a similar looking makeup sponge that costs twice as much.</li>
            <li> Would be ok for someone not so meticulous maybe, but I am not thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m here to compare this directly to the Beauty Blender (BB).  </li>
            <li> These surprised me.  </li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin, there are no worries using this because it is non-allergenic.</li>
            <li> Its better than the other sponges i&#x27;ve purchased from other sellers.</li>
            <li> The fact that you wet the sponge first, does also allow you to conserve the amount of makeup you are using yet still get complete coverage results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second time buying this applicator, and I highly recommend it to all women out there.</li>
            <li> Does one wet it first?</li>
            <li> so I had to use 3 times what I would normally use &amp; still did not get the same coverage.</li>
            <li> I will say that upon first wash, the DS did not have pink dye running from it like the BB did.  </li>
            <li> First, I wet the sponge.</li>
            <li> I have heard that the make up does not go on evenly unless you wet the sponge first.</li>
            <li> No other reason.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a little more from it from reading the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Then I  spread the foundation all over my face and neck, squeeze the egg between your thumb and fingers and sweeping it back and forth and up and down on its sides (45-degree angle) using quick even strokes.</li>
            <li> It absolutely DID shrink down to the normal size after washing (be aware it doubles in size when wet) but if yours doesnt shrink, you did not get all of the suds out properly.</li>
            <li> It actually works the same as the high end beauty</li>
            <li> The sponge is highly durable and I anticipate that it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the hape of it, not like some other odd shaped ones ive used.</li>
            <li> worth 3 stars but not more.</li>
            <li> for sure does what it is meant too and well but is a lot smaller then expected for 10 dollars i expected it to be a little larger</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s firmer than I expected which could just be because it&#x27;s new but using the pointed end helps when applying foundation around the eyes and nose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about half the cost and looks like the real deal according to the picture</li>
            <li> I tried it both wet and dry and didn&#x27;t see too much of a difference in terms of ease of application.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like using the DS or the BB wet because I feel like it dilutes my foundation a bit (so long full coverage!).  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time and brand new, as expected!</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t be that big of a deal except for that the material is more solid foam than sponge, which often makes blending a clunky and awkward experience.  </li>
            <li> Feels like it will last a long time!</li>
            <li> Upon receiving the DS, I noticed that it was significantly bigger than the BB even while dry, but</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is really dense and soak up a ton of water when cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything like it and it took me a few tries before I really understood it.</li>
            <li> I seem to get the same effect with plain old cotton rounds.</li>
            <li> I So soft and not easy to break, I wash it after I used it and still in the same shape!</li>
            <li> If you use the BB dry it sucks up too much product, but because the DS is so solid it doesn&#x27;t have that problem.  </li>
            <li> The stiffness of the material used makes it hard to blend and it absorbs too much product.  </li>
            <li> When I won the opportunity to purchase this strange sponge at a reduced price to offer my opinion, I went for it.</li>
            <li> Its soft but yet firm.</li>
            <li> I cannot give it 5 stars, however, because it tends to absorb product and is not as soft or as fluffy like the Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li> It soaked up a little bit of my liquid foundation but the next day I tried it with a whipped foundation and it didn&#x27;t soak up extra product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how the more expensive, fancy brand names work, but this little sponge has changed the way I apply make-up.</li>
            <li> In the morning, I use it dry with my mineral foundation, blush and eye shadow blending.</li>
            <li> Then dry it off by squeezing it to death and then wrap it in a towel to remove any excess water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This can be used both wet or dry, though I prefer to use it dry with my liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> Get the beauty blender wet and squeeze dry.</li>
            <li> In the evening I use it wet to apply my serum, eye cream and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and i was really curious.</li>
            <li> After getting the sponge wet and wringing it out I used it with my liquid concealer with the pointed end around my eyes and on any spot blemishes.</li>
            <li> even when wet.</li>
            <li> The sponge, even wet, does absorb a bit of the product.  </li>
            <li> After getting the sponge wet and wringing it out I used it with my liquid concealer with the pointed end around my eyes and on any spot blemishes.</li>
            <li> It also worked well blending my highlighting creams and my concealer (especially using the small end of the sponge for concealer around my eyes).</li>
            <li> Softer than similar makeup sponges I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> It blends as well as other types of sponges.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten to use it due to it coming damaged.</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up or liquid foundation but due to hyperpigmentation</li>
            <li> I prefer it half wet</li>
            <li> This is a curious little sponge.</li>
            <li> The material is very thick and soft, and I don&#x27;t have any problems with it soaking up the liquid or cream makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as hard as the last one I used.</li>
            <li> was a little skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I want to order more to use for applying the base for face painting, too.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t do my foundation any other way!</li>
            <li> This product is way too stiff for a makeup sponge even after it is wet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe other than it doesn&#x27;t feel anything like any other sponge I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I like is that is like using my finger but with less messy at the end</li>
            <li> and I have to wipe a little off to avoid that &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Like you can see in the video, it blended a little bb cream I applied so well that you couldn&#x27;t tell anything</li>
            <li> its a little bit on the firm side, but</li>
            <li> I have tried a few before and always ended up using my hands.  </li>
            <li> When your foundation is $40-$60 you do not want waste.</li>
            <li> It is definitely not as light as the beauty blender</li>
            <li> that often but when she does, she has trouble when removing it.</li>
            <li> to ensure an even application, I dipped the sponge in the foundation that I put in the palm of my hand and sweep it back and forth to thin it out.</li>
            <li> I bought this to save some money from the original Beauty Blender and holy crap was that a mistake.</li>
            <li> This was NOT worth 10 dollars!!</li>
            <li> Your make comes on flawlessly no touching your face.  </li>
            <li> Way over priced, and is not great.</li>
            <li> If your comparing this to a beauty blender, this is a poor contender.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with it</li>
            <li> I dont know why people are saying it is fake.</li>
            <li> This sponge is very hard and unpleasant to use.</li>
            <li> ,It looks dirty, even though it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so mad</li>
            <li> so they aren&#x27;t poor quality by any means but this sponge is just awful.</li>
            <li> i need it to conceal these ugly brown spots on cheeks.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed,  it does not work as described</li>

            <li> I love putting foundation on with this. It helps to get around the edges of the nose where I can&#x27;t get with anything else.</li>
            <li> I use a sponge for blending and applying my foundation, and normally I use disposables. But going green is a goal of mine, which means fewer disposables and more reusables like this Dream Sponge Makeup Blender. I like the shape, I like the texture, I like the fact that it&#x27;s washable and reusable. It doesn&#x27;t soak up a lot of foundation like so many disposable sponges do, yet it blends my foundation perfectly. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works well for blending. Seller is awesome - had a shipping situation and she more than made up for it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice but no any case to keep it.</li>
            <li> This is a curious little sponge. I&#x27;ve never used anything like it and it took me a few tries before I really understood it. Once you play with it long enough you realize how many uses it has. In the morning, I use it dry with my mineral foundation, blush and eye shadow blending. In the evening I use it wet to apply my serum, eye cream and moisturizer. It&#x27;s a dense sponge that I really like the feel of. It&#x27;s hard to describe other than it doesn&#x27;t feel anything like any other sponge I&#x27;ve tried. Honestly, I haven&#x27;t used makeup sponges in probably about a decade but as a product tester, I was intrigued. I gave up sponges because I just didn&#x27;t see the point in them. My fingers did the trick just fine. When I won the opportunity to purchase this strange sponge at a reduced price to offer my opinion, I went for it. So, the more and more I use it, the more and more I like it. 4 stars is as high of a rating I can give it because I simply can&#x27;t be in love with a sponge. No other reason. The sponge is highly durable and I anticipate that it&#x27;ll last a long time. The wedge sponges can&#x27;t be compared to this at all. Those belong in the trash which is where I left them years ago. When my Dream Sponge does wear out, it&#x27;s highly likely that I&#x27;ll replace it.</li>
            <li> I just received it today and I started using it right away. If I did not compare it to the Beauty Blender, I probably would have rated it higher but it does a fairly nice job blending. It just lacks the sponge-like texture of the Beauty Blender. Overall, I like it as a dupe.</li>
            <li> The material its like nothing I have ever tried to apply makeup, I am not a proffesional, but I have used a fair amount of blenders. It is not a bad product, it is simply very different than what I am used to, this is a more stiff sponge, so the application does go even, however I found hard to blend, it was earsier to dab the product in, so a bit more time consuming, but good results. Overall it is a good makeup sponge, but I dont feel its still up to compete with the blender, but its a good close third</li>
            <li> I love this sponge. It is perfect for day to day makeup and it blend my makeup very easy and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;It is awesome for big areas like the checks but it also works wonders for eye concealer. I prefer it half wet so it blends faster but not too much and it leaves a very nice finish in the face not like the hair brush that sometimes look streaky.&lt;br /&gt;What I like is that is like using my finger but with less messy at the end</li>
            <li> This is the first beauty blender sponge I&#x27;ve ever used and I absolutely love it! I really like how even my foundation looks when using the Dream Sponge. I normally use a brush to apply my liquid foundation but it ends up way more thicker than I like and I have to wipe a little off to avoid that &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34; look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the foundation absorbs into the sponge so I have to use a little more than I normally would if using the brush. Considering how smooth my makeup looks, that is not something that would make me ever switch back to the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponge is very high-quality and seems like it will last for a good while. I like that it&#x27;s quick &amp; easy clean. Once I&#x27;m done using it, I rinse it in warm water, add a dab of facial cleanser, squish around, rinse it well then squeeze all the excess water out and voila! It looks brand new again. *I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.*</li>
            <li> This sponge blender is fantastic. I&#x27;ve always wanted to try a makeup sponge like this but couldn&#x27;t justify the high price tag of the ones I see in the high end shops. When this company put out a promotion and I was able to purchase it discounted and test it, I couldn&#x27;t resist. I&#x27;m really getting into contouring and have been trying out a new cream contour and bronze set. This sponge, dampened a bit, works beautifully. I was able to easily blend in the contouring without leaving harsh lines or obvious edges. It also worked well blending my highlighting creams and my concealer (especially using the small end of the sponge for concealer around my eyes). The material is very thick and soft, and I don&#x27;t have any problems with it soaking up the liquid or cream makeup. I very much love this product and will absolutely buy it again once this one needs a replacement.</li>
            <li> Very good blender, soft, flexible, and easy to clean. Delivery was quick!</li>
            <li> This sponge is super soft and feels good while applying make up to my skin. I was able to apply my foundation with this sponge and get an even look all over my face. I was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this blender!Love the way the makeup goes on with it.no streaks .it looks so smooth.easy to clean.</li>
            <li> feels very soft on my skin.</li>
            <li> Nice size, fits well in your hand and applies the makeup smoothly, even that fussy mineral stuff.</li>
            <li> I have seen so many make up gurus use these and i was really curious. I am obsessed with it</li>
            <li> This is one of the best blending sponges that I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s not as hard as the last one I used. It blends really, really well.</li>
            <li> I love it, no other way I would put my makeup on. The sponge makes for a smooth even layer of makeup making it look more natural. Won&#x27;t do my foundation any other way!</li>
            <li> Still trying to figure out the best way to use this. Does one wet it first? I seem to get the same effect with plain old cotton rounds.</li>
            <li> Good size and shape.  Blended well, easy to clean</li>
            <li> This is NOT a dupe for a similar looking makeup sponge that costs twice as much. Don&#x27;t let anyone tell you otherwise. If that sponge is what you&#x27;re looking for, suck it up and pay for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sponge is very dense, and swells up easily under water. However, it&#x27;s still very dense and almost rubbery feeling, especially compared to aforementioned popular sponge. It applies foundation well, blends concealer fine, and really, does the job just as well as any other sponge of this kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find that it holds on to a lot of water and I really have to squeeze, and squeeze again, to keep this from dripping when I press it on my face to apply foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my review. My review is my honest opinions on this product.</li>
            <li> works well to blend out foundation.  its a little bit on the firm side, but it works fine.</li>
            <li> Everything I wanted. Not damaged or used. Perfect condition! Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Perfect and way less than the ones at Sephora</li>
            <li> for sure does what it is meant too and well but is a lot smaller then expected for 10 dollars i expected it to be a little larger</li>
            <li> This sponge is ok, I guess. Way over priced, and is not great. I prefer the brush</li>
            <li> At first I was in love with this sponge. It really does a MUCH better job of applying makeup than brushes or cheap square sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#x27;s only been one month and the sponge is already falling apart. I will probably only be able to use it for another week. I paid $12 for it and while I love the sponge - that&#x27;s a lot to be throwing away every month when a brush or cheaper sponge gets me by.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup sponge.  I have tried a few before and always ended up using my hands.  But this sponge really does blend the makeup better!  The design allows for reaching the areas around the eyes and nose.  The sponge is super soft and cleans well and dries quickly!</li>
            <li> Awesome sponge for applying make up!!  Highly recommend it!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my daughter during a promotional offer, and she loves how it works for her.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s been wanting to try a blender sponge for some time, so when I saw this one, I decided to order it and let her try it.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s really into her makeup, and tools to get the right look.&lt;br /&gt;She uses this blender sponge and get&#x27;s a flawless finish every time!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to hold, easy to use. This will be an essential item for her makeup routine.</li>
            <li> Great sponge! This works well. I use it to blend out concealer and cream contour.</li>
            <li> Great makeup sponge. Blends well and does not leave marks or streaks on my face.</li>
            <li> This is an almost perfect dupe for a Beauty Blender. I have been using this to apply my foundation for a while now and have had zero problems with it. Id I didn&#x27;t know it wasn&#x27;t the original I&#x27;d think that it was not a dupe. These are simple to use, wet with warm water, squeeze out excess and then use to stiple on foundation. My makeup looks nearly flawless using this amazing tool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> I received my Dream Sponge in the mail and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impressions were that it was very soft but dense. Softer than similar makeup sponges I have purchased in the past. After getting the sponge wet and wringing it out I used it with my liquid concealer with the pointed end around my eyes and on any spot blemishes. I found that it blended nicely and gave good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I used it with my liquid foundation.  I used 3 pumps on the back of my hand and used the sponge to apply the makeup evenly on my face. It glided nicely and gave me even coverage.  After usage I simply rinsed and laid the puff to air-dry. I will be ordering more, I would like to have one for my liquids and one for powders and blush. I really like this sponge, although the price is higher than others I feel like the value and quality are worth the extra expense. I would recommend this product to a friend and will be buying again.</li>
            <li> The quality of this sponge is incredible. Got it in the mail today and have to say I&#x27;m impressed. It&#x27;s my second time buying this applicator, and I highly recommend it to all women out there. I sure know my girl loves it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product using a discount code send was told to give my unbiased opinion. I have never used a make up sponge before this one, so there is nothing to compare it to. I think it blends pretty well and makes my foundation go on smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Easy to clean and make up goes on so nice and easily.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge. Will order again.Thanks</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves this product.  Provides an inexpensive way to make sure makeup is distributed evenly over face.</li>
            <li> Simple design.  Like how it works for me!  I recommend them.</li>
            <li> Absorbs my make up like a thirsty camel</li>
            <li> I use this product daily to evenly apply my foundation. Makes my face look flawless!</li>
            <li> great sponge to blend the make up! easy to use</li>
            <li> Awesome sponge. Ordered this as a gift and she loves it!</li>
            <li> This is such an awesome make blending sponge! It is super soft and has been really easy to clean. I enjoy the hape of it, not like some other odd shaped ones ive used.</li>
            <li> This sponge is a dream. Its soft but yet firm. I really like the finish it gives me when i use my liquid foundation. Its better than the other sponges i&#x27;ve purchased from other sellers. I give this product a 5/5 stars</li>
            <li> Great sponge that really blends the make-up.  it&#x27;s light and coverage is great.</li>
            <li> While it is definitely not an exact dupe for the Beauty Blender, it works well to blend make-up evenly and smoothly. It is the perfect size for any kind of application, whether it be for under-eye concealer, all-over foundation, or for contouring. It soaks up water fairly quickly and is easy to handle. For me, this is a great multipurpose product that makes the make-up application process a lot easier. I cannot give it 5 stars, however, because it tends to absorb product and is not as soft or as fluffy like the Beauty Blender. I recommend this sponge for those who are on a budget and want to try a product akin to the Beauty Blender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Great dupe for the beauty blender, a little bit wider, and not as sponge like but very good to use if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money on the beauty blender.  Had a little issue with shipping, but seller was very quick to respond and settle the issue very quickly.  Will definitely repurchase if needed!</li>
            <li> This arrived so quickly I couldn&#x27;t believe it! It is a great product! I don&#x27;t use makeup every day, but it surely helps on the days that I do!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome sponge. It did not come with instructions, but was packaged well and has been working great. I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This is so amazing. It works so much better than my foundation brush. Very easy to use and clean. Gives me a flawless look the a brush could never do. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The Dream Sponge works so much better than the sponges from local store.  Easier to apply my foundation and looks better.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product blends concealer and foundation flawlessly! You can get in the smallest of spots with the point of the sponge!</li>
            <li> Have had it a week now and am loving this sponge. It doesn&#x27;t suck up a lot of product and feels good on my face. The pointy end is perfect for under eye.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed,  it does not work as described</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of buzz about the makeup blender and this product so I tried this one.  Compared to the regular sponge, I thought this would offer something more special.  It blends as well as other types of sponges.</li>
            <li> I am very glad that I purchased this product. I have used more expensive blenders and this one by far works the best for a fraction of the price! Perfect.</li>
            <li> I have tried many of these sponges. This brand offers one of the best. The sponge remains moist and blends well.</li>
            <li> I think I need to get used to it but it works.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and makes blending my make up easy. I get a much smoother application and blend effect.</li>
            <li> A nice unique sponge! It blends make up very good. I love the cute tear drop shape which also make it easier to use it for all nook and cranny of your face. I&#x27;m very much enjoying this sponge. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> Best makeup sponge Ever !  It&#x27;s such a luxury ! Feels smooth !!</li>
            <li> Blends well.  Never had the original so cannot compare.</li>
            <li> Love this sponge for close up blending of makeup around my nose and eyes. It also works to blend in eye shadows. Very soft and dense. Feels like it will last a long time!</li>
            <li> The name isn&#x27;t kidding!  This really does feel like a dream against my skin.</li>
            <li> IT is just that....OK...worth 3 stars but not more. I have had experience with the Beauty Blender, which is by far more superior. While I prefer the texture of this sponge to the BB sponge, this one seems to absorb more of the foundation/cream you are applying which wastes a lot of product. When your foundation is $40-$60 you do not want waste. It absorbs quite a bit so I had to use 3 times what I would normally use &amp; still did not get the same coverage. Would be ok for someone not so meticulous maybe, but I am not thrilled with it. IMO save the money &amp; buy the beauty blender instead.</li>
            <li> I like the sponge. Better use it wet.  It help to make up to look more naturally and not thick.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality makeup sponge.  I like to clean it after every use and it&#x27;s held up great</li>
            <li> Easy to apply makeup with</li>
            <li> What a great makeup sponge! I am glad I purchased this!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for precision blending. Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Never used the Original Beauty Blender but this is perfect in my eyes! Love the finished look</li>
            <li> Great product, is super soft!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to the &amp;#34;original blender&amp;#34; because I&#x27;ve never used it. Great sponge after you wet it.</li>
            <li> Great dupe for the Beauty Blender.  Size increases nicely and the sponge doesn&#x27;t hold too much product when wet.  I will purchase again, thanks!</li>
            <li> This product is way too stiff for a makeup sponge even after it is wet.  I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the beauty blender and this product is not even close.  The stiffness of the material used makes it hard to blend and it absorbs too much product.  This was NOT worth 10 dollars!!</li>
            <li> Just as great as the high dollars ones but even softer</li>
            <li> If your comparing this to a beauty blender, this is a poor contender. It is a bit stiffer... even when wet. Does not apply foundation evenly. And absorbs too much product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to apply my foundation pretty evenly for the most part. It&#x27;s firmer than I expected which could just be because it&#x27;s new but using the pointed end helps when applying foundation around the eyes and nose.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and brand new, as expected! Blends very well!</li>
            <li> I love this makeup sponge</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Beauty Blends and the Real Techniques Complexion Sponge.&lt;br /&gt;This one is soft when wet, it was more dense (heavy) then the beauty blender but it did apply my make with ease. It soaked up a little bit of my liquid foundation but the next day I tried it with a whipped foundation and it didn&#x27;t soak up extra product. I&#x27;d recommend this sponge if you wear whipped foundation or a cream blush. The liquid foundations I&#x27;d stick to beauty blender or Real Techniques. If you&#x27;re one to set your under eye with powder, the small side fits perfect.</li>
            <li> An absolutele must for flawless makeup application. Get the beauty blender wet and squeeze dry. I like to wear a super lightweight foundation and add a thicker concealer under eyes and to blemished areas. The beauty blender perfectly and flawlessly blends it all together. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m here to compare this directly to the Beauty Blender (BB).  I&#x27;ll start by saying I was able to score this at an amazing discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  My current BB is falling apart (as they&#x27;re known to do), but before I go and shell out $20 I thought I&#x27;d try this &amp;#34;Dream Sponge&amp;#34; (DS) first.  It&#x27;s about half the cost and looks like the real deal according to the picture so why not?  Upon receiving the DS, I noticed that it was significantly bigger than the BB even while dry, but even more so when wet.  It wouldn&#x27;t be that big of a deal except for that the material is more solid foam than sponge, which often makes blending a clunky and awkward experience.  I tried it both wet and dry and didn&#x27;t see too much of a difference in terms of ease of application. I don&#x27;t usually like using the DS or the BB wet because I feel like it dilutes my foundation a bit (so long full coverage!).  If you use the BB dry it sucks up too much product, but because the DS is so solid it doesn&#x27;t have that problem.  In terms of contouring, I think sponges in general wipe off more than blend so I&#x27;d say use a brush first and only use a sponge to blur the edges.  The DS, however, is great for undoing heavy-handed contouring.  Cleanup is a breeze - I use the BB bar soap (tried the Zote bar and wasn&#x27;t thrilled), but at $15 a pop, probably not the most cost effective.  I will say that upon first wash, the DS did not have pink dye running from it like the BB did.  All in all, the DS is good for blending and I would recommend it to anyone searching for an alternative to the BB.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent product!</li>
            <li> Great product, ordering 2 more!</li>
            <li> These surprised me.  I like the sponge and brushes but, certain things do better than others.  This was 1 of them.</li>
            <li> Blends makeup well.  Very natural look.  This is the first time using one of these, and I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> So soft and smooth.....</li>
            <li> Very handy little sponge. Soft , easy to use.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully soft and allows for flawless application. A must have for every make-up guru!</li>
            <li> I love this beauty blender. I dont know why people are saying it is fake. I can tell you FIRST hand- this is definitley worth the price. It absolutely DID shrink down to the normal size after washing (be aware it doubles in size when wet) but if yours doesnt shrink, you did not get all of the suds out properly. I love this tool and couldnt wait to use it! Flawless makeup</li>
            <li> This sponge was delivered just in time for me to use it to do my makeup for a musical that am currently performing in.  I have a quick makeup change between songs and this sponge works perfectly for it!  Foundation goes on smoothly and quickly!  Just perfect!</li>
            <li> was a little skeptical at first but I love it</li>
            <li> I bought this to save some money from the original Beauty Blender and holy crap was that a mistake. This sponge is very hard and unpleasant to use. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t blend my makeup AT ALL. I use NARS and Mac so they aren&#x27;t poor quality by any means but this sponge is just awful. The Beauty Blender is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with a makeup sponge of this type.  I&#x27;ve never used the beauty blender brand to compare to.  I was hoping for a little more from it from reading the other reviews.  I watched several tutorials and feel like it didn&#x27;t do any better of a job than my flat top stippling brush that I usually use.  The sponge, even wet, does absorb a bit of the product.  I always pour the same amount of foundation on the back of my hand when I apply with a brush.  With the sponge I always need additional product.  Overall I feel I&#x27;m indifferent about the product.  Not bad by any means, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> This product is very much worth the price. I love how it makes my foundation look airbrushed when applied. The fact that you wet the sponge first, does also allow you to conserve the amount of makeup you are using yet still get complete coverage results.</li>
            <li> Use this for my Concealer and it seems to be blending well it is my first time using a beauty blender</li>
            <li> Tried my sponge today and I really love it easy to use on fine lines love it!!</li>
            <li> Works great.. Fits nicely in my hand and blends smoothly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten to use it due to it coming damaged. However it is very soft and I love the shape.</li>
            <li> This sponge is great for contouring. I like it best a little damp.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing beauty tool. It actually works the same as the high end beauty blender!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION AS WELL!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:aff0cf2b8462940d638e9bc9276c6304]] One of my favorite tools in my beauty arsenal is a beauty sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this sponge. It blends so much more flawlessly than sponges I&#x27;ve used in the past. It&#x27;s also got a better density to it than most of the sponges you can find in drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for getting into those little nooks and crannies like the corners of your nose, and the flat end is great for blending out wider surfaces like the cheeks and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do contouring, this would be the perfect tool because of the pointed end. It makes blending and contouring easy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This can be used both wet or dry, though I prefer to use it dry with my liquid foundation. Like you can see in the video, it blended a little bb cream I applied so well that you couldn&#x27;t tell anything was even there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, there are no worries using this because it is non-allergenic. It is also odor free, something I haven&#x27;t found in many sponges that I&#x27;ve used. It is also latex free, so there are no worries for those of you who have latex allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From beginners to pros, this is something everyone who wears makeup needs in their makeup box.</li>
            <li> loved it and great prive!</li>
            <li> This is just what I wanted.  It helps me apply my makeup flawlessly.</li>
            <li> This sponge applies makeup wonderfully.  My only complaint is that it is really dense and soak up a ton of water when cleaning.  It is definitely not as light as the beauty blender but if you can deal with the density of the sponge, you will be satisfied.</li>
            <li> great for face painting too ! I So soft and not easy to break, I wash it after I used it and still in the same shape!</li>
            <li> Nice Product...it is very soft to the skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin too heavy and absorbs very well.</li>
            <li> It blends my make up so well, it met expectations.</li>
            <li> I love this . I allows me to apply my make-up evenly.</li>
            <li> Got this for my sister. She doesn&#x27;t use a lot of makeup that often but when she does, she has trouble when removing it. She&#x27;s tried a lot of makeup remover products but the sponge she loves. And what&#x27;s great is that it&#x27;s latex free and hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> Perfect little Sponge  for applying my makeup..So easy to use and my makeup goes on PERFECTLY..I wasn&#x27;t to sure about buying it but am so happy I did and I kbow you will ve too:-)</li>
            <li> This is an awesome makeup sponge. Very well-designed. I love the shape, color and texture. I use it to apply my foundation. Makes the foundation go on smoothly and evenly.  Very easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup sponge!! I&#x27;m so mad actually lol because I used to just put my makeup on with my fingers and now I can&#x27;t go back!! I tried the target brands and some other &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; sponges but this is the best. Love the feel</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft, dense sponge that provides great uniform foundation application. I received compliments the first day I used it that my skin looked good - was I doing something different. I don&#x27;t use sponges often so this seems to be a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with my foundation for blending.</li>
            <li> This cute little sponge is so adorable! I love the feel of it. It fits in my hand better than any other sponge I have tried. I want to order more to use for applying the base for face painting, too.</li>
            <li> It is amazing the difference this has made in the application of liquid foundation. Gives more of an airbrushed and smooth appearance, no more streaks. Really works so much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, as you can use the more pointed end for around the nose and eyes, and the more rounded end for the cheeks and forehead. I also love that it is washable and reusable, so better for the environment. Definitely worth 10 bucks. Seller Holly Jae was great and delivery was super fast.</li>
            <li> I have seen several people use these sponges and wanted to give it a try myself.  Very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> This sponge is great. The foundations goes on aa smooth aapoasible. Thank you for making a great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this dream sponge because the Beauty blender didn&#x27;t get 5 stars like this one and was more expensive. I like how it blends my liquid foundation and concealer. I washed it and squeezing out the excess water.it feels like a stress ball i use from my chiropractor pretty cool. The sponge works well but the 1 thing i do not like is the stains of make-up left on sponge even after i washed it several times,It looks dirty, even though it isn&#x27;t. Overall a good product and my make-up looked great. not cakey or flakey. It was 94 here in California and i don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up or liquid foundation but due to hyperpigmentation i need it to conceal these ugly brown spots on cheeks. It got the job done.</li>
            <li> Really blends foundation well! Much better then a makeup brush.</li>
            <li> This product was named perfectly the Dream Sponge.  The design is perfect for all the nooks and crannies on you face.  Your make comes on flawlessly no touching your face.  This is an aweome product worth every penny</li>
            <li> I am new to using a make up blending sponge. Many of my friends use them and they swear by them. So when I was given this Dream Sponge Make Up Blender at a discount in exchange for my honest review I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out. A friend of mine posted a YouTube video of how to use the sponge, so I have the basics down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this is how I used this sponge. First, I wet the sponge. I have heard that the make up does not go on evenly unless you wet the sponge first. I mean really give that thing a good soak. Then dry it off by squeezing it to death and then wrap it in a towel to remove any excess water. Now I&#x27;m prepped and ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then to ensure an even application, I dipped the sponge in the foundation that I put in the palm of my hand and sweep it back and forth to thin it out. Then I  spread the foundation all over my face and neck, squeeze the egg between your thumb and fingers and sweeping it back and forth and up and down on its sides (45-degree angle) using quick even strokes. To go back and cover areas that need more attention, I used the tip of the sponge in a pressing motion holding the sponge at a 90-degree angle. Then to tackle my under eye area, I used the side of the tip in a rolling motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked using this sponge because it gave me sheer coverage that I could build on and best of all, it&#x27;s much faster than a foundation brush. And the pointed tip fits perfectly in the hard to reach areas around the nose and eyes. I love this new sponge. And I&#x27;m pretty sure my technique is universal. This has been my honest opinion and all statements are solely my own personal opinion about this sponge.</li>
            <li> This sponge worked exceptionally well,  I always have trouble getting my foundation applied evenly around my nose and eye area, with the pointy tip of the sponge i was able to apply the foundation and blend it in making it look much more flawless.  i will definitely purchase again in the future!</li>
            <li> why haven&#x27;t I had this before?????? totally perfect for putting on makeup to have a flawless face. easy to use and easy to wash.</li>
            <li> Love this little sponge.</li>
            <li> How did I ever apply foundation before this? That&#x27;s what I ask myself every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fantastic! I don&#x27;t know how the more expensive, fancy brand names work, but this little sponge has changed the way I apply make-up. It works better than a brush or using my fingers, and I can definitely tell you it is a million times better than the make-up wedge sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an easy investment. I plan to buy another 10 and give them as gifts and keep extra for myself.</li>
            <li> so cute and this are very well made an dense yet soft on the face, Softer than similar makeup sponges I have purchased in the past. After getting the sponge wet and wringing it out I used it with my liquid concealer with the pointed end around my eyes and on any spot blemishes. I found that it blended nicely and gave good coverage. the dream sponge is perfect. It&#x27;s diverse, in the sense that it lends itself to several foundations whether it be make up, powders, minerals or even liquids and cream. It&#x27; easy t use and allows you smoothen/blend in your face like never before.&lt;br /&gt;I receive this product for free or discount for reviewing purposes</li>
            <li> I love this one it doesn&#x27;t let makeup go clumpsy.It spread evenly and good product to use.</li>
            <li> Soft and lovely.  Great makeup sponge for blending foundation.</li>
            <li> Love how smooth concealer blends! Will purchase more.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge, it gives a great finish when applying make up!!</li>
